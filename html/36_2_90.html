</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I also have two petitions which deal 
with the issue of federal funding for a road which is referred to 
in my community as the South Fraser Perimeter Road.  It is a road 
necessitated by the construction and growth at two ports, the 
Fraser Port on the Fraser River and the Roberts Bank container 
terminal known as Vanport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those two ports have caused a serious increase in traffic to 
flow through the neighbourhood of North Delta through residential 
streets.  The truck traffic is horrendous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal to build a road on the south shore of the river is 
unsatisfactory.  The petitioners would ask that no federal 
moneys be made available until such time as their concerns about 
this road are taken into consideration.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners remind us that one in five Canadian children 
live in poverty, and that on November 24, 1989 the House 
unanimously resolved to end child poverty in Canada by the year 
2000.

children in the country has increased by 60%.  They therefore ask 
parliament to introduce a multi-year plan to improve the 
well-being of Canada's children.  I wholeheartedly concur.

amending the Criminal Code to extend the same protection enjoyed

of nuclear weapons, which poses a threat to the health and 
survival of human civilization and the global environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the

that all questions be allowed to stand. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I have two order paper questions, 
Questions Nos. 28 and 29.  Question No. 28 was presented on 
October 15, 1999 and Question No. 29 was presented on October 18, 
1999.  Neither one has been answered yet.  Question No. 29 was 
first asked on March 24, 1999 as Question No. 227, which was 
never answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions go to the heart of the mefloquine scandal and 
the illegal and inappropriate use of that drug by the Department 
of National Defence during the Somalia crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that it is very difficult and embarrassing for the 
government to answer these questions but I think they are 
questions that do deserve an answer.  The drug did have an impact 
on the behaviour of troops in Somalia and the public has the 
right to have those questions answered promptly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised 
this issue on the floor within the last couple of weeks.  The 
answer that I would hold out today is not terribly different from 
what I described the last time.  A draft to the member's question 
was prepared and it was returned for revisions. I am advised that 
it is certainly in the pipeline and imminent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Shall all questions stand?

</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am in receipt of a notice of motion

Winnipeg—Transcona. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have provided you with the requisite letter and make a small 
argument now for an emergency debate on the subject of Canada's 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject of debate would be the threat to Canada's health 
care system posed by the imminent passage of bill 11 in the 
Alberta legislature and the ramifications for all Canadians as a 
result of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the 
relationship between that agreement and the provisions of bill 
11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament of Canada must have an opportunity to debate whether 
the Alberta government has the right to endanger medicare for all 
Canadians, as it is doing, given the provisions of NAFTA, and 
what the Parliament of Canada should do about it, and what the 
Government of Canada should do about it before bill 11 is passed.

is not something we can debate next week or the week after. It is 
something that we can only debate now.  The Parliament of Canada 
should be seized with this subject as soon as possible.  I 
beseech the Chair to see the wisdom of this request.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has considered very 
carefully the request put forward by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg-Transcona and has concluded that while the matter is 
obviously a serious one it is not one that in the view of the 
Chair ought to be the subject of an emergency debate at this 
time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would ask for unanimous consent of the House to 
revert to the bill being debated at second reading stage, Bill 
C-19, to recognize the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry who 
would take the floor for 10 minutes. That would conclude the 
debate on Bill C-19, if the House would give its consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent of the 
House to revert to the second reading motion on Bill C-19? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
think we would be willing to give that consent provided that our 
member who wanted to speak would also have the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to be 
negotiating across the floor and taking up the time of the House, 
but following the intervention of the member for Elk Island the 
government side would be agreeable to allowing the House leader 
of the Canadian Alliance Party a 10 minute intervention after the 
10 minute intervention by the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following further discussions we have an even more generous 
offer to put to the House.  If the House would give its consent, 
we would go back to the second reading of Bill C-19 to allow 
other members to contribute to this debate.  Then we will deal 
with the matter after the debate has been concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The question is no longer before the 
House, but we will pretend that never happened and go back to 
second reading of Bill C-19.  Is there unanimous consent to 
proceed in such a fashion?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to speak to Bill 
C-19, an act respecting genocide, crimes against humanity and war 
crimes and to implement the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court, and to make consequential amendments to other 
Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill of vital importance, not just for this House, but 
also for the international community as a whole. 
The purpose of this bill is to implement the Rome statute of the 
international criminal court, adopted on July 17, 1998 in Rome, 
after decades of debate and deliberation on the appropriateness 
of creating an international criminal jurisdiction with the 
authority to bring to justice those who have committed 
international crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts of the international community finally came together 
in Rome in the summer of 1998, after repeated attempts had been 
made to agree upon an instrument to fight international crime, 
be it war crimes, crimes against humanity or the crime of 
crimes, genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw particular attention to the contribution 
made by Canada and some of its officials. 
I am thinking, among others, of a friend, a distinguished 
jurist, Philippe Kirsch, who chaired the plenipotentiary 
conference that led to the Rome statute, and of a number of 
individuals whose services were drawn on and whose hard work 
during preparatory conferences and the Rome conference helped 
bring this statute to life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking specifically of John Holmes, Alan Kessel, Darryl 
Robinson, Dominic McAlea, Kimberley Prost and Don Piragoff, 
public servants I have met, at least some of them, who certainly 
played a key role in having the Rome statute adopted for the 
creation of an international criminal court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must, moreover, mention in this House, as I have in the case 
of other debates pertaining to bills implementing international 
treaties, that it is not entirely satisfactory to have a treaty 
as important as this one, which we are asked to debate through 
an enabling act, the ICC statute, not formally approved by this 
House and not the subject a significant debate before Canada 
signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade spent one sitting reviewing the draft bill, 
as it was worded at the time, and I was able to take part in 
that exercise, since I was then a member of the committee. 
However, hon. members probably did not have enough time to look 
at the content of the statute, to express their opinions and to 
state their views on it before it was adopted by the conference 
and signed by Canada, before its ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it would be very desirable for the House of Commons and 
its parliamentary committees to review international treaties 
and proposed treaties during negotiations, so that in future 
members of parliament can have some influence on negotiators, on 
the content of these treaties and proposed treaties, before 
Canada makes a commitment or expresses, through its signature, 
its intention to comply in good faith with the international 
treaties that it ratifies.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is currently before the House a private member's bill, 
Bill C-214, which I introduced last year. Its purpose is to give 
a more extensive role to parliament, to the House of Commons, 
when it comes to international treaties, so that such treaties 
are approved and then better promoted, introduced and published 
by government authorities after their ratification, that is 
after Canada has agreed to be bound by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a third hour of debate on Bill C-214. I hope that 
members of this House will allow the bill to be referred to a 
committee and that they will support it at third reading stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Bill C-19, which I have examined closely, the short title 
is the Crimes Against Humanity Act, a title which could be made 
much more rigorous by including a reference to war crimes.  This 
bill focuses on prosecuting war crimes, which are not included 
in the definition of crimes against humanity, unlike the crime 
of genocide, which these crimes can be considered to include. 
If I could make a suggestion, a more appropriate short title 
would be the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to implement the international 
criminal court statute provisions requiring implementation in 
Canadian domestic law. It seems that this bill is viewed, 
internationally, as adequate implementation of the Rome statute. 
It is sometimes cited as a model of effective implementation of 
the international criminal court statute. At the present time, a 
number of parliaments worldwide must pass enacting legislation 
before states can agree to be bound by it and the statute can be 
implemented.  It cannot take effect until 60 states have tabled 
their instruments of ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has to do with offences committed in Canada.  The 
provisions in clause 4 are intended to correct, to a certain 
extent, the situation in Canadian domestic law, which right now 
does not permit prosecution of individuals for the crime of 
genocide per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill repeals some provisions of the Criminal Code, namely 
sections 3.71 and following, which allowed individuals having 
committed the crime of genocide, as well as crimes against 
humanity and war crimes, to be prosecuted for murder under 
international law. However, clause 4 addresses a shortcoming of 
Canadian law by bringing it in line with international 
obligations and allowing prosecution under domestic law for 
international crimes as defined under international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, clause 4(3) refers to definitions provided in the Rome 
statute, which are implemented under international treaty law 
and which are inspired by customary international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 6 of the bill, which is a very important provision, gives 
Canada, through its courts, extraterritorial jurisdiction that 
will allow judge people alleged to have committed war crimes, 
crimes against humanity and genocide to be prosecuted in Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is in line with the Rome statute and customary 
international law, which allows Canada and any other country, to 
assume extraterritorial jurisdiction to prosecute people for 
such serious crimes, so that they do not go unpunished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 6, which is both prospective and retroactive, contrary to 
clause 4, which only applies to crimes committed after the bill 
becomes law, will allow Canada to prosecute people for serious 
crimes in its own courts of justice, which is absolutely in line 
with the spirit and the letter of the Rome statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, those provisions will be protected, despite their 
retroactive nature, by section 11(<I>g</I>) of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, pursuant to which people may be prosecuted 
for crimes recognized under international law, even if the 
prosecution is of a retroactive nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw the House's attention to something that 
would allow for a review of the contents of this bill. It is the 
provision that clearly gives Canadian tribunals jurisdiction 
over crimes committed outside the country. Clause 8(<I>a</I>) 
recognizes that Canada has jurisdiction when crimes have been 
committed by Canadian citizens or when the victims are Canadian 
citizens. Clause 8(<I>b</I>) also provides that Canada may prosecute a 
person if, at the time the offence is alleged to have been 
committed, Canada could, under international law, exercise 
jurisdiction over the person with respect to the offence on the 
basis of that person's presence in Canada and, after that time, 
if the person is present in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of the kind of universal jurisdiction that 
may be exercised by the various states under international law, 
but it could be broader. 
This ought to be debated and discussed since, in this case, 
universal jurisdiction could only be exercised over a person who 
is present in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, this would prevent Canada from prosecuting someone 
who is not present in Canada. It would prevent it from 
prosecuting a person who is alleged to have committed 
international crimes—whether it be General Pinochet, who 
returned to Chile without having been brought to justice for 
crimes of this type he allegedly committed. It would prevent 
Canada from prosecuting other war criminals or persons who have 
committed crimes against humanity or genocide, for example 
soldiers from Rwanda not present in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be interesting, in examining the bill, to broaden the 
scope of this particular provision so it is not limited to 
persons who are present in Canada. 
Canada—like other jurisdictions such as France, Spain and 
Belgium, I think—should claim jurisdiction over persons even 
though they are not present in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extradition proceedings could help in this regard and allow 
Canada, as we asked in this House in the case of General 
Pinochet, to request the extradition of a person alleged to have 
committed serious war crimes and perhaps to prosecute that 
person.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, the Bloc Quebecois could, in due time, present an 
amendment extending the scope of clause 8(<I>b</I>) so that Bill C-19 
would allow a broader, universal jurisdiction. Canada could then 
have jurisdiction over serious crimes such as genocide, war 
crimes and crimes against humanity, thus ensuring that these 
crimes will not go unpunished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to note that the bill deals with a number 
of defences that may be used by those accused of international 
crimes covered in the bill. 
Clause 14 provides that obeying orders of a superior is not a 
defence. This seems to be consistent with existing international 
law and compatible with the letter as well as the spirit of the 
Rome Statute for an International Criminal Court. 
Criminal Court 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of many of the bill's provisions is to ensure that 
certain obligations under the Rome Statute for an International 
Criminal Court be given effect in Canadian domestic law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, for example, the part concerning the proceeds of 
crime, clauses 27 to 29 of the bill. There is also the part 
concerning the Crimes Against Humanity Fund. This fund, if my 
memory serves me right, was established under the Rome Statute 
for an International Criminal Court. It is designed to help the 
victims of crimes against humanity. 
It would give the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services in particular a chance to pay into this fund the net 
proceeds from the disposition of any property and fines 
collected in relation to proceedings for an offence under the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large, this bill is a clear reflection of the obligations 
that will flow from Canada's agreement to be bound to the Rome 
Statute and the Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Bloc Quebecois reserves the right to examine 
fully the provisions of this bill and to propose, if required, 
amendments to ensure full conformity of the Canadian internal 
law with the international criminal law, as modified by the 
hopefully soon to come Statute of the International Criminal 
Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains a number of consequential amendments to many 
federal acts. For example, the Citizenship Act is greatly 
affected by this bill. The Extradition Act is also greatly 
modified. In the light of the Finta decision, a number of 
amendments contained in this bill in relation to the Extradition 
Act will clarify the situation arising from a controversial 
decision that, according to some people, was enough to justify 
corrections and amendments to the Extradition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also contains a part on conditional amendments. These 
are amendments to the Citizenship Act. This act is currently 
before this House since Bill C-16 is a rewrite of the 
Citizenship Act.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This overhaul of the act and the introduction of this new 
proposed legislation would require additional conditional 
amendments, in light of Bill C-19 on immigration, which at the 
same time is under consideration in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt consideration should also be given to bringing forth 
conditional amendments to another act also under consideration 
in the House, an act that should be amended not in accordance 
with provisions contained in other parts of Bill C-19, which are 
in relation to the old act, that is Chapter I-30 of the Revised 
Statutes of Canada, but in accordance with Bill C-31, which is 
the proposed new Immigration Act presently before the House and 
which we have examined earlier this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community is in the process of giving itself a 
tool absolutely essential to ensure justice and the supremacy of 
international law, especially international criminal law. The 
action that Parliament will take by passing an act to implement 
the Rome Statute will allow for the ratification of the Statute 
of the International Criminal Court. The Bloc Quebecois hopes 
for speedy ratification. 
It will help ensure justice, peace and international security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important bill for the entire international 
community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in 
the debate on Bill C-19.  This legislation has been precipitated 
by Canada's obligations under the Rome statute of the 
International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals strictly with three clearly defined offences: 
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  As well, Bill 
C-19 makes consequential changes to Canada's extradition and 
mutual legal assistance legislation to enable Canada to comply 
with its obligations to the International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 will equip Canada with domestic legislation to 
facilitate the prosecution by Canadian courts of the three above 
mentioned crimes whether committed outside Canada or within our 
borders.  It also gives Canada the right to have the first crack 
at the investigation, prosecution and sentencing of such cases at 
home.  We may also waive the right and extradite an accused to 
the International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also affirms that any immunities otherwise existing 
under Canadian law will not bar prosecution in Canada or 
extradition to the International Criminal Court or to any other 
international criminal tribunal established by resolution of the 
security council of the United Nations.  In other words, if an 
individual is suspected of war crimes and is living in Canada, 
then that individual will stand trial either in Canada if we 
choose or before the International Criminal Court.  If Canada 
undertakes an extensive investigation and the individual is found 
innocent of any charges, then that will satisfy the requirements 
of the International Criminal Court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the history and evolution of this initiative. 
Since the Nuremberg trials in 1945, the international community 
has been working toward the creation of a permanent international 
criminal court.  There is a lot of momentum worldwide for such an 
undertaking.  After years of preparatory negotiations and an 
intensive five week diplomatic conference, the basis for the ICC 
was adopted in Rome on July 17, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Criminal Court will be a permanent 
international institution mandated to prosecute persons 
responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes 
when national judicial systems fail to investigate or prosecute 
such individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Criminal Court statute will enter into force 
when 60 states have ratified it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ICC will be located in The Hague, Netherlands.  The 18 
judges of the ICC and the prosecutor will be selected on 
qualifications similar to supreme court level appointments and 
must be ratified by two-thirds of state parties.  Their terms 
will be for nine years.  Judges may be removed by a similar 
two-thirds vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules of procedure and evidence are currently being 
negotiated through a series of meetings of a preparatory 
commission which includes delegations from signatory states and 
other interested states.  An assembly of states parties will 
ratify these rules of procedure and evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the costs of this new court, at present we do not 
know what this initiative will cost Canada.  All member states of 
the ICC will pay a fee for the creation, operation and management 
of the ICC.  The United Nations will contribute half of the 
initial startup costs and will contribute financially when 
specific cases are mandated by the security council.  The 
remaining costs will be shared equally by all states parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have projected that Canada's initial contribution could be 
anywhere between $300,000 to $500,000.  Once the ICC is up and 
running, Canada could be asked to contribute $1 million to $2 
million per year.  In comparison, Canada's contribution to the 
Rwanda and Yugoslavia war crimes tribunals for 1998-99 was $6.3 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise some concerns and questions regarding this 
new court.  A permanent international body may become 
unaccountable and may override the sovereignty of a nation's 
legal and governance system.  Although the ICC is to be 
complementary to national courts, it will investigate and 
prosecute a crime when the states with the jurisdiction are 
unwilling to do so.  This is clearly one way in which the ICC 
could overrule the sovereignty of a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ICC has been structured so the sovereignty of nations will 
remain primordial.  It does so by requiring the enactment of 
domestic legislation in each ratifying state which gives that 
sovereign state both judicial equipment and the right to 
prosecute suspected cases of a said crime domestically. Bill C-19 
is Canada's version of that legislation.  We can also choose to 
waive the sovereign right to prosecute in our own court system 
and send the case and the accused to the ICC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that this right cannot be circumvented 
unless we are unable or unwilling to use it, that is, there is a 
deliberate fraudulent attempt to shield a suspect from 
prosecution or that our rule of law has completely collapsed and 
we have no government.  That this assessment could ever be made 
in the case of Canada is agreed among Canada's negotiating team 
and justice officials to be simply unthinkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also hope that this court does not lead to any proliferation 
of judicial activism.  Again we have been given assurances that 
the mandate of the judges and the court is clear and the terms of 
operation cannot be expanded.  We trust this is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One critical issue that stands out with this new court is that 
the United States has not yet signed the Rome statute.  We are 
told the current mood in the United States Senate is to remain in 
this position.  There is an argument that without the United 
States as signatory, the court will be very ineffective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also be vigilant not to allow international law to 
supersede Canadian law.  Again we have assurances this cannot 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negotiations of the preparatory commission on rules of 
procedure and evidence address critical and fundamental issues of 
the ICC.  They are not discussed or ratified in parliament. 
Issues such as the definition of aggression and other terms, the 
conditions of imprisonment, and judicial protocol are 
controversial issues in the implementation of the Rome statute. 
All of the negotiations should be subject to the input and 
ratification of this parliament; otherwise our requirement that 
the values of Canadians are adequately enshrined in law, 
structure and procedure of the ICC may be in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two ways we can approach these concerns.  We could 
delay ratification until the negotiations are concluded and can 
be ratified by parliament, or we could amend Bill C-19 to ensure 
Canada's final accession to the ICC is subject to the 
ratification of parliament regarding the rules and procedures of 
evidence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some conclude that individual tribunals would be superior to a 
permanent existing ICC.  A tribunal would examine a specific 
case, render a verdict and then disband.  However, these 
tribunals have proven to be ineffective in tracking down 
criminals and having the legal authority to prosecute criminals. 
On that front the ICC is attractive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance favours the prosecution of individuals who 
commit genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  At the 
same time we are very conscious of the need to protect our own 
sovereignty and want assurances that this will be built into Bill 
C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this bill proceeds, I suspect analysis of it particularly in 
committee will look at such areas as what some interested parties 
have called vague and imprecise definitions of offences. As well 
there has been concern expressed about the specifics of crimes 
committed in Canada as opposed to those committed outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 requires a lot of study and review.  I am confident 
this debate and the following assessments made on the bill will 
fashion a document that we can all accept.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy today to rise to debate the budget 
implementation act, Bill C-32.  In my capacity as industry critic 
I am quite concerned about the lack of progress on tax reduction. 
I want to refer to the study we commissioned in the industry 
committee and our dissenting opinion, which I will refer to with 
regard to taxes and the ways in which we could become more 
competitive in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November of last year the Standing Committee on Industry 
undertook a study on productivity.  The study was initiated in 
response to concerns expressed by many prominent economists and 
business leaders who warned of the alarming productivity gap 
developing between Canada and our major trading partner, the 
United States, and in particular the gap which developed over the 
past decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These leaders confirmed through statistical evidence what 
Canadians instinctively already knew.  Our standard of living had 
fallen over the past 30 years and the rate of decline had 
accelerated during the 1990s.  Currently Canadians earn $9,000 
less per capita than their American counterparts and that 
disparity continues to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Productivity is the measure of efficiency in which people, 
capital, resources and ideas are combined in the economy, which 
show up basically as our standard of living.  From the 1950s to 
the mid-1970s we had a tremendously high rate of growth in 
productivity, approaching 4% per annum in terms of labour 
productivity and 2% per annum in terms of multi-factor 
productivity.  Since 1973, however, Canada's growth in 
productivity has hovered around the 1% level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that really mean?  The picture becomes much clearer 
when we contrast the Canadian experience with that of our G-7 
partners.  At the end of the second world war Canada and the 
United States were by far the most productive countries in the 
world, but the levels of European countries and Japan have 
converged with those of North America.  This of course was 
inevitable as the European and Japanese economies recovered from 
the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the data is clear and unequivocal.  The United States 
remains the most productive country in the world, but Canada no 
longer holds second place.  That is a concern.  Canada is the 
only country in the G-7 that has not closed the gap relative to 
the United States in terms of productivity.  In 1976 Canada was 
second in terms of productivity among the G-7 countries, but 20 
years later, by 1997, Canada was fifth.  Other countries are now 
much closer to the U.S. and have overtaken Canada.  Italy and 
France are respectively the second and third most productive 
countries in the world.  Germany, despite the reunification of 
the west with the east, is now the fourth most productive economy 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After hearing from dozens of witnesses the standing committee 
tabled its 182 page report on productivity and innovation in the 
House of Commons on April 11.  The report did a good job in 
providing a 30 year history of Canada's decline and documenting 
our current situation, but it failed to identify the underlying 
reasons for Canada's productivity decline.  I say that it is a 
failing in the report.  That failure is a significant weakness in 
the report and it prompted the Canadian Alliance members of the 
committee to offer a dissenting opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if we fail to understand or choose to ignore the 
fundamental reasons for this decline it will impair our ability 
to offer constructive solutions.  The issues related to Canada's 
productivity and weakened competitiveness are complex, to say the 
least.  Many factors, including external shocks to a country's 
economy, can cause disruption.  However, some countries, such as 
the United States, are better able to adapt and restructure their 
economies.  The restructuring that took place in the U.S. in the 
1980s enabled the Americans to lead the world in growth for much 
of the 1990s, and that continues to the present.  Canada, 
however, did not enjoy that same level of growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For almost a century the Canadian and U.S. business cycles and 
economies were synchronised and could be charted with no 
divergence between the two.  Between 1900 and 1980 Canada never 
experienced a recession without a corresponding recession in the 
United States.  However, it is no small coincidence that Canada's 
business cycle began diverging from that of the United States in 
the late 1960s after the Canadian federal government expanded 
rapidly and became more interventionist.  The role played by 
public policy in Canada during this period is a significant 
factor which needs to be examined.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that a fundamental shift in government policy in the 
1960s and 1970s created the conditions that led to Canada's 
decline in productivity and currency devaluation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years major social programs were introduced and the 
federal government expanded through successive Liberal and 
Conservative administrations.  Changes made to the unemployment 
insurance program, as an example, moved it away from the concept 
of an insurance program to that of a social program function. 
The result was an increase in Canadian unemployment rates, 
several points higher than those in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, federal program spending continued to grow every 
year, which had to be financed by tax increases and deficit 
budgets.  The accumulated deficits created a federal debt of over 
$575 billion.  Currently one-third of each tax dollar taxpayers 
send to Ottawa is required to pay the interest on our national 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking over the past 30 years, the Conference Board of Canada 
told the committee that the Canadian way—Canada's traditional 
economic and social programs established largely in the 1960s—is 
unsustainable.  The Liberal response to this crisis is very weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee report claims that the latest federal budget is 
the answer to Canada's problems of productivity.  While it did 
propose some tentative steps to improve our productivity, the 
budget is too little, too late, to resolve the problems caused by 
30 years of misguided public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada currently finds itself in a very competitive tax 
environment worldwide and it is becoming more competitive all the 
time.  As such, the overdue tax cuts in budget 2000 are welcome, 
but their value is hampered by long phase-in periods and other 
half measures.  For example, the corporate tax rate is not 
scheduled to decrease until 2001 and then by only 1%, from 28% to 
27%.  The planned seven point reduction will not be fully 
achieved until 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the United States, France and Germany continue to reduce 
taxes and increase their productivity levels, Canada will 
continue to fall behind.  Canada currently holds the unenviable 
position of having the highest personal tax rates as a percentage 
of GDP of all the G-7 countries.  Canadian tax rates in the 
manufacturing and service sectors are becoming the highest in the 
G-7, as rates in those countries continue to decline.  Moreover, 
the $86 billion in new government spending announced on budget 
day clearly demonstrates that the priority of the federal 
government is to continue to increase its program spending, which 
is exactly the wrong thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims to have taken decisive action in paying 
down the national debt, but its current commitment of $3 billion 
annually pales in comparison with the $13 billion handed out in 
the form of grants and contributions each year.  Even at $3 
billion a year, it will take 191 years to retire the debt. 
Meanwhile, half a percentage rise in interest rates would 
increase charges to the national debt by $5 billion annually.  We 
know that interest rates are starting to rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investors take small comfort from the tepid measures found in 
the federal budget.  In fact, bold measures are needed to restore 
confidence in the Canadian economy.  I agree with leading 
Canadian economist, Pierre Fortin, when he advised that the best 
answer for Canada's declining standard of living is to cut taxes 
and pay down debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investor confidence is a very important factor as companies seek 
profit and increased productivity in this globally competitive 
environment.  Unfortunately, the signals generated by government 
policies over the past 30 years have not instilled the confidence 
required to increase that investment necessary to improve our 
productivity and standard of living.  As a result, the percentage 
of foreign direct investment coming into Canada has steadily 
declined over the past several years.  Even Canadians are 
increasingly looking beyond our borders for better opportunities 
for investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1988 to 1998 foreign direct investment flowing out of 
Canada rose more than six times.  Meanwhile, incoming foreign 
direct investment rose only two and a half times.  In fact, by 
1997 Canada had become a net exporter of foreign direct 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, Canada's productivity decline and government 
policy have led to the Canadian dollar becoming very weak and 
some companies are relying on it to remain competitive.  It is a 
poor way to try to get ourselves out of this problem.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely to goodness...If 68 cents was a good idea, why don't we 
try 50 cents?  Depreciating our currency will not serve us 
well....At some point there is a relationship between the cost 
of stuff we import and consume and our currency— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to sum up by saying that Canada is the second largest 
country in the world.  It has a vital pool of human and natural 
resources.  We have untapped potential for growth, but we need 
the proper environment to nurture that prosperity.  I am 
confident that Canada can regain that prosperity and 
competitiveness; however, it will take strong leadership by 
government to do that.  Our solution 17 on tax reform is a way to 
show confidence and we intend to introduce a confident budget 
when elected in the House of Commons to form the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-32, an act to implement 
certain provisions of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having closely examined each component of the latest budget by 
the Minister of Finance, we reached exactly the same conclusions 
as we did on February 28 when it was brought down. We have much 
criticism to level at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make one aside about the size and importance of 
the surplus to come. 
The people listening to us need to understand that when we refer 
to the surplus we mean the overpayments the taxpayers of Quebec 
and of Canada have made to the Minister of Finance.  This has 
merely gone to swell the annual surpluses that are largely used 
for government propaganda.  This money is also used to grease 
the palms of friends of the party, also known as looking out for 
one's buddies.  The government has no control over at least part 
of this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surpluses the Minister of Finance is projecting for the next 
five years are in the order of $90 billion or $95 billion. 
Knowing the Minister of Finance and how he loves to fiddle with 
the figures, and knowing how in the past he has deliberately 
hidden the true situation of public finances, the validity of 
his estimates are suspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be more accurate to speak of a cumulative surplus, over 
the next five years, of more than $140 billion.  For the 
employment insurance fund alone, despite the decrease in 
contributions in the last budget and the one before it, there 
will still be a surplus of more than $6 billion.  Employers and 
employees are, therefore, paying too much in the way of 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, the majority of workers who pay into the fund while 
employed are excluded from benefits.  Only 42% of the jobless 
can benefit, although 100% of them contributed while employed. 
This is a disgrace.  This is why there are stupendous surpluses 
every year in the fund, like the average of $6 billion annually 
over the past three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were expecting a thorough reform of employment insurance. 
My colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, introduced a 
general proposal to reform the employment insurance plan.  Under 
this proposal, all the bias in the plan, all the harmful aspects 
of the plan that the Bloc Quebecois has criticized so often, all 
the elements preventing the people who should benefit from the 
employment insurance plan from doing so could be totally and 
readily corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would even be possible to set aside a bit of a surplus 
annually to ensure there would be something of a cushion in the 
event the economy slows down.  The cushion in the employment 
insurance fund for the past four years has been over $26 
billion.   That is a lot.  This is robbery, because the federal 
government does not put a cent into it anymore.  The employers 
and the employees pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, those who contribute the most, in these two 
categories of taxpayers, are the small and medium businesses and 
the middle income workers, because of the ceiling on 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are the SMBs penalized by the federal tax system, 
especially compared to big business, not only are middle income 
workers penalized by the tax system and the various programs 
they cannot access, but they are obliged to pay more than their 
share of contributions to employment insurance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Minister of Finance has surpluses coming out his ears 
and polishes his image as the possible next leader of the 
Liberal Party of Canada, it is appalling that this man is 
responsible for really botching a policy that had in the past 
made Canada an example in the area of social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man, with his ambitions for the leadership of the Liberal 
Party of Canada, has ruined the work of a number of important 
politicians before him.  He has wrecked the employment insurance 
plan.  He stayed firmly seated on his fanny when he was asked to 
reform the tax system to make it a little fairer. 
He did not do anything for the poor. He let the ship drift. Let 
us not forget that he is a shipowner first and foremost, before 
being a Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man's ambition is to become the leader of a country. 
Imagine the catastrophe that could result if he were at the 
helm. People often forget that he is the one responsible for the 
increase in poverty since 1993, because of all the cuts he made 
to employment insurance and social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the surpluses that are coming out of his ears, we 
expected the Minister of Finance to fully restore transfers to 
the provinces for social assistance, higher education and 
health. But no. The minister earmarked only $2.5 billion, over 
the next three years, while everyone was asking him to allocate 
$3.7 billion immediately and to continue to do so every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is far from restoring federal transfers to fund health, 
higher education and social assistance to the levels they were 
at before the man responsible for this chainsaw massacre came 
into the picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For social housing, $54 million has been earmarked. The minister 
was boasting, saying “I care about the poor”. It is hypocritical 
to present things like that. The minister gave $54 million when 
he knew full well—because of the representations that had been 
made to him, by FRAPRU, among others—that a minimum of $1.7 
billion this year was required for a minimum number of social 
housing units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that even if money has been put into social 
housing since 1993, it is not for new units. It is not to meet 
the needs of thousands of Quebecers and Canadians who are 
getting poorer because of the Minister of Finance. 
It is to maintain housing that has already been built.  That is 
the difference.  There is also quite a difference between 
$1.7 billion and $54 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few words of congratulation for the Minister of Finance 
with respect to the indexing of the income tax tables.  Since 
1993, the Bloc Quebecois has been calling for the income tax 
tables to be fully indexed.  Why?  Because taxpayers are being 
robbed.  Although the Minister of Finance does not rise in his 
place, when bringing down the budget, and announce that he is 
raising taxes, the government's coffers kept filling up at an 
incredible rate because, since 1994, he has ignored our requests 
to index the income tax tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what has been the result?  Since 1994, the Minister of 
Finance, who has visions of leading the nation, has taken in 
$17 billion of taxpayers' money—taken in and stolen, it boils down 
to the same thing—because there is no indexation. 
He might deserve some praise for what he has done in this year's 
budget, but it took seven years and $17 billion stolen from 
taxpayers before this Minister of Finance decided to act.  This 
is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are worst off and those in the middle income category 
will have to wait longer for tax breaks.  With Canada's social 
policies scrapped, the worst off will benefit later from this 
huge sacrifice. The middle income earners, who have had billions 
squeezed out of them to eliminate the deficit and build up the 
surplus, will have to hold their breath too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do people realize what the real tax reduction will be this year 
and next for a couple with one child earning $20,000?  The tax 
savings for this couple will be $106 this year and $269 the 
next—not even a dollar a day. 
The tax savings for a couple with two children with a family 
income of $35,000 will be $115 this year and $195 the next. 
If this is not thumbing their nose at people, what is it?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple with two children and an income of $65,000 saves $485 
in taxes this year, and $500 in 2001, which works out to about 
$1.25 a day.  This is really laughable.  However, the buddies of 
the ship-owning Minister of Finance, with their annual incomes of 
$250,000 or more, will benefit this year from a tax savings of 
$4,785.  Next year, another $3,500 will have to be added to that 
figure, because the 3% surtax is going to be gradually 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at this on top of the enormous scandals at HRDC—the $3 
billion hole, and that is just the amount we know about—the 
Placeteco affair and the creation over the years of no fewer 
than 80 government bodies which have no obligation to report to 
parliament in any way and which have a budget allocation of more 
than $10 billion, over which we have no control.  We look at 
this mismanagement, this misuse of funds that could have gone to 
the disadvantaged and the middle-income earners.  We look at the 
Minister of Finance greasing the palms of his little buddies, 
and we cannot do otherwise than to regret this latest budget and 
all this pretence at lowering taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the analysis I have just presented, it can be seen 
that, yes, there were tax reductions, but for the millionaires, 
the peers and buddies of the Minister of Finance. 
It is possible that these shipowners do pay taxes elsewhere, but 
not in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-32, the Budget 
Implementation Act, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken in the House in the past about the government's 
failure to embrace the realities of a globally interconnected, 
hypercompetitive economy that is writing new rules for the game 
of economics.  We do not write those rules.  In fact we ignore 
those rules at our own peril. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to play by yesterday's rules and to 
foster the types of programs that were dubious 20 years ago but 
today are recognized as being downright wrong.  It refuses to 
embrace some of the elements of tax reform and deregulation that 
are necessary to prepare Canadians to embrace these realities, 
not just to compete globally but to succeed globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to some specific elements of the Budget 
Implementation Act, Bill C-32.  The first is the increase of the 
basic personal amount.  In the budget the government is proposing 
to increase the basic personal amount by $100 this year.  This 
works out to be a tax cut of about 33 cents per week or $17 per 
year.  That is about four cups of Starbucks coffee over the next 
year for Canadians.  I am sure Starbucks and all Canadians are 
grateful to the government for this grudging, belittling, 
ridiculous insult of a tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan we are looking at would effectively raise the basic 
personal exemption over a period of time to $8,200.  The fact is 
that in the U.S. the basic personal amount at which one begins to 
pay personal income taxes is not hit until about $11,000 
Canadian.  We are taxing the poorest of the poor in Canada.  We 
call ourselves a kinder and gentler nation, but the fact is that 
in the U.S., our neighbour to the south, the greatest economic 
superpower in the world, there is actually more compassion 
extended to lower income Americans relative to the tax system 
than what is afforded to Canadians by our tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party task force which reported in 
January would raise the basic personal amount to $12,000.  We 
would like to see that amount raised further, but there is a huge 
difference from $8,200 to $12,000.  It would liberate a number of 
Canadians from the Liberal tax regime which is attacking them at 
the very lowest levels of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest disappointments in the budget was the 
failure of the government to commit significantly to increasing 
Canada's health and social transfers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to remind anyone in the House that the Liberal 
government devastated health care in Canada by making draconian 
slashes to health care, by reducing health care funding and by 
putting health care in a crisis in every province in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government, the finance minister and the health minister 
to be condemning provinces as they try to work creatively under 
the stress created by the government's draconian cuts to health 
care and social transfers is hypocritical at best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been the Dr. Kevorkian of the Canadian health 
care system.  Through its indifference to the provinces and its 
failure to fund properly health care in Canada, the government 
has effectively almost euthanized the Canadian health care system 
or the capacity of the provinces to provide the type of health 
care system Canadians need in an increasingly expensive health 
care environment.  If the federal government wants to play a 
meaningful role in working with the provinces and determining the 
future of health care in Canada, it had better come to the table 
with its chequebook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time that health care funding in Canada was shared 
50:50.  The federal government would provide 50% and the 
provinces would provide 50%.  At that time there was a real 
partnership between the federal government and the provinces. 
There was some legitimacy to the notion that the feds and the 
provinces could work together on seeking new and innovative 
solutions to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently some estimates are that federal government 
contributions are down to as low as 13%.  It is very difficult if 
one is only paying $1.30 of $10 worth of gas to tell the driver 
where to take the car.  The government is refusing to step up to 
the plate and provide adequate funding and leadership to address 
the complexities of health care in this very complicated period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canada Health Act was first introduced, health care 
realities were fairly simple.  Since then pharmaceutical costs 
have increased to about 30% of total health care costs in Canada. 
Most pharmaceutical costs are covered privately.  With the rising 
cost of pharmaceuticals and the increasing rate at which the 
pharmaceuticals are comprising our overall health care spending, 
we already have a two tier health care system.  The federal 
government is not addressing the rising cost of pharmaceuticals 
and the composition of total health care costs as comprised by 
pharmaceuticals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is not addressing the biotech industry. 
Increasingly there are very advanced and complex approaches to 
health care, almost to the extent that miracles are possible. 
However the cost of these health care miracles is immense.  We 
have to address what could actually be considered ethical issues 
and work with the provinces on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible to have universal access to all new and advanced 
therapies and treatments?  Has the federal government worked with 
the provinces to estimate what the cost would be to provide to 
each and every Canadian with the total and utter extent of 
treatments that are available to them in today's global health 
care environment?  These types of things have to be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently our health minister is sounding less like a health 
minister and most like an electioneering politician. 
Unfortunately, until we see some real movement of the federal 
government on the part of both the finance minister and the 
health minister on the health care funding issue, I would suggest 
that Brian Tobin, Premier of Newfoundland and former Liberal 
cabinet minister in this House, is correct when he says that the 
government has missed the boat by not reinvesting significantly 
in health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Across Canada the medical associations, nurses associations and 
provincial governments all agree that the federal government has 
to take a more proactive and aggressive approach to health care 
in Canada.  It has to either butt out or butt in with more money 
for investing in health care.  Clearly the budget missed the 
point on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the government's failure to embrace the importance 
of general tax reform, it is important to point out that our 
competitors in every country in the industrialized world are 
using tax reform and tax reduction as a vehicle to greater levels 
of economic growth and opportunity for their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 10 years Ireland's GDP on a per capita basis has 
increased by 92%.  During the same period of time the American 
GDP per capita increased by around 20%.  Canada's GDP per capita 
increased by an anaemic 5%.  Clearly, as citizens in other 
countries are getting richer, Canadians are getting poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Productivity is the currency of the economic environment.  If we 
are allowing Canada to fall behind, effectively we are reducing 
the standard of living of all Canadians not only now, but well 
into the future. The Royal Bank of Canada's chief economist, John 
McCallum, predicted not so many weeks ago that under current 
trends Canada's standard of living would be approximately half of 
that of the Americans, that within 15 years our standard of 
living would be reduced to half of that of Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brain drain is a damning barometer of the performance of the 
government.  Over the last several years the number of people 
leaving Canada to seek opportunities elsewhere in other countries 
has gone from 16,000 per year to approximately 100,000 per year. 
That is happening under the stewardship, or lack thereof, of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just a matter of tax tinkering based on Liberal focus 
groups and short term political polling.  We need significant 
levels of tax reform focused on doing what is right for Canadians 
well into the next century, not simply poll monitoring focused on 
Liberal fortunes in the next election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the budget brought forth by 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the finance minister and his spin doctors are using 
five year projections to exaggerate his changes and to sell 
benefits to Canadians.  It is too bad the government cannot be 
straight with the public over just what the budget will or will 
not do for the citizens of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a little more integrity and honesty the government would 
have to inform the Canadian taxpayer that the announced tax cuts 
for this year will already have been eaten up by recent increases 
in the price of fuel to operate our motor vehicles.  After all, 
the tax cuts amount to about $10 a week and we have all seen how 
much we now have to pay each time we pull up to the pumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a little more clarity the government would tell Canadians 
that the increase to the Canada pension plan premiums on January 
1, 2000 was one of the largest tax grabs in the history of this 
country. The government sings the praises of its $10 per week tax 
cut, but says very little about the $8 a week tax increase to 
cover its mismanagement of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a little more sincerity the government would inform 
Canadians that it has done little if anything proactively to 
address the $576 billion debt.  The government keeps putting off 
the reduction of the debt for some rainy day far into the future. 
The finance minister has survived this albatross around our necks 
solely because of the pace of the economy.  Should the economy 
ever slow down or even recede, we will be in big trouble for not 
paying our bills when we had surplus capability. It is 
unfortunate when we have a Prime Minister and a finance minister 
who put off this problem until some time when they are no longer 
around to tackle the consequences of their inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I say, the spin doctors have worked overtime to sell this 
budget but Canadians are not buying. 
It is no wonder politicians are ranked so unfavourably by 
citizens.  Even the government after years of good fortune and 
years of fancy bookkeeping now admits that our revenues are 
greater than our expenditures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the fancy bookkeeping or creative accounting and 
bring up the millennium scholarship fund as just one example.  It 
is still a wonder how the country's chief accountant was able to 
write off a future year's expenditures in his current financial 
year.  At least we now have a balanced budget even in the eyes of 
the finance minister and his strange accounting practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a balanced budget the surtax should have been eliminated. 
After all, its only reason for being was to address the deficit. 
The deficit has been eliminated but the surtax remains and will 
only be finally removed sometime in the future.  This reminds me 
of the GST.  The government makes promises but fails to fulfil 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully appreciate that the budget process is primarily about 
the money held by the government on behalf of its citizens. Maybe 
the government should recognize this fact occasionally.  It seems 
to think the money belongs to it, the Liberal Party.  Not too 
long ago the Minister of Veterans Affairs had the temerity to 
imply that the tax department was a Liberal Party institution.  I 
always assumed that government departments were supposed to 
operate independently of the political arm of government. Perhaps 
he let the cat out of the bag as to the real truth in Ottawa.  I 
would hate to think so as Canadians already have enough reasons 
to despise the tax collector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the budget and the money process, the Minister 
of Finance spends a great deal of time allocating money to this 
department and that department, but he does not spend a great 
deal of time ensuring the problems are corrected or that 
ministers are efficient and effective with their allotments. 
There appears to be little concern when the Minister of Human 
Resources Development admits to billions of tax dollars having 
been expended with hardly any checks and balances to ensure that 
we obtained value for the money invested.  It appears the 
government views the taxpayer as a bottomless pit as the finance 
minister added to the problem in this budget by giving HRD more 
money to waste.  As the saying goes, only in Canada you say.  HRD 
should have been dramatically reduced in funding instead of being 
rewarded.  It is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us break our budgetary process into very simple terms.  Over 
the next five years the Minister of Finance projects he will have 
in excess of $119 billion from his excessive taxation policies. 
We all know how conservative the minister becomes when he 
projects his revenues.  There is at least $119 billion that 
taxpayers are being forced to pay in excess of what this money 
grabbing government needs to operate.  This includes the billions 
of dollars that are mismanaged, written off as bad debts and 
spent like the proverbial drunken sailor.  There will be $119 
billion of excess taxation over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $119 billion includes the $5 billion per year the finance 
minister continues to overtax through the employment insurance 
fund.  There is a surplus of $30 billion in the fund but the 
government continues to overcharge workers in order to fund pet 
projects.  The minister likes to point out cuts to employee and 
employer contributions over the past number of years.  The simple 
fact is that there is an enormous surplus and there is absolutely 
no valid reason to continue to overtax workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should be absolutely ashamed of his actions.  He 
overtaxes citizens to the tune of $119 billion and then tries to 
buy them off by giving back a few tax breaks.  The rest is used 
to perpetuate the Liberal legacy of spend, spend, spend.  And we 
wonder why we are $576 billion in debt.  And we wonder why we are 
facing a brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I note that the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance have been noticeably quiet lately about the brain drain. 
Last year they said there was no such thing.  They appear to have 
finally clued in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of being clued in, where was the government prior to 
the budget?  In the budget there was very little for health care. 
Now the Liberals seem to understand that health care is the 
highest priority among Canadians.  The provinces are in desperate 
situations and have been demanding to meet with the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two tier health programs are now once again threatening our 
universal health care system.  What strikes me as very 
questionable is that the health minister says that he wants to 
consult the provinces and additional financial resources are 
available.  If more funds are available, why were they not 
included within the budget just a few weeks ago?  A national plan 
seems to be seriously lacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence the government deserves very little praise for its 
accomplishments over the past seven years.  Yes, when it took 
power in 1993, it faced a very shaky financial picture. Canadians 
were grossly overtaxed, government was far too big and we were in 
a deficit position as the revenues were less than the 
expenditures. 
The government likes to blame the Mulroney government for all our 
financial ills, but I seem to recall that it was the Trudeau 
Liberal government that started us on this downward spiral that 
will take generations to rectify.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Through a little bit of cost cutting but primarily through a 
significant change in world economic growth and significant tax 
increases to an already overburdened taxpayer, this country was 
able to balance the budget.  Canadians owe very little to the 
Liberal government for our present economic outlook. The deficit 
was conquered solely on the backs of Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go on especially on such an important topic as 
the budget but my time is limited. I would like to mention the 
new money provided to the RCMP and I would like to talk about 
border security problems. In both cases the government has put 
more money to the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government created the financial disaster within the RCMP 
when it gave members a long overdue raise in salary but then 
forced the organization to fund the raise from its existing 
budget. This resulted in the closing of the training academy and 
resulted in shortages to the extent that the RCMP had difficulty 
in putting fuel into its vehicles and even into buying tires for 
its cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the border security problems, money is not the sole 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government has no other solutions to the 
problems of the country.  There is no plan. There is no vision. 
We continue to ride on the seat of our pants and hope that the 
problems are solved by themselves. Canadians expect much more. 
The government has gotten very old and very tired. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to speak to budget 2000, which may be described as 
failing to meet the needs of the people and should have taken 
into account all the problems facing the people of Canada and 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government failed to do a very important thing: to 
restore the social transfers throughout Canada.  In 1995, 
$48 billion in cuts to the social transfer to the provinces were 
forecast; in 1999, we have reached $30 billion in cuts. 
This is money for health, education and income security that has 
been cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would therefore have preferred to see happen what we have 
called for on a number of occasions, namely the return of the 
Canada social transfer to better support the provinces, which 
provide the frontline services to the public.  So, $3.7 billion a 
year was sought by the Bloc Quebecois even before the budget was 
presented. What the Minister of Finance delivered was 
$2.4 billion over five years, in trust, for the provinces to 
spend as they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this practice of the government of putting money in 
trust for health does not permit the provinces to develop a long 
term strategy to better meet the needs of the public. 
At present, the health program is in a state of crisis 
everywhere in Canada, and it is often said that the need is 
greater than our ability to meet it. Still, some money will need 
to be invested after the government has reconsidered its way of 
doing things in the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of such factors as the ageing population, the new 
techniques to adequately deal with emergencies and health 
problems, and the increase in poverty, which requires more 
prevention work than in the past, I say that we now find 
ourselves in this situation because the government has been 
accumulating a social deficit and letting the public down for 
six years. This is why the situation is so disastrous in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of all the cuts made to the Canada social transfer, 
Quebec has been experiencing a shortfall that has prevented it 
from hiring 3,000 doctors, 5,000 nurses and 5,800 teachers. 
Let us not forget that income security recipients could have 
received an extra $500 annually.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a federal government initiative that is far from 
pleasing the provinces, which are faced as a result with 
increased demands and an acute problem in health and education. 
The school drop-out phenomenon tells us that we need more 
teachers, helpers and educational psychologists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's underfinancing has been condemned by a 
number of stakeholders in health and education. Social rights 
advocates also demand a greater degree of fairness to ensure 
adequate financial assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, regarding the Canada social transfer, it is a big zero in 
terms of this government's social concerns. This is the mark 
that I would give to the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We noticed a second thing about this budget.  It is unacceptable 
that the government has not budged on EI.  The Bloc Quebecois, 
through the member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, proposed a series of bills that would improve the 
government's approach to eligibility for employment insurance. 
It is no longer insurance when six people out of ten do not 
qualify.  And there are all sorts of reasons why they do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to adopt a reform that would take the market into 
account, but here again I think we have our heads in the sand. 
What we are seeing now is people trying to cope with insecure 
and atypical jobs with few social benefits. When people no 
longer have EI to help keep them afloat until they find another 
job, it is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows perfectly well what is needed to correct 
the situation.  We know that in the meantime Treasury Board 
coffers are brimming over with more than $30 billion from the 
pockets of workers and employers throughout Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable and, once again, we know only too well that 
what the federal government likes to do is build up its revenue 
and its room to manoeuvre with an eye to an election so that it 
will get the biggest political bang for its buck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there is EI and the Canada social transfer, and I would add 
social housing. 
It is unacceptable to see how the government has, since 1993, 
totally abandoned the help families and single mothers have been 
calling for, along with low wage earners who can no longer 
afford to pay the rent, and who often have to pay 30%, 40% and 
even 50% of their incomes to keep a roof over their heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are alarming figures to the percentage of the population, 
of single parents and low income families who cannot find a 
decent place to live at a price they can afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December, with great fanfare, a project was announced which 
will include the homeless and the street people.  There was talk 
of a bill that would involve the major cities of Canada.  As far 
as Quebec was concerned, there was talk of Montreal and Quebec 
City, but there was nothing for the regions. 
The project is being re-evaluated.  Now they say there would 
probably be something for the regions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With $305 million over three years, this is merely a drop in the 
bucket given the pressing need.  It is hoped that the program 
which has been created will also take into account the realities 
of Quebec as far as assistance with social housing is concerned. 
All Quebec community groups comprising the membership of FRAPRU 
are calling for 1% of the budget, which represents $1.6 billion 
yearly, for five years.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a far cry from the $8 billion the various organizations, 
and we in the Bloc Quebecois, had called for in order to 
properly deal with the social housing issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The groups have received the message of the Minister of Finance 
loud and clear, when he plays to the crowd at major 
international conferences, talking of how we must think of the 
disadvantaged, that globalization should apply to the poor as 
well as to the rich, that poverty must be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable that, despite the three measures in which the 
government had room to manoeuvre—much more than what was done 
in the last budget—to properly respond to the whole problem of 
the gap between the rich and the poor, nothing was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another area, that of taxation, the tax tables have been 
indexed.  The government did not go far enough in cutting the 
taxes of low income earners.  A single person earning $20,000 
will pay $2 less in taxes in 2000-01.  The person will pay a huge 
$14 less in taxes in 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again there is very little for people with low incomes. 
There is nothing either for people on welfare, nothing for those 
wanting better care or prevention.  In the meantime, the Liberal 
government wanted to ensure it had a lot of manoeuvring room in 
an election period, so that it could spend for home care and for 
other forms of help. 
I always say that the federal government is more concerned with 
being returned to office in an election than with going after 
the real problems and, in the end, meeting the needs of the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am currently touring Quebec to listen to what people have to 
say on the problem of poverty and the social safety net. 
Clearly, the federal government is evading its responsibilities 
to provide proper funding in this area through channels of 
investments; funding is inadequate and often non existent.  That 
is what we see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois said that there was $95 billion in surplus, 
but I believe the figure is much higher.  The government should 
have given us a social budget, and not—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, speaking of the very sharp 
contrast between the tax and spend Liberal federal government and 
the fiscally innovative and prudent way that the Government of 
Ontario, the Mike Harris Tories, runs its finances, I want to 
remind the federal Liberals of something that is occurring in the 
country right now.  I want to read this for their benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> yesterday stated 
“Ontario is on top of the world.  Canada's economic heartland 
has put behind it almost 30 years of deficits, decline, bad 
government, unsound investments and painful restructuring and 
emerges as one of the most successful economies in North America, 
and in the world”.  This is from the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, which 
is known to be somewhat friendly to the Liberal government of 
late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article went on to state “The latest calculations in 
finance minister Ernie Eves' fifth budget reveal that the 
province's economy last year grew by 5.7%”—and get this, Mr. 
Speaker—“better than anyone had expected, better than anywhere 
else in Canada, better than in the United States, better than any 
nation in the group of seven”.  Imagine that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the citizens of Ontario blessed with such an incredible 
economy?  Let me give an example.  The article continued 
“Ontario celebrates the economic fruits of four years of 
measured, comprehensive income and property tax reform”. 
Translated, that means tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Thanks in part to those tax cuts, real disposable income over 
the past three years in Ontario increased by 11.6%, double that 
of the rest of the country.  Corporate profits rose last year by 
22.3% and real consumer spending rose 4%.  An economy like that 
can generate 200,000 net new jobs in a single year”, which, 
surprise, surprise, Ontario did in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrast that with the Liberal government.  Since 1993 there 
have been somewhere in the neighbourhood of 50 to 60 individual 
tax increases.  The average disposable family income has 
decreased since 1993 by over $4,000.  The average disposable 
income of Canadian workers has decreased by about $2,200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals simply do not get it.  They believe that the way to 
increase the tax revenue in government coffers is not to cut 
taxes, like most people in the real world would assume, to 
stimulate the economy.  If taxes were cut citizens would have 
more money in their pockets to spend.  Consumer spending would 
increase.  Investors would invest in the economy, set up 
manufacturing plants and create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, the Liberal philosophy is “We will simply hold the magic 
tax lever.  In order to balance our budget we do not really have 
to grow the economy.  We will let Ontario do that for us, or in 
spite of us.  We will just wring that money out of the people of 
Canada, the businesses of Canada and the investment community”. 
That is what they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how they got the money to balance the budget; not 
through prudent fiscal planning, but riding on the backs of the 
province of Ontario and the province of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mike Harris and Ralph Klein formed their governments they 
said “We are going to get the finances of this country in shape. 
We are going to use a tried and true formula which we know has 
worked in numerous jurisdictions and countries around the 
world”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That formula is simply this.  Lower taxes equal a more buoyant 
economy.  Higher taxes equal a sluggish economy.  The government 
picked the first one.  It was so simple, but the government does 
not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget the finance minister claimed that he was 
going to give Canadians $58.4 billion in tax relief over five 
years.  That sounds pretty good on the surface.  We could almost 
get excited about it.  Here is the real truth.  From a $58.4 
billion gross tax relief claim, we have to take away $7.5 billion 
over five years for social spending, which is the child benefit. 
Then we have to add to that $29.5 billion in increased CPP 
premiums because the Liberal government, which for so many years, 
unfortunately, has been in office in this country, has mismanaged 
the Canada pension plan since 1965 when it was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good one.  The solicitor general is going to love this 
one.  The government has said that it will provide $13.5 billion 
in tax relief. 
It plans to schedule $13.5 billion in tax relief over the next 
five years.  It plans on doing this but it will not do it so that 
it means $13.5 billion in tax relief or a tax cut.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the former parliamentary secretary of 
finance, the Minister of Health and the solicitor general, here 
is a simple formula.  Let us say that I was a taxpayer earning $1 
a year and paying taxes on that.  The government says that it 
will, let us say, give me 13.5% in tax relief.  I say 
“Whoopee”.  However, what it means is that the government will 
not increase my taxes by 13.5% and therefore I will have a tax 
break.  I look at my pay stub and say “Gee whiz, I did not get a 
tax break.  All I got was no increase”.  In Liberal terms that 
somehow translates into a tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about a couple of other things that the Liberal 
government has told us about its budget and the way it runs the 
country fiscally.  All through this it has tried in vain to 
portray itself as being the caring and generous party of Canada. 
In the meantime, since 1993 it has cut $25 billion out of the 
Canadian health and social transfer.  Does that sound like a 
caring, generous government?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know that you are a wise person sitting in that 
chair and I know that you probably get it before some of the 
ministers here.  This generous, caring government cut $25 billion 
out of the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it will end bracket creep.  That is not a 
reduction in tax.  It only means that a regular scheduled tax is 
again not going to occur.  All the time the government has blown 
its spending budget.  Every year since 1993 it has spent more 
than what it said it would.  It basically adds up to a Liberal 
sucker tax cut, if I can use that term, or, in better terms, a no 
break tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are waiting for it and they have not received it. 
While they look at the performance of the provinces of Ontario 
and Alberta, they say to themselves “Why does this Liberal not 
get it?  Why can it not follow the example?”  I hate to tell 
working Canadians but this government has never gotten it and 
never will get it.  The only way Canadians will get substantive 
tax relief is by electing in the next federal election a Canadian 
Alliance government to sit on that side and bring in the tax cuts 
that they so dearly deserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to rise today 
to speak to the government's budget implementation act, Bill 
C-32, mostly because it gives the members of the Canadian 
Alliance another chance to poke holes in that big myth out there 
that the Liberal government is a prudent manager of the nation's 
tax money, to use the finance minister's term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that a number of words may be used to describe 
Liberal economic management.  I would use unimaginative, 
intrusive, counterproductive, ad hoc and so on, but prudent is 
not a word that fits the real story of this budget or any other 
in the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-32 has a number of components that taken in isolation can 
be argued to have or not have merit depending on the application. 
As a whole, they reveal two things about this Liberal government. 
It really does not have a clue about what it takes to build a 
greater country and it has no intention of giving up its ability 
to dictate and intrude in the lives of Canadians or in the 
activities of the provincial governments.  He who has the money 
makes the rules.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at these pieces.  On the positive side of the ledger 
is a provision for one year versus the now standing six month 
maternity leave.  This is a nod to the fact that parents should 
attend to the raising of their children in the first crucial 
months of their young lives.  However, since only about 30% of 
Canadian mothers qualify for the six month maternity leave now, 
it really begs the question:  Why increase it?  Why not put 60% 
into the six month slot?  This leaves single income families, 
self-employed parents and many part time workers out of that 
loop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a better solution, solution 17 to be exact, and I will 
get to that a bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are provisions in this legislation to give the Minister of 
National Revenue more authority—scary fact—to pounce on 
Canadians who are either trying to avoid the GST-HST levy or are 
having trouble figuring out what to charge it on.  The rules keep 
changing.  I know the members opposite will say it is the former. 
This measure is just meant to catch the unscrupulous.  When did a 
qualification like that ever slow down a tax collector? The 
examples of ordinary, law-abiding Canadians, small business 
people, who find themselves in a kangaroo court over paperwork 
screw ups or whatever are legion.  We cannot expect that to 
improve until the whole system is overhauled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, what happened to the Liberal promise to scrap or 
get rid of the GST?  Seven years later the GST is dinging 
Canadians for over $46 billion a year.  Out of that figure, it 
gives back $24 billion in rebates, which makes one wonder why it 
takes that much in the first place.  Why not reduce it to 5% or 
take it off things like reading materials or whatever?  That 
would require imagination and political will and we do not see 
that.  Let us not forget that the Liberal government was supposed 
to scrap the whole thing anyway.  We should not expect any action 
on this very soon.  We will have to continue to pay it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make another point about the GST before I move on.  In 
the 1995-96 budget the finance minister pre-booked nearly $1 
billion for transitional assistance to provinces that were going 
to harmonize their sales tax with the GST.  The problem was that 
at the time no one had signed on to this harmonization scheme and 
of course no money changed hands that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996-97 the Canada Foundation for Innovation received $800 
million before it even existed.  In 1997-98 the millennium 
scholarship fund received $2.5 billion.  This money walked out 
the door despite the protests of provinces, opposition parties 
and even the students it was supposed to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99 almost $4 billion in pre-booking went on, including 
$2.5 CHST funding that does not actually get to the provinces all 
at once but over four years.  That is not a very big amount when 
we break it down over four years.  We cannot make a big splash 
unless we are willing to throw a big wad of taxpayer money 
overboard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big problem is that the finance minister's shenanigans 
throws into question the real state of the country's books.  The 
auditor general attaches a reservation to the accounts, which is 
the harshest criticism an accountant can level at the government. 
He saw that the Liberals were deliberately overstating the 
deficit and using taxpayer money for the very political purpose 
of making grand, empty gestures and claiming to be wonderful 
managers.  There was no money for tax cuts or debt reduction. 
Just monuments and increased spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite like to defend the government's largesse by 
saying that it is spending on education.  In reality, only 7% of 
university students in this country get in on the millennium 
gravy train and many of them have discovered that the taxpayer 
money from the feds only displaces money from other sources. That 
is a big point.  There are bursary and scholarship programs out 
there already.  Why invent new ones unless we are trying to build 
a monument to somebody, and the Liberals do such a poor job of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a 14 year old student from my riding who has qualified 
for a $16,000 scholarship to a very good school in Montreal.  His 
parents have recently found out that they have to pay $4,000 in 
income tax for him to qualify for that scholarship.  The 
government gives with one hand and rips it back with another. The 
family is beginning to find out that they cannot afford to send 
their child to that school. It is cost prohibitive because of the 
tax law.  This is absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In section 3 of this bill, the federal government has to take 
back the Canada student loans.  A story circulated a few months 
ago that banks would get over $100 million to pay for defaults 
and costs.  I can tell the House that my constituents were upset 
to hear that the billion dollar banks would be bailed out with 
taxpayer money.  It turns out that the federal government pays a 
premium to these banks for them to co-operate in the student 
loans program.  The situation remains murky as to who pays what 
in the end.  The new program may cost $155 million versus the $75 
million under the previous set up.  This is more taxpayer money 
flushed.  The Montreal <I>Gazette</I> reported on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware that students are carrying $9 billion in loans 
right now and, despite publicity to the contrary, most students 
do pay back their loans.  They are good citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the long term value to the economy of higher 
education, one would think that the Liberals would come up with a 
better plan than to place responsibility for doling out this 
money in the hands of the overworked HRD ministry, as we see in 
part 3 of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government feels compelled to join with the 
provinces in the education field, or compete with them, which 
seems to be the Liberal way, then it should offer a plan to 
alleviate student debt rather than add to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the HRD track record, what assurances can we have 
that money will only go to people in need and to encourage our 
best and brightest to pursue legitimate courses of study?  After 
all, this is the same government that defends the funding of dumb 
blonde joke books, porno films and displays involving dead 
rabbits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bright side, I guess, for the students, and I suspect 
the burdensome finance minister's tax system has a secondary 
purpose.  By driving our best young graduates down to the United 
States, he assures them that they can make more money, get to 
keep more of it and pay back their Canadian student loans with a 
more valuable dollar.  Our dollar is worth less than 67 cents 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I thought the finance minister was that clever maybe I could 
find an excuse to applaud him.  However the real reason for the 
complex, archaic, confusing and unworkable tax system, which Bill 
C-32 barely tinkers with, is that it continues to allow the 
Liberals to indulge their overarching ambition to control the 
lives of as many people as they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes are not just government revenue, they are power; power to 
pick losers out of the marketplace and keep them limping along, 
and power to reward loyal supporters.  The old adage that the 
government picks losers and losers pick government is certainly 
reinforced in a lot of the things being brought out in question 
period lately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a prerogative that the Liberals are about to give up 
because they distrust individual choices.  They fear 
entrepreneurship and they despise the fact that provinces, like 
Ontario and Alberta, are succeeding with 21st century politics 
while the Liberal government is stuck trying to make its 1960's 
policies work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 6 of the bill includes provisions for eliminating bracket 
creep.  It also raises the foreign content restrictions on RRSPs. 
That is great for the Liberals.  Welcome to the 1990s.  These 
ideas have been kicked around for the last 10 or 12 years. If we 
allow them to borrow more of our policies like that, we might 
even nudge them into the next century, though of course they 
would not be on that side of the House to enjoy it.  The Canadian 
people will leave them behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals seem to think that the tax changes they are making 
are in isolation in the country.  Unfortunately they are not.  We 
are still coming up short when it comes to the G-7 ratings and 
most of the other countries around the world.  They are making 
changes far faster than we are, and in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Medicine Hat has long been advocating the 
removal of the foreign content restriction on Canadian savings 
plans.  While this country has incrementally lost ground to the 
U.S. economy, Canadians have been penalized billions of dollars 
in lost opportunities.  Now that the stock markets everywhere are 
becoming increasingly volatile, the Liberals say “feel free to 
risk your retirement in other countries”.  They are a day late 
and a dollar short, but even worse, they have the nerve to turn 
their stubborn vices into a new found virtue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been warning them for years that bracket creep was 
eroding the values of Canadian tax deductions, even while their 
own experts complained that Canadian net incomes were falling. 
Finally they decided to come clean and try to take the credit for 
reforming one aspect of a flawed tax system.  Some $10 billion 
have been unfairly raked in by bracket creep alone.  One million 
low income Canadians were dragged onto the tax rolls while 
another two and a half million found themselves paying outrageous 
rates on their few dollars of earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will want us to congratulate them for lower taxes 
but I am afraid we will have to hold our applause.  Like all 
promises by this government, lower tax rates are today's headline 
and tomorrow's excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solution 17 will work to fix all this, and part of that solution 
17 is increasing the basic personal deduction to $10,000 for both 
the husband and wife.  A $3,000 credit for every child, real 
values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who believes the government's budget spin should take a 
reality check.  People should look at their pay stubs and judge 
for themselves.  The real measure is whether or not we are 
gaining or losing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am glad to be here to speak on Bill C-32 today. 
Although we are close to the end of the debate, it is good to get 
one's two cents worth in, particularly right after tax season 
when it is all that many Canadians will have left as a result of 
the tax and spend policies of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had a budget introduced in Ontario that gives 
significant tax relief.  On the heels of that budget, there was a 
dinner in Toronto last night at which every leader of a major 
Conservative-minded, Conservative policy political party, were in 
attendance. 
We note that the leader of the Tories at the far end of the 
building was not there.  We thought maybe Joe Clark did not 
consider himself to be a Conservative.  We have been saying that 
for quite some time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason our taxes are so high is that the Liberal government 
is not really in control of spending.  Since I am deputy critic 
of Indian affairs I thought I would talk about some of the 
uncontrolled and misdirected spending occurring in that area with 
which I am most familiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee recently it is interesting to note that members of 
all parties have begun to speak out on the mismanagement of 
resources and the wasted lives of Canada's aboriginal people 
despite massive government spending that is equal to or exceeds 
the amount spent on other Canadians.  Spending on elementary and 
secondary education of Indian children is in the region of $976 
million annually.  This is second only to social assistance in 
the amount of $1.097 million.  That is a lot of money.  The money 
spent on education amounts to 21% of all spending by Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In chapter 4 of the latest report of the auditor general he 
pointed out that money spent on aboriginal education was not 
being properly accounted for.  The report makes statements like: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actual education costs are not known to the Department. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is noteworthy that education funding and costs may be 
different from each other.  For example a March 1999 study 
concluded that it is not possible to determine how education 
funds provided by the Department for First Nations schools are 
actually spent...We reported similar concerns in our previous 
audits of funding arrangements between the Department and first 
Nations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note the use of the plural of audit.  In section 4.65 he says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could not find any separate cost per student analysis for 
First Nations elementary and secondary schools; nor could we find 
information that identified per student costs paid directly to 
provincial authorities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to a couple of school boards in my riding about 
that same issue, where funds have not found their way to the 
school board responsible for educating the children who have 
moved in off the reserve.  It is getting to be a major issue. 
Moving on to section 4.66, the auditor general again raised the 
issue of funding by saying: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—methods used to allocate funds from the Department's 
headquarters to its regions are based largely on information that 
was developed at least 15 years ago.  The Department has no 
updated analyses. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can I say?  That 15 year old information is still being 
used to base spending.  The Minister of Finance is raising funds 
to transfer for Indian education based on 15 year old 
information, which is a complete waste of taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special needs students are a special responsibility of society, 
and here is what the auditor general reported on this area: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one region of Canada the amount spent on special needs 
children was $581 per year for all students.  In another costs 
range from $2,047 per special needs student to $65,650 although 
there was no mechanism in place to ensure that the needs of those 
students were being met. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we say about that?   Why should Canadian taxpayers be 
happy about statistics like those?  These figures are not out of 
the air.  They are actual statistics used by the auditor general 
in making his report. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance department collects taxes from all Canadians to fund 
education for Indians.  It is necessary to ensure that the taxes 
and other funds collected are well spent.  Mismanagement of 
public funds is one of the main reasons taxes are so high. 
Repayment of Canada's national debt which stands at almost $580 
billion is negligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been speaking about the money side of it, but the 
numbers only tell half the story about Indian education.  The 
latest auditor general's report uncovers a human tragedy. 
Students are just not getting the education they need to succeed 
in society.   Their dropout rates are far higher than normal. 
They are not moving from high school into jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dropout rate before completion of grade 9 is 18%, whereas 
the rate for all Canadians is 3%.  For Indian youth between the 
ages of 18 and 20 who left school the rate is 40% and 16% for the 
Canadian population.  For Indian youth between the ages of 18 and 
20 who graduated the rate is 30% whereas for all Canadians it is 
63%. The population with at least a high school education is 37% 
for Indians and 65% for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are paying a lot of money in the form of the millions 
of dollars the finance minister's bracket creep has brought into 
the taxation system.  This includes people from the first nations 
and immigrants.  It includes all taxpayers from teenagers with 
after school and evening jobs to people past retirement age who 
are still working and everyone in between, the rich and the poor. 
People have been pushed into higher tax brackets and are paying 
more and more money for results that just do not amount to 
anything.  It is a disaster for the human beings involved in this 
kind of program.  We should all be ashamed of it.  I certainly 
am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we say about the government when it comes to other 
things like debt repayment?   Does debt repayment amount to 
anything?   Not at a bit.  No homeowner or businessman would be 
permitted to take such a cavalier attitude toward debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine what would happen if people with mortgages on 
their houses were permitted to tell the bank how much they were 
going to pay.  What would happen if they could walk into a bank, 
reach into their pockets or wallets and pull out some change? 
What would happen if they counted out a few bills, tossed them 
down and said that is what they were paying on their home 
mortgages?  They would not even get out of the bank without the 
manager grabbing on to them and saying that they need to sit 
down, sign something and make a plan to get out of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people get too far in debt I am told counselling is 
available.  Maybe we should send the finance minister for 
counselling to figure out how to handle Canada's debt.  The 
government is putting a mortgage on the future of our young 
people.  Anybody who deals in mortgages knows that is a dead 
hand, that we cannot move.  That is the way of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the Minister of Finance gets a grip on Canadian taxation 
and allows the economy to get moving, we will pass on to our 
children a non-performing economy and a country that will be 
better to leave if future economic prospects mean anything.  The 
best alternative is a Canadian Alliance government, and that is 
what will happen after the next election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am rising today to speak to the third grouping of 
amendments to Bill C-22, in particular Motions Nos. 9 and 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say first that I support the bill.  We all know there 
is a need that has been agreed upon both nationally and 
internationally to combat money laundering.  It is a global 
phenomenon.  Enabling and co-ordinating the efforts of different 
law enforcement agencies through a centralized body such as would 
be established by this bill certainly is not in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also say that the amendments I have proposed do alter 
the bill.  I would ask my friends opposite who have proposed a 
subamendment to think about what my amendments in fact say 
because I do not believe that we are saying anything differently. 
I would ask them to consider the following points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I have proposed these amendments is that I have very 
specific concerns about the lack of a role for parliament, in 
particular the House of Commons, in the oversight of the centre 
established pursuant to the bill, and the limited accountability 
to parliament, in particular the House of Commons, on the part of 
the Minister of Finance for the centre's practices.  However that 
certainly is not a criticism of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendments attempt to redress what I would characterize as an 
undermining of what some would call backbenchers' rights by a 
bill that allows for too little accounting of actions undertaken 
in the name of Canadian citizens by the centre.  My amendments do 
not attempt to micromanage or second guess the daily activities 
of the centre.  They attempt to provide a role for members of 
parliament to monitor the means used by the centre to fulfil its 
mandate and also to enable members to scrutinize periodically the 
effectiveness of the policy that underlies Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first amendment modifies the reporting obligations of the 
centre's director.  As it now stands the director must submit an 
annual report to the Minister of Finance on the centre's 
operations for the preceding year.  The minister would then table 
the report to both houses of parliament within 30 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merely tabling the report in parliament does not provide members 
the opportunity to seriously consider the effectiveness of the 
centre's activities.  It does not enable them to question 
officials from the centre.  It does not permit members to monitor 
the centre for potentially abusive practices.  This is 
particularly troubling to me, given that some of the witnesses 
before the committee described the bill's breadth as excessive 
and the powers reserved for it as potentially sweeping. Legal 
experts testified that the danger of abuse of power is real and 
that the safeguards they foresaw in the bill might not be 
adequate to forestall such abuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment proposes an additional step to the formal report 
made under the current legislation to the Minister of Finance, 
that it be reviewed by an appropriate parliamentary committee.  I 
understand the desire of my friends opposite to have the bill say 
it is the House of Commons, but if we look at this, the amendment 
in fact says that it be reviewed by an appropriate parliamentary 
committee.  It could be designated as a committee of the House of 
Common.  It is very rare that a committee of the Senate would 
take upon itself such an activity.  It could be referred to a 
committee of parliament that has been established for that 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out to my friends opposite that the 
traditional role is for the finance committee to carry out those 
sorts of things. 
In some respects I can understand the fear they have that the 
Senate will come into this but our tradition shows that will not 
happen.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Requiring a committee to make a report of its own would 
obligate, I would suggest to my friends opposite, members of 
parliament to study the effectiveness of the centre.  It also 
would permit concerns to be addressed to the director of the 
centre and his officials as well as raise any problems that may 
not have been seen when the bill was created.  That is not a very 
radical idea. I am not in any way suggesting that members could 
ask who they are investigating, how they are investigating or 
anything of that nature.  It would simply be about where the 
money is going, how it is being spent and whether it is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also proposed changes that would add a sunset clause to 
the provisions that would give effect to the bill limiting those 
provisions to a period of five years, just like the Bank Act. To 
quote from the proposed amendment, the sunset clause would 
require a parliamentary committee to “undertake a comprehensive 
review of the act, the regulations and their administration and 
submit a report to parliament including any recommendations 
pertaining to the continuation of, or changes to, the act, the 
regulations or their administration that the committee wishes to 
make”.  This process already exists in the Bank Act.  It would 
have to be completed so that new re-enabling legislation could be 
introduced to parliament.  It is very simple.  It would have to 
be considered, voted and acted upon within five calendar years of 
the time that this act is given royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a provision would allow members of this place to further 
scrutinize all the aspects of the money laundering act.  The 
sunset provision would also allow changes to be made as new law 
enforcement techniques are discovered and more important, as 
different ways of money laundering emerge.  There will certainly 
be techniques and ways we cannot even foresee or imagine today 
especially with the emergence of electronic technology.  In 
short, I would call it a guard against statutory rust-out.  It is 
a Ziebart provision, if I can call it that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said at the beginning of my remarks that this bill undermines 
backbenchers' rights because we are creating it, giving it 
regulatory powers, and there is a reporting provision.  We know 
this is not the only piece of legislation that has short-circuited 
the rights of members in this place.  Over the past number of 
decades, we the backbenchers have witnessed a decline in means of 
participation in and influence on the great public policy 
debates.  We have little ability to influence new legislation as 
it is being drafted in the faraway reaches of this place.  Nor do 
we have a parliamentary committee structure that enables members 
to adequately influence the course of action taken or even to 
hold ministers to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become a common practice here to time allocate 
legislation so that it does not get bogged down in the House. 
While it is important to ensure against parliamentary gridlock, 
not having adequate time to debate legislation in some ways 
invalidates our roles as legislators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These impediments do not only have implications for our jobs as 
lawmakers or legislators.  Most important, it dangerously weakens 
the link between those who govern and those who are governed. 
Important questions about the true nature of democracy arise.  In 
a parliamentary democracy like ours, we as well as our leaders 
must be aware that the elected members of the House of Commons 
are the repositories of democracy in this country. We must at all 
times be aware of the fact that our obligations must remain to 
our constituents, to national objectives and the ability for us 
to ask the kinds of questions that are expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent times these obligations have become misplaced. 
Increasingly as a body we are giving up our ability to question, 
to debate and to propose changes to legislation.  By having the 
sunset clause we will bring that back to this place. The idea of 
depositing a report with the minister is fine and that minister's 
depositing it in this place is fine, but we need that other 
connection for us.  That is the ability to bring the person 
responsible before a committee of parliament and allow us from 
this place to ask those questions. 
A committee report on the table here does not allow debate, does 
not allow questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am simply saying that these amendments are not revolutionary. 
They just allow for the centre and its operations to be subject 
to the scrutiny of us in this place.  The way it stands, that is 
not the case. For the department to resist such an amendment is 
not the correct thing to do.  It enables us, the backbench 
members and those who will come here in the future to have some 
scrutiny of that operation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to Bill C-22, the money laundering act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report stage amendments have been very constructive and 
helpful in addressing some of the issues I raised when speaking 
to this legislation earlier.  The legislation without these types 
of constructive amendments would provide a carte blanche, a blank 
cheque to the new agency which has the ability to effectively 
pursue activities without any checks and balances and potentially 
persecute innocent Canadians in the course of its activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the interests of accountability and ensuring that the 
rights of all Canadians are respected and protected against all 
powerful institutions, particularly these new agencies, whether 
it is the Revenue Canada agency or this new money laundering 
agency.  We need to ensure that we in the House are vigilant in 
protecting the rights of each and every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My greatest concern, and I raised this when speaking to this 
legislation earlier, is that ultimately the money laundering 
agency would have the power to refer information on questionable 
cases to Revenue Canada.  If that is done only in cases where 
there are reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering is one 
thing.  However, if in a case where there may not be enough 
evidence to suggest money laundering activities but some evidence 
of tax evasion exists and the money laundering agency refers the 
matter to the Revenue Canada agency, that is a very different 
matter.  We need to ensure that with the combination of these two 
agencies we are not creating a turbocharged Revenue Canada agency 
that has a greater level of power to pursue and persecute 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern on the Revenue Canada agency as brought forth earlier 
was that it has the capacity to become an IRS style agency, 
Godzilla the tax collector.  The new money laundering agency 
could augment the powers of an unaccountable agency and make it 
even more frightening to the average Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accountability and transparency that would result from the 
amendments would go a long way to help address a fundamental flaw 
with the original legislation. I would hope that members in the 
House will support these amendments and will continue to monitor 
the activities of these agencies on an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to create a system of fear in Canada for the 
average taxpaying citizen that at the other end of the tax 
enforcement side we are actually creating a turbocharged Revenue 
Canada agency.  We do not want to tilt the balance against the 
average Canadian taxpayer who in the past has had to deal with 
Revenue Canada, now the new Revenue Canada agency, without a lot 
of defences.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, with the new money laundering agency, anything we can do 
to ensure that its activities are held accountable by some means, 
in this case by reporting and by some independent analysis and 
parliamentary reporting and so on, that will all help take the 
necessary steps in the right direction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, when I made the amendment on 
Motion No. 8 I did not realize we were speaking on all the 
motions.  With the indulgence of the House, I wonder if I could 
speak to Motion No. 8, the motion by the member for Charlesbourg. 
With some compromise on the government side, we were able to 
accommodate his amendment which has been dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The parliamentary 
secretary has already spoken to this group, I believe.  We can 
seek the consent of the House for you to proceed.  Does the hon. 
member have the unanimous consent of the House to speak at this 
point? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Madam Speaker, the bill already requires 
that the director of the anti-money laundering centre submit an 
annual report to the minister and that the minister table a copy 
of the report in each House of parliament. This is a 
fundamentally important accountability measure in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view there was no need to add a provision that would 
require the centre's annual report to be reviewed by a committee 
of parliament.  Parliamentary committees have the right to 
conduct such a review as they see fit.  The motion would merely 
create a rigid procedure and timetable for parliamentary review 
without doing anything to strengthen the accountability of the 
centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 9, we were prepared to accommodate 
the member for Sarnia—Lambton with an amendment that would 
strike out the words “and the operations of the centre”. 
Unfortunately we cannot support the subamendment by the member 
for Charlesbourg to replace the word “parliament” with “House 
of Commons”.   Unfortunately, we also cannot support the motion 
by the member for Sarnia—Lambton because we cannot support the 
subamendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 10, the Privacy Act authorizes the 
privacy commissioner to investigate the centre to ensure that the 
confidentiality of personal information is being properly 
protected.  The proposed amendment would not therefore provide 
any additional safeguards.  For this reason, I do not support the 
proposed amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do believe there is merit in having the director 
report in some fashion on the very important matter of 
confidentiality.  That is why we accepted some revised language 
to Motion No. 8 which would call for the centre to describe its 
policies and practices as it relates to the privacy of 
information of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with respect to Motion No. 11, I believe that the bill 
as currently drafted strikes the right balance by requiring that 
within five years of coming into force a committee of parliament 
review “the administration and operation of this act” and 
report to parliament.  Clause 72 also explicitly requires that 
the committee's report to parliament include a statement of any 
changes to the act or its administration that the committee 
recommends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing provision in the bill will ensure that parliament 
will re-examine this legislation carefully within five years with 
a view to considering possible changes to improve Canada's 
anti-money laundering regime.  This is appropriate given the 
importance of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that anything would be gained by the amendment 
proposed by the member for Sarnia—Lambton to the five year 
review clause in this bill because the bill is already going to 
be reviewed by parliament within five years.  I also cannot 
support the subamendment by the member for Charlesbourg to strike 
out the word “parliament”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, we continue with the saga of pulling the bill 
together with amendments, subamendments, everything happening at 
the last minute and negotiations happening even at 11 hours and 
59 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I continue to feel a sense of distress over this bill.  We all 
want the bill to go through so I am begrudgingly recommending to 
my colleagues that we support these motions.  However, there has 
been so much chewing gum, baling wire and paper clips put to this 
bill at this particular point I do not have a lot of confidence 
that we will not see a big problem in three or four years after 
this bill comes into effect.  I am very concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to Group No. 3 specifically.  I will also comment 
on Motion No. 9 by my esteemed colleague from Sarnia, and I say 
that in all seriousness.  I take him to be a very serious and 
competent gentleman.  He has certainly put some very legitimate 
concerns in front of the House and has a deep concern about this 
bill.  He is a very serious and worthy member of parliament but 
the problem with his motion is the phrase “and the operations of 
the centre” contained in that motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why I prefaced my remarks yet again with this business of 
negotiating at the last second is that if in the procedure the 
government had seen fit to remove that or to propose an amendment 
to move that, then my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois could 
then have entered the motion that he has before the Chamber. The 
point is that we have to deal with his motion and we could have 
dealt with the motion against this wording and the operations of 
the centre.  It could have happened and we could have had a 
clause in this bill that would have in its own small way gone to 
strengthening the bill.  Unfortunately that did not happen.  As a 
consequence, because the member's motion includes those six words 
“and the operations of the centre”, I will have to recommend to 
my colleagues that we turn down an otherwise worthy amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the member for Charlesbourg, for whom I also 
have a great deal of respect, I understand what he is trying to 
do in terms of talking about parliament as opposed to the 
government and the whole attitude that there is vis-à-vis the 
Senate.  The Canadian Alliance is certainly in favour of a total 
revision of the Senate before we afford it perhaps the kind of 
respect that a chamber like that should have.  However, because 
we want to get this bill through quickly and come up to speed, in 
spite of the three year delay on the part of the government, I 
would have to vote against revising the Senate for the very 
simple reason that we will not have any constitutional change. We 
will certainly not have this Prime Minister do anything about the 
Senate.  This would have to be included in the motion which we 
will have to defeat.   This is terribly confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 11 the Canadian Alliance generally would be in 
favour of sunset clauses.  As a matter of fact, we have proposed 
them for bills like Bill C-68 and other very contentious bills 
that have no proven value.  Just to parenthesize that particular 
bill is completely off track.  It is costing hundreds of millions 
of dollars and going nowhere.  There is no sunset clause.  Under 
normal circumstances our party would be in favour of a sunset 
clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fact that this bill, as written by the government, 
does call for a review in five years, and the fact that money 
laundering will not go away in the next five years, I do not 
think this particular motion would be at all helpful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise at the 
third reading of Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank members for their co-operation and their 
indulgence.  We have dealt with a number of amendments that were 
presented just days ago, or in some cases hours, and I think we 
have accommodated a number of the concerns of the members who 
proposed amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness to Canadians who are watching this debate, the 
substance of the bill is sound and the amendments will add 
further clarity to the reporting mechanisms.  The amendments will 
certainly add value to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view it is important that the bill be sent to the Senate 
and promulgated so that law enforcement agencies and financial 
institutions can finalize the development of the regulations and 
the guidelines that will set this initiative into motion as 
quickly as possible.  We know that money laundering will not go 
away.  What we are trying to do with this legislation is curtail 
the growth and decrease the levels of activity that are prevalent 
in Canada and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been extensive consultations, not only at committee, 
but with a number of stakeholder groups.  Bill C-22 provides a 
statutory minimum 90 day pre-publication requirement for any 
regulation proposed under the legislation and a minimum 30 day 
notice period if further changes are to be made.  This goes well 
beyond what is provided in many federal statutes and reflects the 
importance that the government attaches to public consultations 
in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, the House should know about the guidelines 
that will be given the institutions and the people, who, in 
order to meet the reporting requirements of this bill, must 
establish the existence of reasonable grounds to suspect that 
the transaction is related to the commission of a money 
laundering offence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we explained at committee, the guidelines will be issued by 
the proposed anti-money laundering agency to assist with that 
determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flexibility will be the key word in developing the guidelines 
and regulations.  The money launderers of this world are 
constantly changing their modus operandi.  They are constantly 
moving into new areas of activity.  Therefore, we need to have 
some flexibility within the regulations and guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, there will need to be some clear rules around the 
professions.  If an accountant or an auditor is doing a regular 
attest audit and he or she comes across what might be a suspicious 
transaction, the legislation does not put the burden on that 
person to report it.  That would create an unnecessary burden. 
However, if that person becomes party to a financial transaction 
which involves a suspicious activity or an amount of money 
defined by regulation, that person is obliged to comply with the 
legislation.  In the normal conduct of professional activities 
that would not be required.  This will be spelled out in the 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our other G-7 partners are devoting considerable resources and 
energies to combatting money laundering activities.  With this 
law we will do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee we heard very strong representations from lawyers 
in terms of solicitor-client privilege.  The bill specifically 
calls for respecting solicitor-client privilege.  However, we 
cannot allow the opportunity for lawyers who might be involved in 
transactions involving money laundering operations to be exempt 
on the grounds of solicitor-client privilege.  That aspect of 
this law will be very similar to the law in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 targets the financial rewards of criminal activity by 
creating a balanced and effective reporting regime. It protects 
the integrity of our financial systems and enables Canada to meet 
its international obligations while protecting individual 
privacy.  We will have an effective money laundering system in 
place to ensure that Canada fulfils its responsibility both as 
the founding member of the financial action task force on money 
laundering and as a member of the G-8 to co-operate in the 
international fight against money laundering. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are we joining with other members of the financial 
action task force on money laundering in order to make the 
reporting of dubious operations mandatory, but our system of 
reporting will now be equal to that of most of the 
industrialized countries, including the other members of the G-7, 
most European countries and many of our Commonwealth partners, 
such as Australia and New Zealand. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us waste no time in passing this legislation.  I urge all 
hon. members to accord this bill speedy passage, as we have done 
to date.  Let us pass this legislation so that Canadians can be 
protected from money laundering activities.

deeply interested in this debate, which has a major impact on 
Canadians and Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I cannot help but deplore, once again, the fact 
that the committee had to rush its examination of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the last witnesses on Wednesday night at 5 p.m. or 5.30 
p.m., and we had to sit the next morning at 9 a.m. to begin the 
clause by clause review of the bill. It is easy to understand 
that, after hearing interesting evidence, very intelligent and 
well documented evidence, members should have been given a 
little time to weigh this evidence and come up with amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this was just before our two week recess. We had 
some time to digest all of this, and we came up with amendments 
that passed. 
I hope this will serve us a lesson to ensure that, if we really 
want to give witnesses who appeared the credit, I would say, 
that they deserve, the least the hon. members could do is take 
the time to assimilate and to re-read their testimonies. The 
quality of witnesses who appeared before the Standing Committee 
on Finance concerning Bill C-22 was particularly impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not tell members of the House that 
the Bloc Quebecois has probably the most intelligent, balanced, 
concrete and imaginative anti-crime agenda of all political 
parties represented in the House. It is an anti-crime agenda that 
does not fall into populism, into demagogy, and I think we can 
see the result with Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind hon. members that the 1997 election platform of 
the Bloc Quebecois—I know this is almost bedtime reading to you, 
Madam Speaker—provided for and clearly asked for such a measure 
to fight money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, as early as 1997, even before the federal government 
introduced Bill C-22 and its doomed predecessor, Bill C-81, the 
Bloc Quebecois was already working on this issue, holding 
numerous intensive meetings with different crime fighting 
agencies. This is only one example. We could give others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, I introduced a bill to take $1,000 bills out of 
circulation. The federal government decided to listen to the 
Bloc Quebecois and to take them out of circulation to fight 
money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spent a full opposition day trying to get all the 
parliamentarians in this House to agree to have the Standing 
Committee on Justice look into the problem of organized crime in 
Canada. It is a third victory for the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three victories are quite impressive. I would be remiss—and 
I am pretty sure that all the members would hold it against me—if 
I overlooked the relentless campaign against organized crime 
that the member for Bagot is engaged in, despite all the risks 
involved, particularly in his region where farmers live in fear, 
terrorized by criminal groups who grow marijuana in their corn 
fields and other fields. It deserves the support of all members 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were four specific actions taken by the Bloc, and we 
claimed victory on three of them. 
Of course, when we hear the clever and convincing arguments 
brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois, it is hard to imagine 
that the House would decide not to follow the lead of the Bloc 
on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to Bill C-22 per se, and I repeat that it was an 
original idea of the Bloc, it is important to mention that it is 
indeed an obligation, as the parliamentary secretary for the 
minister of Finance said, an international obligation for Canada 
to fight this worldwide phenomenon known as money laundering. 
Canada meets its obligations in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, this is a good bill. The amendments proposed, 
again, by the Bloc Quebecois bring some pretty major 
improvements to the bill. I see a number of people agreeing with 
that. The regulative jurisdiction is one of the main problems of 
this bill. 
It was extremely broad, and one can understand the logic of all 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The centre that will be created under this bill will have to be 
flexible. Indeed, considering the ever changing new technology, 
it will have to be able to adjust very quickly. This is why the 
regulatory power is very broad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to ensure that not only would the Access to 
Information Act and the Privacy Act apply, but also that 
parliamentarians would be properly informed about the centre's 
operations. 
This is why I moved Motion No. 8, which was carried with an 
amendment, but which still ensures that the policies and 
benchmarks set by the centre are known by members of the House, 
who are ultimately accountable to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deals, among other things, with the issue of privacy. 
Given today's technology, that issue can raise some concerns and 
this is understandable. It is therefore important to give 
elected members of the House, who are the only ones accountable 
to the public, at least an opportunity to understand and the 
authority to ask what is going on in a centre that could 
potentially have excessive powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the House, and particularly the Bloc Quebecois, 
which promoted the idea of fighting money laundering and of 
reporting suspicious transactions over $10,000. 
This great victory for the Bloc Quebecois is made even sweeter 
by the fact that several of our amendments were accepted by the 
House, and for good reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the House showed great wisdom in supporting the 
amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. I congratulate the 
House, and particularly the Bloc Quebecois for its excellent 
work in the fight against crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, this is possibly the strangest bill I have ever 
had anything to do with in the eight years I have had the 
privilege of serving the people of Kootenay—Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the solicitor general critic I am fully aware of the 
consequences of the bill.  It will be used basically as a highly 
sophisticated sieve to be able to look at countless billions of 
dollars of transactions literally on a daily basis.  The bill is 
a highly sophisticated response to a highly sophisticated 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one presentation during the course of our committee work the 
law enforcement people showed us a graph with three different 
pictures.  When we first looked at it, it appeared as though 
there was a yellow sun approximately 30 inches in diameter and 
there were some notations around its perimeter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we looked very closely at it, we realized they were all 
simply lines.  It was much like taking the wrapping off a golf 
ball and looking at how the elastic band was wound on it. Another 
section showed a bit closer that indeed they were lines, but they 
were so complex that it was difficult to perceive any kind of 
pattern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A smaller section was blown up to the same size as the original 
sun and we could see the number of transactions by organized 
crime they had traced in this one instance to take a look at the 
money coming in from illegal activities that are dragging down 
society such as drugs, prostitution and so on.  Those activities 
were detailed in the study by this law enforcement organization. 
Of everything I saw, the graph was the most graphic illustration 
of what we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the ability because of the power of computers to 
enact all sorts of transactions and exceptionally sophisticated 
transactions on the part of organized crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been exceptionally critical, and I think rightfully so, 
of the solicitor general, the finance minister, the Prime 
Minister and the government for the fact that they have strangled 
the ability of law enforcement agencies in Canada to come even 
close to the level of sophistication of which even the most 
rudimentary organized crime units are capable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only organized crime.  We are also talking about the 
laundering of money, much of which ends up sticking to the 
fingers of people involved in terrorism. The new immigrants to 
Canada, the people who come here to help us build our great 
nation, the people who see the opportunity and seize it, are most 
disadvantaged by the fact that the Liberal government 
consistently strangles the ability of law enforcement to get to 
the bottom of terrible terrorist organizations that not only 
plague the world but indeed individuals in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speed by which the legislation is going through the House 
today and over the last couple of days is well warranted.  It is 
something we desperately need to do, but we put that against the 
fact that over the last three years the government has dillied 
and dallied. It has dragged its feet and has not got around to 
giving us the necessary legislation.  In just a second I will 
describe the process that led up to the point where the 
government finally brought the legislation to the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the legislation has been subjected to crass 
opportunism on the part of the Liberal government which sees this 
Chamber and the work of the people here as being worthy of 
nothing more than being treated as though it were a rubber stamp, 
as though we do not have a function in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected in my constituency not just to represent the 
people there.  Along with the other 300 members in the House of 
Commons, we were collectively elected to come here to work on 
behalf of the people of Canada.  I find it absolutely appalling 
that the government continuously treats the opposition and this 
Chamber as though it was a matter of yet another rubber stamp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give an example.  I am deeply concerned that the bill will 
be so egregiously flawed that we will run into the problems in 
two, three or four years after the bill is enacted and the centre 
gets going.  We will find all sorts of flaws because of the 
terribly bad process it has gone through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have spoken during report stage about the number of things 
that were going on in the background.  First, we ended up with 
negotiations between all parties on a work schedule.  The 
government will say that the work schedule for the committee was 
on the basis that we would be hearing witnesses up to a 
particular point.  The hearing of witnesses was to close at 5.30 
p.m. one day and at 9 a.m. the next day we would start clause by 
clause consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are not familiar with how bills go through the 
House of Commons, clause by clause is exactly that.  Every law is 
made up of any number of clauses to a bill.  The number of 
clauses can be as few as two or three.  In most instances there 
are 100 or more clauses to a bill.  Those describe in great 
detail so that judges, law enforcement officials and interested 
Canadians can see what the intent was of the people in this 
Chamber with respect to any kind of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go through clause by clause on any bill there is the 
government side and, depending on how contentious the bill may 
be, there is the opposition that will then debate each word, each 
parse, each phrase and each piece of punctuation to make sure 
that it is indeed the way the government wants it.  Of course at 
the end of the day the government will prevail. 
That is the parliamentary process.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in this instance was we had a number of very 
interesting witnesses who gave all of us pause for concern.  They 
made us stop and realize that we have to make sure that our 
Canadian legislation reflects the values within the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A witness, a law enforcement official from the U.K., gave us 
illustrations.  I asked him some questions about his 
illustrations on what was being done in the U.K.  We very clearly 
discovered that if we are going to have the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, every piece of legislation has to match it. 
Therefore the bill was working around the restrictions of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that many of our 
ancestors or relatives of our ancestors currently living in the 
U.K. do not have to work around. We realize in every jurisdiction 
in all of the G-7 countries and any of the signatories to any of 
the agreements with respect to money laundering that there will 
be different platforms that legislation will be working from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to different professional agencies.  We listened to 
businesses that were going to be affected by the legislation.  We 
had some very thoughtful presentations from most of the 
presenters.  One or two of the presenters we collectively found 
were a bit over the top but that is fine. That is their right and 
their privilege to come before us in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Against the 2,000 or 3,000 lawyers the government has in the 
justice department, the solicitor general's department, the 
finance department, every government department, against the 
2,000 lawyers the government has on its side who could be taking 
apart this testimony, the official opposition has one lawyer. 
Count him.  There is one lawyer who is basically responsible for 
three different ministries, that is 2,000 to one in terms of 
strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge that the work schedule was agreed to by all 
parties, my party included, but when we came to the conclusion of 
this process it was very evident that the work schedule was no 
longer workable.  That we were going to be hearing witnesses at 
5.30 p.m. on Wednesday and at nine o'clock in the morning on 
Thursday we were supposed to be prepared to do clause by clause 
study was clearly and specifically unworkable. I drew that to the 
attention of the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In good faith I went to that committee session. My colleague 
from Charlesbourg went to that meeting.  We both basically said 
that we needed more time.  The member from Sarnia who was at the 
meeting actually put forward a motion that we needed to have time 
over the two week parliamentary break when members are at home 
working with their constituents. That period of time would give 
our lawyer an opportunity to take a look at the testimony and to 
parse it to see how it related to all of the clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government saw fit to vote down the motion put forward by 
the member from Sarnia over the objections of three members of 
the opposition.  Therefore we did not take part in the clause by 
clause study.  The reason I did not take part in the clause by 
clause study was that quite candidly I was not prepared.  I have 
not received counsel. This is an exceptionally complex bill.  I 
say again it is going to screen countless billions and billions 
of currency in and out of Canada. I wanted to be prepared. There 
was no way I could be prepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us fast forward to bringing this matter to the Chamber 
yesterday. What a disgraceful display that was.  This was brought 
into the Chamber yesterday while we were still in the process of 
discussions.  As a matter of fact I recall the clerk at the table 
stood to introduce Group No. 1 and the Speaker at the time began 
to read the motions.  We were all running back to our seats 
halfway through negotiations as to how we were going to be 
handling the various amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got into the process and then the Liberals ended up 
discussing things with the Bloc Quebecois, which is entirely 
their privilege.  I do not think much of that myself but I do 
think very much of the fact that I represent Her Majesty's 
Official Opposition. 
We were left out of any discussions of that type.  All of a 
sudden the government was presenting motions to the Chair which 
the Chair could not receive.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say for the third or fourth time this bill is basically 
responsible for acting like a highly sophisticated sieve 
involving countless billions of dollars on a daily basis and we 
are running around giving motions from the Government of Canada 
that the Chair cannot receive.  It is no wonder I asked that the 
debate be adjourned.  It was only logical.  It gave the 
government an opportunity to get a breather. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a disgraceful display for a government of a G-7 nation to 
come forward with this kind of vital legislation and to do it in 
such a slipshod way.  It has been the height of folly.  It has 
been absolutely frustrating to try to perform my duties on behalf 
of Her Majesty's Official Opposition when we have seen this type 
of chewing gum and baling wire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out on Group No. 3 that was just passed, again the 
government member from Sarnia presented a motion to amend the 
bill as written.  That is what can happen at report stage, just 
so the people who are not familiar with the parliamentary process 
understand.  That motion actually had some merit.  I think it 
would have strengthened the bill not in a large way but certainly 
in a small way, and for something as sophisticated as this bill 
every little small part helps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  The member included a phrase that unfortunately 
was unworkable.  The phrase would have caused a situation where 
the centre that will be doing the work would have to reveal far 
too much detail in public, and I understand that.  My 
understanding in conversation with the member from Sarnia is that 
there had been agreement that he would agree to the removal of 
that phrase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Charlesbourg for his own very good reasons 
brought forward an amendment.  He wanted to remove the word 
“government” and insert the word “parliament” thereby 
freezing the Senate out of the ability of being involved in the 
five year review of this.  This is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the government been on the ball, and I drew it to the 
attention of certain government members at the time, and had it 
inserted the amendment to the motion by the member from Sarnia 
and then my colleague had put his subamendment, we could have had 
that improvement to the legislation in the bill.  This just 
happened within the last hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the government was remiss and did not do that.  As a 
consequence, as we voted down the amendment by the member for 
Charlesbourg, we closed off the ability to make the necessary 
amendment for that improvement to the bill. I just despair for 
this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not been involved in a lot of the legislation that has 
gone through the House in terms of shepherding it through the 
House for Her Majesty's Official Opposition.  I have not been as 
involved in the detail.  Heaven forbid that the the process on 
every piece of legislation is as messed up as the process that 
was involved in this piece of legislation has been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize we are reaching the time when the Speaker will tell 
us it is time for members' statements. I will want to complete my 
speech following question period.  I will conclude this portion 
without talking about the substance of the bill, which I will 
happily do following question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I state again that I have the greatest feeling of despair for 
this piece of legislation because of the fatally flawed process 
through which it has rumbled through this Chamber. 
This is where the Senate does come in.  God bless their souls 
over there.  They do have the ability to take a look at this 
legislation.  Hopefully they will not go through as badly flawed 
a process.

lightning and wants to get this bill enacted finally after three 
years.  I would hope that if the Senate comes forward with 
meaningful amendments the government will not take those as 
hostile and that we will not be involved in another seriously 
flawed process in the event that the bill ends up coming back 
from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, of course you are absolutely 
correct that you still have close to 22 minutes. I am sure it 
will fit in with your plan to give us the second half of your 
talk today.

ending up with egg on her face after a recent announcement that 
her useless gun registry is doing something about reducing 
firearms crime in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bit of an investigation revealed that she has not even 
bothered to put into force the part of Bill C-68 that requires 
guns entering the country to be registered.  If the minister 
believes the registry is so important, why was the entire 
shipment of World War II army rifles, which she says was a threat 
to public safety, knowingly waved through Canada customs without 
even being registered? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP advised me that Canada customs does not even tell the 
registrar about the guns coming across the border.  The 
minister's own research shows that between 200,000 and 300,000 
firearms enter Canada illegally each year but are never 
registered because the minister has not put into force 
legislation passed in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone should be wondering why the minister waited for a

the past 18 years, over 6,000 animals have been killed by trains, 
cars and trucks in Jasper, Banff, Yoho and Kootenay National 
Parks.  The victims include grizzly bears, a species classified 
as vulnerable in Canada, mountain lions, bighorn sheep and

spilled by trains.  Then we have bighorn sheep and mountain lions 
taking refuge inside the Brulé Tunnel near Jasper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are solutions to stopping this wildlife carnage in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Minister of Finance said that if taxes were higher 
in Quebec it was because a sovereignist government was in power. 
Perhaps the minister, the pretender to the Liberal throne, has 
forgotten that the federalists, his Liberal cousins, were the 
ones to have taxed Quebecers so heavily, while Bernard Landry is 
lowering taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps too, taxes are so high in Toronto because the mayor 
there is a sovereignist? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or perhaps taxes are higher in Quebec than in Ontario because of 
the $2 billion shortfall in constructive spending by his 
government?   Or because of the refusal to compensate Quebec in 
the amount of $2 billion for the harmonization of the GST with 
the QST?  Or the cuts to transfers, a very large portion of which 
fell to Quebec?  Or because the Quebec tax system is much more 
generous than anywhere else in Canada to the disadvantaged, 
students, seniors and low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or perhaps it is because the Minister of Finance is a Liberal, a 
federalist and rich that the level of taxation by his government 
requires certain shipowners, including himself, to sail under 
foreign flag in order to avoid paying tax in Canada?

simple measures to ensure reservists' jobs would be protected 
while they are defending the interests of our country.

that they never even saw the final review.  She did not seem to 
care about it because four days later, on February 6, she

managers as accountable for specific tasks and clearly states 
commitments and deadlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deloitte & Touche said that the draft plan did not assign 
overall leadership and responsibility for implementing the plan,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, an RCMP officer 
reported that there was a total lack of co-operation between the 
RCMP and the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, and he even said 
that the RCMP had its hands tied regarding CINAR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government explain the statements made by the 
Minister of National Revenue, who boasts about the great 
co-operation between his department and the RCMP? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can assure my hon. colleague that there 
is excellent co-operation between the RCMP and this department. 
There are certain regulations that must be followed and they are 
being followed.  There is excellent co-operation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we must have misunderstood the RCMP officer, who said yesterday 
that his hands were tied, that there was a total lack of 
co-operation and that they had reached an impasse. I imagine it 
is the minister who has the hot potato in his hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister explain that this government, which asked 
the Swiss government to violate the financial discretion rule in 
the Airbus case, is now doing its utmost to prevent any light 
being shed on CINAR, thus allowing, perhaps, some key players to 
get away with what they did? Perhaps these people are also 
friends of the Liberal Party.

<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government is not preventing anything 
from taking place.  What this government and every government 
does is let the RCMP do its job.  There are laws and regulations 
in this country concerning what information can or cannot be 
released.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, RCMP officer Pierre-Yves Carrier said that matters 
were at a complete impasse in the investigation into the CINAR 
affair and that he would be able to complete only two-thirds of 
his investigation because of the Department of National 
Revenue's lack of co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister realize that because of the impasse created by 
the department's lack of co-operation, the RCMP, as we heard 
yesterday from officer Pierre-Yves Carrier, may miss important 
players in its investigation?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I just said, there is full 
co-operation.  I am certain that Bloc Quebecois members will 
understand—and if they need proof, they can perhaps ask the 
member for Chambly, who certainly understands that it is 
important to maintain confidentiality in revenue files—that there 
are Canadian laws in place that are still respected by the 
agency and the RCMP. 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if Bloc Quebecois members had not asked questions about CINAR in 
the House, if journalists had not probed deeper, if an RCMP 
officer had not raised the alarm on television, there is a good 
chance that none of this would have come to light and that, 
consequently, nothing would have been done to put a stop to 
these dubious practices.  Ms. Charest would probably still be 
hosting benefit dinners for the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who does the government want to protect?  What important players 
may be missed because of the lack of co-operation of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

completely unjustified.  The Bloc Quebecois member opposite, 
like most Canadians I am sure, knows that these accusations are 
false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada and the Canada Customs and Revenue

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  Bill 11 is now in 
its final form in Alberta.  The government is faced with a bill 
that has not been amended in the way that the federal Minister of 
Health requested.  Many would say that Premier Klein has 
sentenced medicare to death.  The only power in the country that 
can commute that sentence is the federal government acting 
decisively to make sure that bill 11 is not implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, what does the federal government 
intend to do to make sure that medicare does not die on its 
watch? 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we will uphold and enforce the Canada Health Act.  We 
have been proud of our creation of medicare and we will ensure 
that it continues.  We will oppose the concept of two tier 
medicine which is being promoted, it appears, by the Klein 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister could tell us then 
whether that means that in his view bill 11 violates the Canada 
Health Act and sanctions on the part of the federal government 
will be forthcoming.  Could he be clear about that?  Time is of 
the essence with respect to the possible NAFTA implications.  Has 
the federal government, whether in the department of justice or 
trade or health, or somewhere, arrived at a point of view with 
respect to the NAFTA implications of bill 11?  Albertans and all 
Canadians deserve to know this before the bill is passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Health has written to the Alberta 
minister of health setting out views on bill 11 and what should 
be done with it.  The important thing is that we are committed to 
upholding and enforcing the Canada Health Act.  All should take 
note of our commitment in this regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in order to complete renovations on the parliament buildings, 
public works purchased and renovated the St. Andrew's tower and 
the East Memorial Building at a cost of $89 million.  It then 
began spending $9 million to renovate the justice building so 
that MPs could be moved in while the House of Commons was worked 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the minister delayed this work for at least two years, 
at an additional cost of $90 million? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I understand the 
question of the hon. member, there has been no delay.  Work on 
the justice building is going as planned.  Because of the new 
communication technology that all members of parliament enjoy we 
want to make sure that such tools of communication are installed 
in the justice building before the building is turned over to 
you, Mr. Speaker, and members of parliament.  Work is going 
according to schedule. 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the justice building was supposed to have been completed 
last summer; not this year, not next year, last summer.  Instead, 
it will sit empty until the summer of 2001.

parliamentary renovations can proceed on time and on budget? 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

sure that when members of parliament move to the building they 
can have the same installation and accommodation as they have in 
the existing building.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

telling the House that she changed her six point plan to correct 
the serious deficiencies pointed out by Deloitte & Touche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The firm told the House committee on Monday that the minister's 
department assured them that the final plan incorporated Deloitte 
& Touche's recommendations.  I ask her to explain why a 
comparison of the January version with the final version clearly 
shows that the recommendations were not dealt with in any 
meaningful way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is incorrect.  The 
recommendations of Deloitte & Touche were incorporated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting here is I recall that the hon. member, when 
asked by the media about the six point plan, said it is something 
that should have been implemented a long time ago. Does she think 
differently now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  The minister uses the credibility of 
Deloitte & Touche, but the fact is that the firm never saw the 
final draft of her plan.  The minister never even let on to 
anyone that they gave her plan a failing grade, the plan that she 
was bragging about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister now says their advice was incorporated but there is 
nothing to back that up.  Deloitte & Touche were obviously 
disapproving of the first draft.  Why did the minister not make 
sure they were satisfied with the final version before using 
their name as an endorsement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Deloitte & Touche was contracted to give 
us advice on the draft.  They did that.  We implemented their 
recommendations and the auditor general, having seen the final 
plan, endorsed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I would like to point out yet again is that on 
February 10 I presented that plan to the committee and I asked 
for committee members to make any further recommendations they 
would like to see in that action plan.  I received no 
recommendations from that party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the six point plan on the website did not mention 
anything about incorporating the advice of Deloitte & Touche.

the website they would. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have read it very carefully side by side.  There 
is no material difference from the draft to the final version. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deloitte & Touche recommended this.  They said “the draft plan 
does not clearly assign leadership and responsibility.  It does 
not clearly assign to specific individuals the actions they are 
responsible for.  It does not establish timelines, deliverables 
and milestones.  It does not identify the systems and practices 
needed to monitor progress”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not in the final six point plan.  If the minister is

Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not disagree with my hon. friend with

gave us last fall.  It was incorporated into the deal with Air 
Canada which is being enshrined in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that there will be real competition as a result of

most of the shares will be owned by Canadians and control will 
not go to any one group larger than 15%.

serious problems can arise from Canada's participation in this

is participating in the system at the moment.

has been no decision with respect to deployment by the United

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

strategy.  In fact the file is moving.

summary in his sleep. To quote from the Friends of Maritime 
Aviation's statement, “We now believe the elastic band has been 
stretched as far as it can go”.

they are dangerous or they are unsafe, but there is no doubt 
about it that we are fast approaching that critical point”. They 
are not saying that it is at that point now.

more than 1,000 fish plant workers on the Acadian peninsula were

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  Would

of Commons on December 15, 1999.  The broad purpose of the bill 
is to remedy shortcomings in Canada's anti-money laundering 
legislation, as identified by the G-7's Financial Action Task 
Force, FATF, on Money Laundering in its 1997-98 report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a quote from that report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only major weakness is the inability to effectively and 
efficiently respond to requests for assistance in relation to 
restraint and forfeiture.  The use of domestic money laundering 
proceedings to seize, restrain, (and) forfeit the proceeds of 
offences committed in other countries is recognized as sometimes 
ineffective, and legislation to allow Canada to enforce foreign 
forfeiture requests directly should be introduced. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the FATF recommended that reporting requirements in 
Canada be made mandatory, rather than voluntary, as is currently 
the case, and that a “financial intelligence unit” be 
established “to deal with the collection, management and 
analysis and dissemination of suspicious transactions, reports 
and other relevant intelligence data”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean to the ordinary citizen either watching 
these proceedings on televisions or reading these proceedings in 
<I>Hansard</I>?  First, this activity is a criminal activity.  It 
basically undermines Canada's financial and social systems by 
increasing the power and influence of illegal business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts estimate that some $300 billion to $500 billion in 
criminally derived funds enter the international markets 
annually.  In Canada alone the estimates range from $5 billion to 
$17 billion.  The fact that they range from $5 billion to $17 
billion gives me cause for concern.  That being such a broad 
spread, it is very clear that even our law enforcement officials 
have not really been able to quantify this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many ways to launder money, including through 
financial institutions, foreign exchange dealers, significant 
cash purchases, brokerage houses, foreign tax havens and 
cross-border transfers.  The methods of laundering money are 
becoming more and more sophisticated, as I indicated in my 
remarks before question period.  Indeed, many of the transactions 
are so immensely complex that there is no possible way, other 
than with the power of the most high powered computer programmed 
to do this, that we could actually conduct the kind of 
transactions that are currently being undertaken by criminal 
activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is viewed, real or otherwise—and I think it is 
real—as having weak controls, we become a haven for organized 
crime and money laundering.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second reading of this, I drew to the attention of the 
House the situation with YBM Magnex, which turned out to be a 
money laundering operation for the Russian mafia, and the fact 
that there were many prominent Canadians, names people would 
know, who ended up being sucked into that vortex.  Six hundred 
million dollars disappeared as a result of YBM Magnex being a 
money laundering operation and getting by the Ontario Securities 
Commission and other organizations like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the situation of the $6 billion Bre-X debacle and 
put the YBM Magnex on the back side of that, we can see why 
people around the world are deeply concerned about the lax 
attitude that Canada has displayed in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I also indicated prior to question period, it is not just the 
issue of organized crime.  There are also violent street gangs in 
Toronto and Montreal that are channelling criminal profits to 
tamil terrorists waging a bloody fight for an independent 
homeland in Sri Lanka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to an RCMP intelligence report that was reported in 
the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> on March 27 this year, it said that an 
extensive probe by the Mounties found strong connections between 
outlaw gangs and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam, one of the 
world's most dangerous groups.  “There is clear evidence to 
support the relationship and that the money involved is being 
funnelled to the LTTE for extremist purposes in Sri Lanka”, says 
the newly classified report obtained through access to 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people who come Canada as legitimate landed immigrants are 
here to help us build our great nation.  These people come to 
this country looking at it as being a law-abiding country where 
they can live in peace and harmony with their neighbours.  They 
come to this country looking at the opportunities that they have 
to advance the fortunes of their own families.  They come to this 
country as a haven of peace.  However, because of the laxity of 
this government and its slowness to bring either dollar resources 
or necessary legislation like this piece of legislation into 
effect, law enforcement is unable to protect those very people 
who come to this country to help us build this great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on the government, particularly for its delay in bringing 
this legislation to the House of Commons, if only for that 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP implicate the tamil criminal groups in a staggering 
variety of activities, including extortion, home invasion, 
attempted murder, theft, importation and sale of brown heroine, 
arms trafficking, production and sale of counterfeit passports, 
migrant smuggling, bank and casino fraud and money laundering. 
This is from an RCMP security intelligence report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes on to say that the activity is escalating and 
will likely become more difficult for police.  It also says that 
there are other armed conflicts and hot spots in the world where 
there are allegations of smuggling profits that finance military 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we, as Canadians, whether we are recently landed 
immigrants or our families have been here for a long time, should 
care about this piece of legislation.  Money laundering feeds 
armed conflicts and illegal activities that threaten everything 
from our families to our society, our national and international 
economies and perhaps even world peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act establishes a financial transactions and reports 
analysis centre to receive the reports.  Under normal 
circumstances, as a Canadian Alliance MP, I would be opposed to 
the enactment of any legislation that would set up yet another 
analysis centre or another way to have more bureaucrats. However, 
in this particular instance, the independence of the financial 
transactions and reports analysis centre is absolutely critical 
because of the level of expertise to track these transactions 
that were described earlier. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of expertise to analyze the reports as they come out 
of the data that will be collected is very specialized.  However 
there is the whole problem of personal security, the security all 
Canadians have from unreasonable search and seizure and big 
brother overlooking our shoulders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this instance what we are doing under this bill is to 
establish the financial transactions report analysis centre 
totally apart from our enforcement agencies so that all 
transactions will end up going through a highly sophisticated 
microscopic sieve.  From that sieve and from the entrails that 
come out of the money flowing through it, skilled analysis will 
say that we should be looking at this track of money or that 
track of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this will work, as I understand the legislation, is that 
then there would be a report to law enforcement agencies to say 
here is something they might want to take a look at.  That is it. 
The idea then is that the law enforcement agencies would say that 
they already are looking at a particular terrorist group or a 
particular group of organized crime and that the preliminary 
information, this heads-up that the financial transactions report 
analysis centre has given them, fits the mould of what they are 
already doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of the other police work, together with this 
heads-up from the centre, they would then have to go to a judge 
and fulfil all the ordinary obligations that would be required of 
law enforcement agencies so that they could then undertake other 
activity that would be outside where they could normally go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent this centre has to be separate because it has to 
be highly sophisticated, not only the centre itself but the 
people manning it.  Additionally, the centre not being under the 
thumb of, answerable to, or under the jurisdiction of any police 
enforcement body or any military enforcement body gives me some 
feeling of comfort that it will not be abused and that my civil 
rights and the civil rights of all people in Canada will not be 
compromised by the enactment of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the centre would report any suspicious 
transactions or series of suspicious transactions to the 
appropriate police force, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
if the information is relevant to tax or customs duty evasion, 
CSIS if relevant to threats to the security of Canada, the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration and a foreign state if 
there is an agreement with Canada on money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns have been raised, as I have mentioned.  On behalf of 
people who have raised them, as the member of parliament 
responsible for the official opposition I have been very 
sensitive to any of the testimony that has come before committee 
and any other research that I have been able to do to arrive at 
the feeling of comfort that indeed the reports analysis centre 
will be isolated from being able to easily do anything in terms 
of infringing on our right to privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that criminal defence lawyers and the federal privacy 
commission warned that the reporting scheme could turn Canada 
into a nation of snitches.  With that in mind I listened to all 
the testimony very closely.  The Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service said the transaction reporting machine could become a 
bureaucratic monster.  Again, we have taken a look at that.  The 
fact that it has to report back to the government and to 
parliament is a very important issue, which again is why we feel 
comfortable with the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSIS proposed more selective measures that would target parties 
known to engage in dubious activities, but it would be my 
judgment that in all likelihood the centre would end up doing 
that in any event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal specifically with some comments in the March 4, 
2000 edition of the <I>National Post</I> by Terence Corcoran who 
wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed, Bill C-22 would give Ottawa fresh authority to trap 
the innocent, infringe on privacy, collect mountains of 
information on citizens and put routine money transactions under 
suspicion.  It would also conscript lawyers, banks, accountants 
and others into a national subculture of informants and snitches.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With due respect to Mr. Corcoran, I think he got a little 
carried away with his hyperbole.  He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter to Justice Minister Anne McLellan last December, the 
Canadian Bar Association listed some of the threats posed by 
Ottawa's plan to increase its surveillance over money 
transactions greater than $10,000.  It said routine legitimate 
business transactions could be disrupted and solicitor-client 
relationships undermined. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I was sensitive to this and other pronouncements by 
people who have expressed concern about it.  I am sorry, but I do 
not see that as being a problem.  I know a member from the 
Toronto area was as upset as I was when we heard testimony from 
the Canadian Law Association.  It was really very unfortunate. It 
was like they knew everything, that they were present but should 
not have been included, that they should have an exemption just 
because they are lawyers.  It was just a tad thick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am sure there were grains of good information they 
were giving us, I am sure many of us had to sift through an awful 
lot of chaff that these lawyers were giving us.  I agree with the 
government that there were no amendments required to give 
exemptions to the law profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested that it would be a hole big enough to drive a truck 
through.  If somebody was intending to try to get around the 
legislation and find exemptions in it, they could end up getting 
their transaction through.  By making an exemption for the 
lawyers, anyone interested and possibly engaging in this kind of 
nefarious activity would naturally choose a lawyer to do the 
transaction as opposed to choosing an accountant or some other 
professional.  Unfortunately that testimony, although I am sure 
it was sincere, was not singularly helpful.  Mr. Corcoran went on 
to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the name of fighting organized crime, Ottawa also wants to set 
up a new bureaucratic agency with big powers.  The Financial 
Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada would collect 
information supplied by bank informants and lawyers, 
and—depending on regulations—could end up with a licence to 
harass the innocent and legitimate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to Mr. Corcoran and other people who are concerned about 
this issue that I take their expressions of concern as being 
serious.  In spite of all the missteps we have had in this 
process, nonetheless there has been fundamental goodwill among 
members of parliament.  We have all been looking very closely to 
ensure that the concerns brought forward by Mr. Corcoran and 
others have been answered within the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One concern all of us should have is that there is an ever 
increasing encroachment on our ability to be able to relate to 
each other within society either as business people, as 
neighbours or even within our own families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The headline of an April 4 <I>Globe and Mail</I> article read 
“Mob threat getting worse, RCMP says Top Mountie warns of 
organized crime's threat to democracy”.  That is not a false 
threat at all.  That is not hyperbole.  We have seen the 
tentacles of organized crime reach right into the Chamber. A 
member of the Bloc Quebecois, his wife and his young child are 
being threatened by organized crime.  This is something that 
comes to a neighbourhood near us, if not to our own homes.  This 
is something we have to stand on guard against and we have to 
fight collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said many times, I have been desperately unhappy with 
the amateur hour we have had in terms of getting the legislation 
through the House. 
I maintain a concern because I do not know.  Because of this 
flawed process I maintain a concern that two, three or four years 
into the legislation we will probably need a massive review of 
it, probably preceding the five year mandated review for the 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with a delay created by the government of at least 
three years to bring the legislation forward.  Because of the 
urgency of the legislation we have to enable the various public 
servants that will bring the transaction centre into place to get 
on with the job.  This is an important tool to put into the hands 
of our law enforcement people.  Therefore we will support the 
legislation proceeding through the House, to the Senate and 
hopefully to royal assent as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things that we can join hands on.  We notice that 
there has been full co-operation, to the best of my knowledge, 
among all members of the House respecting the bill.  Any 
interventions I have made on behalf of the official opposition 
have been made in the spirit of having a proper process to bring 
this urgent legislation to successful completion and of making it 
as good as we could possibly make it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to join in the debate on Bill C-22.  This proposed 
legislation on money laundering involves transactions through 
financial institutions and other financial intermediaries with 
the intent to conceal criminal profits and make them appear 
legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 builds on the existing Proceeds of Crime Act.  The 
legislation institutes mandatory reporting of suspicious 
financial transactions and of cross-border movement of large 
amounts of currency.  It creates an independent analysis centre 
as has been remarked upon by the previous speaker, the mandate of 
which will be to receive and manage reported information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation meets commitments that Canada made as a member 
of the OECD and of the G-8.   Canada is one of the last G-8 
countries to establish such a regime.  That was pointed out to a 
parliamentary delegation of which I had the privilege of being a 
part at the European Union in the month of March of this year 
when we had an opportunity to discuss with our European 
colleagues what they are doing in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In developing the bill, Canada has taken into consideration the 
40 recommendations set out by the Financial Action Task Force on 
Money Laundering which encourages the strengthening of 
international co-operation with regard to the exchange of 
information on currency flows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the reasons this is important is that money laundering 
is now the world's third largest industry by value.  It extends 
far beyond hiding profits from narcotics.  It now includes trade 
fraud, tax evasion, organized crime, arms smuggling, bank, 
medical and insurance fraud.  In this country alone somewhere 
between $5 billion and $17 billion are laundered each and every 
year.  With those kinds of gaps, $5 billion and $17 billion, 
obviously nobody knows for sure how much, but it is estimated 
worldwide that somewhere between $300 billion and $500 billion 
U.S. are laundered in these ways.  Tax evasion is not addressed 
in the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendation of the New Democratic Party is to support the 
legislation in principle.  It is obvious that we should support 
the introduction of any legislation that curbs illegal activity. 
However there is some wariness on our part as to the lack of 
certainty and of clarity in some parts of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that a number of concerns should be examined and 
addressed further.  There is a potential for charter violations. 
The guarantees of reasonable search and seizure appear to be at 
risk. 
For example, the Criminal Lawyers' Association argues that the 
standard of suspicion outlined fails to meet even the first and 
fundamental requirements of reasonable grounds.  The legislation 
may also create an irreconcilable conflict for professionals, 
such as lawyers who remain subject to certain codes of conduct 
that prohibit them from disclosing information.  It must also 
provide a mechanism to absolve an individual from potential 
liability that may result from disclosing such confidential 
information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second point is the possible pressure on consumers.  The 
reporting regime set up to track and communicate suspicious 
transactions has at least two financial repercussions.  One, 
there is a cost to be borne by the taxpayer for the establishment 
and maintenance of the tracking system.  Second, in having to 
establish compliance mechanisms there is a concern that the cost 
for setting up reporting mechanisms for financial institutions 
will be borne by the customers of those institutions and the 
concern that there not be consumer gouging as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third point is with regard to the system's effectiveness. 
There remains a series of concerns about the planned reporting 
effectiveness.  There is a warning that the new regime has the 
potential to create a bureaucratic monster and there is a chance 
that organized crime would be able to short circuit such a system 
through a series of shadowy, sophisticated transactions. We 
wonder whether money might not be better spent granting law 
enforcement and investigative bodies additional resources to 
detect and prosecute money laundering offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned that the bill does not appear to address 
technology based crimes, the white collar crimes which surely we 
will see grow in future with the growth of the Internet and 
computers in general.  Technology based crimes include credit and 
debit card fraud, telephone fraud, stock market manipulation and 
computer break-ins.  Increasingly organized crime syndicates are 
using technological and digital means of communication, including 
encryption and scanning devices, thus potentially circumventing 
the provisions of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would recommend to the government that a clearer and more 
precise definition of what constitutes a suspicious transaction 
be formulated.  The subjective nature of the definition could 
provide an excuse for compliance failure and as a result many 
suspicious transactions might not be reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the use of a vague definition could result in 
institutions over-reporting for fear of involuntary 
non-compliance, thus creating unnecessary, unwarranted scrutiny of 
innocent individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that the proposed legislation must clearly address the 
issue of the threat to the privacy of all Canadians and 
especially the possible disclosure of information to Revenue 
Canada should it involve a taxation matter.  Obviously, strict 
guidelines must be established in this area.  The bill must also 
address the possible violations of the guarantee against 
reasonable search and seizure in the charter of rights and 
freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the issue of tax-related offences could be 
addressed.  Tax offences occur when money is transferred to 
offshore tax havens through companies, trusts and bank accounts. 
The purpose obviously is to conceal assets from Revenue Canada. 
Money laundering, on the other hand, involves the intent to 
conceal criminal profits and make them appear legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perplexing that even the definition of a suspicious 
transaction, a fundamental principle indeed, is to be determined 
after the legislation is passed.  Many other key dispositions 
would be determined after that fact by regulation.  These 
include:  the appointment of the centre's director and the 
determination of his or her remuneration; the determination of 
the individuals or businesses that will be subject to this 
legislation and how they will report; the delay which will be 
granted to financial institutions to retrieve and report 
information; bodies and institutions which will be required to 
report on how records are to be maintained; the delay a financial 
institution must respect; and the length of time records are to 
be kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In agreeing to a bill such as this we also wonder about things 
like the Tobin tax which the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle 
brought forward.  Indeed, it was passed as a private member's 
bill in this House.  Why could that not be established with the 
same alacrity with which we are working in this area?

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, a Tobin tax framework would be an excellent 
initiative to establish an international monitoring system of 
currency flows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the points I wish to make.  After listening to the 
remarks of the hon. member for Kootenay—Columbia I was pleased 
to note that the financial reporter for the <I>National Post</I>, 
Terence Corcoran, has many concerns about this bill.  That 
resolves my belief that the bill is worthy of support.  It is one 
of the few things that has resulted from the fact that the 
<I>National Post</I> is now in existence that I do not have to 
look at Terence Corcoran's column in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak to Bill C-22 at third reading 
to address some of the very important issues about the 
legislation which would create the new money laundering oversight 
agency that would be positioned to help protect Canadians from 
organized crime and be part of a global effort to combat the 
insidious and pervasive nature of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most business activities, organized crime has become very 
much a global enterprise.  As such, Canada's procrastination and 
tardiness in not addressing this issue earlier is unconscionable. 
It is unfortunate that the government had not seen the need to 
address this issue earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members have noted, we are lagging behind other members 
of the G-8 and the OECD in terms of pursuing this very important 
initiative of establishing within our country a sound oversight 
agency to reduce the incidence of money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a huge issue.  The estimates of money laundering are even 
difficult to get a handle on.  Some estimates in Canada are as 
low as $5 billion or $8 billion and some are as high as $20 
billion.  There is a huge variance and disparity on this one 
issue.  That indicates the degree to which we are really only 
beginning to understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One concern I have about this legislation is that it addresses 
in many ways yesterday's issue, that is, the very conventional 
means of money laundering.  Nowhere in the legislation or in the 
new agency do I see some sort of commitment that the agency will 
have the type of resources and technological strength to address 
some of the current and emerging issues of technologically 
oriented money laundering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the sophistication of financial instruments and the 
inability of sovereign governments to track either cross-border 
financial transactions or intra-state transactions, whether they 
be derivatives, which are not considered to be a particularly 
sophisticated financial instrument in the current context, the 
fact is that increasingly we are dealing with these sophisticated 
financial instruments and the ability of any agency to track 
transactions, large or small, intra-state or cross-border, is a 
real challenge.  I would hope that this agency will have not only 
the resources to pursue technologically driven approaches to the 
very serious issue of money laundering, but beyond that would 
work with the private sector and many of the companies involved 
on the Internet security side to develop private sector 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technology being developed by both American and Canadian 
companies in these areas is very advanced. 
I would hope that the government would do a better job at seeking 
input from the private sector in developing more sophisticated 
approaches to this problem than it has in other areas.

helped and have been constructive in assisting to ensure that 
there will be some level of accountability for this agency and 
some level of rigorous reporting that has the capacity to provide 
some checks and balances.  That is all well and good, but we have 
to be vigilant as parliamentarians to ensure that we provide 
mechanisms to protect Canadians against these all powerful new 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that any law-abiding Canadian would have any 
difficulty with getting tough on money laundering.  That being 
the case, it is very important to separate the powers of these 
agencies.  For example, I expressed concerns at the time of the 
creation of the new Revenue Canada agency that it could emerge as 
an IRS style agency, Godzilla the tax collector, which would have 
the power to persecute and relentlessly pursue individual 
Canadian taxpayers, and in many cases bring about undue suffering 
and unfair treatment of ordinary law-abiding, tax-paying 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more powerful the agency, the more difficult it is for 
individual Canadians to muster the resources to fight it.  My 
concern has been and continues to be with the new money 
laundering agency that we ensure that any sharing of information 
between this new agency and the Revenue Canada agency is done 
under very strict conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if the new money laundering agency sees some level 
of evidence to suggest money laundering and feels that sharing 
that information with Revenue Canada would help bolster the new 
agency's case in pursuing a case of money laundering against an 
individual or a group of individuals, that could be seen as 
being reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, on the other hand, there is not sufficient evidence to 
suggest money laundering, but if the new agency sees some 
evidence that there may be some level of tax evasion and shares 
that information with the new Revenue Canada agency, I think that 
would be overstepping the boundaries and would be leading to an 
incredibly powerful, turbo-charged Revenue Canada agency that 
could wreak havoc on the lives of ordinary Canadians.  We have to 
be careful to ensure that there is a Chinese wall between the 
Revenue Canada agency and this new money laundering agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nebulous nature of the description of suspicious 
transactions is also disturbing.  It seems to be a very 
qualitative description that is very difficult to narrow in a 
substantive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of resources is very important.  Certainly the RCMP 
calls this legislation long overdue, but we have to ensure that 
the RCMP on a national level is funded properly to pursue some of 
these activities and work with this agency.  It is critical to 
ensure that we not create these new agencies without providing 
some level of resources to ensure that they can do their jobs and 
at the same time maintain our traditional policing of white 
collar crimes through the RCMP in a way that is consistent and 
which provides over a period of time a reasonable level of 
support and resources.  The government has not provided ongoing 
and consistent levels of support to the RCMP, and in fact has 
starved the activities of the RCMP on a national level.

direction but the government is prone to taking baby steps as

</I></B></P><P align=left>While we do recognize that this is a step forward, a lot more 
needs to be done to ensure that ordinary Canadians are protected 
against organized crime.  In the future we must work more 
proactively with our trading partners and with our partners in 
the G-8 and the OECD to develop solutions and introduce them 
within our borders earlier as opposed to always playing catch up 
and lagging behind our partners on something as important as 
money laundering and organized crime.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK237">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 7 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-25, an act to the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act and 
the Budget Implementation Act, 1999, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to debate Bill C-25.  Whenever we bring 
legislation before this place that comes from the Department of 
Finance, in fact legislation that comes from anywhere in 
government, one of the things we should be doing is examining 
very closely that legislation to determine whether or not it is 
working to enhance Canada's productivity as a nation. I am going 
to argue that Bill C-25 does not seriously do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to argue that most of the legislation that comes from 
the government in fact does not enhance our productivity as a 
nation.  That is one of the reasons Canada is chronically an 
underachiever.  It is one of the reasons we continue to fall 
behind in the world.  Any objective review of the facts will bear 
that assertion out.  I think it is absolutely the case.  We can 
point to lots of research that will underscore what I have just 
stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to run through why I think it is so critical that we 
start to improve our productivity as a nation.  It is a simple 
fact that when a country becomes more productive, the standard of 
living increases.  This is an obvious truth; it is self-evident 
in a sense.  When we produce more things of value, it means we 
have more income, more money. That allows us to spend it on 
things that are important to us, not the least of which is 
ensuring we have a good health care system and the things that 
are important to people that they finance sometimes through their 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not very long ago despite the best efforts of the government, a 
government that has been in power now for seven years, we saw 
another report which indicated that the productivity gap between 
Canada and the United States is widening.  It is getting larger. 
This should be alarming to us because over the last couple of 
years report after report after report has said that the Canadian 
federal government should be worried about this and it should 
start to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, apparently the government is deaf to that message.  It 
does not seem to understand.  It cannot see the connection, which 
I argue is self-evident, that if we produce more things that 
people value, we are going to have a higher standard of living. 
The government cannot seem to figure that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a position now where with every passing day we see 
Canada fall far short of its potential which means that Canadians 
are far poorer than they need to be.  That is not just a hard 
economic fact, it is a personal human tragedy for many people. It 
is wrong when we as legislators have the ability to make changes 
to make this country better, more productive and wealthier that 
we do not do it, that we sit on our hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am imploring the government to listen carefully to the 
argument I am going to make.  It is one of many arguments that 
others have made imploring the government to do the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned a minute ago that the productivity gap continues to 
widen between Canada and the United States.  It is important to 
measure us relative to the United States because in many ways 
there are things we can compare.  We speak the same language, 
share the same continent and engage in many of the same kinds of 
industries.  It was not long ago when Canada had a standard of 
living equally as high as that of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is a birthright that we should have a standard 
of living that is higher than the United States or any other in 
the world, but if it is achievable we should strive for it.  We 
know now, according to reports by people like John McCallum, the 
chief economist of the Royal Bank, that Canada has fallen far 
behind the United States, a country with which our standard of 
living was equal.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his last report, Mr. McCallum pointed out that our standard 
of living was now two-thirds of that of the United States.  If we 
keep going the way we will soon be at 50% of that of the United 
States.  Bill C-25, and Bill C-32 which we addressed the other 
day, do not go anywhere far enough to addressing these 
fundamental problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing we must do to ensure that our country becomes a 
lot more productive is to remove the impediments to wealth 
creation.  We must beat down burdensome regulations that have 
outlived their usefulness.  There are tens of thousands of 
regulations on the books today that nobody in any particular 
industry can be expected to know all about.  We cannot understand 
thousands of regulations that affect each and every sector of the 
economy.  No one can possibly know all the regulations but we are 
somehow expected to comply with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we still have interprovincial trade barriers that cost 
the economy a tremendous amount of money.  In many cases, it is a 
lot easier, for instance, for Ontario to trade with Michigan than 
it is with Quebec, which is crazy.  The federal government has 
the power in the constitution to ensure that those trade barriers 
are broken down.  However, it refuses to act for reasons that I 
cannot understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest impediments falls under the umbrella of tax 
policy.  Something the government cannot seem to figure out is 
that high marginal tax rates hold back our economy. We have high 
marginal tax rates.  What is important, when we talk about ways 
to make the economy more productive, is the tax that we pay at 
the margin.  What I mean by that is, if we have an income in 
Canada of say $80,000, every dollar we earn beyond that we pay 
over 50% to the taxman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to people who are innovators or entrepreneurs who 
invent things that they are being punished for the crime of 
producing these things that are good for the economy, for their 
families and for the world.  Their reward is to pay higher taxes. 
The result is that many of these people get frustrated.  They say 
“If I am not going to be valued in my country, then I will go 
elsewhere”.  That phenomenon is called the brain drain.  Some 
people in the government deny that it happens, the Prime Minister 
being one of them, but according to the evidence there is a brain 
drain, and that is beyond question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to find out about that all we have to do is go 
to one of the high tech firms in Ottawa and Kanata and ask them 
how many of their people have left for the United States or other 
jurisdictions.  We will find out that brain drain is a real 
problem.  When we talk about the high tech field, we are talking 
about the field that will create the lion share of the wealth 
around the world in the next several decades.  As legislators, we 
are crazy if we do not do something about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is public policy that is standing in the way.  This is not 
because we have some natural disadvantage in Canada.  On the 
contrary, we have all the natural resources in the world at our 
fingertips.  We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world 
when it comes to natural resources.  We have an educated public. 
We have great human resources.  Unfortunately, we have a 
situation where public policy is standing in our way.  The only 
people who can change it are the people in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, that government across the way is fixed in cement when it 
comes to making the types of changes were are talking about. 
People are paying for it in the form of standards of living that 
fall far below their potential.  That is a shame.  Governments 
should not punish the people they purport to serve.  I would 
argue that this government, through neglect, is doing exactly 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make the case that this is happening by pointing to the 
OECD statistics from 1988 to 1998.  During that 10 year period 
Canada's real output per capita, the standard of living of 
Canadians, grew by only 5%.  Over that same 10 year period we saw 
the output per capita in Mexico grow three times as fast; in 
France, three times as fast; in Australia and in the United 
States, four times as fast; in Norway, six times as fast; and in 
Ireland, a staggering eighteen times as fast.  Why is that?  Is 
it because Ireland has so many more resources than Canada?  No. 
It is because it put in place the right public policy, something 
this government has failed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to talk about now is in the context of the Ontario 
budget that came down yesterday.  One thing that the Government 
of Ontario understands and the federal government does not 
understand is that we are in a global competition.  If we do not 
react and put in place public policies that make our jurisdiction 
an attractive place to invest, then we will be left behind and 
our people will pay the price in the form of a falling standard 
of living.  That is exactly what has happened to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider what happened in Ontario on Monday when the 
Ontario government brought down the budget.  When it brought down 
the budget it made sure that it lowered corporate taxes so that 
they would be lower or the same as many American states.  It 
lowered provincial income taxes to the point where they are now 
the lowest in Canada.  What does that mean?  It means that the 
Ontario government is sensitive to the fact that if it does not 
get taxes down it will lose crucial investment that will go 
somewhere else in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider what happened with the Alberta budget.  The 
Alberta government brought down a very unique tax proposal.  It 
is essentially a single tax rate of 11%.  It is designed to 
attract people to Alberta and to keep people who are currently 
there.  We understand that when we attract investment and the 
people who create jobs everyone will ultimately benefit.  The 
Alberta government understands that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the Government of the United States at times 
in its history has very much understood that. I think it is 
shocking that the United States, which has 10 times Canada's 
population, spends more per capital on public health care than we 
do.  How do they do that?  It certainly does not distribute it 
the same way and some people are left out. We eschew that system. 
We do not agree with it.  However, how does it do that?  How 
come it is not going bankrupt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, how does the United States do that and still 
spend so much more as a percent of its GDP on military financing? 
How does it do that while at the same time have a debt to GDP 
ratio that is far lower than ours?  In other words, it did not go 
into debt or borrow money to do this.  How does it fund all those 
things?  It is able to do that because its economy is much more 
productive.  The output of the average American is much higher 
than that of the average Canadian.  Why is that?  Is it because 
they are smarter?  Of course not.  Do they work harder? Sometimes 
they do, but that is really not the key.  The difference is that 
the United States has the proper incentives in place to encourage 
people to go out and create wealth.  When wealth is created, some 
of it is paid to the government. 
That is how it is able to finance all those things with much 
lower taxes than we have in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just pointed out that the United States spends more than 
Canada on public health care and far more on defence, but it has 
a much lower debt per capita and much lower taxes, about 30% 
lower, than Canada.  The only way that can happen is if each 
individual American produces more.  The way to ensure they 
produce more is to lower marginal rates.  That is critical.  That 
is something our government cannot get through its head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget the government cut taxes very minimally but 
it did not do anything at all about lowering marginal tax rates. 
We missed a golden opportunity to send a message to the rest of 
the world that we are open for business and that we will value 
investment if it is brought here because then everyone gets to 
benefit from it.  If it goes somewhere else it will benefit 
someone else.  It is time we learned that lesson.  How do we do 
this?  How do we turn this ship around? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must first change our attitude.  We must look at legislation 
like Bill C-25 or Bill C-32 and ask what it does to improve the 
productivity of the country and, by extension, the standard of 
living of Canadians.  When we ask that question, we say that we 
will beat down marginal rates.  That is why the Canadian Alliance 
is advocating solution 17, this idea of lowering taxes for all 
Canadians at the low end, the middle and the high end. It is a 
single rate tax proposal.  It has three elements.  One element is 
to raise the basic and married exemptions to $10,000.  In doing 
that, we would lift 1.9 million low income Canadians right off 
the tax rolls.  They will not pay any more tax. This plan also 
benefits people on the low end.  We would extend a $3,000 per 
child deduction to every family in Canada with children under the 
age of 16.  Right away $26,000 of income would be exempted for a 
single income family, or a dual income family for that matter, 
with two children.  After that, we propose a 17% tax rate for 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would knock down the hurdles that make it difficult for 
people to climb up the income scale.  The way it is now, when we 
begin to climb up the income scale, bang, we are into a higher tax 
bracket.  All of a sudden the incentive to continue to work 
harder is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the finance committee's majority report in December, the 
Liberals on the committee said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest economic gains, however, will be achieved when 
marginal tax rates, especially the highest ones, are reduced. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were Liberal members who were arguing this because they 
understood something that the government, in general, does not 
understand, which is that high marginal taxes impede 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that we must beat down those rates and not fall a 
little less quickly behind the Americans, the Irish, the U.K. and 
other countries, but to catch up and go beyond them.  It is a 
sin, in a country as naturally wealthy as ours and with the human 
resources that we have, that our standard of living continues to 
decline relative to all these other countries around the world. 
It is a sin not to fulfil our potential, but that has been the 
legacy of this government.  It has allowed that to happen.  The 
Prime Minister is the one who sticks his head in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members doubt for a moment any of what I am saying, they 
should reflect on the Prime Minister's sanguine attitude toward 
the fall of the Canadian dollar.  “A low dollar is good”, he 
says.  However, a low dollar is a reflection of the strength of 
the economy.  Our dollar today dropped about a quarter of a cent, 
down below 67 cents.  Unbelievable.  In the mid-seventies to late 
seventies it was higher, and that reflected our standard of 
living being so much higher relative to the Americans.  On that 
fact alone, the government should stand indicted of a great crime 
which is to allow Canada to underachieve.  Canadians, 
individually, are poorer for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I heard the comments of the 
member for Medicine Hat.  The party opposite uses the expression 
“marginal tax rates”.  What are marginal tax rates?  Marginal 
tax rates are taxes at the margin; what an individual will be 
taxed for every incremental dollar.  It can apply to anyone in 
the income tax system, but when members opposite talk about 
marginal tax rates they talk about marginal tax rates at the high 
end.  While it is true that the government has not reduced 
marginal tax rates at the high end as much as we have reduced 
marginal tax rates at the middle income and low income levels, we 
have reduced taxes significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In budget 2000 we have a tax package of $58 billion as a 
minimum.  The economy continues to tick away at a growth rate of 
about 4% annually.  There have been 18 consecutive quarters of 
growth.  The way the member opposite was speaking we would think 
it was doom and gloom.  There have been 18 straight quarters of 
growth in the country.  We are leading the G-7 and the OECD 
countries.  In terms of employment growth, we are leading the 
G-7.  Unemployment is at its lowest level in a generation—in 24 
years.  I could go on and on about the good news.  I am glad that 
Canadians do not listen all that carefully to the doom and gloom 
across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the member's premise in terms of the tax 
rates at the high end of the income tax scale.  That really 
coincides with the opposition's flat tax proposal.  Let me give a 
comparison.  A taxpayer—

this.  You are asking a question, I believe.  Perhaps you could 
put a question so that we would have time for a few more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was building up to a 
question.  I will leave the subject of the flat tax for a moment 
and come back to it later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Medicine Hat talked about the huge amount of 
money spent in the United States on health care.  Will he 
acknowledge that in the United States, because of its private 
health care system, fully 30% of the costs of the total health 
care system is spent on administration, filling in forms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if it is or 
it is not.  I am not advocating that we embrace the U.S. system. 
In fact, as I said in my speech, we do not agree with it.  It is 
the wrong system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point was that the U.S. economy produces so much more wealth 
per person that it is able to fund public health care to a 
greater degree than Canada.  I think my friend across the way 
should pay attention to that fact.  Whether the administration 
eats up 30% or whatever is irrelevant to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that the government is anaesthetising itself with 
happy talk about the growth in our economy.  The truth is that 
one of the ways we are subsidizing the growth in our economy is 
by allowing our dollar to sink, producing a feeling of good 
times, but at the same time not preparing our economy in the 
proper way to take advantage of the new economy.  We are allowing 
the government to cruise, perhaps through to another election 
campaign, sacrificing the best interests of Canadians in doing so 
and making us poorer in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way must acknowledge that if he is going to 
be completely upfront and forthright with Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in response to the hon. member opposite who asked a 
question of my colleague, I would like to ask him what his view 
is of yesterday's Ontario budget which made cuts to corporate 
income tax and the capital gains tax.  That has actually done 
more for the Canadian economy, for which the Liberals would like 
to take credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, it is a 
recognition of the fact that people in the Government of Ontario 
understand that they have to be leaders when it comes to 
attracting wealth and talent from around the world, so they move 
to cut all of their taxes significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government seems to think that if taxes are cut in 
the middle, very marginally by the way, only about $8 billion 
over five years, when we net everything out—my friend across the 
way laughs, but I am happy to do the math for him— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  I have heard it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  He has heard it, but the government 
does not include $30 billion in tax hikes for Canada pension plan 
premiums when it does its figuring.  Eliminating bracket creep is 
not a tax cut.  It means that we will not have future automatic 
tax increases.  That is not a tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the child tax benefit, the government is talking 
about it as though it were a tax cut.  It is a social program by 
any reasonable definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way is completely deluded if he thinks that 
somehow Canadians are going to end up being $58 billion better 
off because of what the government brought down in the last 
budget.  That is simply not the case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-25 and comment on 
the exchange that took place between my colleague from Medicine 
Hat and the parliamentary secretary regarding the $58 billion 
which the Liberal government is talking about as being tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Medicine Hat indicated, there really are no 
tax cuts.  We simply have to ask Canadians if they see more money 
in their pockets.  It is a simple question.  All members should 
go to their ridings and ask this question of their constituents: 
Have you seen the so-called tax cuts that the Liberal government 
has brought down in this budget; the $58 billion which it is 
touting? 
They will not find Canadians who say that they have received any 
tax cuts.  Where are these tax cuts?  I do not know where these 
tax cuts are.  Canadians do not see them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The claim by the government that there is $58 billion in tax 
cuts is all accounting and bookkeeping which the government has 
brought forward so it can spin it to the country that there are 
tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address two areas.  One deals with what 
Canadians are facing.  The other deals with the impact of the 
government's fiscal policy on international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received constituent complaint after constituent 
complaint, complaints of the draconian measures that Revenue 
Canada takes when going after people who cannot afford to pay, 
unfairly squeezing money out of them, putting them into more 
misery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that Revenue Canada has a system of fairness 
and that people can complain.  I can tell the House that is not 
happening.  What is happening is that Canadians are calling their 
members of parliament.  Any member of parliament would tell us 
that Canadians are complaining about the draconian measures which 
the bureaucrats are taking at Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a call this morning which concerns me.  A constituent 
of mine is having problems with Revenue Canada.  This case was 
given to the Minister of National Revenue six months ago and we 
have not had a reply.  My constituent phoned the agent who seized 
an aircraft from U.S. Customs.  What did this bureaucrat tell my 
constituent?  He said “You went to your member of parliament. 
You complained to the minister.  I am sorry, but we are going to 
take our sweet time in dealing with this”.  Is that how we deal 
with Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another case dealing with immigration bureaucrats, from 
whom I have written proof that they say to members of parliament 
“Sorry, we will not respond to your inquiries”.  I would like 
to tell these bureaucrats that members of parliament have been 
elected by Canadians.  We are the voice of Canadians on the 
street.  It is their democratic right to come to us for help.  It 
is our right to ask the government and the bureaucrats questions 
and it is our right to expect a response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that happening?  No, it is not happening.  What is happening 
now is that we are seeing the bureaucrats taking over, making 
decisions and then telling members of parliament that they cannot 
respond to them.  This is becoming a trend which is quite 
disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the tax cuts which the government is talking 
about, time after time calls have come into my office asking 
where are these tax cuts.  Where is this tax relief? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A constituent came into my office.  He had been granted a CPP 
disability pension.  Under the CPP disability plan he was 
eligible for a claim because he was recognized as having health 
problems.  He is disabled.  When he filled out his income tax 
forms and included the disability credit, lo and behold, Revenue 
Canada said “No, you are not disabled.  This disability claim is 
disallowed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can one arm of the government give him a cheque, saying that 
he is disabled, when another arm of the government, Revenue 
Canada, is actually telling him that he cannot claim the 
disability credit and, therefore, will have to pay tax?  Then 
Revenue Canada charges interest on it, and this poor man just 
cannot afford to pay.  He is on disability from CPP.  How does 
this work?  I do not know.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that it is compassionate and is giving a tax 
credit.  Students and single parents have come to me who cannot 
pay.  Do members know what is killing them?  It is the so-called 
interest and penalties, even if it is Revenue Canada's fault. 
That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At times Revenue Canada will not tell the constituent what it is 
doing.  It just goes ahead and assesses without giving due 
notice.  That is why my colleague from Calgary Southeast is 
presenting a taxpayer bill of rights.  That is the best 
legislation that could be brought down to give Canadians at least 
a voice against the draconian measures taken by the bureaucrats 
of Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be done about a system which charges penalties and 
interest and says that we have to pay it?  People are already 
facing problems and having difficulty paying in the first place. 
These are not people who are trying to cheat.  They are not 
denying their incomes.  It is not that.  They are not making much 
income but the problem they are facing is that Revenue Canada 
without informing them is taking draconian measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They come to our offices and at times we are successful, but why 
does it have to take us to do it?  Why cannot the government do 
it?  This is a concern which I thought was appropriate to bring 
out when we are talking about Bill C-25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the international trade critic and I would like to talk 
about the government's fiscal policy on international trade. Many 
times I have heard the Minister for International Trade mention 
very proudly that 43% of our GDP or one out of three jobs is tied 
to international trade.  He says this proudly.  As a matter of 
fact he said it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to book entitled “Africa Trade Strategy 2000”.  That 
is fine and I accept it.  We are proud of what is going on. 
However, I have a question to ask of him.  Why has there been no 
trade mission to Africa?  The Minister for International Trade 
rightly said that when Canadian companies are interested we will 
have a trade mission to Africa.  The essence of the point is: 
when Canadian companies or businesses are interested in doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade and all the trade officials 
that work for the Department of International Trade around the 
world are promoting trade.  Trade means jobs for Canada.  We all 
know that.  They are promoting trade to the best of their 
ability, signing deals, creating corridors and opening windows of 
opportunity for Canadian companies.  That is great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that it is for Canadian companies.  With the high 
taxation that the government's fiscal policy has created and the 
refusal of the Prime Minister to recognize that, will Canadian 
companies at the end of the day be able to take advantage of the 
international windows of opportunity?  Absolutely not.  As the 
minister said, he may go out there and find there are no 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A problem is also originating out of this, which is evident even 
from EDC's list of clients.  We have a serious problem henceforth 
with calling for EDC's privatization. We are getting 
concentrically narrower and narrower and narrower with only a few 
Canadian companies out of the whole Canadian economy.  I can name 
a couple of them, Bombardier and SNC-Lavalin. 
These are the companies that are taking advantage of it.  The 
Canadian economy is growing.  There are companies all over the 
country that would like to do international trade.  We need to 
expand to get them to take advantage of international trade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot restrict it to companies that are benefiting from 
grants and that have connections with the government.  We have to 
open it up.  That can only happen if there is sound fiscal policy 
by the government.  Lowering taxes is the peak criterion.  Time 
after time every business leader says that productivity has 
curtailed and taxes are too high.  At the end of the day the 
government refuses to listen.  The Prime Minister says that if 
they do not like it they can leave the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About a week ago I saw an article in the paper indicating that 
500 Newfoundlanders were going to Ireland to work.  Companies 
from Ireland came to Newfoundland and asked people to work for 
them.  What does that tell us?  It tells us that in Ireland the 
economy must be booming.  There is a shortage of people so they 
come to Newfoundland, and rightly so.  Let them come to 
Newfoundland.  If Newfoundlanders can find work in Ireland, 
great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the massive change that has taken place in 
Ireland because of lower taxes.  Ireland looked at its business 
environment and said that its economy had to be productive.  It 
did that.  Today its companies are coming to Canada looking for 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government refuses to do that.  The Minister for 
International Trade and everybody else including me will proudly 
say that we are trying to promote international trade.  That is 
good for Canada. International trade provides jobs.  When we try 
to sell business opportunities in the international market to 
Canadian companies they say cannot do it.  They cannot expand 
because people are leaving the country.  They do not have the 
workforce and taxes are very high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, it is critically important that we have a sound 
fiscal policy.  That will create an environment where business 
can flourish, which in turn means jobs for Canadians, which in 
turn means prosperity for Canadians.  If we do not do it, the 
prosperity of Canadians will go down and down.  It is a question 
we need to be worried about because Canada has the potential.  We 
are touted as the best country in the world.  If we do not stop 
this now, we will start slipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we already are slipping, when we look at our partners 
that compete with us on the international trade scene.  We have 
started to lose ground to them rapidly.  If everybody else is 
recognizing the problems of productivity and high taxation and 
are addressing those issues, when will our government address 
them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In solution 17 that my party proposed we are asking for the 
general corporate tax rate to be reduced from 28% to 21%.  We are 
asking for the payroll tax, the EI premium, to be reduced to $2. 
We are asking that the small business tax rate be reduced from 
12% to 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to be rocket scientists to know what all this 
means.  It will mean more money in the hands of businesses and of 
Canadians.  More money in their hands means more consumer 
spending, which means companies become productive, the business 
environment has the strength to grow and we will be looking at a 
robust economy. 
If we fail to do that it will not happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The international trade agreements we are signing are opening 
the doors for other countries to come here as it is opening the 
doors for us to go first.  If we are not going to go, they are 
going to come here.  When they come here there are jobs for 
Canadians, but we would be weakening Canadian companies.  We want 
them to be strong and to take advantage of the ongoing 
globalization era around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a question of priorities.  Yesterday the Ontario 
government introduced a budget which targeted the business sector 
and a reduction of taxes as its number one priority.  It is the 
largest province and it is doing well.  I was at the dinner and I 
can say there was a great sense of optimism in that province.  In 
my home province there is also a great sense of optimism.  Those 
two provinces are optimistic.  The question we might ask is why. 
The answer is simple.  Their economies are becoming robust, not 
because of the federal government but because of the provincial 
governments which have taken the lead in reducing taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is refusing to recognize the results.  It 
is refusing to recognize the evidence that is out there.  There 
is evidence of those provinces reducing taxes.  The European 
Union started reducing taxes.  If we are not careful, even with 
the NAFTA trade we are doing with our neighbour to the south we 
can start losing ground.  Nothing will stop them.  They will be 
going down to Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that by bringing it to light the government will 
recognize it and do something about it.  At this time I would 
like to move an amendment to the amendment. 
<A NAME="LINK243">&nbsp;</A>

time in terms of questions and comments, I feel like someone at a 
smorgasbord.  I do not know where to start, but I will be 
succinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the budget in Ontario, corporate income 
taxes and their impact on trade, et cetera.  Has the member 
actually had a chance to read the Ontario budget or budget 2000 
of the federal government?  Budget 2000 of the federal government 
reduced the general corporate tax rate from 28% to 21% or seven 
percentage points. 
A few months later the Ontario government has come along and made 
similar reductions in the corporate tax rate.  I applaud the 
Ontario government for following the lead of the federal 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the member opposite talked about how Canadian companies 
are not competitive.  He cited Ontario.  I can tell the hon. 
member that when these corporate tax reductions are fully 
implemented, the combined federal and Ontario corporate tax rate 
will be significantly below the tax rates in that party's sacred 
cow, the United States, and in the United Kingdom, two 
jurisdictions that the member for Calgary East cited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the hon. member has had a chance to actually 
read the Ontario budget and to read budget 2000 of the federal 
government and if he would reconsider the conclusion he reached 
earlier, because I think it clearly negates what he said earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member 
raised this question.  Yes, the press release on the Ontario 
budget talks about reducing the corporate income tax. I did read 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, aside from the corporate income tax, what 
about the payroll taxes?  The federal government just increased 
the CPP premiums.  How much money is it taking on the Canada 
pension plan because of the government's mismanagement?  With the 
increase in the Canada pension plan premiums, the federal 
government is taking away the money. Look at the EI surplus.  The 
government could reduce the tax burden on the corporations making 
them more competitive. Again it is the numbers game my colleagues 
on the other side like to play, but which at the end of the day 
does not result in what the corporations are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is critically important that we say what is right. In our 
view, the budget does not create the environment required for 
Canadian corporations and businesses.  It does not give the 
working Canadians the tax reductions that are needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I enjoyed my colleague's comments 
immensely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of things he alluded to in his speech.  One 
of them was constituents' complaints.  The leading one I get is 
when they deal with Revenue Canada on GST and revenue taxation. 
I wonder if he would like to outline a little bit more on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also alluded to the private member's bill which is almost a 
taxpayers' bill of rights and provides for an ombudsman for 
people to call.  To whom do we go?  I try to work out things for 
my constituents.  In dealing with the revenue minister, the 
finance minister, the Prime Minister and so on, we seem to get 
pushed around and around and really do not get substantive 
answers to a lot of our concerns.  Would the hon. member care to 
comment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 
my colleague for bringing forward a very good point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member of parliament sitting over here knows that the 
number of complaints against the federal government and Revenue 
Canada has skyrocketed in our offices.  The majority of the 
complaints somehow seem to get settled after we get involved and 
we wonder why.  Why can the government and Revenue Canada not 
just settle these problems?  Why do they make Canadian taxpayers 
go through the pain and suffering and time wasting procedures? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of complaints are that the laws that have been made 
by the government are so weak that they can be interpreted by the 
bureaucrats in any direction they want.  One goes in one 
direction and one goes in another direction.  One will accept it 
and one will not accept it.  There is inconsistency. Where can 
people go?  That is why my colleague has brought in the Canadian 
taxpayers' bill of rights.  At least the people will have 
somebody to complain to about what is happening.  Maybe then the 
government will listen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my colleague was talking earlier about 
international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back about 40 or 50 years when Japan was just 
starting out and when the image of made in Japan was not a 
particularly good item. However through progressive governments 
that have been favourable to industry, through productivity, 
individual work ethics, some of that productivity in Japan is now 
some of the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen that go from Japan to Korea to Taiwan, a similar 
move of where economies start at the low end but through 
progressive governments that are favourable to industry, they end 
up doing particularly well on the international market.  These 
are the markets with which we have to compete.  We will be 
competing with China over the next several decades.  That will be 
an absolute workhorse of productivity and an economy that works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My impression is that Canada is just about at the opposite end. 
The government is trying to penalize industry.  It is not making 
progressive taxation or legislation that works for industry. That 
is my impression.  I ask my colleague do we seem to be on the 
wrong side of this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, at the end of the day 
what concerns me is whether this new century will be the century 
of missed opportunity for Canada.  It will be if we do not 
address the fundamentals in creating the economic environment for 
business to thrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague alluded to Japan and other Asian tigers. They 
became tigers because they recognized the importance of 
international trade and of a freer market and creating an 
environment for business to thrive.  I accompanied the Minister

thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased and honoured to enter the debate on the 
income tax amendments.  It may interest those watching in the 
wonderful world of CPAC to know what it is we are actually 
debating here this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking to a lady at a trade fair a couple of weeks ago. 
We have these trade fairs out west.  I stood all day and listened 
to people about their concerns.  Among their concerns definitely 
with tax day looming was the whole situation of taxes.  This one 
lady said she always watched CPAC.  I asked her if she had any 
other problems.  She was a very delightful lady. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to bring to the attention of everyone in the House, as 
well as to those who are watching via the electronic medium, that 
we are debating Bill C-25. We have a tendency here, and the 
parliamentary secretary will agree, to bring all these things 
together. Even in his questions he was talking about budget 2000 
which the Minister of Finance brought down several months ago. 
However, this bill is one which is now over a year old. I think 
people should know that.  We are finally getting around to 
implementing measures that were introduced in budget 1999 some 13 
or 14 months ago.  It is really quite ridiculous.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this bill also covers two ministries.  There are 
several amendments to acts which are under the co-ordination of 
the Minister of National Revenue and then others for the Minister 
of Finance.  This is an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the 
Excise Tax Act and the Budget Implementation Act, 1999.  We are 
really doing catch up here and I do not mean that in the sense of 
something we put on our fries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to also point out some of the individual topics 
that are covered and make little comments about them.  One of the 
measures in the bill is that the tax credits for individuals, the 
basic amounts and spousal amounts, are to be increased and the 
amounts are specified.  This is a lame halfway measure the 
government introduced last year to begin to index the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bracket creep has been a real problem. The government just loves 
to crow now about the fact that it has ended bracket creep.  We 
have been calling for that for six years.  For six years we have 
been saying to index all of the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 
particularly the basic exemptions so that people do not have a 
hidden increase in taxes every year.  Finally last year the 
government started to do something about it and it took further 
measures this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After my little lecture speaking about last year's budget I will 
mention about this year's budget. Now the government has said it 
will restore full indexation.  While I would like to put my hands 
together to applaud that, the government missed because in the 
last six years it has used bracket creep to ratchet up the amount 
Canadian taxpayers pay, to the tune of around $40 billion a year 
more tax revenue since the Liberals took office. That is since 
1993.  The Liberals have ratcheted up the income tax revenue over 
that time and now they say, “Are we not wonderful?  We are now 
going to keep it there”.  We were at a lower level; the 
government allowed it to go up and now says it will no longer 
increase it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, since I was a teacher and an instructor for 31 years 
I have the habit of showing graphs from the point of view of the 
people watching me.  When I raise my hand I presume that people 
will see a blackboard on which I am drawing a graph and they are 
looking at it and I am sort of behind it.  It is a skill I wish I 
could use here.  I would love to have graphics, charts, overhead 
projectors and animated graphs using a computer.  We would be 
able to communicate so much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is a very important one.  By lack of 
indexation over the last six years since the government took 
office, it has moved the basic rates up.  Now it says it will 
increase the rates no further.  As my colleague from Medicine Hat 
mentioned in his very fine speech, it is now claiming as taxes 
have been going up due to bracket creep, had the government not 
ended it in this year's budget it would keep on going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that based on what those rates would be 
in the next five years, it would be collecting a whole bunch of 
dollars but now it will not collect them and therefore the 
government will call that a tax cut and that will make everyone 
feel good.  The fact is it has been a huge tax increase from the 
1993 level to the 1999 level when the government started reducing 
the increase.  Now it claims the level is flat.  Let us hope the 
government keeps it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the elimination of an individual surtax. We promoted 
and proposed that both the 3% and the 5% surtaxes be eliminated.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1999 budget the Liberals undertook to eliminate the 3% 
last year, and I say great.  I guess we should give them credit 
when credit is due.  An income splitting tax is included in this 
legislation.  It is rather interesting.  While they talk about 
cutting taxes, here is one where they arrange to tax mostly young 
people.  A tax is added to the earnings of a person living in a 
home with his or her parents.  Those earnings are added to the 
income of the parent claiming an exemption.  They introduced a 
tax on passive income.  It is a tax increase no matter which way 
we slice it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could argue that it is only fair.  Why should one person be 
able to earn an income and have to pay tax on it and the other 
one not?  There is an element of fairness, but the fact of the 
matter is that they drew into the tax rolls individuals who were 
not there before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses a number of other issues.  One I found 
particularly interesting was the one on communal organizations. 
There are a number of such organizations.  We certainly have them 
in the west.  I have several of them in my riding as a matter of 
fact.  Instead of individuals owning farms there are communes. 
They are very successful farmers but do not own the land as 
individuals.  Instead they all live on it.  Actually they are 
delightful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any of my colleagues end up in western Canada and have an 
opportunity to visit one of the Hutterian Brethren communes it 
will be quite an experience.  All the young people are taught to 
work. They all participate in the task of putting bread and 
butter on the table.  They have animals.  They are also excellent 
grain farmers and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The particular measure provides that in order to compute the 
taxable income of communes they can apply the basic exemptions of 
all individuals who are part of the communes.  This seems fair. I 
do not think there is anything patently wrong with it.  I am not 
going to criticize it because I think it is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that 50 people are making their living from a farm. 
If they all owned little pieces of land they could all claim 
their basic exemptions.  None of them can claim personal incomes. 
They do not operate that way.  They all live together.  They 
share their food.  They share their accommodations and so on. The 
costs are paid by the commune.  To apply the collective 
exemptions of all of them to their income is a fair situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it makes me think of a shortcoming that I often think 
about, particularly with respect parents who choose to have one 
of them stay at home and look after the children.  That is also a 
form of commune.  Only one parent is earning an income and the 
other parent and the children are dependants.  Yet the government 
has never seen fit to apply a basic exemption for those members 
of the family who are not making an income.  They always have a 
reduced exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our solution 17 we have proposed this in various income tax 
projections over the last number of years.  We have been quite 
consistent in this regard. Both parents should enjoy the same 
basic exemption.  There should not be a differential.  Our 
solution 17 does the same thing. Whether it is a one income or a 
two income family it matters not. Each adult in the family would 
be eligible for a $10,000 basic exemption.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If they recognize the principle for communes of 50, I invite 
them to recognize and apply the principle to a commune of two:  a 
mom and a dad looking after their children.  Let us have a fair 
tax system so that we stop bleeding families dry and making it so 
difficult for them to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other issues in the bill.  I will skip 
right to the last one and make a comment on the bill before I say 
some general things.  The last one has to do with income taxes 
related to the hepatitis C trust.  We will remember that the 
Liberals were hammered for the fact that they wee very selective 
in whom they chose to give compensation.  In the rules that were 
set up, if a trust is set up and it earns interest that interest 
should be taxable.  They are talking about taxable income as a 
result of interest from these trusts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two days ago young Joey Haché was here again.  He is one of the 
young fellows who has been highlighting the whole hepatitis C 
issue.  So far we find that the bulk of the money paid out under 
that program has been to lawyers.  The victims of the hepatitis C 
scandal at this stage are still mostly struggling to get 
compensation to reach them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a few things in general about taxes.  It is 
interesting that the decisions we make in life are based on our 
perception of facts.  They are also usually based on certain 
assumptions.  Assumptions are sometimes a little different from 
facts because what we are doing is saying if we do this, then 
this is likely to happen.  Perhaps it is not 100% predictable. It 
is a non-repeatable experiment in many cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if I throw a glass of water out of a 12 storey 
building, chances are pretty good that when it hits the ground 
the glass will break.  If it actually breaks I cannot repeat the 
experiment of throwing it to see whether it will break a second 
time.  It is a non-repeatable experiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the case with some economic assumptions.  We often hear 
from the government in its budgetary policy that it is creating 
jobs.  It keeps talking about this, but no one ever admits on the 
other side that for every job it creates it is probably killing 
1.1 jobs.  Another way of putting that would be to say that for 
every 10 jobs it creates, it is killing 11.  The reason is very 
simple.  Canadian families are taxed to death.  With all three 
levels of government most Canadians will end up having half of 
their income confiscated from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought of something last week during the Easter recess.  I 
noticed that my garage roof was leaking.  That is unfortunate 
because the water falls on to the car and because it is a tar 
roof it marks the car.  I thought of the money I pay in taxes to 
help create jobs building a fountain in Shawinigan.  If I could 
have my taxes reduced I would have enough money to phone the 
roofer and ask him to come and fix my roof.  He would have a job 
for a day.  We know how much mismanagement and mishandling there 
has been of government funds.  The boondoggle has become quite a 
large issue in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that I have had this idea for many 
years.  When we take money away from people who have earned it, 
we are not creating new jobs.  We are moving the jobs. That is 
what we are doing.  If we take the overhead costs of that 
process, the cost of collecting the taxes and the whole 
bureaucracy of distributing the money, we recognize that maybe my 
ratio of 11 to 10 is wrong.  It is a number I have pulled out of 
the sky.  Maybe it is 15. 
Perhaps for every 10 jobs the government claims it creates 
through grants and contributions, the government is killing 15 
jobs in the economy.  I do not know what the number is.  Perhaps 
studies have been done that give us that information, but I have 
an idea that is a safe assumption.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would much rather leave more money in the hands of the people 
who earned it and have them create the jobs by having the roof 
fixed or by making a new business investment which would directly 
hire people.  To me the marketplace is a much better creator of 
jobs than the temporary jobs created by a handout government, 
especially at election time when we see these handouts peaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in May 2000 debating the budget brought down on February 
16, 1999, well over a year ago.  Most of these things have 
actually already been collected.  That is quite an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an increasing lack of respect for the taxation 
collection agencies in the country.  More and more people are 
beginning to question the legality of paying taxes and all these 
things.  I do believe in law and order and all that, and I really 
do not think the so-called anti-tax people who claim that it is 
unconstitutional to collect taxes are right.  Even if they were, 
I would still like to have a tax regime that works.  I want to 
maintain the structure of solid government, such as we have in 
this country, but not with excessive taxes.  When we behave this 
way we build a stronger case for them to reject our tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of items for which the people have already 
filled in their forms.  They have filed their taxes on this 
basis.  Strictly speaking, we have not yet passed the orders into 
law.  Those people who claim that this is not constitutional or 
not legal could probably win in the supreme court.  I hate to say 
that, but they probably could because the court would have to 
rule that it would be illegal for the government to collect the 
tax or in some cases to make an exemption which had not yet been 
passed into law.  I think that is regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should make sure when it has a budget that it 
deals forthwith in implementing the provisions of the new budget 
so that people can have confidence that what they are being asked 
to do is legal.  I regret that my time is up because I could 
speak for hours on the whole issue of taxation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened to the hon. member 
for Elk Island finally get to budget 1999, but in his preamble he 
talked extensively about the reindexation of the income tax 
system which occurred in budget 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about the flat tax.  People understand 
that the flat tax or solution 17 is not a progressive tax.  In 
other words, it moves the tax burden from high income Canadians 
to middle income Canadians.  For example, a single taxpayer 
earning $30,000 would receive a tax reduction of 12% while a 
similar taxpayer earning $200,000 would receive a tax cut of 39%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know it is not progressive but we hear about the simplicity 
where people will fill in a form with their income and they will 
just take 17%.  I heard the member talk about various deductions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have the information on solution 17.  Under solution 17 
will there be various deductions and tax credits?  For example 
right now under our tax system we have deductions for RRSP 
contributions, pension contributions, charitable donations, 
medical expenses over a certain amount, union dues, professional 
fees and special tax considerations for people with disabilities. 
Will items of that nature still apply under solution 17 or will 
it just be a matter of taking one's income and applying a 
percentage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I need to congratulate the 
parliamentary secretary. That is such a super question.  He could 
not have asked a better question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is this myth going around that the single rate tax, which 
is different from the flat tax, is a tax break for the rich.  It 
is not.  It is an equalization of the tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic exemptions are increased dramatically. We are going to 
give a percentage tax cut indeed to the average Canadian 
taxpayer.  However the people who benefit the most are the 
families.  For example a mom and a dad and two kids who earn 
$26,000, I do not have the numbers right at my fingertips on how 
much tax they would pay under the Liberal government but whatever 
it is, we are giving them a 100% tax break. Every tax dollar that 
they have paid they now will no longer have to pay.  They get off 
the tax rolls completely because there is a $10,000 basic 
exemption for each of the adults and $3,000 for each of the two 
children which is $6,000. That is $26,000 they earn before they 
pay a single penny of tax.  They get a 100% tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to apologize for the fact that even those who are 
making more money also get a tax break.  It is time for us to 
stop punishing people who earn money in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person is making $50,000 or $60,000, and if they earn an 
extra $5,000, I can see where we are going to tax them on that 
extra income.  However I reject the hypothesis that as they earn 
more we have to take a higher and higher proportion of it because 
that totally stifles economic growth and it kills the enthusiasm 
and joy of our citizens. If they earn $10,000, let them pay twice 
as much more tax as the ones that earn $5,000 more.  I am talking 
about after those basic exemptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question the member asked had to do with the 
deductions from taxable income for all of the other expenditures. 
The short answer is that most of the deductions that are in 
place now would still remain in place.  It is not a flat tax per 
se.  It is a single rate tax.  It simply means that there is a 
certain level on which earners pay no tax and after that it is 
17% on every additional dollar after the basic exemptions. They 
still will be able to apply, for example, their deductions for 
charitable donations and others. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my colleague was giving some very enlightening 
comments on our 17% tax proposal.  I want him to carry on a bit 
to clarify and enlighten all of us here and the viewing audience 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us keep this real simple and use the example of a husband 
and wife with no kids on the scene.  I have a brother and his 
wife who are in that situation.  If they had an income of $40,000 
and they each had this $10,000 exemption, in effect they are 
going to be paying 17% tax on that additional $20,000.  Am I 
correct in understanding that they are not going to be paying 17% 
on that second $20,000, from $20,000 to $40,000?  At that level 
they will not be paying 17%.  It would be much less. In fact one 
would have to have a fairly good wage before one would be paying 
anywhere close to that actual 17%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, again it depends very much on 
the individual situation.  Let us talk of two adults, a husband 
and a wife, who earn $20,000 between them.  If they have no 
deductions, then they would pay 17% on $20,000 which would be 
$3,400.  That would be their total tax but the effective rate for 
them would actually be 8.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beauty of this tax system is that for each incremental or 
marginal increase in one's income, the tax is linear.  I am 
speaking as a mathematician.  It does not go up exponentially as 
it does with the Liberal scheme where if we make more and more 
the Liberals take a higher and higher percentage of it.  We 
propose to take a constant percentage.  Therefore, it is a 
truly—and what is the opposite of a regressive tax system—a 
progressive tax system.  Those people who make $20,000 would pay 
zero.  As the income goes up, the total amount that is paid in 
taxation goes up in a really nice continual curve.  It does not 
have big leaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear these horror stories about people who got a raise or 
overtime pay but had less on their paycheques than if they had 
not worked that extra time.  They got into a higher bracket. 
That will never happen with our system because it is a linear 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very good question and I appreciated the opportunity to 
answer it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, one other thing my colleague from Elk Island did not 
mention is the impact of the underground economy on our tax 
system.  Many people in the country feel our tax system is so 
unfair that they actually hide income.  They put it under the 
table.  That is part of this fair 17% solution which very few of 
my colleagues across the way seem to understand.  If people feel 
the tax system is fair, they are far less likely to go through 
the process of hiding their income. Could my colleague comment on 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am no different from other 
members of parliament.  I am sure everyone in the House who is 
willing to admit it has heard stories and knows of some cases 
firsthand, as I do, of individuals who quote two prices to do 
something, for example to fix the roof.  There is a price if they 
are paid cash and a price if they have to issue a tax receipt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I think that is deplorable.  It is really wrong for an 
individual to avoid the tax system.  What he or she should do is 
help to elect a Canadian Alliance government to fix the tax 
system.  Until that happens, people should really comply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate the problem is huge. I remember way back in 1993 
when the Liberals were first elected and the Conservatives had 
been in power. Even then, because of the GST, it was stated that 
probably all of the deficit, which was estimated to be around $40 
billion but it turned out to be larger, but $40 billion a year of 
government revenue was lost because of the underground economy. 
We never know exactly how much it is because the people who do 
not comply are the ones that are not tracked. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to put a few points on the record in 
the five minutes that remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to look across the way.  It is almost a state 
of denial.  Look at where 40 years of successive tax and spend 
governments have put us.  I will show myself as being a little 
long in the tooth, but I remember in the 1950s when we went to 
the United States and put a dollar on the table, we got $1.12 
back or $1.09.  The Canadian dollar was worth more than the 
American dollar but today it is below 67 cents. 
That did not happen by osmosis; it happened through government 
policies.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We consistently get the denial from across the way “Well, we 
always look at our pals in the United States.  It is the United 
States that we always look to”.  In some ways we do, because the 
Americans have the luxury of an economy that is going far faster, 
in multiples of what ours is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have to make a comparison, we do not have to go down to 
the United States.  We just have to compare my home province of 
British Columbia with its next door neighbour Alberta to see what 
different taxation policies can do.  We not only have the Liberal 
government to contend with but we also have the provincial NDP 
government and British Columbia has been put on its knees with 
the cumulative effect of the two.  Compare that to Alberta which 
basically has no sales tax and has a very envious record.  Again, 
that is through public policy, policies of successive governments 
that have gone in the direction of building the economy, not 
knocking it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just a simplistic answer.  We have interprovincial 
trade barriers, for example.  We have talked about it. It is a 
huge cauldron. In Ontario and Quebec it is a one-way street with 
workers going across one way but it is not reciprocal the other 
way. That is a simple example of the trade barriers in one 
province not being the same in others.  It goes right across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about our debt?  I started out by saying our dollar was 
$1.12 compared to a U.S. dollar 50 years ago, and it is now down 
to 67 cents.  Back in those days we had a very tiny debt.  The 
reason our dollar is down on its knees is the huge burden. The 
world markets are looking at Canada and saying that with this 
huge debt we have hanging over us, they do not have faith in our 
economy and they do not have faith in our dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would like the government to address that.  For 
example, the U.S. plans to pay off its debt in about 13 years. 
Australia plans to do it in about three years.  With the 
forecasting from the finance minister, in Canada it is something 
like 190 years at the present rate.  There is no political will 
to move forward to attack that debt so that we can bring the 
economy forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the cumulative effect of taxes, of debt and of legislation 
that does not favour business.  In fact, it penalizes business. 
It penalizes.  It is as if it is a crime in this country to make 
a buck.  This is with tongue in cheek but basically with the 
Liberal policy, the simple tax form in part <I>A</I> asks how much 
money we made and part <I>B</I> says to send it in.  That is about 
where this government has been going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are on their knees. They are taxed not only federally, 
but in some cases we have a provincial regime that does not work, 
and the municipalities as well. This country needs to get its tax 
burden across the board under control. All levels of government 
have to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen other countries that we have to compete with.  I 
mentioned earlier in a question Japan, Taiwan and now China. 
These are countries that started off at the low end but through 
the years and with progressive government policies that favour 
industry and productivity have moved forward.  These are the 
economies we as Canadians have to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am running out of time, so I will wind up.  On the tax issue, 
if there is just one message I wish the government would really 
listen to, it is that we need to lower taxes at all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I have to interrupt 
the hon. member at this time.  The next time the bill is brought 
before the House, the hon. member will have about 14 minutes 
remaining.

<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK255">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
introduce amendments to Part III of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act so that the Office of the Correctional 
Investigator would report directly to Parliament and that its 
recommendations would be binding rather than simple 
recommendations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Madam Speaker, Motion M-228, which I am putting before 
the House today, deals with Part III of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, which deals with the correctional 
investigator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Corrections and Conditional Release Act is now being 
reviewed by a subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights. While the conditional release procedure seems 
to capture the interest of the general public and of members of 
the House, the same is not true of Part III of the act, which 
deals with the correctional investigator. In my opinion, this is 
a very important part of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee reviewing the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act will propose certain improvements to the Office of 
the Correctional Investigator. These improvements are acceptable, 
but I believe they are not sufficient to give the correctional 
investigator the powers he should have, given the importance of 
his functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have decided to draw the government's attention to 
that part of the act. I call upon the government to give more 
powers to the Office of the Correctional Investigator and to 
introduce the necessary amendments. Allow me to explain why the 
government should seriously consider my motion and the proposals 
it contains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I think it is important to remind the House that, 
as stated in section 3, the purpose of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act is, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by (<I>a</I>) 
carrying out sentences imposed by courts through the safe and 
humane custody and supervision of offenders; and (<I>b</I>) assisting 
the rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the 
community as law-abiding citizens through the provision of 
programs in penitentiaries and in the community. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of the Correctional Service of Canada 
to look after the custody of offenders and set up programs that 
contribute to their rehabilitation and successful reintegration 
into the community. The correctional service must also prepare 
inmates for their release and supervise conditional and statutory 
releases, as well as the long term supervision of some offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner of corrections has the control and management 
of the service and all matters connected with the service. The 
commissioner reports to the minister, in this case, the Solicitor 
General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the act, the correctional investigator conducts 
investigations into the problems of offenders related to 
decisions, recommendations, acts or omissions of the commissioner 
or any person under the control and management of the 
commissioner that affect inmates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should be noted that the reasons for complaints are many. It 
could be a transfer or something to do with the special handling 
unit, access to rehabilitation programs, double bunking, health 
care and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main function of the correctional investigator is to conduct 
investigations and settle the complaints of each offender. The 
correctional investigator may conduct an investigation either on 
his own initiative or following a complaint by an inmate or a 
request by the minister. 
Unfounded or inappropriate decisions might compromise chances of 
success of rehabilitation and, in the longer term, they might 
also affect the public's security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After having conducted an investigation, if the correctional 
investigator determines that there actually is a problem 
regarding one or more offenders, he must submit a report to the 
commissioner. The correctional investigator adds to his report a 
motivated opinion if he considers that the commissioner has 
contravened the law or an established guideline or rendered an 
unreasonable, unfair, oppressive or unduly discriminatory 
decision. He will also give a motivated opinion if the 
commissioner exercised his discretionary power for improper 
purposes, irrelevant reasons or no reason.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The correctional investigator must also include in his report 
the recommendations he deems appropriate and which are relevant 
to complaints from inmates. These recommendations ensure that 
systemic concerns within penitentiaries are dealt with properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the correctional investigator has jurisdiction 
over special detention units, grievance procedure, case 
preparation, access to rehabilitation programs, double bunking, 
as I mentioned, transfers, the use of force, injuries to inmates, 
and other matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, the investigator has important duties and he 
must deal with both sensitive and complicated matters. As 
mentioned in his departmental performance report for the period 
ending March 31, 1999, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Office aims to assure the Canadian public that the federal 
correctional system is managed efficiently, equitably and fairly. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the recommendations or findings of the 
correctional investigator following an investigation are not 
binding on the commissioner of corrections. With the current 
legislation, when the commissioner of corrections does not take 
action within a reasonable time after the correctional 
investigator has presented his report, the latter may inform the 
solicitor general of the situation and provide him with the 
information originally provided to the commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the act says that the minister must act on the advice 
of the correctional investigator. The investigator must submit 
annually a report of the activities of his office to the 
solicitor general, who introduces it in the two houses of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the decision-making power of the correctional 
investigator is quite limited. 
Furthermore, the appointment process does not guarantee total 
independence or neutrality. Indeed, the correctional 
investigator is presently appointed by the governor in council. 
In other words, the minister is his boss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the importance of the correctional investigator's 
role, I believe that changes are in order and that the 
government must act. Therefore, I submit that, to start with, 
the government must amend the act to make the correctional 
investigator accountable to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that he would be appointed by parliament. In legal 
terms, the provision could read something like this: the 
incumbent shall be appointed by commission under the Great Seal 
after approval of the appointment by resolution of the Senate 
and the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this appointment process, the appointee shall report to 
parliament and, at the end of each year, submit an activity 
report. This report may include recommendations regarding the 
changes in legislation that are deemed desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once tabled, this activity report is referred to a committee 
designated or established by parliament pursuant to the act to 
monitor the enforcement of the act and its regulations. This 
designated committee also oversees the implementation of the 
reports tabled by the person responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this change in the correctional investigator 
appointment process would really improve the role of the 
investigator, who would be accountable to parliament, which would 
give the function a more independent and impartial status than it 
currently has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some recommendations of the correctional investigator could be 
implemented at this level by the committee responsible for 
monitoring the enforcement of the act. The commissioner of 
official languages and the information commissioner are two 
examples of people who are accountable to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of his or her position, the correctional investigator 
can identify weaknesses in the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act and see how it impacts on the prisoners and their 
rehabilitation. Any improvement of the status of the correctional 
investigator is likely to improve the very complex system 
provided for in the act. For these reasons, this change in the 
appointment process of the correctional investigator is 
desirable.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government ought to do more, this, in my opinion, is 
the first change that should be made to this act. Genuine 
decision making power must be given to the correctional 
investigator by making his recommendations binding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen, at present, the commissioner is not bound by 
the recommendations made to him by the correctional investigator 
after a prisoner's complaint has been investigated. The only 
recourse, as the case may be, that the correctional investigator 
has to ensure his conclusions are acted on is to inform the 
solicitor general that the commissioner failed to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several avenues could be explored by the government to ensure 
that the recommendations of the correctional investigator are 
binding. The government could simply change the existing 
legislation so as to direct the commissioner to follow the 
recommendations of the correctional investigator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between April 1, 1998 and March 31, 1999, the correctional 
investigator received 4,529 complaints made by inmates or on 
their behalf. The correctional investigator's workload is 
considerable. Moreover, the correctional investigator must make 
sure that custodial provisions are appropriate and look after 
the rehabilitation of inmates, while ensuring public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I encourage the government to introduce amendments 
to the appointment process, so as to give the correctional 
investigator an independent status, as I said earlier. 
I also say to the government it should introduce amendments to 
the legislation in order to give some real authority to the 
correctional investigator.  In fact, the correctional 
investigator knows that I have moved this motion in the House 
today and he is, in his own words, totally in agreement with 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to stress that this motion is absolutely non-partisan.  I 
believe that all parties in the House stand to benefit from the 
correctional investigator reporting directly to parliament.  We 
want to make sure that this function is real, efficient and 
independent.  I believe this concerns us all as 
parliamentarians, whatever our political allegiance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs has not 
selected the motion I am submitting to the House this evening as 
a votable item, even if the issue is of primary importance.  I 
think it is unfortunate that we cannot vote on such a serious 
issue.  In spite of that, I have addressed the House on the 
subject, and other members may do so for a total of one hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the use of debating for one hour if the members will 
never have the opportunity to vote on the issue?  My speech 
tonight will certainly convince several members of the validity 
of my motion, but no concrete measure will be taken following 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tempted to say that we are wasting time and precious 
resources. 
Members of parliament work very hard to introduce motions and 
bills on issues affecting the general public. That is why all 
members should have the opportunity to vote on such initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of motions and bills by private members allows 
them to speak for their constituents. It is also an opportunity 
for other members to express the views of their constituents on 
the issues before the House. To deny members the possibility to 
vote on these initiatives is to withdraw a basic vehicle for 
action in our democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I think that out of respect for the voters and for 
the position of members of parliament, the issues submitted by 
private members to the House should all be votable items. Do 
members not believe that talking for the sake of talking is a 
waste of taxpayers' money? No, that is not why we were elected. I 
think that the job members of parliament do is a serious one and 
the motions and bills they introduce should be treated as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that I am a little embarrassed to be doing this tonight. 
I know that I am not alone in this regard. As a matter of fact 
several other hon. members already expressed their views on 
votable items in 1996, before the subcommittee on private 
members' business of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us thought that there were not enough votable bills and 
motions in spite of the importance of the issues. Many also 
thought that all the bills and motions by private members should 
be voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I urge all hon. members who share this view to keep 
on working to change the way things are done in the House. 
Furthermore, the subcommittee I mentioned recently sent a 
questionnaire concerning Private Members' Business, and I hope 
all hon. members take the opportunity to express their view on 
this matter.

order, I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to finish my 
speech. There are only two sentences left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Does the hon. member have 
the unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne:</B> Madam Speaker, I will conclude by saying 
that if members have not yet taken advantage of the fact that 
they are being consulted on whether they want all motions and 
bills to be made votable, I invite them to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together, we should succeed in changing this practice that leads 
us nowhere. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, we have before us Motion M-228, 
which deals with the office of the correctional investigator. 
This motion asks the government to introduce legislative 
amendments to have the correctional investigator report to 
parliament directly, and not through the solicitor general, as 
is the case now. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For reasons which I will explain in greater detail, I simply 
cannot support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the criminal justice system has held a place of 
prominence in parliament in recent months.  The Minister of 
Justice has initiated action in the area of youth justice.  Her 
extensive proposals are still being considered by the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights.  In the last session, 
among other initiatives, she oversaw the passage of significant 
additions to victims rights legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has done his share of legislative reform 
by extending the protection of young Canadians from sexual 
predators with amendments to the Criminal Records Act, which has 
just received royal assent. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our justice system is being updated practically on a continual 
basis. In fact, one could consider that correctional reform was 
undertaken when the Parole Act and the Penitentiary Act were 
replaced by the new Corrections and Conditional Release Act that 
was passed in 1992. It is in that new act that the Office of the 
Correctional Investigator was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In establishing that office through legislation, the government 
reinforced the right of inmates to have access to a grievance 
process, while ensuring better protection of their right to be 
treated in a fair and humanitarian manner. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take pride in our worldwide reputation for maintaining a 
correctional system which acts fairly while pursuing its primary 
goal of public protection.  I fear, however, that Motion No. 228 
would change our law in ways not envisaged or intended by those 
who drafted, debated and later amended legislation which became 
the Corrections and Conditional Release Act as we know it today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion M-228 asks us to reconsider an aspect of the office of 
the correctional investigator that could have been included in 
the 1992 legislative package, an item that was indeed proposed by 
some witnesses and committee members during the hearings before 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the proposal was rejected, and it is no more desirable today 
than it was then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out that we are expecting the report of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights dealing with the 
most recent review of the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has said that he looks forward to 
receiving the recommendations of the subcommittee, and I am 
certain that he will consider those recommendations very 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 228, however, proposes a change to this act, and a 
change which I cannot support. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time I have left, I will try to shed some light on the 
way the Office of the Correctional Investigator currently reports 
and explain why this proposal is not judicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general is responsible for the federal 
correctional agencies, of which there are two: the Correctional 
Service of Canada and the Parole Board of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is accountable to parliament, thus to the Canadian 
public; moreover, he has the mandate to make the necessary 
changes—when they are called for—to the policies and practices 
of these agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the correctional investigator reports to the minister, as 
is the case now, he brings his concerns directly to the attention 
of the system's responsibility centre. If the report contains 
recommendations that it would be appropriate to implement, the 
solicitor general encourages the government to take the necessary 
measures accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their is no chance these reports will get lost along the way, or 
shelved as they say, because not only does this series of 
legislative measures make it mandatory for the solicitor general 
to present such a report, but also the act categorically states 
that it must be tabled in parliament by the solicitor general 
within 90 days. In short, the correctional agencies are 
independently monitored and reports must be submitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And besides, there is another important element, of course. 
The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, of which the 
author of the motion is a member, may examine, at its own 
discretion, the annual reports and special reports of the 
correctional investigator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions may be asked about the follow-up given to 
recommendations made by the investigator, either in his annual 
report or in his special reports. Questions may also be asked 
about the way complaints lodged by inmates have been dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore today's motion is totally redundant. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are living in times of tremendous change.  You, Madam 
Speaker, and all of my colleagues are well aware that change is 
experienced no less by the criminal justice system than it is by 
any other institution in our society. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the last decade has seen a great deal of activity in 
the area of criminal justice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is our justice system working?  Is it indeed protecting our most 
vulnerable citizens?  Are our actions in line with our speech in 
terms of making the safety of Canadians of paramount concern to 
the Government of Canada? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government was well prepared to deal with those 
difficulties. I would add that Canadians are not asking us to 
allow inmates to submit their problems directly to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rights of offenders imprisoned or on conditional release are 
protected by the law and by international codes of ethics, of 
which Canada is a signatory. Besides, the rights of individuals 
living under the authority of the correctional system are 
protected by legislative provisions on human rights, as well as 
by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely do not believe that the motion moved—in all good 
faith—by my colleague, who is a hard worker, will improve those 
protections in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, what interests me most is that this proposal can in 
no way guarantee better protection of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, since this motion can neither improve protection of 
the public nor increase the public's confidence in the 
correctional system, this motion is useless, in my opinion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am honoured to enter the debate on this justice issue 
brought forward by the hon. member for Saint-Bruno—Saint Hubert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing once again the issue of justice and 
sentencing.  I vacillate back and forth between the whole concept 
of holding people accountable for their actions in a meaningful 
way while at the same time upholding a very important principle 
in which I strongly believe.  The principle I am talking about is 
our justice system, which in all aspects should be based on the 
principle that it is the safety of law-abiding citizens which 
should take pre-eminence in all cases.  I also very firmly 
believe that if the rights of a victim and the rights of an 
accused collide, then the rights of the victim should take 
precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this motion was brought forth today out of a sense of 
frustration with our justice system in Canada.  I do not want to 
particularly pick on the current Minister of Justice, since I do 
not think the situation was substantially better under the 
previous minister.  The way the justice system works in Canada is 
very seriously flawed.  We have a minister who, unfortunately, 
does not respond well to issues which are very important to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have more than 500,000 names on petitions asking the 
government to do something with respect to the possession of 
child pornography.  The Minister of Justice simply wrings her 
hands and says “I cannot do anything”.  Canadians do not 
understand that.  They do not like it and they have expressed 
that to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned in an earlier speech today that I spent a number of 
hours at trade fairs in two of the major centres in my riding in 
the last couple of weeks.  One of the issues that came up over 
and over was the issue of child pornography.  I can see my 
colleague being motivated to bring forward her motion when the 
minister does not respond to issues such as child pornography. 
The member is really bypassing the minister with her motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the annual report of the correctional 
investigator is tabled in the House by the minister.  It is 
required by statute that the report be tabled in the House so 
that it will be available to all of us.  Consequently, the 
minister can sit on it and forget about it.  There is never a 
requirement to actually act on any of the recommendations.  I can 
understand the member's frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel bad about this because I know this motion has come 
forward from correct motivation.  I wish the member had worded it 
a little differently, because then I would have supported it 
quite heartily.  However, I have a real concern with a motion 
which lets a correctional officer prepare a report with 
recommendations that are binding on the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we actually so arrange our affairs, we are in danger that 
parliament will not be supreme.  We have already done that thanks 
to former Prime Minister Trudeau who brought in the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms with its overriding control over 
future parliaments.  We have lost our autonomy.  We no longer 
have a parliament that can pass a law based on the majority in a 
democratic process either of our people or of our representatives 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am reading this motion right, the primary flaw that I see 
is that the motion would further erode the supremacy of 
parliament.  I am sure the hon. member will correct me during her 
last five minute speech if I am wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way I read it, the motion states, and I quote, 
“recommendations would be binding rather than simple 
recommendations”.  It means that the recommendations made in 
that report to parliament would not be debated or passed by the 
House.  If they were, there would be no choice but to adopt those 
recommendations.  I think that would be unwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undoubtedly many of the recommendations would be valid and would 
carry the support, but if there were recommendations that were 
not supported by the majority of either our citizens or, by 
projection, their representatives in this place, then we ought 
not to allow yet another individual or small committee somewhere 
out there, that is neither elected nor accountable, to dictate to 
Canadians how the conditional system works.  As I see it, that is 
the most serious flaw in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like to say that we need to seriously look at 
the whole question of sentencing and we need to have better 
feedback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to have a major institution located a few miles from 
the boundary of my riding.  Many of the people who work at that 
institution live in my riding.  They live in the towns of Fort 
Saskatchewan, Gibbons or Bon Accord.  They work at that 
institution and they express their concerns to me. Many of the 
things that happen in Correctional Service Canada are not really 
geared toward the protection of citizens they way they ought to 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for bringing this motion forward.  I 
certainly sympathize with her frustration with the system.  We do 
need to look at the way this reporting should be done.  However, 
it would have been better if she had moved a motion that said 
that those recommendations must be dealt with in the House within 
a certain length of time and that a subsequent vote on those 
recommendations would be a free vote, as Private Members' 
Business is.  Perhaps that would have been a better way to 
accomplish the goals she is seeking.
