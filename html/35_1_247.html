	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
October 25 marks the second anniversary of our government's 
election. Two years ago, Canadians across the country decided to 
elect a government that reflected them, one they trusted.
<P>
	The popular support our government has enjoyed in these past 24 
months demonstrates clearly our ability to identify the public's real 
needs. The challenges are considerable. We are working tirelessly 
to put the economy back on track and we are confident we will 
make good all of our campaign commitments by the end of our 
mandate.
<P>
	Canadians want the changes we support, and we are sure that, if 
we continue to work together, Canada will long remain the best 
country in the world.

ago today, on October 25, 1993, the people of Canada sent 52 
Reform MPs to Ottawa. They did so because we as a party 
promised to put their interests as constituents first. Today my 
Reform colleagues and I thank our constituents for helping us to 
keep that promise.
<P>
	A special thanks goes out to the people of Lethbridge 
constituency for participating in the first leg of my annual fall tour. 
In places like Diamond City, Picture Butte, Nobleford and Milk 
River they talked about issues that were important to them, things 
like jobs, pensions, agriculture and certainly the referendum.
<P>
	They told me about their hopes and their fears. They reminded 
me what it meant to be their representative in Ottawa. The main 
streets and the coffee shops of southern Alberta are a long way 
from Parliament Hill.
<P>
	Many of my constituents will never have the opportunity to visit 
the nation's capital, but the Reform Party believes that by 
effectively representing their interests in this House of Commons 
we will be able to bridge that distance.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have not been able to say this for a long time but 
thank you, Mr. Speaker.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to appeal to all my fellow Canadians in Quebec who 
may be thinking of voting yes on October 30 as a way of protesting 
against the policies of this federal Liberal government, against this 
Prime Minister, against the corporate agenda, against the current 
constitutional impasse, whatever, to think again.
<P>
	Governments and prime ministers come and go. What is in the 
interests of all of us and the world is that Canada remain and that 
progressive Canadians stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of 
social justice in the Canada we built together in the last 50 years.
<P>
	We have been an example to the world. Let us not commit the sin 
of sowing despair when we should be sowing hope, for what hope 
is there for others who are not so richly blessed if Canadians cannot 
find a way to live together.
<P>
	I have always believed that Canada has a mission to be a light to 
the nations and that Quebec in Canada was integral to that mission. 
The rest of Canada has not always nurtured that light but that light 
for the next few days is in the care and keeping of Quebecers alone. 
I appeal to them not to snuff it out.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, MMT is the 
only available gasoline additive in Canada that can reduce nitrogen 
oxide emissions by as much as 20 per cent. These emissions cause 
urban smog.
<P>
	A ban on MMT would have the effect of adding one million cars 
to Canadian roads by the year 2000. MMT  lets Canadian refiners

<P>
use less intensive refining which also cuts down on other types of 
emissions that hurt the environment. In Saint John which has the 
biggest oil refinery in Canada this is important.
<P>
	The environment minister with Bill C-94 wants to remove MMT 
from Canadian gas because she says it will harmonize Canada's 
standards with the U.S. where MMT is not used. She has also stated 
that automakers claim that MMT harms their onboard diagnostic 
systems. Independent studies and American courts have said that 
there is no such link. Within weeks MMT will be used in U.S. 
refineries.

number of Canadians learning French has increased enormously in 
the past fifteen years. Thanks to the policy on bilingualism, 
thousands of young people across Canada are learning French. At 
first, the debate was fierce, but, little by little, Canadians learned 
the importance of bilingualism and of the French language.
<P>
	And so, immersion classes started throughout Canada, and, in 
British Columbia, 3,000 kilometres from Quebec, many 
anglophone parents decided their children would learn the second 
language of their country and join with  francophones outside 
Quebec, who speak both English and French. We have come a long 
way. The policy on bilingualism has served our country well, and I 
would like to join the many Canadians who believe in a bilingual 
Canada and who continue to live together in harmony despite their 
race, colour and beliefs, and believe in a united Canada.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="15805"> 15805 </A></B>
<P>
Prime Minister made an about-face and promised Quebecers 
change as an incentive to vote No in the upcoming referendum.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Labour. Would she 
agree that these last minute promises, made in a panic by the Prime 
Minister a week from the referendum, sound very familiar to 
Quebecers who remember the referendum in 1980?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister of Canada explained his 
point of view to all those who believe in the No side, saying how 
serious the situation and the choice made on October 30 were for 
the future of our country, and that this was a choice Quebecers had 
never had to make before in their entire history, because just one 
vote would mean the break up of Canada.
<P>
	So the Prime Minister urged all Quebecers to think carefully 
before they voted, to think carefully about what Canada is today, 
what Quebecers are today, before they go and vote. That was 
basically the Prime Minister's message last night.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
discussing the complete about-face made by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I therefore want to ask the Minister of Labour why Quebecers 
should trust someone who made promises to them last night, when 
only last Sunday in New York, he bluntly rejected the demands of 
Daniel Johnson, the chair of the No committee? Why should we 
trust the man who betrayed Quebec in 1982?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Once again, my dear colleagues, I would ask you 
to be very careful about your choice of words used in both 
questions and answers.
<P>
	This is a question and answer period, so I hope we can keep 
reasonably calm.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, unlike the hon. member for Roberval, the Prime Minister 
of Canada is aware of the gravity of the situation and does not take 
the destruction of this country lightly.
<P>
	This country is not just any country. It is the best country in the 
world. And the Prime Minister of Canada has always been a proud 
francophone, a proud Quebecer and a proud Canadian. In this, he is 
like the majority of Quebecers who are proud to be Quebecers but 
are also attached to their country, Canada. That is where the Bloc 
Quebecois is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
editorial writer for the <I>Daily Gleaner</I> in Fredericton wrote the 
following on Monday, and this is a translation: ``At the beginning 
of the referendum, the rest of Canada was asked to remain silent''. 
In return for that silence, assurances were given that there would be 
no promise of constitutional change for Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Labour agree that this revelation of an 
agreement between the Prime Minister of Canada and people in the 
other provinces outside Quebec is strangely similar to what 
happened that night in 1980, when Quebec was betrayed by the 
same man, the same-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I want to ask the hon. member for Roberval to 
please change the word he used. I would appreciate it if this word 
were not used in the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, to conform to your instructions, I 
will change the word I used. So is this not strangely similar to what 
happened at a time Quebecers remember with sadness in their 
hearts, when they had problems with the same man, in the same 
way, with the same players and for the same reasons?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, oddly enough, in this referendum campaign, the three 
leaders who want the break up of this country had to sign an 
agreement among themselves. It is the only written agreement in 
this referendum campaign. On the other side, we have Quebecers 
who do not want the break up of this country, and to share the same 
goal, we do not need an agreement in writing.
<P>
	If there is anyone today who could not care less about the distinct 
society concept that we as Quebecers support, it is the leader of the 
Yes side who said in no uncertain terms: ``To hell with a distinct 
society. We want a country''. That is what the choice is about on 
October 30. It is about the break up of Canada as we know it today, 
and that is why it is such a serious matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Prime Minister made the following 
statement, and I quote: ``Any changes in constitutional jurisdiction 
will only be made with the consent of Quebecers''. This somewhat 
ambiguous statement is devoid of any meaning; moreover, the 
Prime Minister took great care not to pronounce the words ``right 
of veto'', but rather allowed the idea to circulate without ever 
stating it.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Labour confirm that the Prime Minister's 
statement does not in any way constitute a right of veto as Quebec 
has always understood and demanded it, but is instead a vague 
promise that is more or less devoid of meaning?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think this is evidence of a lack of desire to properly 
understand what the Prime Minister of Canada said yesterday. The 
Prime Minister of Canada was very clear about the distinct society 
and said that he accepted it.
<P>
	He was very clear in stating that the constitutional changes 
affecting Quebec will be made after consultation with Quebecers. 
He was very clear in stating that this  country is undergoing a very 
great transformation in preparation for the 21st century and that it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15806"> 15806 </A></B>
<P>
was his heartfelt wish that Quebecers participate fully in these 
changes for the 21st century. That was the Prime Minister's 
message.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister is not being very clear. What she was asked 
involved the right to veto, changes with the consent of Quebecers, 
these being the words of the Prime Minister, but as usual she is not 
answering the question. I shall attempt another.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Labour tell us what reassurance there is for 
Quebecers in such a statement by the Prime Minister, when in 1992 
he overrode the virtually unanimous opposition of the parties 
represented in the Quebec National Assembly, including the 
Liberal Party of Quebec, of which she was not so very long ago a 
member, and the leader of the present Liberal Party had voted 
against unilateral patriation of the Constitution? This Prime 
Minister was therefore identifying himself as a Quebecer at the 
time, and Quebecers were represented at that time by 74 Liberal 
members in the House of Commons. How can there be any 
confidence in a person who has reneged on his commitment to 
Quebec?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the present Prime Minister of Canada is very aware of the 
whole constitutional history of this country. He is also well aware 
of what has happened in Quebec. He understands very well, too, the 
disappointment some Quebecers may have felt at certain points in 
the history of this country. For the past two years, however, this 
Prime Minister has been leading this country; let us look at what he 
has done in those two years to respond to the needs of all 
Canadians, to respond to their concerns, their needs.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister of Canada speaks, I feel that we can 
judge him very well by the actions he has undertaken in the past 
two years as the Prime Minister of this country. He did not govern 
by ``referendum'' for the past two years; he has acted, and he has 
governed this country.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have been very 
clear on this side of the House and have agreed with the position 
put forward by the hon. member and his party as to the need for 
fundamental change.
<P>
	We have also said in two successive budgets that what we were 
doing was not simply cutting spending but redefining the role of 
government because that must happen in the modern age.
<P>
	In that area there are items on which we may or may not agree. 
We have said that as far as we are concerned the best controls on 
spending we can have are short term targets on which the 
government's feet are held to the fire. That is what has enabled us 
to hit our targets consistently and that is what we intend to continue 
with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the biggest problem with our current Constitution is not so 
much its content but its application. The federal government has 
used its spending power to encroach on provincial areas of 
jurisdiction such as natural resources, manpower training, social 
services, language, culture and so forth.
<P>
	The answer to the separatists is a more balanced federation 
which can be done by re-examining and reducing the federal role in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Is the federal government open to this type of change, a simple 
withdrawal from provincial areas of jurisdiction, again changes 
that can be made without constitutional wrangling?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only is the federal 
government open to that kind of change but in looking at what has 
happened over the course of the last two years, we have done this in 
a number of areas.
<P>
	The hon. member should look at the great openness displayed by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development concerning ways 
he would work with the provinces. He should look at what the 
Minister of Natural Resources has done. Look at regional agencies. 
Within Quebec we have taken 43 programs down to one to 
concentrate on small and medium size business and the delivery of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15807"> 15807 </A></B>
<P>
federal government programs. In department after department we 
have effected that kind  of change and we have done it without any 
constitutional discussion.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	The federal government is concentrating on those areas where it 
can make the maximum impact and is allowing the provincial 
governments and municipal governments to do the same thing.
<P>
	The kind of change the leader of the Reform Party calls for is in 
the process of happening, but it is happening without the kind of 
rupture and dismantlement the PQ or the Bloc would advocate. It is 
happening for the betterment of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians are offering Quebecers change, real change; 
not superficial, symbolic constitutional change.
<P>
	People cannot eat the Constitution. They cannot pay their 
mortgages with the Constitution. They cannot build their dreams 
on constitutional clauses.
<P>
	What is needed today is a changed federal government that 
respects provincial powers, stops reckless spending and taxation, 
and gives all provinces the tools they need to develop the strengths 
of their own communities and economies. That is possible with a 
no vote.
<P>
	Is the federal government open to these kinds of changes? Is the 
Prime Minister open to these kinds of changes? If the government 
is, how does it propose to demonstrate that openness in practical 
ways before October 30?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the proof is in the 
pudding. If we look at what the government has done over the last 
two years, we see that the fundamental process of change is under 
way. There is only one thing that can stop the process of change and 
that is a yes vote, which would make the country go back to square 
one.
<P>
	The fact is that a no vote means that the evolution of the country, 
along with the evolution of the nations around the world, is 
something that is proceeding apace.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you want proof that the federal government is 
open to change, just look at the remarkable speech the Prime 
Minister made last night in Verdun.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister talks about distinct society, he keeps 
referring to a concept that is meaningless and subordinate to the 
principle of equality for all the  provinces, a concept that was 
rejected by Quebecers in the referendum on Charlottetown.
<P>
	Yesterday, it was impossible to get a specific answer from the 
Minister of Labour, so we will ask her the same question today. 
Could the Minister of Labour tell us what kind of distinct society 
the Prime Minister wants for Quebec, the Charlottetown one, 
which is meaningless because it is subordinate to the equality of the 
provinces or the Meech Lake one, which the Prime Minister 
opposed so strenuously?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is quite simple. I will repeat in this House what the 
Prime Minister had to say about the meaning of distinct society.
<P>
	``A Quebec recognized in Canada as a distinct society by virtue 
of its language, culture and institutions. I have said it before and I 
say it again: I agree'', the Prime Minister said.
<P>
	Does the Bloc Quebecois agree with a distinct society?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the minister said in this House that Clyde Wells was in 
favour of a distinct society. Are we to understand that when the 
minister and her Prime Minister talk about distinct society, they are 
referring to the same definition as Clyde Wells, in other words, a 
definition that is completely meaningless and without any of the 
powers demanded by Quebec for more than 30 years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is such a surprise to see the Bloc Quebecois anxious to 
defend the concept of distinct society, while their present leader, 
the leader of the Yes side, Mr. Parizeau, says he does not want to 
hear about distinct society; he says to hell with distinct society. He 
is just not interested. He is interested in destroying Canada, to 
make a new country. That is the big difference between the Prime 
Minister of Canada and the Premier of Quebec.
<P>
	We want to keep this country called Canada, and we want to 
remain proud and distinct in Quebec.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question relates to the Prime Minister's speech last night and other 
discussion of possible constitutional changes.
<P>
	Before the Charlottetown accord the Reform Party and the 
Liberal Party had made commitments that all major constitutional 
amendments should be done only through national referendum. Is 
it still the commitment of the Liberal Party that any constitutional 
changes being planned must be submitted and approved by the 
people in a national referendum?

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what the Prime Minister said yesterday, very clearly, is 
that any changes in constitutional jurisdictions will only be made 
with the consent of Quebecers. It seems to me that, as a statement 
of position by the government, this is very clear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that is a wise commitment and I hope the Prime Minister is 
prepared to make it to all Canadians.
<P>
	After the last referendum in 1980 we entered into constitutional 
discussions with a PQ government in Quebec. That proved to be 
very problematic for the country as a whole and particularly 
problematic for Quebec.
<P>
	Does the government believe that the PQ government would be a 
willing, open and constructive participant in constitutional 
negotiations?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very clear that after this referendum, in which we 
hope with all of our hearts that this country will remain united, the 
premier of Quebec will still be Mr. Parizeau. Since Mr. Parizeau's 
sole dream and sole obsession has always been to create a separate 
country, it would perhaps be a little surprising if he were to sit 
down at a constitutional conference table. May I express the hope 
that the premier of Quebec will bow to the democratic vote of 
Quebecers?

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Labour.
<P>
	Clearly, English Canada categorically rejects any possibility of 
constitutional change in Quebec's favour. This is why the leader of 
the Reform Party said there was no market for a distinct society, 
that it was old hat.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Labour acknowledge that, although the 
Prime Minister has been saying he wants to enshrine the principle 
of a distinct society in the constitution, he will be unable to because 
of the steadfast opposition of English Canada as expressed 
yesterday by the premiers of British Columbia, Newfoundland and 
Manitoba?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the words of the Canada's principal leaders are 
once again being twisted.
<P>
	What a number of premiers said is that they recognize the 
principle of a distinct society for Quebec, but wonder whether it 
was a priority here in Canada at the moment to sit down and change 
the country's constitution.
<P>
	This is what the premiers of the other provinces said. Quebecers 
are saying exactly the same thing. When asked what the priority 
should be for their provincial government, how do they respond? 
Over 80 per cent say it should be the economy, employment, health 
services or education. Only 8 per cent mention Quebec's political 
status. So, if we are going to respond to the priorities expressed by 
our fellow citizens, we must look to the problems before us first 
and foremost. This is what the premiers confirmed in the other 
provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we 
to understand the reason the premiers of English Canada are so 
steadfastly blocking constitutional change is once again because of 
the bargaining that went on before the start of the referendum 
campaign between them and the Prime Minister of Canada in 
which they promised there would be no constitutional change for 
Quebec, as the editorial in the <I>Daily Gleaner</I> indicates?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> That is disgusting, what she is saying.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, probably the member for the Bloc Quebecois made a 
mistake when she spoke of our Prime Minister as the prime 
minister of English Canada. As far as I know, our Prime Minister, a 
francophone from Shawinigan, is the Prime Minister of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Robillard:</B> And as the Prime Minister of all Canadians, 
including Quebecers, it is his responsibility to make clear the 
seriousness of the choice awaiting us on October 30-the 
destruction of our country, Canada.
<P>
	I repeat that this is not just any country in the world, it is a 
country which we are proud of and which we have grown and 
developed in. I can tell you that everyone who believes in this 
country will do everything they can so that everybody says no to 
separation on October 30.

	The Canada Health Act respects the jurisdictions of the

protect equal access for all Canadians in order that they receive 
the funds transferred from the federal government to the

<P>
	In his speech yesterday, the Prime Minister indicated that he still 
favoured administrative agreements as a way to meet Quebec's 
demand that the federal government withdraw from Quebec's areas 
of jurisdiction.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Labour tell us how Quebecers can trust the 
Prime Minister when he proposes administrative agreements, since 
the only time he proposed such an agreement-it was, may I 
remind you, in the area of manpower-, the minister, in solidarity 
with her former boss, Daniel Johnson, rejected it, calling it a 
third-rate agreement?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr.

statement in extenso, since the member of the Bloc Quebecois 
omitted part of the sentence. He said, and I quote: ``We will keep 
open all the other roads to change, including administrative and 
constitutional means''.
<P>
	I think the intent is quite clear: to keep open both administrative 
and constitutional roads to change. Throughout this country's 
history, we have found various  ways to make changes, without 
necessarily reopening the constitution. At this time, we only have 
to look at the whole issue of immigration in Quebec and all the 
powers granted to Quebec to choose its immigrants and welcome 
them into Quebec society. All this was done by administrative 
means. So we should certainly not set aside this way of effecting 
changes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
response to Liza Frulla, who, last Monday, called for the federal 
government's withdrawal from the area of culture, how can the 
Minister of Labour answer that a mere administrative agreement 
could be enough to solve the problem, and will she dare give the 
same answer to stakeholders in the cultural industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr.

on the road to change and that, in order to meet the challenges of

because we now face international competitors that were not even 
on the scene 10 years ago.

decentralization.

For example, we offered specifically to all provinces the right to 
take over responsibility for institutional training, all the training 
that takes place in the community college system.
<P>
	We have had very positive responses. Unfortunately the minister 
of employment in the Government of Quebec refused to have a

would not engage in that important dialogue.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development 
concerning the role a company called Jobs Incorporated Canada of 
Campbellton, New Brunswick seems to be playing in the Canada 
employment department. I am referring to the fact that this 
company advertised at the CEC office in Winnipeg for a position 
that would have had the successful applicant greeting clients and 
explaining programs at the Canada employment office in Selkirk, 
Manitoba.

<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	I ask the minister: Who is this company? How much 
privatization is going on in the Canada Employment Centres? And 
why is this going on without any consultation with the union?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is very simple. 
Jobs Canada as an organization has established a coast to coast job 
bank, which takes application forms from prospective employers 
and résumés from prospective employees. It provides a nationwide 
service to enable job seekers to find the best possible jobs.
<P>
	What we are testing out on a pilot project basis in three locations 
across the country is how we can take advantage of that vast 
network of job applications and openings at Jobs Canada and build 
them into our own job bank so we can substantially expand the job 
offerings for people who come to the CECs. It is simply one way of 
using new technology and developing a partnership with a private 
sector firm to help get Canadians better, higher paying jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> I ask the 
minister: Why was this done apparently without any consultation 
with the union in Manitoba? Will he undertake to consult with them 
and hear their concerns on this matter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes I will.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of my point of order is to correct <I>Hansard </I>to bring it in line 
with reality.
<P>
	During question period, the Minister of Labour no doubt 
misunderstood what the hon. member for Saint-Hubert said and 
attributed words to her that she never spoke. She never described 
the Prime Minister as the ``prime minister of English Canada''. She 
did say, and I have her text in front of me: ``Are we to understand 
that the premiers of English Canada-'' This was therefore not a 
reference to the Prime Minister of Canada, which led to a 
correction and to applause from our friends across the way. Sorry, 
but this was not the case.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This is perhaps a point of clarification, but it is 
not a point of order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Colleagues, I do not see any other points to be raised at this time.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AUDITORGENERAL'SREPORT-SPEAKER'SRULING">AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would like to make a statement regarding the 
point of order raised last week by the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Transcona. I would also like at this time to thank the hon. member 
for Kindersley-Lloydminster and the parliamentary secretary to 
the government House leader for their contributions to the 
discussion.
<P>
	On October 18 the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona rose to 
question the admissibility of the auditor general's report tabled in 
the House on October 5. The report, which was sent to the public 
accounts committee for examination, contained what in the opinion 
of the member were ``politically biased statements''.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member contended that the auditor general had 
``overstepped the legal and customary boundaries of his duties as a 
servant of the House''. He requested that I rule the tabling of the 
auditor general's report out of order, ask that the auditor general 
submit an amended report, and refer the terms of reference for 
auditor generals' reports to the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The auditor general's importance to Parliament is indisputable. 
This House relies on the auditor general to help it ensure that 
taxpayers' dollars are spent for the purposes approved by 
Parliament and to assist it in holding the government to account for 
its actions. Under the terms of the Auditor General Act, the auditor 
general is empowered to report to Parliament. Under the provisions 
of Standing Order 108(3)(<I>d</I>), these reports are then deemed 
referred to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With all respect, my colleagues, any ruling that is made here in 
this House affects all hon. members. If any business is to be 
conducted other than the hearing of my decision, I respectfully ask 
that it be done outside.
<P>
	The hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona has long taken an 
interest in the form and content of auditor generals' reports. I recall 
that he made a member's statement in the House on this very 
subject on November 23, 1994. It is clear that his view of the 
appropriate role of the auditor general is not necessarily shared by 
the auditor general.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15813"> 15813 </A></B>
<P>
	Those who follow the proceedings of the public accounts 
committee know that this is an issue that is regularly the object of 
some discussion in the committee.
<P>
	The hon. member is absolutely correct in his assertion that the 
auditor general is an officer of Parliament. As a servant of 
parliamentarians and especially of the Standing Committee on 
Public Accounts, the auditor general must pay particular attention 
to whatever difficulties members encounter with his reports in the 
exercise of their parliamentary responsibilities.
<P>
	Like any officer of the House, the auditor general should be 
diligent in responding to the views expressed by members, 
especially when there is a pattern to their complaints, lest there 
result an erosion of a very special relationship.
<P>
	That being said, I must point out that the auditor general's 
co-operation with the House of Commons and the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts is well known.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the Chair has ruled on a number of occasions, it is not my role 
as Speaker to interpret the laws of Canada. The Auditor General 
Act lists a number of matters to be treated by the auditor general in 
his reports to the House of Commons. I do not feel, however, that it 
is up to me to interpret whether or not what is contained in the 
auditor general's report meets the criteria of the law. Therefore, I 
can neither rule the tabling of the report out of order nor demand 
that the auditor general submit another report, as the hon. member 
requested.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, I must stress the fact that the auditor general is not an 
agent of the government. If there is to be a review of his 
performance, I must agree with the parliamentary secretary to the 
government House leader that the proper place to do so is in the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts. The estimates and the 
reports of the auditor general are dealt with in this committee on a 
regular basis. It is within the committee's mandate to bring to the 
attention of the House, by way of report, any aspect of the auditor 
general's report and the conduct of the affairs of his office the 
committee feels the House should be apprised of and should act on.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	Should the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona still wish to 
pursue this matter, he has every opportunity to bring it to the 
attention of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.
<P>
	I thank all hon. members for their contributions to this 
discussion.

private member's bill today, seconded by the hon. member for 
Crowfoot and co-sponsored by a number of my colleagues.
<P>
	If passed by Parliament, my bill will improve the possibility of 
obtaining a criminal conviction of anyone who knowingly infects 
another person with HIV, thereby exposing the victim to the fear 
and risk of contracting AIDS and certain death if he or she does.
<P>
	If enacted, my bill will create two new offences related to wilful 
or reckless acts by a person infected with HIV or a person who has 
AIDS. If the act results in infection with HIV, the offence is 
criminal infection, with a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 
life, the same maximum penalty now imposed for manslaughter. 
The rationale is that victims infected with HIV face a life of fear of 
contracting AIDS and certain death if they do. In the event the 
infection with HIV is not proven, the offence is reckless infective 
behaviour, punishable by imprisonment for up to seven years.
<P>
	Consent is often an issue in prosecutions under other provisions 
of the Criminal Code, and this creates problems for the courts. For 
example, the question of whether a victim consents-

voices must be heard when we make decisions that will inherently 
affect their future.
<P>
	A healthy and safe environment, meaningful employment and 
education are issues that affect all of us but they have a more 
profound effect on our country's youth, as does a united Canada, a 
country which includes Quebec.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These petitioners want to make sure that, when making decisions 
that affect young people, whether these decisions concern

people in Quebec and the rest of Canada.

only of the province of Saskatchewan but of Canada as well. There 
is a need to develop a strategy to utilize this important seaport to 
ship other exports as well as grain.

Canada's annual grain shipment.

S-241 of the Criminal Code of Canada which was enacted to 
protect all individuals. If S-241 were struck down or amended, 
protection to the disabled, the terminally ill, the depressed, the 
chronically ill and the elderly would no longer exist and our most 
vulnerable members of society would feel an implied pressure to 
end their lives.

decision of September 30 to disallow assisted suicide or 
euthanasia.

<P>
	The petitioners should like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is

against families who make the choice to provide care in the home 
to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

concerned about the massive spill of cyanide in the Essequibo 
River in Guyana, South America. They point out that the spill was 
the direct responsibility of a Montreal based Canadian gold mining 
firm called Canbior. They also point out that the safety, livelihood 
and well-being of some 18,000 Guyanese citizens are affected.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to direct an 
independent inquiry into the incident in order that the Canadian 
residents and citizens who have a humanitarian and an 
environmental responsibility in this matter are informed of the 
steps being taken to arrange for the adequate compensation of 
people affected and have steps taken to ensure that necessary 
measures are being taken to correct this environmental disaster.
<P>
	I have a second petition on the same topic, in which the signers 
point out that the river in question is the largest in Guyana; that it 
passes through the rice producing belt of Guyana, rice constituting 
one of the country's main exports; and that this is one of the worst 
environmental disasters since the incident in Bhopal.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners call on Parliament to intervene on 
behalf of the Guyanese people affected by sending a trained team

danger to residents and the environment, and to aid the Guyanese 
government.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SMALLBUSINESSLOANSACT">SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration from October 24, 1995, of the 
motion that Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak to the House today 
regarding Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	This is a very important bill, because the program administered 
under the Small Business Loans Act has an impact on the Canadian 
economy. The amendments before the House today, which are part 
of an ongoing process aimed at reinforcing the Small Business 
Loans Program and making it sustainable, will help improve the 
climate in a sector that today generates the strongest economic 
growth and increase in employment in Canada, and I am referring 
to small business.
<P>
	It is common knowledge that small businesses have become a 
major moving force in the Canadian economy. During the past 20 
years, we have seen a remarkable increase in the number of new 
small businesses in Canada. That small businesses are so important 
is borne out by the fact that in 1991 Canada had, if we include 
self-employed workers, more than two million small businesses 
with fewer than 100 employees, an increase of 50 per cent over 
1981.
<P>
	Small businesses today, many of which are dynamic innovators, 
will help to define the future development of the Canadian 
economy. In fact, according to the statistics, Canada increasingly 
relies on the growth of small businesses to create jobs, diversify 
economic activities and compete effectively on global markets.
<P>
	Small business has a profound impact on the Canadian economy 
and will remain the main source of economic growth and job 
creation.
<P>
	That is why the present government's main priorities include 
ensuring that the small business sector is healthy and prosperous.
<P>
	Take, for instance, the issue of access to adequate financing. As 
the government was told repeatedly by members of the industry 
committee, the ability to obtain financing by contracting loans is 
extremely important for small businesses. Lack of adequate 
financing will restrict the growth of small businesses and 
jeopardize the future prosperity of this country. That is why the 
government passed a bill that will enable the Federal Business 
Development Bank, once it has been restructured, to improve its 
response to the needs of small businesses. As a result of changes 
introduced by the government, the bank will be in a better position 
to finance innovative small businesses in the new economy.
<P>
	The amendments to the Small Business Loans Act before us 
today were drafted in the same spirit as the changes giving a new 
impetus to the Business Development Bank of Canada. In both 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15817"> 15817 </A></B>
<P>
cases, the underlying motive is the same: providing an appropriate 
policy framework that supports the development and prosperity of 
Canadian small businesses from coast to coast.
<P>
	Given its broad scope for action and implementation under the 
act, the small business loan guarantee program plays a large role in 
the launching of small businesses and in other aspects of their 
operations across Canada. It also has an impact on similar 
Canadian programs.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The difficulties experienced by small businesses in securing 
loans on reasonable terms have been described in great detail in 
recent years. The extensive consultations held with representatives 
of both borrowers and lenders during the drafting of Bill C-99 
showed that most stakeholders are concerned mainly about access 
to financing and not so much about its cost. As far as access to 
financing is concerned, both borrowers and lenders confirmed the 
usefulness of the small business loan program as administered 
under the act.
<P>
	They recognized that the program was especially helpful in 
times of economic slowdown. With the exception of farms, 
religious businesses and charities, Canadian based businesses with 
annual revenues of $5 million or less may apply for loans under 
this act.
<P>
	Almost every small business operating in Canada can now get a 
loan under the program. Loans made under the act are approved by 
private sector lenders and guaranteed by the Government of 
Canada. Loans can be as high as $250,000 but in the past most 
loans were for less than $50,000.
<P>
	The small business loans program is an important tool to 
encourage lenders to provide access to debt financing for high risk 
small businesses, including those which find themselves in one of 
the following situations: they wish to borrow a small amount or 
obtain a start up loan; the goods that they must provide as collateral 
are inadequate or insufficient; they wish to obtain funds to buy new 
technologies or specialized material; they are active in sectors 
which are generally considered more risky, such as tourism, retail 
sales or services; they are not located in urban centres, or they are 
in regions which are not major economic activity centres.
<P>
	Clearly, the small business loans program is important to small 
businesses. Since 1961, when the act came into effect, over 
420,000 loans amounting to more than $15.5 billion were extended 
to small businesses.
<P>
	Given the importance of the loan program run under the act, it 
was a real concern when its annual deficit increased to the point 
where it might have exceeded $100 billion per year. Some 
measures had to be taken, and they were taken. Again, this shows 
how the program has constantly evolved, thanks to the Canadian 
government's ability to implement the necessary changes.
<P>
	Two major changes were made to the program on April 1, 1995. 
An annual fee of 1.25 per cent is now collected from each lender, 
on the average outstanding balance of loans granted after March 
31, 1995. The maximum yearly rate which a lender can set under 
the  program was increased by 1.25 per cent, making it equivalent 
to the prime rate plus 3 per cent for floating rate loans, and 
equivalent to the residential mortgage rate plus 3 per cent for fixed 
rate loans. Thanks to these changes, which will be followed by 
those proposed in the bill before the House, the program will be 
completely self financing and can therefore be maintained.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Future access to the loan program by small businesses is now 
basically guaranteed, but the changes included in Bill C-99 are 
necessary to complete the process. The bill will make it possible to 
complete the transition to full cost recovery and to improve the 
mechanisms of the program relating to borrowers and institutions 
making small loans.
<P>
	Among other things, the bill will accelerate the coming into 
force of the reduction from 90 per cent to 85 per cent in the amount 
of the state's loan guarantee under the act; authorize the making of 
regulations for setting processing fees; authorize the making of a 
regulation on the release of securities and personal guarantees 
accepted by lenders against repayment of small business loans 
under the act.
<P>
	It will also serve to improve the situation of institutions making 
small loans, from the point of view of applications involving 
guarantees; to ensure that the small businesses loans program can 
be adapted more promptly to changes in the program and in the 
economy, by allowing readjustments in the proportions of the 
guarantee via regulation rather than legislation.
<P>
	The government is clear in its intent to support small business, 
which it considers the motor of Canada's economic growth. It has 
been pointed out to the government on numerous occasions that the 
best way of helping business, whether small or big, was to control 
the deficit. The modifications to the Small Business Loans Act are 
obviously proposed with this in mind.
<P>
	Thanks to the introduction of a mechanism for users' fees, this 
program will no longer add to the federal deficit. I would like to 
take this opportunity to again point out the particularly pleasing 
fact that transition to full cost recovery has received unanimous 
support from all interested parties consulted during the drafting of 
Bill C-99, lenders and borrowers alike.
<P>
	Bill C-99 will be the end point in a process which will allow a 
program that is already a nationwide success to continue that 
success. The amendments will ensure that the Small Business 
Loans Act remains an important mechanism for implementing 
government policy in order to foster the growth of small business 
across this great land of Canada. These amendments merit the full 
assent of the House of Commons.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the member for Madawaska-Victoria's speech on Bill C-99 which 
of course was a Liberal point of view. It was just a reiteration of 
what she has been told to say by the government frontbench. The 
things she was saying do not seem to make a lot of sense to me.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about how the government supports 
small business. Then she went on to say that the new user fee 
mechanism will no longer contribute to the deficit because the 
program is going to be on a full cost recovery basis. The reason the 
government was putting it on a full cost recovery basis was its 
concern and desire to try to balance the budget.
<P>
	I agree with the government's desire to balance the budget but 
typically, here we are again; the government is going to do it on the 
backs of private enterprise. The Liberals are going to charge the 
businesses that borrow money under this act an excess premium on 
the interest rate. This money will be put into the government 
coffers and will be channelled through a bureaucratic system to 
reimburse the lenders that make the bad decisions and lend to small 
businesses that cannot under whatever circumstances repay the 
loan. If the Liberals are concerned about supporting small business, 
why are they doing that?
<P>
	Some private sector businesses are going to reimburse the losses 
of other businesses. It will not cost the government one single 
nickel under this process, yet the hon. member says that the 
government supports small business. There are two contrary 
situations here. I would like to hear what the member has to say.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased with the 
question put forward by the hon. member. Notice that the question 
is consistent with the third party policy of double talk. I have been 
here for the last two years and I have listened to the hon. member 
and his colleagues from the third party in this House talk about the 
fact that businesses in Atlantic Canada were receiving grants here, 
there and everywhere.
<P>
	I am talking today about the federal government taking its 
responsibility toward the small and medium size businesses 
throughout this country. We are making sure that as responsible 
politicians, as a responsible government, we can provide the right 
environment and opportunities from coast to coast to coast for 
small businesses to create jobs, to look forward to competition and 
to make sure they can get ahead and increase exports. The member 
is saying that we do not know what we are doing.
<P>
	On the one hand Reform Party members are saying to cut grants, 
cut everything, to even cut health care. Now they rise in this House 
to say it is not proper for us to make sure there is security for small 
businesses to have  access to capital and on the same wavelength to 
have access to exporting their technology.
<P>
	For nine years I have heard political questions in the New 
Brunswick legislature and in the House of Commons, but I have 
never heard double talk to this measure from an hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria for her intervention today on behalf of small 
business. She has shown great leadership in the last two years for 
small business in her community.
<P>
	No one in this House will ever forget the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria's very first intervention on this floor two 
years ago when she said: ``We will be a government that is lean but 
not mean''. Reform Party members obviously heard her say that 
but they do not understand where she was coming from.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Reformers forget about some of the great wins Canadians have 
experienced from Atlantic Canada in terms of business enterprise.
<P>
	I want to talk specifically about a very small business which 
received a bit of help in 1979-80 from a Liberal government. I was 
there. It received about a $4.2 million grant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Sounds like patronage to me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> It was not patronage. I 
remember the principles of the country tended to be more Liberal 
than anything else.
<P>
	It was the McCain organization. That very small business has 
grown to be one of the absolute jewels of industry not just in 
Canada but throughout the world. It has expanded its business not 
just in Canada but all around the world. It has created jobs and 
developed technology.
<P>
	The Government of Canada got its $4 million back within the 
first year. Since 1980 we have probably received 100 times that 
amount in taxes and job creation.
<P>
	Reform members really irk me from time to time. They talk 
about the importance of entrepreneurship. They talk about the 
importance of enterprise having a proper environment to get the job 
done. Most of them come from western Canada. Companies in 
western Canada receive the biggest grants of all, especially in the 
oil and gas sector. They are given grants which are buried in the tax 
act. Those tax grants are no different than direct cash grants.
<P>
	I support the thrust of Reform Party members when they talk 
about cleaning up, simplifying and developing a fairer tax system. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15819"> 15819 </A></B>
<P>
However, they cannot take a cheap shot at an act of Parliament that 
is trying to help small business without realizing they are giving 
tens of millions  of dollars worth of grants to businesses in their 
ridings through the tax act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks. Bill C-99 
is obviously another example of the way our country is constantly 
changing. The government cannot create employment as such, but 
we have a responsibility to create a suitable environment for the 
development of small and medium size business in Canada, right 
across the country, from Atlantic to Pacific.
<P>
	I consider the bill to be a responsible way to meet our obligations 
to the people of Canada, including the people of Quebec.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans 
Act.
<P>
	I believe it is the responsibility of governments to create an 
environment in which businesses can flourish. This is where most 
of our jobs will be created. On the history of job creation in Canada 
in the last year, 90 per cent of all new jobs have been created by 
small and medium size business. It is interesting to focus on this 
because this is small business week. Of these 200,000 jobs, 
one-quarter were created in the province of Quebec; 48,000 new 
jobs were created by small and medium size businesses.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I talked about creating an environment in which these businesses 
can flourish. There are two aspects that create a stable environment 
in which small and medium size businesses can flourish and be 
effective in their operations of creating new and challenging jobs 
for a new generation of Canadians.
<P>
	These two areas are access to capital and access to stable 
markets. The area of access to capital deals pretty much with the 
meat of this bill. We have been told time and time again by some of 
our critics that we must make government more efficient, that we 
must find ways of cutting costs.
<P>
	The bill recognizes the federal government was in the position of 
picking up bad debt losses created by lending practices, loaning to 
some of these businesses which obviously failed.
<P>
	There is nothing unusual about that. It is not a calamity. It is not 
a disaster. The loan loss rate within that program was somewhere 
between 2 per cent and 4 per cent. This is quite normal in the 
banking industry.
<P>
	Basically the Small Business Loans Act attempts to create a 
federal government guarantee which encourages financial 
institutions to loan to small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	Some may ask why these institutions do not do it without the 
guarantee. Most of these loans were for capital projects. Our 
financial institutions for a variety of reasons have become very 
much short term lenders. They lend on the strength of things like 
accounts receivable and inventory, things they believe they can 
quickly liquidate.
<P>
	When a small business is setting up it needs manufacturing 
equipment, possibly delivery vehicles, whatever the case may be, 
equipment that has a long and useful life, but it also clearly takes a 
long time to pay off a loan based on the income flow from that.
<P>
	Banks have not always been as active as perhaps they should. 
Small or medium size businesses, which are sometimes emerging 
businesses, also have instability to some degree in their financial 
records.
<P>
	Quite often banks, being very conservative lenders, are looking 
for a long track record. Our emerging industries today do not 
necessarily have a long track record. Consequently they may have 
one or two-year financial statements and so forth but the banks are 
very cautious. They would rather loan to governments than to 
businesses.
<P>
	It has been necessary for the government to recognize there are 
inequities within our capital markets and create a program that will 
attract financial institutions to loan to small businesses to get them 
established and create jobs.
<P>
	It is no small miracle that the government can claim some 
responsibility for these 200,000 new jobs created in Canada in just 
the last year because at the same time we have witnessed the 
increase in the small business loans program. This program loaned 
$500 million prior to 1993. That moved up to $2.5 billion in 
1993-94 and to over $4 billion in 1994-95. That kind of tremendous 
growth shows the demand in the small business sector for this kind 
of lending.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	If we take our loan loss provisions of 2.5 per cent roughly and 
move them through that increase in volume we will see it is 
possible the government could be facing loan losses of $100 
million.
<P>
	What has the government done? It has recognized it should do, 
not unlike what any financial institution would do, and build that 
cost into the lending provisions. Essentially it has created a fund as 
part of the application fee, a new 1.5 per cent fee added to the cost 
of borrowing this money and then it is spread out over the term of 
the loan in order to provide for as much as $100 million of loan 
losses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15820"> 15820 </A></B>
<P>
	All banks do this. All financial institutions carry on this way. 
It is not unusual. I am surprised the third party takes some 
exception to this. Small business people understand it. We realize 
even when we go to our local supermarkets to buy consumer goods 
that within the cost of purchasing are things like theft. There are 
other provisions for products that go bad and so on. That is the 
normal course of business.
<P>
	I commend the government for getting its economic house in 
order by recognizing, as small business people do, that it cannot be 
responsible for all small business ills. The government has created 
a situation in which small business can get access to capital. That is 
really the whole point of the Small Business Loans Act, to provide 
access.
<P>
	I served on the industry committee which produced the report 
``Taking Care of Small Business''. Over and over we heard from 
small and medium size businesses that their major concern and 
problem was access to capital; not so much the cost of the capital 
but the access.
<P>
	In some of the provisions we talk about increasing the lending 
interest rate from prime plus one to prime plus three. Emerging 
businesses do not like to pay more interest than they have to but 
realize that a 1 per cent or 1.5 per cent increase in interest rates is 
still well worth it to them to get this seed money to get themselves 
established.
<P>
	When I talk about access to capital it is interesting also to note 
capital markets. What has happened with our debt and deficit 
situation is many governments are competing in the marketplace 
with small and medium size businesses for capital. This is why we 
have to get our debt and deficit under control and why I am happy 
the government is very much on that course and on a target to effect 
that.
<P>
	In Quebec a referendum is due next week. Quebec borrows 
something over $70 billion. That is the size of its debt right now. 
Interestingly, 54 per cent of it is financed outside of Canada. It 
seems odd that we are going through the process of a referendum in 
Quebec which costs $66 million, as stated in <I>La Presse</I> recently. By 
extrapolation almost $35 million of the cost of the referendum will 
have to be borrowed from people outside of Canada to ask the 
people of Quebec whether they want to be an independent country. 
It seems ludicrous.
<P>
	That is the problem of the capital markets. I would like to 
address the issue of markets. Clearly, the small business man or 
woman is not just looking for capital for machinery. He or she 
needs a market to serve.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	There has been much talk about the globalization of our 
economy and the need to have easy access to markets. Indeed, 
agreements like the North America Free Trade Agreement and the 
GATT address that cause.
<P>
	A recent study by the OECD on the whole aspect of small and 
medium sized business is very interesting. The European Union 
and other members of the OECD are very interested because all 
these countries recognize that small and medium sized businesses 
are going to be the employers of the future. In a recent report, I 
believe from October 1995, they said: ``Sudden national economic 
growth will be enhanced if government policies are co-ordinated 
and targeted so that they strengthen and reinforce regional and 
local systems. This should improve the conditions that encourage 
new and small firms.''
<P>
	While we are talking about these markets, once again we are 
talking about a debate that is going on in the province of Quebec 
that would basically balkanize those markets, would create barriers 
to markets, would make the markets much smaller for these 48,000 
people who are employed in small business in Quebec, because a 
nation defines its markets within its political boundaries and 
operates within those political boundaries to its own best interests.
<P>
	I am trying to say that the bill is very much a necessity and 
should be supported. More importantly, some of the debates that 
are going on within our country today are simply ludicrous. I am 
talking specifically about the referendum in Quebec. It will create 
more barriers for small and medium sized businesses. The ability 
to create new and challenging jobs within Quebec and to some 
extent in the rest of Canada is going to be adversely affected by that 
process.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that I am very supportive of the 
bill. I am certain that the small business community is also very 
supportive, understanding, and respectful that the government has 
taken the initiative to continue this program to increase the volume 
that is available to small businesses. I am sure we will see creation 
of more new jobs within our economy in the near future because of 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the member 
for Durham on his remarks. I especially want to thank the member 
for Durham for all his work in committee during the last two years 
since his coming to the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	One reason we have had such success and why I believe small 
business is heading in the right direction is because our team of 
Reform Party members, the Bloc, and Liberals all worked together 
on the committee to try to make sure we had a fist when we went to 
the banks and other financial institutions as we were pleading for 
help in accessing capital for small businesses.
<P>
	My question for the member has to do with start-up. In his 
experience as an accountant helping small businesses deal with 
banks, does he not think that one area we are going to have to do a 
lot more work on is making sure that the attitude and culture of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15821"> 15821 </A></B>
<P>
bank mangers changes  dramatically toward people who are 
starting businesses, versus people who have been in business for a 
long time?
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	With all of the downsizing going on in both large businesses and 
governments right now, we have many people who are starting a 
business for the very first time. In order to really achieve success 
they are going to need help from financial institutions in this 
country. I believe that banks are going to have to change their 
attitudes dramatically for start-ups.
<P>
	I wonder if the member for Durham, who is also an 
accomplished accountant in his field, could comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member 
for Broadview-Greenwood. I have always been interested in what 
he says. We do not always agree 100 per cent of the time, but 
basically our orientations are in the right area, which is to increase 
capital for small and medium sized businesses.
<P>
	The member is absolutely right. Banks in this country have 
forgotten just what they were doing. Banks originally started off 
many centuries ago investing in ideas. They invested in people's 
grey matter. They invested in their ideas about making life better 
and increasing people's standards of living. I have noticed that 
banks now invest in financial transactions. Our banks in North 
America are very oriented toward paper currency transactions. 
Indeed, I think if we were to study the balance sheets of most of our 
banks we would see a high percentage of their assets being held in 
government securities, et cetera. This has become a linkage in the 
global environment.
<P>
	The reality is that these debts and financial instruments do not do 
anything. They do not create any more jobs. They do not create or 
take a piece of technological science and turn it into something 
useful.
<P>
	What do we see in North America? We see people like Bill 
Gates, who had to work out of his garage to get his ideas going. 
People have to go and find others who will give $50 to buy so many 
shares and maybe later on some of that will come back. The banks 
say that sounds pretty wild.
<P>
	I have a specific example of this in my own riding. I had the 
pleasure only last week of congratulating an entrepreneur for 
winning the Canadian woman entrepreneur of the year award in the 
area of export. This woman many years ago was my client. She was 
making strips of fur and putting them on strings. I must admit that 
even to me it sounded ridiculous at the time. What she did with that 
was to create a reversible fur coat. I went to various banks for her, 
and they said: ``What are you going to give us as security, strips of 
fur? Get out of here.'' Do you know who finally picked up this 
account? It was a bank from England, not a Canadian bank.
<P>
	That woman today employs hundreds of people. It is a small 
business in my riding that has given jobs in basically a rural area. 
Her product is shipped all over the world, mainly to Japan and 
Southeast Asia. She is creating jobs and hard currency exchange 
for our government and our country without the support of banks.
<P>
	Yes, the member is absolutely right. This whole attitude in our 
banking system has to change. We have to get on board and support 
our small and medium business sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have one 
simple question I have asked of other members. It is on the full cost 
recovery being put forward by this particular legislation.
<P>
	The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood talked about the 
fact that small businesses needed the impetus available under the 
Small Business Loans Act. But here they are being asked to pay for 
something they think they are getting from the government. Small 
business people who borrow under the Small Business Loans Act 
are being asked to pay for absolutely everything, every benefit that 
is being provided under the Small Business Loans Act, which 
seems to me a big circle of laundering the money through the 
government. I would like the member's response as to what benefit 
this will really provide to people who are borrowing under the 
Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for St. Albert keeps 
going over this. Repetition is a great educator, so hopefully he will 
listen a little bit more this time.
<P>
	First of all, there is nothing terribly unusual. This program has 
been set up in the best interests of small and medium sized 
businesses.
<P>
	Let us look at the other side of it. What will we do if in fact the 
government did not try to recover this bad debt loss? What does it 
mean? Does it mean that we do not have a program, period? We 
know it has been very successful. We know that using this system 
has assisted many and has probably created thousands and 
thousands of jobs in Canada.
<P>
	Maybe the member wants the government to fork out $100 
million a year in loan losses. Is it the responsibility of Reform 
Party members to tell the Government of Canada to cut spending, 
get its act together, and if it wants to give away $100 million on 
loan losses that is fine by them?
<P>
	There is nothing unusual about cost recovery programs. They 
happen in the business world every day. Here we have the 
government acting like a business, creating opportunities for small 
business but at no cost to the taxpayer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15822"> 15822 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this latest 
exchange between the member for Durham and the member for 
St. Albert reminds me of the similarity between a computer and 
an accountant: we have to punch the information into both of 
them.
<P>
	Given that the banks these days have the reputation of giving you 
an umbrella on a sunny day and taking it away on a rainy day, and 
given that banks today have the reputation of tightening up their 
credit, I would like the member for Durham to tell us how this will 
force banks to increase their loan portfolio to small businesses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd</B> I thank the hon. member very much for the 
question.
<P>
	First, the whole concept of a guarantee creates the opportunity 
for the bank to loan money that clearly it would not loan on its own 
accord. I note in the legislation that in fact we have actually 
lowered the loan guarantee from 90 per cent to 85 per cent. If we 
simply look at the growth and the volume within the small business 
loans program in the last three years, there is no question that there 
has been a demand, and a demand that has been satiated, if you 
will, by financial institutions.
<P>
	Clearly, the program is on a success course and it continues to be 
on a success course. In fact it was the government's orientation to 
say this was very successful and we want it to expand, we want it to 
grow more, we want to make sure there is more money available 
for small and medium sized businesses; but at the same time, we 
also want to make sure we are not going to be on the hook for it.
<P>
	One of the complaints of this program has been that a lot of the 
money was getting out to businesses that could have possibly 
financed loans without the Small Business Loans Act; in other 
words, possibly banks were misusing the program or possibly 
larger companies were getting the benefits of the program and they 
did not really need it. By lowering the guarantee aspect of this loan, 
we will also be ensuring that we direct it at the very new and 
emerging small and medium sized businesses.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to say a 
few words in the debate pertaining to small business.
<P>
	It is not all that often we get a chance to talk about small 
business in the House, and we really should. With the indulgence of 
the Chair and with the indulgence of colleagues present I hope to 
stray a little from the direct confines of the bill. I know it is most 
unusual in the House to stray away from the subject matter at hand. 
I hope to talk about small business in general, to talk about how 
important small business and entrepreneurship are to our country, 
and to provide a few words of encouragement for small businesses 
out there that are struggling today.
<P>
	Can we imagine what it must be like for an entrepreneur in 
Quebec even as we speak? We have a situation of systemically high 
unemployment in Quebec. It has been that way for years, ever since 
the last separation crisis in 1980 when the people of Quebec chose 
to elect a separatist government. All that did was give U-Haul 
one-way traffic to Toronto a bonanza. Ever since the election of the 
first Parti Quebecois, the first separatist government in Quebec, 
what has happened? Toronto has prospered largely at the expense 
of the self-inflicted wounds of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	All the country has profited because the separatist government in 
Quebec insists on shooting itself in the foot with separation every 
15 years or so. I am sure that is what is ongoing in the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	If the people of Quebec want to do something really worthwhile 
for their futures, they will resoundingly reject the separatist option. 
They will resoundingly reject any notion of getting out of the 
country and will work together to make the country stronger. If 
they do that it will get entrepreneurs investing in in small 
businesses in Quebec.
<P>
	It is about the willingness of people. It is not banks or 
governments that get businesses going. It is individual people who 
are prepared to put up everything they have in the world, including 
their homes and borrowing money from their friends and their 
families, because they have a dream or an idea to see through to 
fruition. We should be celebrating the fact that we have these 
people. These are the people we should be asking in Quebec, 
because there is systemically high unemployment, how we can go 
about reversing it.
<P>
	Let us provide stability. Let us make sure that when people start 
businesses, particularly in Quebec, they do not have to go through 
never ending navel gazing, gnashing and worrying about tribalism 
and nationalism in Quebec. Why would anybody put up with that if 
they could invest their money in a jurisdiction that does not have 
such problems?
<P>
	We have these wonderful people who has invested of 
themselves. They have put their hopes, dreams and aspirations on 
the line. What happens when they go into a bank? I can speak from 
personal experience because I have gone through it, as have other 
members of the House, many people watching on television today 
and perhaps a few others who might read the debate.
<P>
	It is not like going into K-Mart or some other store where they 
shake hands and say: ``We are glad to see you. What can we do for 
you?'' The first thing they say is: ``Are you going to do that? We 
already have a few of these. Didn't you know that somebody just 
went broke doing this a while ago? If you are to do this, if you are 
to set up this service, if you are do that, you had better make sure 
that you can guarantee the borrowing of $1,000 with $2,000''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15823"> 15823 </A></B>
<P>
	Instead of the entrepreneur being encouraged, the first remark 
that comes through is: ``We have to protect our depositors' money. 
Therefore we have to make sure that we do not take any risk at 
all because you want to borrow $75,000 or $100,000''. That is 
what got the Government of Canada into small business loans in 
the first place. We ended up as a nation guaranteeing loans that 
rightly should have been the purview of the banks.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The banks have a licence to print money in Canada. When is the 
last time we have seen a small, humble bank building? In every city 
in Canada the four pillars on the four corners of shiny office 
buildings are bank buildings. That is the way it is. Meanwhile the 
people of Canada through the tax base are subsidizing the banks. 
That is what this is all about.
<P>
	When they went into banks to get loans, the loan officers said 
that they could not have them because they did not have enough 
money. The banks had their houses, first born, bicycles and cars. 
The banks had everything they had in the world but they still did 
not have enough money for them to feel safe and secure about 
lending money. If they can lend money to another country and 
write it off that is okay, but they did not have anything for the small 
business person, the entrepreneur, the dreamer.
<P>
	What happens then? The government has to step in and through 
the Small Business Loans Act guarantee the bank about 95 per cent 
of the loan at a rate of about 1.5 per cent above prime. Generally 
speaking any other business paid prime plus two, so there was an 
obvious magnetic pull to write all small business loan transactions 
that could possibly be written by the banks and have them 
guaranteed by the people of Canada, which did not make any sense 
at all.
<P>
	The previous legislation raised it so at least the interest rate 
charged was on par or a little more than the interest rate charged to 
people who did not have a government guarantee. The amount that 
would be guaranteed by the government was to be reduced 
somewhat as well.
<P>
	As earlier speakers have said, the problem with financing small 
businesses is not how much people have to pay for the money, 
within reason. The problem is how to go about getting money in the 
first place. No matter how good the business plan, if the business 
person does not have a track record, does not have money and 
cannot guarantee at least 200 per cent, the chances of getting the 
loan are somewhat remote. This is why the Government of Canada 
and the people of Canada, through the Small Business Loans Act, 
are in the business of protecting the banks. The banks will not do it 
unless we hold them harmless through the Small Business Loans 
Act.
<P>
	In a perfect world we should not be in this business at all. That is 
what banks should be doing. However we are  not in a perfect 
world. We need to ensure we nurture and help small business 
people or entrepreneurs. That is why the legislation is so worth 
while and necessary.
<P>
	However our job as members of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition 
is to oppose bills not just because we want to oppose them but 
because we in opposition in Parliament can cause the government 
to rethink some aspects of its bills and make them better. If all we 
did every time the government brought forward a bill was to say it 
was great, roll over and not pay any attention, we would not be 
fulfilling our function as opposition in the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	While it is basically a very good bill it has a flaw I would like to 
point out to members opposite. I hope the government sees the 
error of its ways and changes it. The amount of money involved in 
a guarantee could be changed by order in council. It would not have 
to come back to the House to be debated. That sets a fairly bad 
precedent. We are talking about the financial responsibility of the 
Government of Canada and a change to the financial responsibility 
of the Government of Canada. These decisions should not be 
decided in a backroom somewhere, even if the backroom has a 
cabinet table. They absolutely must see the light of day. They must 
have sunshine, that being the best disinfectant of all. These 
decisions should come back to the House. In a majority situation it 
is not likely they will be changed anyway. The government will 
have its day no matter what the opposition might have to say about 
it. The bill would be improved somewhat if the provision in it, 
which allows the government by order in council to change the 
ratios, was amended so that it had to come back to the House.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I should like to spend a few minutes talking about small business 
people and where we are going a bit off the rails. The people of 
Canada who are prepared to give of themselves as entrepreneurs to 
create wealth and employment across the country are very often at 
great risk to themselves and to the capital they have built up. They 
should in some way be honoured. It seems passing strange that the 
people most revered and honoured in society are hockey players, 
for instance, who might earn a couple of million dollars a year 
playing hockey but have never created a job or actually put their 
lives on the line.
<P>
	Some accounting firms and chambers of commerce are 
beginning to recognize that as a nation we need to applaud and 
encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. To be an entrepreneur 
or an innovator who creates wealth is a necessary and 
fundamentally important function any citizen can provide.
<P>
	I recall attending a meeting sponsored by the Edmonton 
Chamber of Commerce. The person who appeared at the meeting 
came from a small town in Colorado. He had won a prestigious 
international award. His company had gone from nothing to 
worldwide sales  of approximately $500 million a year. His 
company manufactured tapes used on computers to back up the 
memory. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15824"> 15824 </A></B>
<P>
They cannot make mistakes with these tapes; they have to be highly 
precise.
<P>
	The town in Colorado had an IBM manufacturing facility. IBM 
wanted to move it to Florida or some such place. Many key people 
in the business did not want to leave their town because of the life 
they could lead there; they loved living there. Rather than moving 
they left the company. They thought to themselves that they were 
smart, innovative people and wondered what they could do. They 
decided they would make the world's best recording device, 
magnetic tapes for computers. They did it by innovation.
<P>
	He drew to our attention that the town had since become the hub 
of innovation and entrepreneurship. The people in that town have a 
week in which to celebrate the leadership derived from small 
business people. The innovators and entrepreneurs are part of the 
social fabric of the town. They have star status because the people 
understand the value of entrepreneurship and innovation.
<P>
	All across the land thousands of men and women, young and old, 
have put everything they own on the line with the bank to support 
their small businesses. They are truly the stars of our economic 
system. They are the people we should be celebrating, not the big 
business people who have grants, handouts and loans from the 
government. It just makes one sick. The bigger the business is, the 
bigger the hand is into the banking system and into the government 
system. This is what we must put a stop to. It is wrong to have our 
priorities so misplaced that we do not recognize what small 
business people and entrepreneurs contribute to our society when 
all we can look at are the big mega stars.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you and my colleagues for the opportunity 
to make the case for small business in our country. I applaud 
anything we can do to build and strengthen that sector of our 
economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
took note especially of the part of the hon. member's speech which 
dealt with the question that has been on the minds of most 
Canadians over the past few months. It is the question of Quebec 
separation and its impact on the small business community in 
Quebec. I thank the hon. member for his comments on that. They 
made a lot of sense.
<P>
	The fact remains that in an independent Quebec it would be a lot 
more difficult for small business people. Certainly the surveys that 
have been conducted throughout the referendum bring this to light.
<P>
	In a survey that was conducted by the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce of people who create the jobs in Quebec, the small 
business people, almost two-thirds, 64 per cent, of Quebec 
businesses believe that Quebec's  economic prosperity would be 
diminished under separation. A strong majority, 55 per cent, 
believe that the business relations and trade with the rest of Canada 
would worsen under separation. More than a majority, 53 per cent, 
of Quebec businesses believe that their benefits and profitability 
would diminish if Quebec voted yes.
<P>
	In another public opinion survey almost all the respondents, 93 
per cent, expect long and difficult negotiations with the rest of 
Canada in the event of a yes vote. More than four out of five 
people, 83 per cent, think that Quebec's separation from Canada 
would have a negative impact on Quebec's economic development.
<P>
	There is another survey of small business owners. Almost 
two-thirds of the small business owners in this survey chose 
Canada. They felt that the best route, the best way for their own 
economic prosperity would be through staying in Canada.
<P>
	I think back to my own experience in a rural part of our country. I 
know the hon. member is from a big city and talked about the banks 
in the big city. In terms of small business people in rural Canada, 
obviously farming and farmers are a critical component to the 
small businesses in rural Canada and rural Quebec also. The whole 
question of supply management and where that goes in a separate 
Quebec is a major question.
<P>
	These people should not be fooled. We brought in supply 
management a number of years ago with the support of Quebec 
farmers who were a major part in getting that. The whole concept 
behind supply management is that we are able to protect the local 
market, our current market under GATT and international rules. If 
Quebec becomes a separate country that will not be the case. They 
will not be able to protect that market.
<P>
	Today in the industrial milk area Quebec holds about 47 per cent 
of the Canadian market. It is a very important aspect of it. The hon. 
member knows that. It would be folly to say to Quebec dairy and 
supply managed farmers that they would be any better off in a 
separate Quebec. In fact the whole nature of it would fall down. 
Granted, it would not only hurt Quebec dairy farmers, it would also 
hurt Canadians.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member if he is aware of these statistics and these 
polls. Is he aware of the fact that the majority of Quebec's small 
business people feel that they would be much better off in Canada?
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member opposite raises a 
valid point. As a matter of fact even as we speak the tariff on milk 
is 350 per cent.
<P>
	It just absolutely boggles the mind how members of the yes 
group are able to go through Quebec like Johnny Appleseed 
spreading these little bits of misinformation all over the place. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15825"> 15825 </A></B>
<P>
debate is on a level that has no  intellectual veracity or honesty in it 
whatsoever. The debate is purely cosmetic. People who scratch 
below the surface of the debate will understand very quickly just 
how devastating the result of a yes vote will be to the people of 
Quebec. It will hurt everybody in Canada, but it will hurt the people 
in Quebec far more.
<P>
	The tragedy is that nothing the Quebec nationalists want to 
achieve can be achieved outside of Canada that cannot be achieved 
within Canada. In my view, the very protection of the language and 
culture they profess to be so concerned about is better protected 
within Canada. Anyone can bet that on a wide open North 
American market the French of Quebec will very soon be like the 
French of Louisiana. They just will not have the bulwark of Canada 
to protect them.
<P>
	Lest anyone in Quebec who is watching this thinks that my 
words are hollow and empty, they should be aware of trade by 
Quebec with the rest of the country. The hon. member's question 
has given me the opportunity to put this on record. Lest anyone 
thinks that a free ride will be achieved by the people of Quebec in 
terms of their economic future, they should keep in mind that in 
1989, the last year for which accurate figures are available, 
interprovincial trade in Quebec had a balance per year of $1.8 
billion dollars in favour of Quebec. If they think that would happen 
after a yes victory, they can think again. The bulk of that was in 
protected industries.
<P>
	That brings us to the free trade agreement, internal trade barriers 
and how ludicrous it was for us to get involved and the hypocrisy of 
government members opposite supporting the free trade agreement 
now when they did not in opposition. I supported it wholeheartedly 
as a private business person. I certainly did not support the method 
by which the Conservative government took us down the road to 
free trade. This is apropos in my view to what is likely going to 
happen to the people of Quebec if they were to be irrational and 
vote yes.
<P>
	We went into the free trade agreement and got clobbered as a 
country. We did so because we went into the agreement with the 
highest interest rates we had historically, the highest dollar we had 
historically and industries across the country which had been 
protected by tariff barriers for many years. Our industries were not 
competitive with those in the United States. Is it any wonder we got 
clobbered. Imagine the Monty Python movie ``In Search of the 
Holy Grail''. We were the knight at the bridge and when we 
finished we had the knife in our teeth and no arms or legs. All we 
could say was: ``Fight fair''.
<P>
	I saw our chief negotiator, Simon Reisman, on the Sparks Street 
Mall the other day. I wanted to ask him: ``Did you not think about 
this?'' I have really wondered about this. Surely the government of 
the day must have been aware of the situation we were getting 
ourselves into. Maybe it was not, but it certainly should have been.
<P>
	If that happened to us as a country, what is going to happen to 
Quebec as a country in a free trade arrangement with Canada and
<P>
the United States? Will Quebec have a high dollar? Probably not. 
Will it have high interest rates? Very likely. Will Quebec have 
industries that are capable of competing efficiently in the North 
American market? Probably not. Are they going to have an easy 
ride of it? Probably not.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It would seem to me to be very prudent for those people in 
Quebec who are wondering whether or not they should vote yes or 
no, if they choose to vote yes, the one thing they can be absolutely 
assured of is they will be paying a financial premium for many 
years for voting yes. They will have many years to think about it 
because it is not something that will cure itself overnight.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the comments made by the hon. member for Edmonton-South 
West come very close to being a threat, when he says that Quebec 
better not think that the day after a Yes vote it will be just as easy to 
negotiate from province to province, and so forth, but in a way that 
is distinctly ominous.
<P>
	However, I agreed with what he said when he commended the 
business community on its initiative, courage, determination and 
vision of the future. The Bloc Quebecois and, in fact, all Quebecers 
could not agree more. These people are driving 85 per cent of our 
economy, at present.
<P>
	However, I fail to understand why, in the same breath, he attacks 
the people of Quebec who had the initiative, the courage and the 
vision to choose a country for themselves. That he does not like.
<P>
	So I want to ask the hon. member this: When he says Quebec had 
better not think it will be easier, should we take this as a threat or 
simply as the way people talk who cannot tolerate the fact that 
others decide to simply make a decision?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly not a threat. It is a 
statement of the reality of the situation that faces all of Canada, but 
will face the people of Quebec to a greater degree for a longer 
period of time than it will everybody else. It is not a threat. It is a 
statement of the obvious. It is a statement of fact.
<P>
	In the democratic process people are elected and there is a 
fiduciary trust responsibility we are prepared to accept the moment 
we stand for election. That is in everything we do, we will do it not 
for the betterment or enrichment of ourselves or for 
self-aggrandizement but we will work for the people who have 
entrusted their lives to us as their members of Parliament, their 
elected representatives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15826"> 15826 </A></B>
<P>
	When a person is elected to high office, which is a member of 
Parliament, there is a trust responsibility to do the very best one 
can in the interests of the people being served. It then follows that 
it should be to protect their economic, cultural and ideological 
interests. It should not be to take them down a treacherous path 
when they are standing above a precipice. That is not the fiduciary 
trust responsibility of a person elected to high public office in 
Quebec or anywhere else in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker: </B>Before we continue the debate, it is my 
duty to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at 
the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden-pharmaceutical products; the hon. member 
for Davenport-the environment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to speak on the subject of Bill C-99, the act to amend 
the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	I will make some comments a little later on entrepreneurs 
because they are really the heroes of Canada. I echo the comments 
made by an earlier speaker that entrepreneurs are really the basis of 
what makes up the country. We need to create the climate to 
encourage entrepreneurship.
<P>
	My colleagues have spoken at length about the specifics of this 
bill but I will talk about how the amendments to the Small Business 
Loans Act fit into the federal government's plan to create a climate 
for business growth in Canada.
<P>
	It is often said a business plan is only as good as the economic 
foundations on which it is built. The federal government has 
targeted the national debt as the number one impediment to 
business growth. That is why last February the Minister of Finance 
introduced a budget that will cut $29 billion over the next three 
years, the largest set of budget cuts since Canada demobilized after 
the second world war.
<P>
	We also undertook at the same time a thorough review of federal 
government administration and spending in the non-social program 
area. The objectives were to get government right, to ensure 
taxpayers were getting value for money and to encourage 
Canadians toward building a more innovative economy.
<P>
	The result of this has been a major change in our approach to 
sector development in industry and in the role and function of the 
industry department. It is obvious old style industrial development 
strategies are no longer workable. Some might argue they never 
were, but our goal as a government is not to affix blame for the past 
but to set a course for the future.
<P>
	The challenges for government, for Industry Canada in 
particular, are to help small business compete and to promote a 
business environment that will lead to job creation, a competitive 
economy that is a thriving economy, one that will take Canada to its 
rightful place in the global economy.
<P>
	Small and medium size businesses are leading the way in terms 
of innovation and job creation, there is no question. I meet with 
constituents regularly, small business people and entrepreneurs 
who come to the constituency office and share their ideas and their 
enthusiasm to create employment and make Canada a better place 
to live.
<P>
	During the 1980s in Canada small and medium size businesses 
were responsible for 87 per cent of all new jobs created. Since the 
last recession they have accounted for over 90 per cent of the net 
new jobs created. On average about 300,000 firms or 
self-employed entrepreneurs have started a business every year for 
the past 10 years. SMEs account for almost two-thirds of the 
private sector employment.
<P>
	The main thrust of government support in industry must be small 
business, I think we are all in agreement in the House. Small 
business has a major role to play in reducing unemployment. 
Despite the fact that small business is clearly the way of the future 
in Canada, there are still too many impediments to SMEs truly 
coming into their own. One of our priorities is to reduce or 
eliminate those impediments wherever possible.
<P>
	A fundamental impediment is the access to adequate financing. 
The banks explained to us on the industry committee the 
improvements they are making in this area. Entrepreneurs and 
small business owners stated the difficulties they are having 
accessing capital. It is crucial for us to deal with this issue. The 
availability of capital has been a source of frustration, no question.
<P>
	SBLA loans have played an integral part in helping small 
businesses gain access to capital needed for start-ups, expansion 
and growth. The program's success both as an economic 
development tool and as an example of public sector-private sector 
co-operation has inspired similar government programs at both the 
federal and provincial levels.
<P>
	Since 1961 more than 420,000 SBLA loans, totalling over $15.5 
billion, have been made to small business. Virtually every small 
business in Canada is now eligible to borrow under the SBLA 
program providing that its annual gross revenues do not exceed $5 
million. We are targeting the small business sector.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	In recent years the SBLA program has been running at an annual 
government cost of $20 million to $30 million. However, following 
a significant program change effective April 1, 1993 the annual 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15827"> 15827 </A></B>
<P>
lending activity  increased from $500 million to $2.5 billion in 
1993-94 and to over $4 billion in 1994-95.
<P>
	Assuming a continuation of the historical loss rate, this meant 
the annual program costs would increase by over $100 million. 
Clearly this was a threat to the sustainability of the program.
<P>
	The potential cost of the program and the government's overall 
need for deficit control required that the program be brought to full 
cost recovery. With respect to full cost recovery, it is interesting to 
note that the users of this program both on the small business side 
and the lenders side, the parties that have been consulted, support 
the move to cost recovery.
<P>
	Through the consultation period the government has asked for 
input on the changes to the program and it is reflected in what we 
are seeing here today.
<P>
	Recommendations of the industry committee and the small 
business working committee were also taken into account. All 
stakeholders supported the move to full cost recovery. Two major 
changes were made through regulatory amendments with an 
effective implementation date of April 1, 1995.
<P>
	First, a new 1.25 per cent annual administration fee is being 
charged on each lender's average outstanding balance of SBLA 
loans made after March 31, 1995. Second, the maximum interest 
rate that a lender can charge under the program has been increased 
by 1.25 per cent to prime plus 3 per cent for floating rate loans and 
to the residential mortgage rate plus 3 per cent for fixed rate loans.
<P>
	To complete the move to full cost recovery and improve the 
administration of the program, other changes are now being made 
by Bill C-99. These proposed changes will allow the release of 
security, including personal guarantees, improve the government 
guarantee coverage for small lenders, and provide for the 
introduction of a government processing fee on lenders' claims.
<P>
	To add flexibility to the program and permit the easier fine 
tuning, parliamentary approval is being sought so that future 
changes to the level of government guarantee can be implemented 
through the regulatory rather than the legislative process.
<P>
	It was stated earlier that the one change the third party would 
recommend is an amendment to this part of the bill. In the 
consultations I have had with small business, one of the criticisms 
it has had of government policy is that government is often unable 
to react quickly when a situation changes.
<P>
	Business groups have often asked for greater flexibility to deal 
with these issues and it is exactly that which this part of the bill is 
reacting to, adding the flexibility to the program and permitting the 
easier fine tuning.
<P>
	These changes also mean that the SBLA will be better targeted 
toward small businesses that really need its help. An estimated 30 
per cent to 40 per cent of SBLA loans go to businesses able to 
access normal commercial financing.
<P>
	After the changes financially strong businesses will switch to 
lower cost commercial financing. During the consultations small 
businesses told us repeatedly that the primary issue is access to 
capital and not the cost of financing.
<P>
	When I meet with entrepreneurs in my community, as we all do 
as members of Parliament, they are looking the opportunity, the 
chance to make their idea work. They appeared before the industry 
committee. They have met with their members of Parliament. The 
message is getting through. By making this change we will be 
targeting the SBLA program at start-up companies and companies 
in the expansion mode that need capital.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	During the consultations small businesses told us that making 
the SBLA self-sustaining will ensure continued access. We agree 
with that.
<P>
	We have been told repeatedly, I am sure the third party would 
agree, that the best thing government can do for business, large and 
small, is to get the deficit under control. The proposed changes to 
the SBLA are a step in that direction. The proposed changes will 
ensure it remains an effective and viable instrument of support for 
small business in Canada. It will certainly remain an integral 
element of our comprehensive plan to create a business climate 
which will enable Canadian small business to grow and create jobs 
in the global economy.
<P>
	The objective of the bill is to continue the process of the 
modernization and improvement of small business. The proposed 
changes relieve Canadian taxpayers of the financial burden of the 
program. We have been asked to do that.
<P>
	Small business created 90 per cent of new jobs in 1994. The 
government has placed support for small business at the top of its 
agenda for jobs and growth.
<P>
	It is crucial that we continue to bring forward bills which will 
help to create a climate that will encourage entrepreneurs to 
continue to dream and create their own companies. They will help 
Canada by creating employment. That is the thrust of the bill. We 
must convince the banks that small business people and 
entrepreneurs are the cornerstone of our economy; they are our 
future.
<P>
	This and the other bills the government has brought forward are 
the end result of the consultation process. We have gone to the 
stakeholders and we have asked for their input. They have given us 
direction. This bill reflects that direction. It is also the result of 
what we have been doing in the standing committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

	We are moving in the right direction as we continue to improve 
access to capital for small business and encourage entrepreneurs 
to go forward and do what they do best, create their own small 
businesses, improve the economic climate and encourage other 
individuals to do the same. I ask all members of the House to 
support the bill.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GRANDPARENTSDAY">GRANDPARENTS DAY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider 
designating the second Sunday in September of each year as grandparents day 
in order to acknowledge their importance to the structure of the family in the 
nurturing, upbringing and education of children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me today to speak on 
Motion No. 273. This motion flows from Bill C-274, a private 
member's bill I introduced on September 27, 1994, an act 
respecting a national grandparents day in Canada.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the support of my own party and that of the 
opposition parties with regard to this very important issue. It is 
important that the House recognize the contribution of 
grandparents and the critical role they play in strengthening the 
family.
<P>
	Grandparents have always been important to society. One step 
removed from the parenting process, they can share with their 
children the experience and wisdom they have gained. They 
provide a link to the treasures of family history and can provide an 
objective second opinion on a wide variety of important issues 
facing the family today.
<P>
	Many of my fellow members have addressed this issue and have 
gone on record as supporting the creation of a national 
grandparents day. In so doing, many have expressed personal 
memories of their grandparents and the role played by these most 
important relatives. Thoughtful, caring and loving, these role 
models cannot be underestimated in their importance in the 
development of young people who themselves will most likely be 
parents someday.
<P>
	Grandparents have always been important to the vitality of the 
extended family but never more so than in today's society. With the 
increase in family breakdowns the relationship between 
grandparents and grandchildren has taken on even greater 
importance.
<P>
	As we see more and more single parent families, the need for 
additional support and nurturing becomes more important today 
than ever. By officially recognizing the role grandparents play we 
emphasize the importance of this role in society and honour those 
grandparents who rise to the challenge and continue to provide 
love, that most important of commodities, to the most vulnerable 
victims, the children.
<P>
	If this motion is adopted, as I hope it will be, grandparents day 
would give national recognition to the growing number of 
grandparents in Canada. Many provinces and municipalities have 
already recognized that grandparents contribute greatly to the 
family and that they are the basic and fundamental element of our 
society. It is time the federal government and the House recognize 
this fact as well.
<P>
	Often when a family breakdown occurs one parent assumes 
custody and the children no longer have the opportunity to visit 
with both sets of grandparents. While this motion does not address 
this issue directly, it is my hope that the official recognition of 
grandparents day will provide a focal point to the very important 
issue of grandparents' rights. If a society acknowledges the 
importance of grandparents, a certain amount of moral force will 
come with that recognition. Hopefully, parents in a broken family 
will realize the importance of the contribution that both sets of 
grandparents make to the nurturing and well-being of their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	We need to express recognition of those elements within our 
society that are fundamental building blocks of healthy, productive 
individuals. Other than that of parenting itself, I can think of no 
more important role than that of a grandparent in fulfilling that 
responsibility.
<P>
	As members make their decision whether or not to support 
Motion No. 273, I ask them to consider the comments of fellow 
members who are speaking in support of the motion. I am sure their 
comments will lend force to the argument to officially recognize 
the contributions grandparents make in the lives of their 
grandchildren and to society in general.
<P>
	In closing, I ask members for their support of this very 
worthwhile effort to create the much needed recognition of the role 
that grandparents have made in all of our lives. I urge my fellow 
members to support Motion No. 273 and allow grandparents of the 
country to celebrate the second Sunday in September every year as 
national grandparents day.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in this House to speak in support of  Motion M-273 
put forward by my colleague, the hon. member for Don Valley 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15830"> 15830 </A></B>
<P>
North, to designate the second Sunday in September of each year as 
``Grandparent's Day'' in order to acknowledge their importance to 
the structure of the family in the nurturing, upbringing and 
education of children.
<P>
	As the official opposition's critic for seniors organizations, I 
have always supported similar initiatives to designate a national 
grandparents' day, because seniors' organizations across the 
country, and in my riding of Argenteuil-Papineau in particular, 
are in favour of this kind of acknowledgement.
<P>
	Grandparents play a crucial role for their grandchildren, 
providing a degree of stability and continuity that is so essential to 
them. Unfortunately, the situation is sometimes complicated by 
mariage breakdown and remarriage, with values often being 
disrupted in the process. But grandparents can help insofar as they 
are able and available during the transition period.
<P>
	Seniors and grandparents can be instrumental in improving 
cohesion within the family. Grandparents act as the thread 
connecting the past, the present and the future. Many teenagers feel 
they stand alone against the problems of daily living. In 1993, in 
Quebec, seniors from Le Pélican seniors club, in co-operation with 
the Villeray local community service center, in Montreal, and the 
Regroupement inter-organismes pour une politique familiale au 
Québec, founded La Maison des grands-parents, or grandparents' 
house.
<P>
	Grandparents welcome their children and grandchildren in this 
house, which is a co-ordination centre for family action. The 
house's goals are to foster social involvement, help prevent 
problems inherent to disadvantaged and isolated families, and 
promote reconciliation and co-operation within and between 
families.
<P>
	Then, other seniors from various golden age clubs in Quebec 
founded centres with similar goals. In my riding of 
Argenteuil-Papineau, teenagers from the Vert-Pré drop in centre 
in Huberdeau and seniors from the gold age association in 
Saint-Adolphe-d' Howard worked together on a self-help project.
<P>
	In June 1993, the general meeting of the Quebec Federation of 
Senior Citizens came out in support of bringing grandparents and 
their grandchildren closer together. It was the federation's 
contribution to the International Year of the Family. There are also 
groups of caring grandparents in various regions of Quebec. The 
purpose of these organizations is to put grandparents or seniors, 
both singles and couples, in touch with families with young 
children.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Their goal is to promote intergenerational contact, to help and 
support young families, to recognize the  experience of 
grandparents and allow them to play an active role in society. This 
description of some projects is not restrictive, and I urge all seniors 
to take the steps required to create similar projects.
<P>
	As a representative of seniors' organizations, I have always 
sought to ensure that the government does not penalize seniors. I 
took part in the debate on Bill C-54, which has a special impact on 
seniors' pensions through the Canada pension plan and old age 
security. We in the Bloc Quebecois proposed a series of 
amendments to protect seniors, who would otherwise be penalized 
by Bill C-54. Unfortunately, these amendments were rejected by 
the government.
<P>
	I also spoke to Bill C-232, an act to amend the Divorce Act. The 
purpose of this bill is to exempt grandparents from having to obtain 
special leave of the court to apply for an interim, standing or 
variation order with respect to custody of or access to their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	I am personally very concerned about the old age pension reform 
announced by the government, which will take effect in 1997 and 
possibly earlier.
<P>
	In 1994, the government announced the production of a 
document to be tabled. It delayed the release of that document, 
preferring to wait until after the Quebec referendum. Thanks to the 
hearings held by the Commission des aînés sur l'avenir du Québec, 
our seniors had an opportunity to express their views regarding 
their future. That consultation process showed that the concerns of 
seniors are similar everywhere in the country, and have to do with 
their social and economic situation.
<P>
	We are all convinced of the major influence that grandparents 
and seniors have on the development of children and on the 
well-being of families. We must give grandparents the place that 
should be theirs in the family context, and we must make all 
Canadians aware of the importance of their role.
<P>
	Grandparents are an essential source of affection, understanding 
and experience which strengthens the family. They must be 
integrated to the family life.
<P>
	In conclusion, the official opposition supports the motion of the 
member for Don Valley North asking the government to designate 
the second Sunday in September of each year as Grandparents Day, 
in order to acknowledge their importance to the structure of the 
family in the nurturing, upbringing and education of children.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member on behalf of all the organizations 
representing the elderly, and also on behalf of all grandparents, 
young and not so young, for emphasizing their contribution to our 
society.
<P>
	Finally, I want to point out that, should Quebecers vote in favour 
of sovereignty on October 30, Quebec might also recognize the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15831"> 15831 </A></B>
<P>
contribution of its elderly and  designate the second Sunday in 
September of each year as Grandparents Day.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member for Don Valley 
North for having his Motion No. 273 selected and deemed votable.
<P>
	In this motion the government is being asked to consider 
designating the second Sunday in September of each year as 
grandparents day. I am very familiar with this issue as I also 
presented before this House on June 22, 1995, Bill C-259 asking 
for a national grandparents day on the second Sunday in 
September. I am aware that the member for Don Valley North also 
presented a bill asking for a grandparents day. Unfortunately, 
neither of our bills were votable.
<P>
	It is fitting and proper that this 35th Parliament finally corrects a 
wrong against our senior citizens. It does not cost taxpayers any 
money for the government to recognize our seniors, the oldest 
group in our society which is becoming more plentiful as 
Canadians live healthier and longer lives. I would like to draw 
members' attention right now to the gallery where grandparents are 
waiting to hear the verdict of today's motion.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	1994 was the Year of the Family. As I have stated many times, 
the family is our basic unit in society. We need to keep our families 
strong. There is a natural progression here: from strong families 
come strong communities; from strong communities come strong 
provinces and states; and from strong provinces and states come 
strong countries.
<P>
	Again, if a country is to remain strong, its people must be strong, 
for a country reflects the value of its people. Who teaches the 
values to children? The parents. Who taught them? Their parents, 
the elders in each of our families, the grandparents and the great 
grandparents, those who have experience and are wise in the ways 
of the world. We all realize that the best way to be wise is through 
personal experience and hardships.
<P>
	Many of today's seniors and grandparents are very active. Many 
are still in the workforce. Many are in volunteer organizations. My 
point is that these grandparents and great grandparents have given 
their fair share to society and many are still giving. If we are wise, 
all Canadians will show our seniors how much we appreciate them.
<P>
	In times of restraint there is no money for new programs, 
especially programs for children. Patience, caring, knowledge, 
experience, time and love are what are needed to work with 
children. Our seniors have all of these requirements. Many are 
already giving countless volunteer hours to children.
<P>
	Recognition of grandparents day is really recognition of 
grandchildren and their relationship to the future of our country. 
When we talk about respecting our grandparents, we are 
reinforcing the rights of our grandchildren.
<P>
	Lifting the role of grandparents gives recognition to the interests 
of our grandchildren. It provides a bridge between the age gaps of 
young and old. When we see seniors working with young children, 
we realize there really are no age gaps. They converse very well 
together and understand each other very well. What better way for 
children and parents to say thank you than by having a nationally 
recognized day to visit grandparents and pay respect to these 
seniors?
<P>
	At present I am honoured to be representing Canadian 
grandparents in their fight to see their grandchildren after a 
divorce. Too often, many are cut out of their grandchildren's lives 
just because the custodial parent does not think the children should 
continue to see their grandparents. Often it is the grandparents who 
in difficult times can reinforce the stability and love in a 
grandchild's life through a difficult divorce. In the United States 
where the rights of grandparents to see their grandchildren are 
recognized, over five million grandparents are raising their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	So many seniors want to be grandparents that there is even an 
organization called Volunteer Grandparents. A very good friend of 
mine who has never married became a volunteer grandparent about 
15 years ago. It is a very special part of her life.
<P>
	We have an opportunity here to recognize all grandparents. Let 
us be positive and agree to this motion.
<P>
	Many in the House may wonder if the rest of Canada feels that 
the recognition of grandparents is wanted within our country. 
Nancy Wooldridge, president of the Canadian Grandparents 
Association in British Columbia and her membership wrote to all 
the municipalities in British Columbia asking for their assistance in 
proclaiming the second Sunday in September 1995 past, which was 
September 10, to be declared grandparents day. The response was 
incredible. I have only some replies with me today but in 
recognition of what those communities have done, I think I should 
share them.

grandparents on behalf of all Canadians by recognizing from now 
on the second Sunday in September as official grandparents day.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the motion of 
my colleague, the hon. member for Don Valley North, to designate 
the second Sunday in September grandparents day.
<P>
	I have spoken out on the significance of grandparents in the 
House on a number of occasions. Grandparents play an 
irreplaceable role in the life of Canadian families. They form a 
stable link in a rapidly changing world. Where there is 
fragmentation because of divorce or separation they bring 
continuity. Today many families are headed by single parents and 
where there are two parents they are often found both working 
outside the home.
<P>
	The significance and value of grandparents have increased 
beyond belief. I do not hold grandparents to be glorified babysitters 
but rather as parents' surrogates who bring love, a continuance of 
generational values and a sense of the child's worth to the integrity 
of the family.
<P>
	I speak from personal knowledge and with emotion about the 
importance of grandparents because I was brought up by a 
grandparent. My parents both worked outside the home for most of 
my life with them. They needed to for economic reasons. It was my 
grandmother who nurtured me, gave me a sense of worth and 
moulded in many ways the course my life was to take.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	My grandmother was my role model, my mentor and my 
confidant. As a strong feminist woman long before the term was 
invented, she taught me to be bold and confident, to stand up for 
my beliefs, to change things when I did not like them, to be an 
active participant in changing my society and my world.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would be so bold as to say I stand before you 
today because of my grandmother. Yet I have never been able to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15833"> 15833 </A></B>
<P>
celebrate her contribution to my life. We all celebrate Mother's 
Day, Father's Day, Remembrance Day. We have dedicated weeks to 
promote breast cancer awareness, AIDS, violence against women, 
but we have never celebrated the worth of our  grandparents to the 
family, to society and to future generations.
<P>
	Grandparents have enriched our lives by their presence. They 
represent the past, our history to us in their stories, in their 
lifestyles and in their values. Through them we gain a sense of the 
continuity of humankind and through us they live forever.
<P>
	I once remarked that if grandparents did not exist in nature we 
would have invented them because they are the embodiment of the 
concept of family. Because of the reverence and love I feel for my 
grandmother I cannot wait to be a grandparent so I can completely 
emulate her as my role model. Unfortunately my sons do not seem 
willing to comply at this time.
<P>
	You do not need children of your own to be a grandparent. In 
British Columbia there is a volunteer grandparent's association 
whose members adopt, figuratively speaking, children who are not 
fortunate enough to know or who do not have a biological 
grandparent close at hand. As we all know, in this vast land of ours 
families can live far away from each other and many families do 
not have an extended family or a grandparent close by. My children 
did not. These volunteer grandparents bridge that gap and bring to 
hundreds of B.C. children the warmth and experience of having a 
grandparent.
<P>
	Grandparents bring a sense of trust. They help us to feel safe 
because no matter what happens they are our refuge against often 
cranky parents.
<P>
	In many cultures grandparents are historians. In others they are 
the heads of households. They bring wisdom and warmth, joy and 
stability, and the list of their worth goes on and on.
<P>
	I will finish today by quoting the words of one young constituent 
who has expressed so simply the importance of her grandmother:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The first day I was brought into this world I met my grandmother. I have 
come to know her very well. These past 17 years she has been there for me 
almost as much as my parents. My grandmother is a very special part of my life. 
She was the one who took care of me when I was sick or cheered me up when I 
was down. I get to see her almost once a week.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My grandmother is the most interesting lady I know. She is an artist, a chef 
and a seamstress. This lady has a good eye for fashion and style and she always 
knows just what to buy me. I heard all grandmothers are good cooks but my 
grandmother is one of the finest. She supplies the birthday dinners and cakes for 
the whole family. No matter how much her grandchildren whine and complain 
she always keeps her cool and has great patience with us all. I am extremely 
lucky to have such a wonderful grandmother. Not everyone is so fortunate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>She is the type of lady who is always doing special things for you and is 
always trying to please. My grandmother means the world to me. I hope she 
remains with me for many years to come.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	By passing this bill we will make that wish come true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to have seconded this motion put forward by my 
colleague, the member for Don Valley North, on the selection of 
grandparents day in Canada, Motion No. 273.
<P>
	I believe the motion will be a model for the world by showing 
that Canada pays respect to grandparents, to seniors, whose love, 
wisdom and caring for their daughters and sons, for their 
grandchildren, are truly recognized.
<P>
	It is my honour to support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I support for this motion which 
would designate the second Sunday in September as grandparents 
day.
<P>
	It is appropriate to recognize the members for Don Valley North 
and Mission-Coquitlam. It must bring a tremendous amount of 
satisfaction for these members to come to the House in their first 
term to present a bill that receives the support of all parties and 
eventually goes through the whole House. I congratulate my 
colleague.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>

	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PHARMACEUTICALS">PHARMACEUTICALS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal government is cutting costs and reducing services in our 
medicare system. In the last budget it drastically cut transfer 
payments to the provinces and will continue to do so each year over 
the next three years, reducing health care services further.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15834"> 15834 </A></B>
<P>
	Why will the Liberals not enact cost cutting measures that would 
not reduce services to Canadians yet save  taxpayers a billion 
dollars a year or more? This could be done by repealing Bill C-91, 
the Drug Patent Act, passed in the last Parliament. Bill C-91 
catered to foreign drug companies that wanted to make more 
money by extending drug patents to 20 years for prescription drugs, 
in essence a 20-year monopoly to charge whatever price they want 
for certain prescription drugs.
<P>
	In opposition Liberal members of Parliament, such as the current 
Minister of Health and the Minister of Industry, were present in the 
House on December 10, 1992 to vote against Bill C-91. Now that 
they are in government they support the legislation, which is a very 
major flip-flop.
<P>
	Bill C-91 has had the effect of costing Canadians billions of 
dollars in their prescription drug costs. In the past eight years drug 
prices have increased 13 per cent every year for an accumulated 
total of 220 per cent. For example, the cost of Tagamet, a drug to 
treat ulcers, is 78 per cent cheaper when a Canadian generic drug is 
used instead of the brand name product. This is why our 
prescription drug costs are skyrocketing. Bill C-91 prevents the 
generic drug companies from producing cheaper cost copies of 
prescription drugs. Pharmaceutical companies have a 20-year 
monopoly on their patents and a monopoly pricing situation exists 
to the detriment of the health of Canadians.
<P>
	Prescription drugs represent over 15 per cent of the total cost of 
health care in Canada. This amounts to over $11 billion every year. 
It is a fact that drugs are the fastest growing cost to medicare. It is 
also one of the most controllable costs to our medicare system 
because Parliament has the power to put forth legislation that will 
control the cost of drugs and end price gouging by pharmaceutical 
drug companies.
<P>
	Pharmaceutical drug companies employ roughly one sales 
representative for every three doctors in Canada and spend $10,000 
per doctor on promotions. Canadian taxpayers are paying for these 
promotions while hundreds of millions of dollars of profits are 
leaving the country and jobs are being cut by the drug companies. 
These prices have increased 13 per cent each year over the past 
eight years due to Bill C-91.
<P>
	While in opposition the Liberals opposed the bill. While in 
government they are now supporting it. The government must 
immediately abolish the automatic injunction clause of the 
patented medicines regulations. The automatic injunction clause 
adds two more years on top of the twenty years that a drug 
pharmaceutical company can charge rates and prevent the generic 
industry from competing. This clause, if abolished, would save 
Canadians $750 million right off the top.
<P>
	By repealing Bill C-91 in its entirety Canadians could save $3 
billion to $5 billion each year on health care costs through 
reduction in prescription drugs, equivalent by the way to the 
Liberal government's cut to medicare funding over the three years 
proposed in its budget.
<P>
	Why will the government not do this? Why is the Liberal Party 
allowing pharmaceutical drug manufacturers to set the agenda? It 
is a fact that the Liberal Party receives thousands of dollars in 
donations from foreign drug companies. Is this the reason?
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal Party's inaction to rein in the outrageous brand name 
price increases is costing Canadians and threatening our health care 
system. It is time for action. The Liberal government must act 
immediately to abolish the automatic injunction on prescription 
drugs and make a commitment to abolish Bill C-91.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the member is 
absolutely right. In opposition we opposed Bill C-91. I not only 
opposed it in the House, I set up a display in my office on the 
Danforth pointing out the difficulties with Bill C-91.
<P>
	We lost that vote, and the mechanism for Bill C-91 was put in 
place by the previous government. In many respects it is not unlike 
the GST. We campaigned vigorously against the GST and we lost in 
opposition, but the entire infrastructure and the mechanisms for the 
GST were put in place. When we were given the trust two years ago 
today, one of the things we had to face was the challenge of doing 
something about the GST. This bill is in many respects similar to 
that challenge.
<P>
	The minister has said that we are currently evaluating the impact 
of Bill C-91. There is a parliamentary review process that will be 
invoked in 1997. The challenge presented by the drug patent policy 
is to ensure that it conforms with all the international trade 
obligations and supports the development of our pharmaceutical 
industry while making patented drugs available to Canadian 
consumers at non-excessive prices.
<P>
	I want to reassure the member that we are not running away from 
our concern about what takes place with Bill C-91. He should know 
that not only the government but many members in the House share 
many of his views. We are very wise to the marketing in this 
industry. He will just have to be patient a little longer so that when 
we attack this issue we will do it in a rational and totally 
constructive way so that we will not upset the infrastructure that 
has been put in place and the investment that has already been 
started.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
members will probably recall, in June the Standing Committee on 
the Environment and Sustainable Development issued a report on 
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act entitled ``It is about 
our Health''. It is a parliamentary study that aims at pollution 
prevention in the interest of public health. It was made possible 
because of extensive hearings with over 100 witnesses from all 
walks of life in all parts of the country.  As a result of that, the 
committee recommended major changes to the existing act, 
commonly known as CEPA, the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15835"> 15835 </A></B>
<P>
	The changes to the act, which in essence deals with toxic 
substances, are necessary because at the present time the 
legislation is too slow in protecting the public from toxic 
substances. For instance, the complete toxicity assessments for 13 
out of the 44 substances placed on the priority list in 1988 have not 
yet been done. In addition to that, of the 26 substances found to be 
toxic, only three, those related to chlorofluorocarbons, chlorinated 
pulp effluents, and PCBs, have been subjected to regulation.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	In addition, problems related to enforcement, problems related 
to biotechnology products, problems related to the role and 
lifestyle of our aboriginal people, in particular in relation to 
environmental protection, and problems related to the management 
of Canada's coastal zones have not been resolved by the act as it 
exists at the present time. To address these problems, the 
committee called expert witnesses, scientists and native people, 
industry, professional organizations, et cetera, to ensure their 
recommendations would have sound expert support.
<P>
	The committee's recommendations reflect the principle of 
sustainable development as set out in the red book, <I>Creating 
Opportunity</I>, which was produced in 1993 during the federal 
election. In addition to that, the committee's report builds on three 
cabinet documents; namely, the government's toxic substances 
management policy, the strategic framework for pollution 
prevention, and the guide to green government. The last one was 
signed and endorsed by all members of cabinet. Therefore, the 
report of the committee has as its foundation three substantial 
documents produced by the present government, and quite rightly 
so, in support of sustainable development objectives.
<P>
	To conclude, the report is based on the concept of pollution 
prevention. The accepted norm for environmental protection policy
<P>
in industry and governments in the western world is therefore in 
that report. Every witness before the committee urged that the 
government adopt pollution prevention, shifting away from the 
costly approach of reacting and curing to the more efficient 
approach of anticipating and preventing.
<P>
	I see that my time is up. I thank you for your indulgence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to say through you to my 
colleague from Davenport, who has led the way for so many of us 
on environmental issues in this House, that as a government we 
must pay attention to his words right away.
<P>
	When I was working on the Hill as a young assistant back in the 
early 1980s and the member for Davenport was Minister of the 
Environment, he helped put us on  the international map with his 
campaign on acid rain. I have experienced his passion and his 
commitment. I have been exposed to his knowledge on this issue 
on a thousand different occasions.
<P>
	I can only say to the member for Davenport that his words will 
be communicated directly to the minister and to the cabinet. With 
the trust that we as a government have in his advice, I am sure we 
will be moving on his recommendations in the near future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38, the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. Accordingly, 
this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
