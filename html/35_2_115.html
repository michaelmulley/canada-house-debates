move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, immediately after the conclusion of Private Members' Business on Tuesday, 
December 10, 1996, the House shall consider a motion ``That this House take note of 
the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights in 1998 and the importance of this declaration in the promotion of 
human rights both domestically and throughout the world,'' and that during the 
consideration of this motion no quorum calls or dilatory motions shall be received 
and that, at the end of the three hours of consideration or when no Member rises to 
speak, whichever is earlier, the House shall adjourn to the next sitting day.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	The House resumed from November 27, 1996, consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-62, an act concerning fisheries, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment 
and the amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I start my 
speech, I think it should be pointed out that there were five minutes 
left for questions and comments, following the Reform member's 
speech. I believe the hon. member concerned is not here this 
morning. Therefore, I will get on with my speech.
<P>
	I am pleased to address the amendment and the amendment to 
the amendment proposed by the Reform Party, asking that the bill 
be not now read a second time but that it be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans, so as to allow the government 
and members of this House to review the basis of this  legislation. 
In our humble opinion, we in the official opposition agree with 
Reformers that, in its current wording, the bill does not make sense. 
Therefore, we will support the amendment proposed by the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	I should remind the House of the Bloc's position. During the 
debate on the main motion, I mentioned three major irritants. The 
amendment and the amendment to the amendment proposed by the 
Reform party provide us with another opportunity to stress the 
three major irritants in this legislation.
<P>
	Let me say from the outset that those main irritants relate to the 
management agreements referred to in clause 17. These 
agreements allow the minister to invite, at his discretion, classes of 
fishers or persons of his choice to enter into management 
agreements, and therefore share the wealth among themselves.
<P>
	However, all this is discretionary. Fishers involved will not know 
the rules of the game, because the bill is silent on this issue.
<P>
	The second major irritant relates to the delegation of powers. 
While our views may sometimes differ from those of Reformers, 
we should discuss them again in committee and then come back 
here with a proper solution.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	According to the Bloc Quebecois, the delegation of authority 
proposed in the bill is inadequate and, more to the point, 
contradictory. I will explain why in a bit more detail later on.
<P>
	The third irritant in the bill is the creation of fisheries tribunals, 
to be found in part III, I believe. In my view, these tribunals are just 
an excuse so the minister can set up a quasi-judicial system of 
administrative awards.
<P>
	They say that future members of the tribunals will be appointed 
for three years only. At the present time, decisions are made by the 
regional directors of Fisheries and Oceans. What is the difference 
between a decision made by a regional director and an official 
appointed for three years by the minister? Three years is not very 
long to learn how to exercise one's responsibilities with diligence 
and transparency, and in a non-political manner.
<P>
	There are other irritants, particularly concerning the 
environment. My colleague, the member for Laurentides, will have 
an opportunity to speak to this today. I must  point out right off the 
bat

<P>
that the Bloc Quebecois sees serious problems with the provinces. 
The way the bill is worded, the government is giving itself new 
powers, or increasing those it already has. If the federal 
government does not like the way the provinces are managing their 
environment, it will be able, with this new bill, to claim that its 
authority takes precedence. We object to that.
<P>
	I will now be more specific. I spoke about the main irritant of the 
management orders. I think the government is up to no good. I see 
that the secretary of state for agriculture, and fisheries and oceans 
is listening to us very attentively this morning. I will therefore take 
this opportunity to try to instruct government members.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It will not be easy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier:</B> No, it will not be easy, but I will try to be as clear 
as possible.
<P>
	I will start by giving an example, and perhaps the secretary of 
state will understand. Last spring, the fishery helped develop an 
agreement in principle for the management of certain stocks.
<P>
	I would remind the secretary of state that crabbers from zone 12, 
whom he must have heard of, participated in good faith in last 
spring's exercise. What happened? At the request of the former 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, officials of that department 
worked in good faith with fishers to establish a framework 
agreement. It will be recalled that officials duly authorized by the 
former minister ratified the agreement with the crabbers in 
question.
<P>
	When the new minister took up his duties in February 1996, he 
repudiated their signatures, signing the death warrant for this 
agreement in principle.
<P>
	The secretary of state will have a chance to speak shortly.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The main thrust of this is that, when one wants to establish a 
partnership, first of all, if one wishes to respect the spirit of 
partnership-I see that the hon. member from Newfoundland 
understands, and is listening to me; I hope he will be speaking 
shortly-one must establish an atmosphere of trust. That 
relationship of trust has been broken. Without going into further 
detail, I know there is a case currently before a judge, in Moncton I 
believe, in which crab fishers are seeking a decision on whether the 
minister was justified in dumping this agreement in principle, as 
well as on who will have to pay the costs the industry incurred to 
establish this agreement.
<P>
	It is immediately evident that the government took a position 
right from the start, by wishing to implement these partnership 
agreements.
<P>
	An additional remark can be made here concerning the fisheries 
management orders. I have already referred to the discretionary 
powers of the minister. I have met with  several fishers' 
associations and they are anxious to find out who can be a party to 
these agreements, how one becomes party to one, and what the 
mechanisms will be.
<P>
	There is nothing in this bill to indicate how it will be done. 
Nothing. This is even more dangerous. Without prejudging who is 
entitled and who is not, let me give an example of what happens 
when nothing is clearly established: the social chaos this fall in 
Chaleur Bay. I am not challenging the right of aboriginal people to 
fish, but they are nonetheless a new group, a new player in the 
game. This is an example of what happens when no provision has 
been made for how a new player can be brought into the game.
<P>
	Those who were already involved in this fishery were surprised. 
Now, what is going to happen? How will a place be made for them? 
And who is to say that there will not be other groups tomorrow? 
Because the act speaks of classes of permit holders, and it is 
therefore understood that this refers to people already active in the 
commercial fishery, and reference is made to any group of 
individuals, but it is all at the minister's discretion. Some of the 
government literature refers to partnership agreements. I repeat, 
when partnerships are involved, there must be an atmosphere of 
trust. But such trust is not there at the present time.
<P>
	The minister could have a second chance, if we assume that this 
was an oversight, that he forgot to include the mechanisms. If we 
could at least have some specifics on the mechanism that will be 
used, once the cod fishery is resumed, to decide who will work in 
the fisheries, since we do not expect the cod fishery to be resumed 
at the same pace at which it was abandoned?
<P>
	When I look at what the government is doing now, I see no 
indication of how this long awaited rationalization will be 
implemented. I saw no indication of how the core groups involved 
in the fisheries will be defined. I even raised this question with an 
official at the department where I was told: ``We will let the 
industry take care of that''. As far as the Atlantic fisheries strategy 
is concerned, $1.9 billion was wasted. These people were given 
financial support, but we thought that the government, to make the 
most of its $1.9 billion investment, would require an accounting of 
the money spent, and that there would be a deadline and a schedule. 
Representatives for the department told us right off the bat: ``No, 
we left it up to the industry''. So there is no obligation on fishers to 
define their core activity as such before a given date and to 
rationalize their activities accordingly. It used to be management 
for the short and medium term.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	There is no indication of a mechanism the minister could have 
started using on a trial basis and then included in his legislation, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7177"> 7177 </A></B>
<P>
with the comment: ``I tested this on a group of fishers''. Nothing 
was done. This shows  there is much that will have to go back to the 
drawing board.
<P>
	The official opposition is prepared to go along with this exercise 
of informing the government. It is willing to meet the industry with 
members of other parties and then ensure the government listens to 
the industry. That is the tenor of the amendment proposed by the 
Reform Party. However, I wonder what members opposite who rise 
in the House today will have to say about this.
<P>
	The clock seems to be moving very quickly this morning, and I 
want be sure I do not run out of time, but before discussing the 
other main irritant, the delegation of authority, again in the 
management agreements the department wants to arrange, there are 
other points we should not overlook. The management agreements, 
according to paragraph 17(d), I believe, provide that fishers who 
are parties to the said agreement-and this is probably what the 
government will want to do on a large scale-will pay their share 
of management fees.
<P>
	As a member of the opposition, it seems to me that the sole 
purpose of this bill is to help the government deal with a financial 
problem and that the government certainly has no intention of 
dealing with the fundamentals of managing the industry, because it 
is still discretionary, but what is not discretionary is the fact that 
fishers will have to pay management fees.
<P>
	We must not forget that the father of this bill, Brian Tobin, left a 
little present for the fishers before going: he increased licence fees. 
So in two years, we will have had two proposals affecting a group 
that pays taxes like anybody else. This means double taxation. That 
is what we said when licence fees were proposed, but I find it very 
sad that fishing communities are more likely to have problems with 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I realize the government is taking money out of the pockets of 
people who may have a little more money than others if they have 
their own fishing vessels, but does the government realize that 
when it takes this money, it is taking wealth out of the community 
and sending it back to Ottawa? These are people who already have 
a high rate of unemployment in their community, and the 
government goes and makes money even scarcer. I find that 
appalling.
<P>
	At the time, I proposed to Mr. Tobin, if this measure had to be 
introduced, and the Bloc Quebecois also advocated rationalizing 
the deficit like any good parent or farmer, that we have part go 
directly to Ottawa. If the fisher could prove he invested in his 
community, in order to distribute the wealth and create jobs, he 
would not have to remit the entire amount to Ottawa. The 
government did nothing. Not only did it not act, but we were told 
immediately that new administration fees will be charged.
<P>
	There is another small point. Since we are discussing the 
government's invoice, there was another case pending  which, I 
think, has been settled. There was a decision by the court and, if I 
am not mistaken, the federal government either tried to pass other 
legislation or signed contracts with fishers, but there is still no 
mention in the present bill of landing fees.
<P>
	The federal government has already had its knuckles rapped 
once. I think it was in 1992. In 1994, the system was changed. They 
have already had their knuckles rapped for failing to provide a legal 
mechanism for the payment of these things. And yet, there is still 
no provision in this bill. It is easy to see the number of problems 
that have yet to be resolved.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Time is passing quickly this morning, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps with 
the unanimous consent of the House, I could have the five minutes 
for questions and comments the Reform Party did not use, since I 
was the first to speak this morning.
<P>
	In any case, delegation of powers to the provinces is both 
inadequate and contradictory. There is not enough, and I hope my 
colleagues will discuss it some more this morning. One need only 
read the proposal the Government of Quebec made in Victoria in 
November 1994 for it to become clear. British Columbia too is 
asking to have its powers over fisheries management returned. 
They are currently negotiating. I think the negotiations are to 
conclude at the end of February.
<P>
	Why is the federal government in such a hurry to introduce a bill 
like this one, given that negotiations are currently going on with 
British Columbia? The initial protocol provides that the agreement 
is not to be tabled before February.
<P>
	I believe the government does not listen to itself. As evidence of 
the fact that this is inadequate, just look at the powers sought by the 
provinces and you will see how far off the mark it is.
<P>
	There is also a contradiction here. In light of what I said about 
management agreements, if the federal government negotiates 
directly with fishers, or groups of fishers, regarding issues such as 
the number of fishing licences and traps, or who will share the 
wealth, what is there left to delegate to the provinces, since clause 
17 takes precedence over clause 9? There will hardly be anything 
left to delegate. It will be a virtual delegation of powers.
<P>
	I said the fisheries tribunal was a front. When people are 
appointed for three years only, how can they be non-partisan or not 
think about being re-elected or re-appointed? These people will be 
appointed for a period of three years, with specific directions from 
the minister. If they do not follow these directions, their mandate 
will definitely not be renewed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7178"> 7178 </A></B>
<P>
	Fishers are entitled to a system that is fair, a system with no 
strings attached. If we get such a structure, we will support the 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the hon. member asking for unanimous 
consent of the House to complete his remarks, or did I 
misunderstand his point?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I asked to have a little more 
time because I know there was time left over from the Reform. I 
still have lots of things to teach government members. If they want 
to listen to me-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will ask the question. Is there 
unanimous consent of the House for the hon. member to finish his 
speech?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since I heard some people say no, I 
cannot grant more time to the hon. member. Questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the speech of my hon. 
colleague from Gaspé. Being myself a former employee of the 
marine fisheries branch in Gaspé, I know that the Quebec fishing 
industry is operating under dynamics very different from those in 
the west, for example, or even in the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	Fisheries are very important in concerned areas like the Gaspé 
peninsula, the North Shore, Magdalen Islands, all that area. They 
are also a small part of Quebec economy. Therefore special 
management is called for.
<P>
	Looking at the bill, I am a little surprised because, from 1922 
until 1984, there was a delegation agreement. Under that 
agreement, the federal government had delegated fisheries 
management to Quebec. In 1984, the minister of the day, Pierre De 
Bané, who now sits in the other place, decided-in a fit of anger, I 
believe-to withdraw that delegation. That shows the strength 
these administrative delegations have.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member for Gaspé whether it does 
not seem to him that the delegation of powers found in the bill has a 
needlessly complicated air about it. They want to give the 
provinces the power to issue permits and licences, but then, if I 
understand correctly, it will be the federal government that will 
enter into the resource management and protection agreements 
directly with the industry. The impression I get from this is that we 
will end up with the same squabbles as before, which may have 
been behind the withdrawal of the delegation set out in the 1922 
agreement.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask a question of my colleague from Gaspé: Does 
he not think that this piece of legislation will be a source of new 
conflict and will only feed the  bureaucrats implementing it without 
meeting the needs of fishers, especially those in Quebec who are a 
little lost in the great Canadian whole as for the choices that are 
made?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup understands quite well where the 
government is headed concerning this issue. What fishers in the 
province and the province itself want is complete jurisdiction over 
fisheries. If we are to manage this, let us manage it entirely.
<P>
	As things stand now, when cod are alive, they are under federal 
jurisdiction. As soon as they are taken out of the water, they are 
under provincial jurisdiction, because fish plants and fish plant 
standards are a provincial matter.
<P>
	Several provinces guarantee fishing boat loans themselves. 
When cod die, there is a change in jurisdiction, but that does not 
solve any of the problems of fishers or the industry.
<P>
	The Quebec government demands the devolution of all those 
powers if it is to manage something. It has to be in charge of 
licence delivery, administration and fish stock preservation. 
Provincial demands about this make a lot of sense. We all know 
that the cod resource migrates. The province of Quebec alone 
cannot be expected to manage biological research or the 
assessment of the cod biomass, because cod migrate.
<P>
	We demanded first the right to manage the delivery of licences. 
How would the remaining responsibilities be shared? If the federal 
government does not know how to do it, it just needs to do proceed 
the same way NAFO does.
<P>
	NAFO, or Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization includes a 
number of countries, and each one of them contributes to the 
assessment of stocks with the co-operation of biologists and 
commercial fishers. This information is then compiled by a 
secretariat. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea even 
stipulates that border countries have primary responsibility for 
preparing and providing these assessments. If border countries do 
not comply, any other member state of the convention can step in.
<P>
	The hon. member from Newfoundland could confirm that, in 
many cases, Russia has provided the biological data on the halibut 
stock off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. So, as you can see, 
shared management systems do exist.
<P>
	Have you ever heard of Canada having problems with Russia in 
terms of fish management? No. We have had problems with Spain, 
yes, because that country did not want to comply with what was 
behind our management philosophy.
<P>
	What we have to do is apply whatever models we have. What 
would be the impact of managing our fish stock  using an approach 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7179"> 7179 </A></B>
<P>
similar to NAFO's model? Quebec's quota would be already set. 
Let us not kid ourselves, around 85 per cent of all the fish caught in 
the Gulf come under individual quotas. That does not leave much 
room for negotiation.
<P>
	What else would happen? We could have a system where 
everything from beginning to end, from the harvesting to the dinner 
plate, from the fishers to the consumers, would come under one 
jurisdiction. The government could ensure resource allocation, 
namely defining fishing areas and classifying fish boats.
<P>
	What people have to understand is that different types of fishing 
boats would be needed. Because of fish migration, I could not tell 
you what fishing boats would have to be used.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Everyone knows full well that when the fish comes in, trawlers 
cannot catch it off the coast of Gaspé, so trawl lines or gill nets 
have to be used. And then the fish heads back for the banks, at 
which time trawlers can get to work, but when they catch too much 
fish, there is less left for those who use trawl lines or gill nets. So, if 
we have a given amount of fish to catch in a given time in order for 
the fish plants to run a profit, then we would have to find some way 
to strike a balance.
<P>
	The problem is, if we find a way to manage the system from 
beginning to end, once fishers land their catch, what do we do with 
it? The Bloc Quebecois once suggested-and nobody was against it 
but this is not possible under the current system-to provide some 
sort of buffer zone between fishers and processors. Why? Because 
our main problem is that our processing plants are overspecialized. 
A plant that used to produce salted and dried fish had to get fish 
measuring at least 20 inches, so when a fisher came in with a 
16-inch fish, which is still legal, they were less interested.
<P>
	They should have told him: ``Unload everything at the same 
place and we will take care of market segmentation''.
<P>
	What is needed is a single jurisdiction and a will to assume 
responsibility instead of everybody passing the buck as is the case 
now, as my colleague from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup 
pointed out.
<P>
	The delegation of powers proposed in this bill does not seem 
very promising, since the federal government can choose anytime 
to opt out and say: ``Get yourself out of the mess'', as it did in 
1984.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after listening to the Bloc and the Reform Party, I feel 
compelled to say at least a few words about this bill.
<P>
	The Bloc does not like the bill. The Reform Party does not like 
the bill. The Tories do not like the bill and the  NDP does not like it. 
There must be something terribly right about this bill if those 
political parties are saying they do not like it.
<P>
	It is not just those political parties which do not like the bill. It is 
also making international news this morning in the European press. 
The reason is that the European Union is claiming now that it is not 
going to sign a co-operation agreement with Canada because 
according to this story that is in the papers from Canadian Press: 
``According to judicial services''-now that is in the European 
Union-``there will be more than 14 articles with extraterritorial 
effects in the fisheries bill presently before the House of 
Commons''.
<P>
	Let us get this straight. The Bloc, the Reform Party, the Tories 
and the NDP do not like the bill. There are countries around the 
world that do not like the bill. Therefore one has to ask the 
question: What is in the bill that all of those people do not like? I 
will tell the House what it is.
<P>
	This bill before the House today is a historic piece of legislation. 
It is one of the best pieces of legislation ever to be brought before 
the Parliament of Canada. The first historic piece of legislation 
brought before the Canadian House of Commons was in 1977 and 
the fisheries minister at the time was also a Liberal, the hon. 
Romeo Leblanc. A lot of people today still talk about that fisheries 
minister as being such a great minister. He brought in a piece of 
legislation that created an exclusive fishing zone in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> He is our commander in chief, is he not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> That is right. He is presently the governor general. 
In fact some fishermen have commented that they wish that orders 
in council would actually come from the governor general because 
they appreciated those orders so much when he was the fisheries 
minister.
<P>
	That piece of legislation unilaterally declared a 200 mile 
exclusive fishing zone in Canada. That is not the same as the 
exclusive economic zones, the EEZs, in other nations of the world. 
This was a unilateral action by Canada to save the fishing resource. 
That was in 1977.
<P>
	When was the next piece of legislation that really broke new 
territory on behalf of the fishery in Canada? From 1977 until 1996 
we had 10 years of Tory rule and not one piece of legislation was 
passed by this Chamber which we could call a historic piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	Then we come to the year 1996. Again under a Liberal 
administration, this time under the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans who is the member from the historic riding of 
Bonavista-Trinity-Conception, legislation was brought in to do 
what the other nations have done. Instead of the exclusive fishing 
zone, we have declared an exclusive economic zone for Canada so 
that Canada can be a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7180"> 7180 </A></B>
<P>
part of the team of nations around the world that  are trying to save 
the fisheries. We would have identical legislation.
<P>
	Today this bill is truly a historic piece of legislation. Why is 
that? It is for the very reason that countries in Europe do not like 
the legislation. It is for the very reason that some countries in 
Europe, and yes the United States and quite a few other countries 
are objecting to this bill. The reason is that it gives the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans unusual powers to seize foreign fishing 
vessels which are fishing illegally, according to what the Canadian 
government is declaring, on the high seas adjacent to Canada's 
territorial zone.
<P>
	When the opposition parties complain and say that this bill gives 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans too much power, they have to 
realize that we either have to do it or we do not do it. We have to 
give the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the power to do things 
which are unusual under international law in order to save the 
fishery of Canada.
<P>
	In Europe they are saying there are 14 articles which have 
extraterritorial effects. I have looked through this bill in the last 15 
minutes trying to find those articles. I found some of them. One of 
the articles for example will allow the government in the future 
when an offence has been committed to seize a vessel that is owned 
by the same company that owned the vessel that committed the 
offence.
<P>
	Let us say we had a fishing nation which violated the rules on 
bycatch in the NAFO zone which the hon. member was talking 
about.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	What is a bycatch? A fisherman once defined it as a catch you 
accidentally catch when you're trying to catch another catch. It 
means that some fishermen use the bycatch rule of 10 per cent to 
catch more than 10 per cent of what they are allowed to catch.
<P>
	Suppose the records of that vessel reach Canada after the fact. 
The vessel is gone. The skipper probably will not be seen in 
Canadian waters again and no charges under the present law can be 
brought against the company that owned the vessel. Under this bill 
Canada can now seize a vessel that belongs to the same company 
from the same foreign nation that committed the offence to satisfy 
a judgment.
<P>
	An internal audit was done when the Tories were in power in 
1985. It showed many cases of bribery, of money being exchanged, 
money being put in people's mailboxes to try to buy influence with 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans by these foreign captains. 
A fisheries officials in one case found $25,000 in a mailbox. He 
immediately reported it to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Fisheries and Oceans knew who did it but they could not charge 
that fishing captain because he did not show up in Canadian waters 
again.
<P>
	Under this legislation DFO will now be able to seize another 
vessel that belongs to that company from the foreign nation to 
satisfy the judgment.
<P>
	I do not know the entire 14 articles to which the European Union 
is objecting, but one to which it is objecting is this. Under the bill 
the Canadian government will be able to bring charges against a 
stateless vessel on the high seas that is in a management zone of the 
northwest fishing organization to which the hon. member from the 
Bloc referred a few moments ago.
<P>
	If a vessel from the United States of American-and we have 
them-constantly violates the fishing agreements entered into with 
countries that belong to the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries 
Organization, charges cannot be brought against the American 
vessel because the U.S. does not belong to the organization. Under 
this bill we will be able to do that. There is a whole section on 
stateless vessels.
<P>
	These are some of the things that the Bloc and Reform Party 
should be standing up and saying: ``What a marvellous piece of 
legislation. Canada will be the first nation in the world to put some 
real teeth into enforcement to try to save the fishery'' because the 
fishery needs to be saved. I think everybody would agree with that.
<P>
	In the past, prior to 1993, Tory governments gave quotas to 
foreign nations. In the fall of 1979 Russia received a quota of 
100,000 tonnes of capelin, the food of the cod fish. That Tory 
administration gave it a 100,000 tonne quota for 1980, thereby 
giving the Russians a higher quota of capelin than the entire 
Canadian fleet has ever caught in its entire history and then you 
wonder what happened to the fishery.
<P>
	In 1985, 1986 and 1987 when fishermen were telling the 
politicians that there was a problem in the fishery the 
administration in power here in Ottawa continued to give out 
foreign licences. The Tories turned their backs and looked the other 
way when all the dragging was going on. They even encouraged it.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member from the Bloc represents an area of Quebec 
that has the best spawning area in the world for mackerel. The Tory 
administration actually gave Norway and Sweden licences for 
mackerel in Canadian waters which would stop the mackerel on 
their way to the spawning grounds at the end of May.
<P>
	The Tory government, in the mid to latter part of the 1980s, gave 
licences to Cuba, Japan, Russia, to five fleets to catch another food 
of the cod, the squid, off the province of Nova Scotia. Can anyone 
imagine that?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7181"> 7181 </A></B>
<P>
	For the Government of Canada to constantly say that it does not 
know if it is going to harm the cod fishery if it gives licences for 
fishing the food of the cod, it should know that the squid that were 
once in abundance on the  coast of Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova 
Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, have 
disappeared. Why did they disappear? It was not Canadians who 
made them disappear. It was not Canadians who made the capelin 
disappear either.
<P>
	They disappeared because of the foreign nations fishing in 
Canadian waters with licences given by the Tory administration in 
Ottawa. The squid come up in a narrow line. They are born in 
Florida, live for only one year and then go back. They know where 
to go. They die in Florida at the end of the year. However, the circle 
they make goes up the east coast of Canada in a thin line. 
Fishermen refer to it as the trans-Canada highway of squid.
<P>
	Lo and behold, the previous Tory government gave licences to 
the Japanese, the Cubans and the Russians to block that passage of 
squid every single year in the 1980s. That is why we had no squid 
in Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island or 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	As well, the Tories gave licences for all the fish we do not even 
think about here like argentine. They also gave licenses for another 
fish, a scrawny thing with a big swelled head, which reminds me of 
some of the politicians across the way. They gave licences for 
every species of fish in our waters and they gave them to 
foreigners.
<P>
	Today these opposition parties should be standing up and 
congratulating the government by saying that this is the best news 
they have heard since the depletion of the cod fishery. Perhaps it is 
the single best piece of legislation that could ever be brought before 
the House of Commons, to be able to arrest stateless vessels that fly 
no flags and vessels on what is called the high seas outside of 
Canada's zone.
<P>
	We need legislation to be able to govern what happens on the 
high seas, just as we need it when it comes to the attachment of 
wages act. Certain people in our society are excluded from the 
attachment of their wages. One of them is somebody who is on the 
high seas or somebody who is a seaman and another one is 
somebody in a foreign embassy. However, the government is 
bringing in legislation so that child support payments and so on can 
be retrieved from these people. Here is another piece of legislation 
which will grant the government powers on the high seas.
<P>
	To conclude, the Bloc is against it, the Reform is against it, the 
NDP is against it and the Tories are against it. All of these nations 
quoted by Canadian Press are against it because those nations do 
not want to have their gigantic, huge draggers stopped around the 
Canadian coastline from ruining our fishery.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	It is a historic day and a historic piece of legislation. Once again 
it has been brought in by a Liberal administration, the third such 
piece of legislation we have had in the past 20 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as always I was 
very interested to hear the words of my hon. friend. I appreciate the 
work he does on this issue.
<P>
	However, as he was speaking he held up a copy of the Fisheries 
Act amendments and it was plain to see the thickness of that 
document. There is a lot in that document that goes well beyond 
what the member was talking about.
<P>
	We support the idea that Canada should play a much stronger 
role in managing the fishery in international waters where they 
affect Canadians and Canadian fishermen. I certainly agree with 
many of the remarks the member made about the Tories. However, 
we have all heard the expression: ``Don't throw the baby out with 
the bath water''. I am suggesting that with this bill Canadian 
fishermen and the Canadian people are going to be asked to drink a 
lot of stinking, rotten bath water to see a baby and that is not 
acceptable. There is a lot in this bill that is not acceptable and goes 
well beyond what this member was talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know. I did not see anything 
about dish water or anything like that in the legislation. I have 
sifted through it for about 15 minutes. I certainly do not see 
anything there. I suppose the hon. member is talking about the 
powers that are given to tribunals on each coast.
<P>
	However, we have not heard the other side of that argument. 
Under this legislation some decisions are put directly in the hands 
of those people who are affected by the policies of the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans. I do not see anything wrong with that. The 
government should have done that a long time ago.
<P>
	Overriding all of that is the point that the government is being 
criticized by many nations today because of this legislation, as per 
the Canadian Press articles.
<P>
	This is a great day for Canadian fishermen because the 
government is finally putting its foot down, putting some teeth in 
the legislation. The Reform Party and the Bloc should be standing 
up and saying: ``This is a great day. We are going to just cut off 
debate on this and put it through in one day''.

	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak out against violence against women. 
Less than a decade ago this act was met with snickers in this House.
<P>
	It is not so today, in part because of the greater number of 
women who now are represented in Parliament. But it is also 
because of the many women who refuse to remain silent any 
longer; groups like Saskatoon's December Memorial Committee, a 
collective of concerned women and women's groups who 
recognize that silence allows the violence to continue and who 
organized ``Speaking Out: A Portrait Violence'', a two-week 
awareness program designed to educate and increase public 
awareness through community events.
<P>
	I commend the committee for its ``Speaking Out'' event, a 
memorial to the tragedy at École Polytechnique, but also a public 
forum in a safe environment for the survivors of violence to speak 
out their stories through art, music and words.
<P>
	The power of their creative works and words brings our society 
one step closer to zero tolerance of violence against Canada's 
women and children.

national day of remembrance and action on violence against 
women, it is with sadness that we remember the tragic event at 
École Polytechnique in Montreal in which 14 young women lost 
their lives.
<P>
	That event has deeply marked the collective memory of 
Quebecers and Canadians. It compels us to think of the actions we 
must take to counter violence against women.
<P>
	Too often, men use their physical strength to force women to 
accept their points of view. We must act on ingrained prejudices 
which perpetuate the inequality of women at home and in the 
community. Mentalities are changing but not fast enough. We must 
act in our families and in our communities to make sure that 
women always feel safe everywhere.
<P>
	We must say no, loud and clear, to violence against women. 
From now on, it is zero tolerance.

	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is the national day of remembrance and action on 
violence against women. One of the greatest sources of violence 
against women, families and society is drunk driving.
<P>
	Therefore I ask all hon. members to support Motion No. 78 from 
the member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley to strengthen 
penalties in the Criminal Code that deal with impaired driving 
offences. This would deter others and make penalties reflect the 
seriousness of this crime.
<P>
	Representatives of Mothers Against Drunk Driving were here in 
Ottawa recently. Their executive director told my office: ``All the 
polls we have done say this government has not been proactive on 
the whole issue of impaired driving''.
<P>
	Yearly over four times more people are killed by drunk drivers 
than are murdered. Yet this government enacted compulsory gun 
registration against law-abiding gun owners while it refused to pass 
Bill C-201 which would have sent drunk drivers who kill to jail for 
seven years. I urge this government to get its priorities straight and 
stop drunk driving.

	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today in 
communities across Canada, men, women and children are 
gathering to remember the horrific events which occurred seven 
years ago at l'École Polytechnique in Montreal. On that December 
6, 14 bright young women lost their lives in a senseless act of 
violence. In my community of London, Ontario there are several 
events planned to mark this anniversary and to remember all 
women who suffer violence.
<P>
	We must help to end the violence with better understanding and 
education through governmental and non-governmental assistance. 
We must also do our part as legislators to pass relevant legislative 
measures.
<P>
	I commend those who strive every day not only to reduce 
violence against women but who work with the victims of violence 
including the husbands, wives, children, siblings and friends who 
also become victimized, sometimes to the extent that later in life 
cycles of violence are repeated.
<P>
	One day a year is set aside to recognize Canada's national day of 
remembrance and action on violence against women. Today the 
flag on the Peace Tower is flying at half mast. I strongly urge every

	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago 
14 bright, promising young women experienced hell on earth. 
Their crime? They were women. Their sentence was death. As I 
speak, other Canadian women are experiencing the horror of 
violence and intimidation.
<P>
	The only fitting tribute to the slain women of l'École 
Polytechnique and to all victims of violence is to stop the violence 
and to say never again. Much is being done and I applaud those 
working with abused women and children. Services like those 
offered by the Nepean Community Resource Centre in my Ontario 
riding are providing counselling, outreach and services for children 
who witness violence. Those services strive to undo the damage.
<P>
	Eliminating violence requires a commitment from all 
individuals. We must reject the stereotyping of women. The media 
must stop its glorification of violence and legislators at every level 
must enact laws to better protect our citizens. Canadians must unite 
against those who wreak death and terror. We must stand up and 
say never again.

outstanding Canadian, Dr. Charles Huggins.
<P>
	During his career Dr. Huggins was a leader in the field of cancer 
research. His accomplishments provided a stimulus for future 
developments in chemotherapy. It was 30 years ago, in 1966, that 
Dr. Huggins received the Nobel prize for his work in cancer 
research. Dr. Huggins developed the first non-radioactive, 
non-toxic chemical treatment for cancer. Prior to receiving this 
award, only one other surgeon had ever received the Nobel prize.
<P>
	Dr. Huggins spent most of his working life in the United States 
but he is a native of Nova Scotia and a graduate of Acadia

the 14 young women killed on December 6, 1989 at the École 
Polytechnique. All of Quebec and Canada continues to mourn your 
loss with you.
<P>
	Such a tragedy must never again be allowed to happen. So that 
all women can live in safety, not only must we remember the 
violence experienced by thousands of women every day, but we 
must also demonstrate a genuine political will to help ensure 
respect for the integrity of women.
<P>
	In addition to community action and court challenges, the fight 
to end violence against women must be added to the political 
agenda. The safety of 50 per cent of the population concerns

	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently one of my Reform colleagues introduced a 
private member's bill extending the child care tax deduction. The 
key is that the deduction would be converted to a refundable tax 
credit which would benefit those parents who choose to care for 
their own children.
<P>
	Presently a tax deduction can be received if someone else cares 
for your children but not if you choose to stay home and raise them 
yourself. As usual, the Liberal government refused to support the 
bill.
<P>
	Its solution to helping families cope with the stresses of the 
nineties is to implement a national day care strategy, a new $700 
million bureaucracy. I can well imagine the chaos a program like 
this will create for families in rural Saskatchewan and indeed in 
rural Canada.
<P>
	We all know that an institution is no substitute for the family. In 
fact, in a <I>Maclean's</I> poll last year, 70 per cent of Canadian families 
said that if they had the choice they would prefer to have one parent 
stay home with the children.

contrast to the legacy left by the previous Tory administration 
which, save two members now in the House, was wiped out in the

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	It has been clearly established that women with a family income 
of less than $15,000 are twice as likely to suffer physical abuse as 
women in the general population. In a document establishing the 
link between violence against women and poverty, the government 
said that unfortunately, the circumstances of women seemed to be 
getting worse. Governments are cutting budgets, reducing social 
programs and eliminating a number of programs and services that 
help low income women, men and children who are exposed to 
violence. These changes will probably lead to more poverty and 
more violence. And once again, women will be the worst off.
<P>
	Will the Government of Canada admit that by slashing its social 
programs to the tune of nearly $5 billion by 1998, it is going too far 
and that instead of helping women, it is making matters worse?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member opposite is right to be concerned about violence 
against women, as we all are.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7186"> 7186 </A></B>
<P>
	However, these accusations against the government are unfair. 
The hon. member must know that the new system of pensions for 
the elderly provide nine persons out of ten who live alone, and 
we know most of them are women, with benefits that are far more 
generous than under the old system. This is one example of the 
government's plans to ensure that women living below the poverty 
line will be better off under the system we intend to implement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was referring to a government document and to figures 
that appeared in the government's budget. These are not 
accusations, these are facts.
<P>
	I will continue. In the same document, the government said that 
as a society, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to 
help women get out of the vicious circle of poverty and violence. 
This means they must be given adequate resources in terms of child 
care, housing, training, social assistance benefits, and so forth.
<P>
	Since the federal government recognizes the link between 
women's poverty and violence against women, why it is cutting 
social programs by $5 billion? Why does the government insist on 
reducing its deficit at the expense of the neediest in our society, the 
majority of whom are women?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it 
is exactly the other way around. For instance, and I am following 
up on what my colleague said, the new old age benefit announced 
in the last budget is intended to deal with the concerns raised in the 
report.
<P>
	Seventy-five per cent of elderly persons will benefit under the 
new system. Benefits will be the same or exceed those now 
received by the elderly. We announced an increase for those 
receiving the annual $120 supplement, because we too are 
concerned about the problem of violence against women, 
especially older women.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we were treated to another minister, but the same answer. 
I agree that the measure that was announced is a good one. We did 
not say all the measures were bad. But it is rather odd we could find 
only one this morning. Two ministers for the same measure. Two 
ministers for the same answer.
<P>
	In the press release announcing the international day of 
remembrance and action on violence against women, the Secretary 
of State responsible for the Status of Women said that she hoped 
that Canadians would renew their commitment to prevent violence.

	Does the Secretary of State or anyone in this government realize 
this statement is contradicted by the decisions the government has 
been making?

and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
once again, the hon. member is making accusations. He must be 
aware of all the measures initiated by our government to deal with 
violence against women.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has just described a number of social 
reforms that will be beneficial.
<P>
	I would also like to remind the House of the amendments to Bill 
C-72 concerning self-induced intoxication used as a defence in 
cases of assault, especially against women. Amendments were also 
made to Bill C-68 concerning firearms and to the Criminal Code 
through Bill C-42. I could also mention sentencing reform and the 
review of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Last December, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed persons 
charged with sexual assault access to the medical and 
psychological files of their victims. As the result of this decision, a 
lot of women will now refuse to lodge a complaint for fear of 
finding themselves in the prisoner's dock.
<P>
	Given the Minister of Justice's promise to act quickly in this 
matter to protect victims of sexual assault, could he explain the 
delay in having legislative measures passed to ensure fair and 
equitable trials?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to assure my hon. friend on behalf the Minister of Justice 
that this continues to be a priority which engages the minister's 
attention. He is very conscious of the findings of the supreme court 
on this matter. Certainly action will be forthcoming before too 
long.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the government is favourably disposed, I will test its 
sincerity.
<P>
	Over two years ago, the justice committee proposed that the 
provisions for the Criminal Code on obscenity be amended to 
prevent the exploitation and glorification of horror, cruelty and 
violence in all its forms.
<P>
	How does the government justify the fact that no bill has yet 
been tabled to deal with this problem?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is something of importance to the government. I think it is 
clear to people serving in this House that the Minister of Justice on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7187"> 7187 </A></B>
<P>
behalf of this government has had a very heavy legislative program 
in  the area of justice reform, particularly matters of concern to 
women.
<P>
	Chief among them is the new Firearms Control Act. This was a 
major priority. With this act being adopted, we are well on our way 
to having the most effective gun control system in the world. This 
is important to prevent violence against Canadians generally but 
particularly against women.
<P>
	I thought I heard some grumbling from members of the Reform 
Party. I wish they would listen to what has been said in the House 
this morning and change their narrow-minded position and give 
support to this measure if they are sincere in their wish to fight 
against family violence, particularly violence against women.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Statistics Canada announced today to nobody's surprise 
that the unemployment rate for November was stuck at 10 per cent.
<P>
	For the benefit of the Minister of Finance who seems to love 
creating lists, here is a list for him created by three years of Liberal 
government: 1.5 million Canadians unemployed; a youth jobless 
rate of over 17 per cent; two to three million Canadians 
underemployed; and 25 per cent of all Canadians worried about 
losing their jobs. So much for the Liberal promise of jobs, jobs, 
jobs.
<P>
	Why will the finance minister not create real jobs by balancing 
the budget, lowering taxes in this country and making government 
smaller?
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
over the course of the last year, over 200,000 new jobs have been 
created in the private sector. Quite clearly one should look at the 
tendency over a longer period of time. There were 7,000 new jobs 
created as was announced by Statistics Canada this morning.
<P>
	It is the overall job creation that is by far most important. When 
we look at the G-7 countries, outside of the United States, Canada 
this year and last year has created more jobs than any other G-7 
country. This is as a result of the economic climate created by this 
government and the desire and the ambitions of Canadians for 
which we should all be proud.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure the Minister of Finance is aware that if we 
compare Canada with what other countries are doing, perhaps we 
do look good. The fact is we should be considering where Canada 
could be if we had a responsible government running the country. 
Let us compare it to where we could be.
<P>
	The association of Certified General Accountants has said that 
we could create 108,000 new jobs if the Liberal  government would 
lower taxes by only $4 billion. Just think of the jobs we could 
create if the government took the Reform Party's lead and lowered 
taxes by $15 billion. It is obvious that the Liberals' approach is not 
working because jobs are scarce in this country.
<P>
	I ask the minister again: Why will he not create real jobs by 
balancing the budget and lowering taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is pretty clear that the hon. member opposite has not had the 
opportunity to read the full CGA report which he has just cited.
<P>
	Reform members say that they want a faster deficit reduction. 
They are advocating slash and burn policies. In the CGA report the 
accountants have suggested slower deficit reduction than what we 
are engaging in. Furthermore, if I might quote from the CGA 
report: ``To give credit where credit is due, two years ago we could 
not have even considered entering into this debate on a tax 
reduction''. What the CGA is saying is that it is the policies not of 
the Reform Party but of the Liberal government that are giving us 
the success in cleaning up the balance sheet and allowing us to have 
the debate which we are now engaged in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian people are not going to be fooled and the 
Reform Party is not going to be fooled.
<P>
	We know that the only reason the deficit figures are looking 
good is that the Liberal government has wrenched out of the 
pockets of Canadians an extra $25 billion in increased taxes which 
the Liberals have raised 35 times since they have been in office. As 
a matter of fact they have only lowered taxes, lowered the deficit, 
lowered spending by about $3 billion. If you have an endless 
money tree you can shake down any time, any deficit can look 
good.
<P>
	The minister can bluster all he wants about what the Liberal 
government is doing but I ask the minister: Why has the Liberal 
government and the minister failed to deliver on what Canadians 
are asking for: lower taxes; real, long lasting, good paying jobs, not 
part time jobs to replace the full time jobs that they are losing; and 
a balanced budget? That is what is really needed. When is the 
finance minister going to listen to Canadians and do the right 
thing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately again the hon. member's facts are wrong. If we look 
at the 200,000 jobs that have been created this year, the vast 
majority are full time, permanent jobs.
<P>
	Most economists, for instance Rosenberg from Nesbitt Burns has 
said that as a result of the low interest rate policies of this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7188"> 7188 </A></B>
<P>
government, over $5 billion of new purchasing power has been put 
into the pockets of Canadians. If the hon. member refuses to fully 
read  reports of outside advisers, perhaps he might look at what his 
own party has said.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	In its 1995 taxpayers budget, the Reform Party advocated a slash 
and burn course and then went on to say: ``Under the Reform's 
taxpayer budget the short term employment impact of spending and 
deficit reduction is negative but manageable''. What is 
manageable: the loss of 30,000 jobs, the loss of 50,000 jobs, the 
loss of 100,000 jobs? That is what Reform has advocated. We are 
creating jobs.

question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, we learned about the smuggling of illegal 
immigrants from Hong Kong. This morning, we learned about the 
smuggling of illegal immigrants, this time from Iran through the 
Netherlands. This smuggling is said to have allowed the illegal 
entry into Canada of 4,000 Iranians, and to be operated by a very 
well organized network with connections in Canada.
<P>
	What serious and effective steps does the Solicitor General 
intend to take in order to stop this smuggling of illegal immigrants 
and reduce the number of people illegally entering Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the situation of immigrant smuggling is of serious concern to the 
government and certainly to the RCMP. It is a worldwide 
phenomenon and all countries are working to develop effective 
means of dealing with this problem.
<P>
	The RCMP is giving priority to dealing with the situation. More 
money was appropriated in recent estimates to assist the RCMP in 
working on this problem. I can assure my hon. friend that the 
RCMP is working closely with other governments to deal with the 
situation. Dealing with it continues to be a priority.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, only one 
RCMP officer handles this case. The Dutch authorities themselves 
said they were surprised that there was only one RCMP officer 
investigating such an important matter, when they themselves had 
assigned more than 30 police officers to work on it.
<P>
	Does the Solicitor General appreciate that by downplaying such 
important matters, police authorities are in fact penalizing all legal 
immigrants, who will suffer the direct and indirect repercussions of 
these illegal entries?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to assure my hon. friend that the RCMP is working closely 
with foreign governments, including the government of Holland to 
combat immigrant smuggling problems. This will continue 
because we agree it is a serious problem that deserves the high 
attention and priority of our police authorities. This is the case now

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government 
is about to announce its plan to fight child poverty.
<P>
	We all agree that families are suffering. Under this government 
unemployment is chronically at 10 per cent, personal bankruptcies 
have hit record levels, and the average family income has shrunk 
by an incredible $3,000.
<P>
	The finance minister says he is committed to fighting family 
poverty. Why will he not adopt Reform's plan to take at least one 
million of Canada's working poor completely off the tax rolls?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is incumbent upon the Reform Party to put the full impact of its 
program before the Canadian people and before the House.
<P>
	While Reform advocates a tax cut, that tax cut will only come 
well down the peace and substantially two to three years after the 
Reform Party has in fact cut the Canadian health and social 
transfer, cut equalization payments, after it has cut the basic social 
programs upon which those very Canadians rely. It is simply not 
reasonable or an accurate representation of the facts for the Reform 
to stand in the House and talk about a tax cut when what they would 
do would be to impose an unbearable financial burden upon low 
income Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are talking 
here about the difference between this government's policy of 
taxing people whether they are poor or not and leaving their 
earnings in their own hands.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	Let me tell the truth about the Reform Party's plan. A single 
parent on social assistance with two children will have $1,300 more 
per year. A single parent earning $22,000 would get to keep an 
additional $200 each month and would keep that away from the tax 
man. Two parents making $35,000 would have their taxes reduced 
by $2,800 per year.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="7189"> 7189 </A></B>
<P>
	This country is in trouble when we have a finance minister who

minister refusing to give poor parents tax relief so that they can 
provide for their children with pride and independence without 
having to rely on government handouts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is not what the Reform Party is suggesting.
<P>
	The Reform Party has said that its very first act will be to cut 
$3.5 billion in welfare payments. At the same time Reform has said 
that none of its positive programs will come in for years after it has 
in fact devastated the social fabric. That is the basis of the Reform 
program.
<P>
	In last year's budget the government doubled the working 
income supplement. That helps poor Canadians. In last year's 
budget the Minister of Justice and myself announced a 
tremendously reformed set of social programs for families with a 
custodial parent who is having difficulty.
<P>
	If we look at the caregivers credit and every single measure of 
our budget, they were all directed to helping low income 
Canadians. The only question that comes up is: Why did the

question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Canadian government chose to give up its 
leadership regarding a humanitarian mission to eastern Zaire. The 
Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the crisis had shifted to inside 
Rwanda where the problem now was the resettlement of refugees 
returning home. For his part, the defence minister announced 
yesterday the cancellation of the Canadian-led mission and 
questioned whether last week's highly publicized plan to air drop 
food would go ahead.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the Canadian government has given up 
on eastern Zaire where, according to the UN envoy, some 300,000 
refugees are still trapped, to concentrate its efforts solely on the 
resettlement of refugees who are returning to Rwanda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the member 
knows fully well that nobody said yesterday that we were going to 
cancel the humanitarian mission in Zaire and Central Africa.
<P>
	What we said is that military developments in that area are being 
monitored by a steering group made up of representatives from 
countries belonging to the coalition. General Baril is assessing and 
will continue to assess the situation in the field.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the situation has evolved dramatically. 
Canada did not go there on a unilateral basis, and will not leave on 
a unilateral basis. What is happening over there is based on 
assessments made by all parties involved in the mission, and who 
are party to the agreement reached a few weeks ago as a result of 
the Canadian Prime Minister's initiative.
<P>
	The sad thing in all this is that the hon. member does not seem to 
realize that the huge success we encountered over there resulted in 
the unprecedented return home of over 700,000 refugees from 
Zaire to Rwanda, without any casualty or endangering troops in the 
field.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, instead 
of claiming, as the defence minister did yesterday and as he is 
doing again today, that Canada played a major role as a catalyst in 
the return of refugees and that the whole process was a phenomenal 
success, will the minister admit that if he really wants to show 
some leadership, he should convene an international conference to 
find some permanent solutions to the conflicts in the great lakes 
region?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation

Mr. Speaker, the Department of National Defence has apparently

sales program. Audits show that it has used the program as a year 
end slush fund and that it cannot account for millions of dollars in 
missiles and torpedoes and other mission sensitive equipment.

<P>
been wasted and that nobody knows where missiles and other types 
of military matériel might be.
<P>
	What I do agree with, however, in the context of the question put 
by my hon. friend, is that there have been some questions raised 
about the way this fund has been managed over many years because 
of the requirement of the American government with respect to the 
acquisition of military matériel from the United States.
<P>
	An internal audit is being conducted. Unless he and the House of

with the results of that audit, we will take whatever measures are 
appropriate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that is no comfort to the Canadian taxpayer. The 
Department of National Defence has lost $200 million of 
taxpayers' money. Nothing has been done to rectify this problem 
which has been going on for 15 years.
<P>
	The audit notes show that the problems have continued all the 
way through 1996, including today. The department knows full 
well about this mismanagement of taxpayers' money and has 
refused to take any action.
<P>
	Will the minister immediately request that the Auditor General

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

about, which I might add is a very sophisticated program dealing 
with aerial navigation, not only have there been changes to the 
program put forward by Hughes, but also cost overruns.
<P>
	This is a matter of considerable regret and concern to the 
government. We have done everything that we possibly can to try 
to ensure that we get best value for that contract. I must point out to 
him, although the Reform Party does not appear to want to hear the 
facts on this situation, that when entering a contracting situation for 
the development of future technology from a corporation such as 
the Hughes Aircraft, it is not possible to take the same approach as 
buying a can of soup on the shelf of a store. A certain amount of 
discussion must take place back and forth as the development takes 
place and as the scientists and computer technicians develop the 
technology that you may wish to put in place.

<P>
	Does the minister not agree that by giving biased information to 
the auditor general, maintaining that renegotiation of the contract 
did not lead to any substantial increase in cost, despite a real 
increase of $217 million, his department was trying to hide from 
Canada and Quebec taxpayers its poor management of the project?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the imagination of the hon. member is impressive but not 
realistic. When developing new technology for highly 
sophisticated navigational systems, the contract must be flexible to 
some degree. In some instances you may be paying substantially 
less than expected if progress is better than anticipated beforehand. 
Sometimes you may find yourself having to accept less or pay 
more. We were in that situation.

multibillion dollar industry of trafficking of people.
<P>
	I ask the parliamentary secretary if the government is prepared 
to introduce tough new penalties that would deter these criminals 
from trafficking in human beings?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact that the 
individual received jail it is obvious that we have very strong 
legislation-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> One day in jail?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> Nonetheless the individual will be deported and not 
be allowed to stay in this country. Bill C-44 deals very clearly with 
that issue, something which the opposition did not support.
<P>
	As I said before, the RCMP have very strong relations with 
police abroad. In this case, which the hon. member has cited, by 
working together with the Dutch officials we have uncovered this 
issue and it is being dealt with. The system is working. When 
people are caught they are deported. The system we have in place is 
very effective.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, the finance minister said in this House, and I 
quote: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7192"> 7192 </A></B>
<P>
``When someone leaves the country, it is quite likely the tax is not 
due, since the item in question was never sold; so there is no capital 
gains tax''.
<P>
	His motion tabled on October 2 indicated that, when assets are 
transferred out of the country, there is deemed disposition. The 
capital gain must be calculated and the tax is payable.
<P>
	My question is quite simple, it is a Taxation 101 question. Yes or 
no, does a transfer of assets out of the country cause a disposition 
and thus the calculation of the capital gain on which a tax is to be 
paid?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, a 
capital gain is realized when the item in question is sold. That 
having been said, since we have the right to tax residents, we want 
to ensure that someone who is a resident and who becomes a 
non-resident pays us the tax when it is due. The tax is determined 
when the emigrant leaves the country.
<P>
	If the emigrant did not sell the item, this is treated the same way 
as if someone had something to sell in the country, that is, when it 
is sold, the tax is payable, except that it is determined when the 
emigrant leaves the country. That is where we ask for the security.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I now realize that the minister tables ways and means 
motions and related documents without knowing what they 
contain. It is incredible to hear such things.
<P>
	Thus, according to the minister, there is no disposition when a 
rich taxpayer transfers his assets out of the country. However, the 
motion he tabled on October 2 said, and I quote once again: ``When 
there is a transfer of trusts out of the country, we ask for a security 
that is sufficient to pay for any tax due through the deemed 
disposition''. This is exactly the opposite of what the minister just 
said. This is incredible.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has the flu, so I also understand this is sometimes 
hard to follow.
<P>
	The member just explained the exact situation. The tax is 
determined when the emigrant leaves the country. The capital gain 
taxable in Canada is the difference between the purchase price and 
the value when the emigrant leaves the country. The gain is realized 
when the item in question is sold, which is the same as when this 
happens in the country.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
former CRTC chairman stated that Canadians that rely on direct to 
home satellite service from the United States would not be 
prosecuted for violating CRTC regulations.
<P>
	Recent media reports indicate that maybe officials are getting 
ready to prosecute those persons whose only crime appears to be 
that there is no Canadian provider of those satellite services.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Industry give his assurance to the House and 
the people of Canada that until companies in Canada start 
providing DTH services that Canadians who receive U.S. signals 
will not be charged with an offence.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I think he 
understands that it is very important that we distinguish between 
the black market in this trade and the grey market.
<P>
	It is an offence to tamper with the equipment that enables people 
to acquire signals from satellites without paying for them. That is 
the black market. In the cases that have been reported in the 
newspapers it has been a case of the RCMP endeavouring to 
enforce the law in respect of the black market.
<P>
	With respect to the grey market generally speaking, consumers 
will acquire a system through an intermediary that orders the direct 
to home service from an address in the United States and they pay 
indirectly for that service. It is not our intention to take any legal 
action against those subscribers.
<P>
	I would like to make sure that they understand that they do not 
have the ability to ensure that the service will continue to be 
delivered to them. In fact, they may be at peril of losing a fairly 
substantial investment of $1,000 to $1,500 in the equipment 
because there is no way to ensure that the American service 
provider will continue to provide them with service.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister will be aware that the reason for the grey market is that 
there are no Canadian providers. The reason there is no Canadian 
service is because of CRTC regulations, an over abundance of 
regulations and hurdles that these companies have to go through.
<P>
	What will the government do to clear away the obstacles and the 
red tape that prevent Canadian companies from fulfilling the 
market that is there, ready and waiting?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member will be pleased to know that at least one  
<P>

<B><A NAME="7193"> 7193 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian provider expects to be offering a service in the very near 
future.
<P>
	In addition, the hon. member will know that we launched a 
request for submissions to the private sector in the hope that on a 
fast track we will have a proposal by December 15 to establish a 
Canadian direct to home satellite service in the Canadian satellite 
slot.
<P>
	The hon. member will also know that if we are to have a 
Canadian service we need to be able to ensure that the service is up 
and running. To do that it is necessary for us to ensure that there is 
respect for the law and that the licensing laws in Canada are 
applied.
<P>
	He will know that a Canadian service provider would not be 
licensed to provide direct to home service in the United States. I am 
sure for that reason he would not encourage us to permit U.S. 
service providers to provide service in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> According to the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans DFO, records, there are at present 33 existing 
dams and diversions built and operated by B.C. Hydro in the 
province. These are as follows. In the Columbia Region: Mica 
Project, Revelstoke Project, Keenleyside Project, Seven Mile 
Project, Walter Hardman Project, Whatshan Project, Spillimacheen 
Project, Aberfeldie Project, Elko Project, Duncan Project,

<P>
	The potential effects of flow control on fish and fish habitat 
include effects on productivity and water quality in reservoirs and 
effects on habitat quantity and quality, benthic productivity, water 
quality and fish behaviour downstream of release facilities. A list 
of the potential impacts of hydro dams and diversions on salmon is 
given below.

<P>
	The majority of B.C. Hydro projects were undertaken many 
years ago. At that time, potential impacts of facility operations on 
fish and fish habitat at a specific site were often not fully known 
owing to limited knowledge of the fisheries resources at risk at that 
site. Furthermore, in today's context, fish and fish habitat are often 
impacted by B.C. Hydro's management of its day to day 
operations. For example, flow constraints imposed at one plant for 
fisheries protection may have a system-wide effect, for example, 
block loading at one plant may increase load fluctuations at another 
plant, or result in even greater impacts at another facility. This is 
why it is important for DFO to work with B.C. Hydro to attempt to 
maximize benefits to fisheries from hydro operations.
<P>
	In June 1993, the B.C. government directed B.C. Hydro to 
undertake a review to determine the feasibility of altering its 
electric generation system, operations to increase net social and 
environmental benefits to the province. The provincial government 
liaison committee, responsible for implementing the 
recommendations stemming from this review, established a fish 
power issue management committee on which DFO has 
representation. This committee in turn has established a technical 
working group which is reviewing B.C. Hydro water licences for 
facilities located on 10 priority watersheds in coastal and southern 
interior B.C., all of which support salmon. All 88 B.C. Hydro water 
licences will be reviewed within the next 3 years.
<P>
	Through its participation on these committees and working 
groups, DFO is working to have fisheries protection measures 
incorporated into B.C. Hydro water licences. An example of recent 
fisheries/hydro interactions was the resolution of the low flow 
issue on Alouette River. Stakeholder negotiations involving federal 
and provincial agencies, First Nations, B.C. Hydro and public 
advisory groups resulted in a flow agreement based on 
scientifically defensible information and a socioeconomic model.
<P>
	Despite such co-operative work, fish-power conflicts continue to 
arise in B.C. DFO will continue to work with B.C. Hydro to 
minimize these events but will nevertheless take action where 
appropriate, as is evident with the current Fisheries Act 
prosecutions for events occurring on the Bridge River in 1992 and 
1993.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-62, 
an act respecting fisheries, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee, and of the amendment and amendment to the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Five minutes were promised to hon. 
member for Gaspé for questions and comments, but this seems to 
be impossible as the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls is not 
in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would still like 
to make a comment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that the hon. 
member for Gander-Grand Falls will be very interested in the 
comment I have to make following his speech.
<P>
	There are two points in my comment. The hon. member for 
Gander-Grand Falls argued that the Bloc and the Reform Party 
were against such a nice bill which, according to him, is protecting 
us against the bad countries which come to fish our straddling 
stocks. The hon. member said that we, in the Bloc, are against that, 
which is not true.
<P>
	I hope he will respond to this because the Bloc Quebecois 
immediately offered its support when Brian Tobin, who was then 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7196"> 7196 </A></B>
<P>
fisheries minister, wanted to introduce a bill protecting these 
straddling stocks and  allowing us to use force if necessary. The 
Bloc Quebecois agreed; it was a historic moment. The secretary of 
state for agriculture and fisheries was present at the time. The Bloc 
Quebecois agreed to go through the three stages of that bill in one 
day. Is the use of such common sense not a sign of co-operation?
<P>
	Is there any common sense in this bill? That is the question. We 
proved to you that we are willing to support any sensible initiative, 
but this is not the case.
<P>
	I have a second comment. The hon. member for Gander-Grand 
Falls has been sitting in this House for 20 or 25 years maybe and 
has seen a lot of governments-both Conservative and 
Liberal-come and go. There were changes in government in his 
own province, with the Tories and the Grits taking turns, but 
despite all his whining a moment ago, he never once said to us that 
somewhere in this bill, the federal government is protecting his 
own province.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Where in the bill does it say that the Newfoundland fisheries 
minister will have a say in ensuring that Canada and the fisheries 
minister protect the stocks adequately? Nowhere. Nowhere is it 
mentioned in the bill.
<P>
	How often did Clyde Wells, the Liberal Premier of 
Newfoundland, come to Ottawa to say to then fisheries minister 
Crosbie, a Conservative, that foreign overfishing had to be 
stopped? There was no official link, the federal Minister of 
Fisheries had no obligation whatsoever to listen to his provincial 
counterpart.
<P>
	What happened? Things dragged out. What did it take for the 
government to finally introduce legislation against overfishing? 
Maybe a combination of circumstances. There was Mr. Tobin, a 
Liberal minister from Newfoundland, and there was also a 
provincial Liberal government, under the leadership of Clyde 
Wells. As a member of the Bloc, I myself said that this bill made 
perfect sense and that we would vote for it.
<P>
	Where does it say the Government of Newfoundland will have a 
say? Things will not always be as they are today. Imagine that the 
Conservatives are back in office or that we have a Reform 
government. Who knows what can happen? Do you think that the 
Newfoundland fisheries minister would see eye to eye with a 
Reform Prime Minister? We in the Bloc do not wish to form the 
government. The rest of Canada will be on its own.
<P>
	Think about a way of allowing the provinces to be heard. 
Newfoundland is surrounded by sea. Newfoundland must have a 
say; the central government must not be the only one to decide.
<P>
	As a responsible parliamentarian, the hon. member for 
Gander-Grand Falls must ensure that, next time, this government 
will introduce measures protecting his province.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Because the member for Gaspé was 
promised a few more minutes by the Chair, he was allowed to speak 
for five more minutes.
<P>
	As every member knows, the member who made the comments 
that triggered this reply was not in the House. Usually, one cannot 
speak if the member who made the comments is not in his or her 
seat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, I would like to tell my colleague, the hon. member for 
Gaspé, that I agree with many of the things he said about our 
colleague, the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-who is taking great advantage of blaming everything that is 
happening on the Conservatives while he is reluctant for the 
Liberals to take any blame for what has happened in the fisheries.
<P>
	The government has put before the House Bill C-62, the fisheries 
act. This legislation will radically change the management of the 
fishery as we have known it for over 150 years. If passed, Bill C-62 
would give the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans unlimited 
discretion to carve up the public fishery into private and exclusive 
fisheries. That is bad news.
<P>
	The bill contains no requirement for any publication of private or 
exclusive fisheries agreements. There would be no guidelines on 
who might be the recipient of these agreements. The private fishing 
agreements can override any regulation governing the public 
fishery made by the governor in council, that is, the cabinet.
<P>
	These fishing agreements would be similar to the aboriginal 
fishing agreements that the government currently enters into with 
native bands under its aboriginal fishery strategy. We heard nothing 
about that from the member for Gander-Grand Falls.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Under this bill the minister would be given unlimited discretion 
to make his own regulations and to organize the fishery by 
ministerial decrees or orders. These ministerial orders could 
override a condition of a licence. The bill would give the minister 
the power to take away the historic common law public right to fish 
in exchange for a privilege dependent on the whim of the minister.
<P>
	The government would be able to transfer its constitutional 
responsibilities for fisheries management, enforcement, and 
habitat protection to the provinces without coming back to seek the 
consent of this Parliament.
<P>
	The government views this new legislation as a political 
necessity following three decisions of the supreme court last 
August. The court held that British Columbia natives do not have a 
constitutional right to a separate commercial salmon fishery. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7197"> 7197 </A></B>
<P>
decisions exposed the native only commercial fishery 
arrangements undertaken by the government as a fraud.
<P>
	In the past the public was assured that the government had been 
required to establish the separate fishery by the courts. There is 
now greater awareness that the present Fisheries Act does not give 
the government authority to establish a native only commercial 
fishery. The government has been operating outside the law.
<P>
	Without the new powers in the bill, the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans would probably be unable to operate a separate native 
commercial fishery. The government would also have to admit that 
the criticism levelled by fishermen against this separate native only 
commercial fishery was correct.
<P>
	The bill would give unlimited discretionary power to the 
minister to regulate the fishery, to enter into private fishing 
agreements, to transfer control to the provinces but without any 
accountability, without yardsticks with which to evaluate what the 
government is doing.
<P>
	A new fisheries act ought to deal with the real problems in the 
fishery, not simply make life easier for the government. It ought to 
solve problems, not create new ones. It ought to respect the law, not 
try to get around the law.
<P>
	Let me remind the government of some issues that Bill C-62 
ought to have addressed. John Fraser, a respected former Speaker, 
in his study of the mismanagement of the salmon fishery on the 
Fraser River in 1994 identified problems with fisheries and oceans. 
Then the government in the spring of 1995 undertook to implement 
all 35 recommendations from Mr. Fraser.
<P>
	A study undertaken in the spring of this year by DFO evaluated 
the department's success in implementing Fraser's 
recommendations. Let me read directly from the study. DFO's own 
study speaks eloquently of the department's failure. One of 
Fraser's recommendations was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That DFO retain and exercise its constitutional responsibilities and not in any way 
abrogate its stewardship of resources under federal jurisdiction. Conservation must 
be the primary objective of both fisheries managers and all others participating in the 
fishery. That conservation must prevail throughout and be adhered to by all.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The evaluation study instead found that ``stock-specific 
conservation of the Fraser River sockeye is threatened. DFO cannot 
hope to succeed without a clear vision of what it is trying to 
achieve''. It stated: ``The first requirement therefore is an explicit 
definition of conservation''. It also stated: ``There can be no 
conservation of Fraser sockeye salmon in the long run without 
equivalent care and protection for habitat on which fish stocks 
rely''.
<P>
	Bill C-62 does not contain any definition of conservation and 
Bill C-62 weakens habit protection. Bill C-62 would allow the 
government to transfer to the  provinces responsibilities for habitat 
protection, the very opposite of what Fraser recommended.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Let me go on with Mr. Fraser's recommendations: ``That DFO 
and the Pacific Salmon Commission''-of which we heard nothing 
from the member from Gander-``adopt a risk aversion 
management strategy because of the great uncertainty on stock 
estimates, in season catch estimates and environmental problems''. 
The evaluation study undertaken this year by DFO under contract 
found: ``A risk averse strategy has not yet been developed. We 
found that DFO's actions were not the result of an explicit, well 
defined averse management strategy but rather were a response to 
the unprecedented events of the 1995 fishery''.
<P>
	Therefore we can conclude that Bill C-62 does not contain any 
requirement for risk averse management of the fishery or even a 
definition, totally contrary to what was recommended in the Fraser 
report. Let us take another recommendation of Mr. Fraser's:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DFO develop better co-ordinated inter-party communications among its staff and 
between staff and the Pacific Salmon Commission, First Nations, commercial and 
recreational fishing groups, with a greater degree of co-operation aimed at enhanced 
in season management and post season evaluation, and at fostering working 
arrangements among all parties-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So much for the recommendation by Mr. Fraser. The evaluation 
study found: ``Tensions between DFO and the Pacific Salmon 
Commission persist particularly with respect to the free flow of 
data. This is true of integration with both ocean fisheries and in 
river aboriginal fisheries''.
<P>
	We conclude that Bill C-62 does not contain any requirement 
that there be a free flow of scientific data between DFO and the 
salmon commission. In fact Bill C-62 would continue to leave the 
openings for aboriginal fisheries outside the commission. There is 
only one set of fish and there cannot be two competing 
organizations managing it in isolation from one another.
<P>
	Bill C-62 would give the minister unlimited authority to sign 
such agreements but without any recognition of Fraser's 
recommendation. Let me cite another recommendation from Mr. 
Fraser:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Canadian section of the Fraser River Panel be vested with responsibility 
for in season management for Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon fisheries in 
Canadian waters beyond the current Pacific Salmon Commission convention area. 
Further, to facilitate communications and understanding between DFO and PSC of 
the in season run and stock size estimates, a member of the DFO stock assessment 
division be assigned to work closely with PSC during planning, estimation and 
evaluation of run estimating procedures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Instead, after that recommendation the evaluation study found 
that there are still problems in the integration of DFO and Pacific 
Salmon Commission activities particularly with respect to the 
transfer of  information. The evaluation study found that based on 
numerous interviews with DFO staff and industry reps, it is clear 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7198"> 7198 </A></B>
<P>
that certain difficulties still face the integration of panel fisheries 
and non-panel fisheries.
<P>
	The evaluation study found instead: ``We understand from both 
parties, DFO and PSC, that relations between the two organizations 
have been somewhat strained in recent years-effective 
communication and co-operation between the two are essential to 
conservation and good management of Fraser sockeye'', that is 
Fraser River sockeye. ``Whether the problems arise from politics or 
personalities, immediate action is required to ensure effective 
communications and co-ordination between DFO and PSC''.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-62 ignores this problem. Because it is a structural problem 
involving two separate organizations each operating under its own 
statutes, specific recognition of this problem in the bill would have 
gone a long way to solving it. Ignoring this longstanding west coast 
problem will not make it go away. Unfortunately it guarantees that 
it will be with us indefinitely.
<P>
	Let us look at another Fraser report recommendation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That an independent Pacific fisheries conservation council be established to act as 
a public watchdog for the fishery, to report to ministers and the public annually and 
from time to time as is appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What did the evaluation study find with regard to that 
recommendation? It found to date that DFO has not developed an 
annual review process as recommended in the Fraser report. It 
found that the consolidated annual review process such as was 
called for has not yet been implemented.
<P>
	The Fraser commission made a whole series of 
recommendations. Fraser is a well-respected man. The evaluation 
study, which went hard on its heels, has virtually ignored many or 
most of the recommendations.
<P>
	Bill C-62 as a bill is good news, but only for the minister of 
fisheries. To the fish, fishers and people of Canada it is bad news. 
The Reform Party cannot in any way support Bill C-62.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan for bearing witness to the fact that the 
speeches are now 10 minutes and there are no further questions or 
comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy to speak to Bill C-62, on fisheries, which 
the minister repeatedly called the bill of the century. For his part, 
the critic for the Bloc said that the bill of the century was rather a 
botched job.
<P>
	Why do we, from the Bloc, say that this bill is a botched job? 
Simply because it is not what the industry requires. It will allow all 
kind of activities and will leave  the door wide open to patronage. I 
think that instead of helping the individuals and companies the 
minister said he intended to help, the bill will greatly complicate 
matters for them.
<P>
	The Bloc thinks that there are three major flaws in Bill C-62. The 
first one concerns the provisions which allow the minister to 
choose the fisheries management agreements partners. It is obvious 
that the minister is giving himself all the leeway he needs to decide 
whom he will be dealing with, who will be making the decisions.
<P>
	It is clear that the industry itself never wanted the minister or his 
top civil servants to make the decisions; lately, it has been seen that 
ministers are not very knowledgeable about their own departments. 
We have seen that, at present, top public servants, and even junior 
public servants, are calling the shots. At least that is the impression 
left by the answers given in this Chamber. So, those public servants 
will make the decisions instead of the people from the industry who 
would have liked to be heard and play a leading role in shaping the 
important decisions that are badly needed to improve the fisheries.
<P>
	I repeat that we are not against legislation that would modernize 
and improve the situation of the fishers. In fact, that is what we are 
waiting for. But the minister's approach is wrong.
<P>
	Therefore, the first major flaw of the bill is the discretionary 
power the minister wants, to choose the partners with whom he will 
make the important decisions for the future of fisheries.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The other major flaw is the devolution, which is certainly 
inadequate and inconsistent. The federal Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans wants to transfer powers to the provinces, but he still 
controls the levers.
<P>
	There is a major inconsistency since, on the one hand, the 
minister transfers to the provinces the authority to issue licences 
while, on the other hand, he wants to negotiate agreements on the 
management and protection of resources directly with industry 
stakeholders without the provinces being involved in the 
discussions.
<P>
	That must be it, when we hear in every throne speech, year after 
year, that the federal government is a flexible government. Yes, the 
federal government is flexible as long as the other parties 
co-operate. That is the kind of flexibility it means.
<P>
	This bill is quite simple, generally speaking. The federal 
government could prove its flexibility by giving the provinces 
more jurisdiction and authority, but this bill shows that the right 
hand of the government does not know what the left hand is doing.
<P>
	My third point-and it is an important one-concerns the 
establishment of fisheries tribunals. This is only a front for the 
minister, and I would even dare say a real haven of patronage. Now, 
why should I focus on this? As  you know, I am justice critic, and it 
is from this angle that I have looked at clause 65 and the clauses 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7199"> 7199 </A></B>
<P>
that follow dealing with the establishment per se of the fisheries 
tribunals.
<P>
	We understand that this was a response to certain difficulties 
being experienced by the department. However, there are two 
major problems with establishing these tribunals, and a look at Bill 
C-62 will show us what they are.
<P>
	If we look at clause 65 in part III, administrative sanctions, the 
immediate conclusion is that these tribunals will be administrative 
in nature. If we are talking about administrative tribunals, the 
conclusion is that there will be decisions made that include 
administrative sanctions, with fines that can be very heavy. The 
Atlantic Fisheries Tribunal and the Pacific Fisheries Tribunal do 
have an area of jurisdiction.
<P>
	Clause 69 sets out members' terms of office:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) The members of a Tribunal shall be appointed to hold office during good 
behaviour for a term not exceeding three years, but may be removed by the 
Governor in Council at any time for cause.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) A member may be re-appointed to a Tribunal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A three year term is not that long, especially when we know that 
the minister will be laying down the ground rules. He will proceed 
the way he wants, often without Parliament's knowledge. He will 
establish regulations, and the people in the fisheries tribunals will 
enforce them. Three years is not a long term of office. The bill may 
well say that it cannot be exceeded, but if these people want their 
career to go on a little longer than three years, they are much better 
advised to dance to the minister's tune.
<P>
	Everyone understands that, and I think that, on this three year 
criterion alone, it is contrary to paragraph 11(d) of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I also wonder about the 
appointment of these tribunal members. Who will decide on 
appointments?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Friends of the party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> The members across the way have the nerve 
to tell me that it will be friends of the party. Yes, that is who it will 
be. I am glad to hear it from the benches across the aisle. Yes, the 
minister will appoint friends of the party. It is true, that is Liberal 
party patronage for you.
<P>
	In addition, the friends of the party who will be appointed to this 
administrative tribunal will not even need to have legal 
background.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The only requirement is some ability in the areas of fish stocks 
or administration. In areas of such importance, legal training 
should have been a minimum requirement. I think this is extremely 
important given the  administrative sanction that will be applied to 
people in the fishing industry.
<P>
	This indicates the government's approach with the bill. They 
start off with fine principles, as we have often seen. They shake a 
lot of things up, they create great smoke screens and, in the end, 
little changes. Unfortunately, this government has a false front.
<P>
	We have seen it on a number of occasions involving lobby 
groups and justice matters. I am the justice critic. The government 
makes grand speeches, great discourse on violence, against 
dangerous criminals, against this and against that. Why? For the 
voters. It sells well.
<P>
	Things are not any different with the fisheries bill. I hear a 
Liberal member saying they never do that. He admits they do petty 
politicking in such a case. It is unacceptable, particularly on the 
part of the secretary in this matter.
<P>
	We could have reached a consensus with the community, 
because it wanted changes. But no. The Liberal government, the 
minister, the minister's secretary were up to petty politics, as 
always, for their personal gain and their own political ambitions 
and not for the industry. This is why we will vote against the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my remarks I 
want to respond to some of the comments which the hon. member 
for Gander-Grand Falls made this morning in debate.
<P>
	The member is, of course, quite right when he talks about the 
foreign overfishing that has taken place in Canadian waters and just 
outside Canadian waters which affects Canadian fish stocks.
<P>
	He is quite right when he notes that it was the Conservative 
government between 1984 and 1992 which dramatically increased, 
by agreement, the amount of foreign fishing in Canadian waters.
<P>
	I do not refer to these amendments as being amendments to the 
Fisheries Act. I know that is how the government treats them. 
However, if we look at the bill, it will create a new act. It replaces 
the old act almost entirely.
<P>
	There are, indeed, some aspects of the bill which are good. The 
problem, and it is the same problem we have with many pieces of 
government legislation, is that buried in among the parts of the 
legislation which we can support are many aspects of the 
legislation that we find totally reprehensible. Therefore we have to 
decline our support for the entire piece of legislation.
<P>
	I hope that members who feel strongly about foreign fishing in 
Canadian waters and outside Canadian territorial waters, which 
affects Canada's fish stocks, will understand that what we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7200"> 7200 </A></B>
<P>
saying is that the entire bill is so comprehensive and so far reaching 
in its impacts that we cannot support it. I am going to go through 
the  main reasons, in the limited time I have, to discuss why we 
cannot support the bill.
<P>
	There are problems in almost every fishery in Canada today. 
There are some fisheries that, thankfully, do not experience very 
many problems or any serious problems at the present time. 
However, they are the exception and not the rule.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Whether Pacific salmon, Atlantic groundfish or lobster, most of 
the fisheries in Canada are having problems of one sort of another 
and some are very serious problems.
<P>
	In 1992-93 the government had to declare a moratorium on 
groundfish and cod in Atlantic Canada. We heard scientists talking 
about environmental conditions, seal populations and so on, but the 
raw fact is those stocks were overfished and overfished habitually 
and regularly for many years.
<P>
	Why were they overfished? In essence the decision making with 
respect to catch limits, who could actually have a licence and how 
the resource was going to be managed was basically driven by 
politics, not by science and not by sound business principles. It was 
driven by politics and of course the results are obvious.
<P>
	I remember clearly watching the former minister of fisheries and 
oceans under the Conservative government, Mr. Crosbie, in a press 
conference in Newfoundland. He was sitting surrounded by DFO 
officials and he said: ``We are hearing some scientific evidence that 
is suggesting that we should reduce our quotas and reduce the 
harvest rates on cod. But we are not prepared to make those kinds 
of decisions because there are too many people who are depending 
on this fishery for their jobs and their livelihood. We think the 
scientific evidence is not strong enough and therefore we are just 
going to allow the current catch rates to continue''. And they did. 
They fished it right into the ground.
<P>
	Yes, there may have been some environmental conditions which 
added to the problem. Yes, there may have been some problems 
with respect to seals which added to the problem but the seals were 
not the main problem and the environment was not the main 
problem. Those stocks were fished into oblivion. There remains the 
question today of whether those stocks are going to rejuvenate over 
time.
<P>
	There is some indication and a ray of hope that some of these 
stocks are starting to rebound as we speak and have been for the 
last couple of years since the moratorium was imposed. That is 
some stocks, but not all of them. Even the ones that have improved 
have improved only marginally. There are not massive increases in 
recruitment, massive increases in stock levels. There has been 
some minor improvement and in some cases an improvement that 
is encouraging for all who depend on the fishery.
<P>
	The main problem is that politics has driven the decision making 
process. It has been the same whether it has been a Tory 
government or a Liberal government; it has been political decision 
making.
<P>
	For example, we have the FRCC now saying that there is a minor 
improvement in stock levels. There is some hope that these stocks 
are going to come back. We have a discussion taking place this fall 
as to whether the cod fishery in Newfoundland, the upper St. 
Lawrence River and Bay of Fundy is going to be reopened next 
year for a limited commercial harvest.
<P>
	Frankly, while I can understand that the FRCC would like to 
have more and better information with respect to stocks, and that is 
part of the reason it is recommending a very limited opening, in my 
view it is a major mistake for the government to look at any kind of 
a commercial harvest under the present circumstances. I am very 
concerned that we are going to have a decision from the minister 
very soon suggesting that is exactly what we are going to see next 
year.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	We have to get away from politics driving the decision making 
process. This bill does not address any of the problems that I talked 
about. It is going to give the minister much more power than he has 
at the present time. The underlying reason for that is that the 
minister wants to make more political decisions and not less.
<P>
	The minister wants to be able to enter into agreements with 
individual groups and organizations for access to fish stocks on an 
exclusionary basis. That is something we have never seen in 
Canada before. We know that the underlying reason for it is that the 
government is trying to justify the aboriginal fishing strategy in 
British Columbia. We know there is no constitutional or legal 
support for the pilot sales aspect of the aboriginal fishing strategy, 
which is what the government is trying to protect.
<P>
	With the recent court decisions that were made this year, the 
government has absolutely no foundation whatsoever to maintain 
an aboriginal fishing strategy and the pilot sales aspect of it in 
British Columbia. However, it appears intent on doing that and it is 
looking to this legislation to lend support to that decision.
<P>
	I see that my time is up. We will be dealing with this matter 
further in debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the other Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the new Speaker of the House for his 
temporary promotion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7201"> 7201 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, like my colleagues, I will be speaking against Bill 
C-62. It is rather strange that we are discussing a fisheries 
management bill at this moment, when it should have been done a 
long time ago. The existing act dates back to 1867, and the Bloc 
Quebecois is certainly not against the idea of modernizing it. What 
we are against is the way it is being done, particularly the excessive 
centralization that is evident in this bill.
<P>
	I will start by saying a few words about the environmental aspect 
of this legislation because I have to admit that, before entering the 
political scene, I was a unionist and I had the opportunity to work 
with several environmental and social groups. It is sad to see that 
100 or maybe 150 years after the adoption of the first act, we are 
facing a situation where our fish stocks are in a deplorable state. I 
think the ocean, particularly on the east coast, has been emptied. 
Even with the various attempts made to modernize the act, we are 
realizing that it is now the ocean on the west coast that is being 
emptied.
<P>
	Therefore, it is important to have massive consultations with as 
many stakeholders as possible-and the provinces play a crucial 
role in this debate-if we are to rectify the situation and to ensure 
the recovery of our fish stocks, which we think are in the process of 
being completely destroyed.
<P>
	Why are we saying there is excessive centralization? The heart 
of the problem can be found in clause 17.
<P>
	It says that Her Majesty, in right of Canada, represented by the 
minister, may enter into a fisheries management agreement with 
any organization that, in the opinion of the minister-and the 
problem lies in these words: ``in the opinion of the Minister''-is 
representative of a class of persons or holders.
<P>
	Therefore the minister, surrounded by an array of officials, is the 
one who will decide, in the east as well as in the west, wherever 
there is jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have been delegated to 
provinces, namely freshwater fisheries. The minister could at any 
time decide to withdraw this delegation. This, as we know, could 
create problems, but the minister holds all the cards. I believe that 
the way the bill is drafted, it sidelines provinces and some 
extremely important groups.
<P>
	As honourable members know, I am the Indian affairs critic for 
my party. I believe there is a major problem with native fisheries 
and this bill does nothing to solve it.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We have just received the report of a royal commission of 
inquiry which lasted five years. Last week, this commission, 
created by the Conservatives, presented a 4,000 page plus report 
and 400 recommendations. Some of those recommendations deal 
with native fisheries. Nowhere in the bill does it say that the 
minister must  consult natives. He will, only if, ``in his opinion'' it 
is justified.
<P>
	The danger lies not only in the centralization but in the 
possibility that the minister could play political games with his 
decisions. Several people have already mentioned this. The 
minister could play political games. I will speak about Restigouche 
later, as an example.
<P>
	First of all, I want to explain how natives negotiate. Negotiations 
are very important to them. In fact, when Europeans got here, 
natives already had their own governments, their own political 
system, their own justice system. Most decisions were reached by 
consensus.
<P>
	Of course, that required much longer discussions. With a 
majority, you tend to say: Look here, we can cut the debate short, 
since the majority will win out in any case. I must say that the 
government realized it could do so a long time ago. We were 
gagged several times. Of course, it is hard to reach a consensus in 
this House. However, the government regularly brings forward 
some motions to gag the opposition. We are far from having 
lengthy discussions to try to improve bills, explain our positions 
and reach some kind of compromise. Unfortunately, the 
government gags the opposition a bit too often. That is not the 
natives' approach. They were always striving for a consensus.
<P>
	We see that, under this bill, not only can provinces be excluded, 
but natives are excluded as well. The minister can set out classes of 
licence holders or fishers on his own initiative. One day, he could 
say that it does not include natives, and the next day, for political 
reasons, he could say that he is including natives and will ensure 
that their rights are upheld, as was done in Restigouche.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this bill does not provide for a negotiation 
process. Once again, a minister, using his authority with his 
officials, may impose a procedure, a way of setting limits and 
issuing permits. The minister is allowed to do anything he wants 
without consulting the provinces and groups concerned.
<P>
	As you can understand, as the opposition critic on Indian affairs, 
after such a meaty report as the one tabled last week, I think the 
minister falls far short of the goal of seeking a consensus, of 
holding extensive discussions, of ensuring the effective 
preservation of our fish stocks. When several parties agree on 
something, it is a lot easier to implement the decision than if the 
minister decided to impose his own vision despite the opposition of 
Quebec or another province or of native people.
<P>
	That is what happened in Restigouche. Everything was 
improvised. The Micmac and other native people in Restigouche 
made a decision to resume subsistence fishing. As you know, the 
Supreme Court of Canada makes a distinction between subsistence 
fishing for aboriginal people and commercial fishing. The issue of 
subsistence fishing is quite clear and precise, and there are specific 
rules 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7202"> 7202 </A></B>
<P>
on that. When preservation is not in  jeopardy, there is no problem 
with giving priority to subsistence fishing by aboriginal people.
<P>
	The problem in Restigouche is precisely that stocks are at risk, 
and there has been a lot of improvising on the part of the 
department. It is trying to impose its way of doing things, probably 
for political reasons. There are disagreements over this. Aboriginal 
people maintain they have the right to fish for subsistence; those 
who already have licences say that stocks are endangered and that 
more fishing licences should not be issued because stocks will be 
depleted.
<P>
	Finally, we realize that the minister missed an opportunity to 
include a mechanism for negotiating. It would have been easy to 
say it must not just be ``in his opinion'', but, rather, that he must 
automatically and officially consult the provinces, interested 
parties-such as the native peoples-and licence holders. It would 
be a way of requiring basic agreement with a majority involved in 
order to have a chance of success.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately this is not the case with the bill before us. The 
minister simply wants to impose his authority on everyone else, 
and this bill allows him to do so.
<P>
	I would therefore like to make a suggestion. Obviously, we 
cannot vote in favour of the bill at second reading. Obviously this 
bill will be sent to a committee. I think the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans should consult his colleague the minister of Indian 
affairs to see if matters can be arranged.
<P>
	I hope our representatives and colleagues on the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans will make this a concern. The 
provinces consider it vital the government provide for consultation 
in its bill. Consultation with the provinces should be almost 
mandatory.
<P>
	When interest groups, including the provinces, are involved, I 
think we might succeed. I hope fish stocks will be restored to the 
level they were 100 years ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I stand to speak on Bill C-62, the new fisheries act.
<P>
	A strange thing is happening in this bill. It contains provisions in 
clauses 17 to 22 designed to abrogate the public right of access to 
the fishery. This seems strange. This right for the public has been 
around since the Magna Carta in 1215. The bill will empower the 
minister, the crown, without notice to the public, to grant the 
private right to fish for commercial or sport purposes to any group 
currently in political favour.
<P>
	This is something that cannot be done legally under the present 
Fisheries Act. The present act is based on the premise that the 
fishery is a public resource to which all  Canadians, not just a select 
few Canadians, are entitled to equal access.
<P>
	I have to wonder if the minister and the members opposite 
understand what equal access means. I look at many decisions the 
government has brought down in the last little while. The 
government claims they are for the benefit of all citizens. As we go 
through these decisions, we see it is very select group who benefits. 
Bill C-62 is one example.
<P>
	Let us take British Columbia as an example. I know firsthand 
what the government decided for the fishing industry there. I know 
the Liberals like to say that they do all this fancy consulting. I 
sometimes wonder if they are talking to their fathers and 
grandparents in order to get an okay on some of these things that 
are passed in the House. Let us take a look at what is happening on 
the Adams River which happens to be in my constituency. It is well 
known around the world for the spawning runs that used to happen 
in the Adams River.
<P>
	The government in its ultimate wisdom-I would say in its 
ultimate stupidity I guess-decided that the best thing it could do 
for the people in B.C. and in the constituency of 
Okanagan-Shuswap was to shut down the fish hatchery. The 
government has proceeded to shut down most of the inland 
hatcheries on the west coast after consultation. I would like to 
know who was consulted. The government never talked with any of 
the mayors or any of the people in my constituency, not one. It just 
decided to shut them down.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The reason? It said that it was not making enough profit there. 
This hatchery has not been open long enough. Anybody with a little 
knowledge of hatcheries knows that it takes approximately nine 
years to see a decent stock return. The government decided that 
four and a half or five years was good enough for the hatcheries on 
the west coast.
<P>
	It makes many people wonder how the Liberals can shut down 
what was a basic part of the food chain. Millions had already been 
spent putting the hatcheries in place. I asked the minister that if the 
department was having trouble with salmon, we could certainly 
turn it into a trout hatchery. Believe it or not, the minister's 
argument was that it might interfere with the wild stock. Does this 
make any sense to anybody?
<P>
	We could tag these fish, send them on their way and then put a 
moratorium for a certain period of time on catching the wild stock 
until they are brought back up to a healthy number for fishing. But 
this seemed to have been lost to the minister. He could not fathom 
this idea. He seemed to be bent-as he still is-on seeing the west 
coast go the same way Newfoundland has gone.
<P>
	Do members in the House understand what has happened in 
Newfoundland through the inaction, the absolute non-action, and 
the silly decisions that have been  made by governments? Do they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7203"> 7203 </A></B>
<P>
realize that now the people are suffering through silly things like 
this?
<P>
	The only thing fishy in Newfoundland is the red book. There is 
absolutely no doubt about it. It reminds me of out west where we 
have a saying that government is a group called politickitis. A tick 
is a little bug that gets on human beings and sucks their blood. It is 
far worse than a mosquito. It can create a great disease.
<P>
	Politickitis is a two-legged bug that sits in government. Nine 
times out of ten it sits on the front benches. It then latches on to the 
taxpayers and sucks the lifeblood right out of them. Unfortunately 
we only have one cure for this disease so far: the ballot. But we are 
only allowed to use that remedy once every four or five years at the 
whim of the insect that is causing the problem. It seems kind of 
strange but that is what we have to put up with here when we get 
bills like this coming before the House.
<P>
	These bills come from a government that has thrown more 
people out of work in this country than any other government in the 
history of Canada. Government members stand here every day and 
basically misrepresent everything they can in regard to all 
opposition parties. They are masters of deceit.
<P>
	If we look at what has happened we will find that we have largest 
bankruptcy rate that has ever happened. They like to talk about the 
G-7 countries. They like to say how well we are doing compared to 
the other G-7 countries. That is the most fishy thing about it all.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals have brought this awful piece of garbage before the 
House. They have told us how well they are doing. We have the 
highest bankruptcy rate of the G-7 countries. We have more 
unemployed and under-employed. We have the best dictatorship 
there is in the free world as we know it today.
<P>
	Clauses 17 through 22 of the bill demonstrate this. They will 
empower a minister of the crown, without public notice, to grant 
private rights to fish. It is totally unacceptable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me, as an MP from Montreal, to 
speak to this bill, the fisheries bill, which is very important for the 
economy.
<P>
	I have always made a point of examining any issue that might 
affect the interests of Quebec. Before getting into the substance of 
this bill, I do not want to miss this opportunity to pay a heartfelt 
tribute to the member for Gaspé. I believe both the government 
side and the Reform Party will agree with me on this.
<P>
	On this issue, it could be said that he was in his own element, as, 
from week to week, his expertise guided the caucus. One must 
admit that the member for Gaspé's approach is more adversarial 
than confrontational.
<P>
	The member for Gaspé did the right thing by warning us against 
what amounts to a subterfuge on the part of the federal government. 
He demonstrated very eloquently that this act had to be updated. 
This act dating back to 1868 has barely been reviewed since its 
enactment. The question of quotas was reviewed, somewhat 
indirectly. In essence, we have before us a totally new bill, if I 
correctly understood the wise explanations of my colleague from 
Gaspé.
<P>
	Despite the fact that such a detailed review was done, the 
government has found a way to disappoint the main partners. That 
is the conclusion that must be drawn. Since you are allowing me to 
address this issue, I would say there is an analogy to be made 
between the fishing industry and the Canadian Confederation. 
What I mean is that any attempt to modernize does not necessarily 
lead to success.
<P>
	In both cases, the member-and his gracious assistant who has 
played a very supportive role at his side-reminds us that, in the 
end, Quebec should have been handed back full jurisdiction over 
fishing matters.
<P>
	That being said, we will not avoid the basic issues. Having 
carefully studied these issues in the last few days, I remind the 
House that we have three objections, which I will reiterate.
<P>
	There are irritants. As members may have noticed, I happen to 
like this word and I will use it in this case. We have three major 
objections to Bill C-62, which the member for Gaspé will allow me 
to reiterate. My colleague, the hon. member for Gaspé, made an 
in-depth review of the bill. Come now, let us have some order in 
this Parliament. I believe the member for Verchères ought to leave 
if I am to have any hope of delivering my speech. I want the House 
to know that I am serious now, I have been all long really.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We oppose the bill because we fear that the minister's approach 
regarding management agreements will preclude any real 
partnership.
<P>
	Also, we have concerns regarding the delegation of powers to the 
provinces, which we find totally and utterly inadequate. If I 
understand the bill correctly, I believe the main concern-as is the 
case with other issues I am involved with-is that the newly 
created fisheries tribunal might become, if I may say so, a 
patronage haven.
<P>
	I would like to get back to this clause. We are bringing the labour 
code up to date. A case in point is what the minister is going to do 
with what his colleague, the labour minister, is proposing. We are 
in the process of reviewing the labour code, which had not been 
brought up to date for the past 30 years. Yours truly has been an 
active contributor to this process.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7204"> 7204 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> I appreciate the enthusiastic show of support from 
the House, where quorum is obviously not an issue.
<P>
	Let me tell you, we certainly contributed to the updating of the 
labour code when we asked the government to use the lists 
submitted by the parties when appointing the members of the 
Canada Labour Relations Board, which is an arbitration forum for 
employers and employees-I see you are in agreement, Mr. 
Speaker, and that is very reassuring.
<P>
	When these tribunals are created, should we not make sure 
beforehand that the members appointed will be people who know 
the fishing industry, a very complex industry after all. That 
industry is at the very basis of the food chain. I believe we should 
never forget that. Our concern is that the creation of those 
tribunals-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> And they should have some managerial 
skills.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Yes. You will understand the passionate outcry of 
the member for Gaspé, who has reminded us that it is important 
that those people have some administrative skills and know the 
fishing industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> They should at least know the fishing 
industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was not always the case. I could 
easily give you some examples of appointments which did not 
serve fisheries well, and I will do so later on.
<P>
	This industry is much too important. It is growing and methods 
are constantly changing, so the people involved must have a solid 
knowledge, they must know the environment, be able to recognize 
an offence when they see one and be able to make judgments on 
stock replacement and all the other characteristics of the fishery.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé): </B>We need real judges, not some pale 
imitation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard: </B>I am getting there. There is a specificity that the 
hon. member for Gaspé has been underlining on several occasions.
<P>
	Once again, I do not know if I said this before, but I think the 
House would agree that, if there is in this House someone who 
spoke with a forceful voice, with good judgment and who has a 
good knowledge of the fishing industry, it is the hon. member for 
Gaspé. I am sure my colleagues will want to share my enthusiasm 
by giving him a resounding hand of applause. He is a real fisher.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard: </B>I come from the city, but since I used to eat fish 
every Friday throughout my childhood, I fully appreciate the 
importance of the fishing industry.
<P>
	What we are asking the government, and we feel this is a 
legitimate request, is that this tribunal be made up of real lawyers, 
members of the legal profession, people who have formal training 
and who know the fisheries sector.
<P>
	We warn the government against any attempt to make partisan 
appointments that would hurt that sector. We would be very 
disappointed if this were the case.
<P>
	I am a bit sad to see that my time is running out, because I could 
have talked about this issue for 20 minutes.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I will conclude by reminding you that Quebec-and I think all of 
us here know that Quebec is a nation-made claims at the 
conference held in Victoria.
<P>
	Let me stress what may be Quebec's primary claim regarding 
fisheries. Quebec wants the federal government to transfer to it all 
the powers relating to stocks fished by its residents, the assessment 
of stocks, the establishment of conservation and management 
policies, the issuing of licences, the allocation of resources to its 
residents, and the control and monitoring of its fisheries.
<P>
	This is a major issue that each of us, members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, will emphasize. I will be very pleased to answer any 
questions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is the second time that I have spoken on Bill C-62.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not allowed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> But this is an amendment so it is quite in order.
<P>
	I would like to reiterate that this bill is still dressed up as 
modernization. This bill gives the minister and thus the senior 
bureaucracy all the power they could ever possibly want to reward 
their friends and consolidate their strength and powers. This is 
known on the west coast for certain and in other jurisdictions as the 
most top heavy and arrogant bureaucracy in the federal 
government. It is amazing to me to see how the consolidation of 
powers in this bill can be characterized as modernization.
<P>
	There is a major collision of events happening right now on the 
west coast. There is a federal-provincial set of negotiations going 
on in an attempt to translate some of the current jurisdictions of the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans into a provincial mandate. We 
have a federal-provincial fisheries impact review board that is 
probably reporting today as we speak. We have the results from a 
very precedent setting federal court case in Vancouver that is very 
interesting. I would like to speak a little about that in a few 
minutes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7205"> 7205 </A></B>
<P>
	The halibut advisory committee process that dealt with halibut 
licensing on the B.C. coast several years ago was under scrutiny. 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans personnel came out looking 
very bad indeed. They confirmed what many in the industry, many 
people familiar with the actions of the senior bureaucracy have 
believed for some time and now we have it in black and white.
<P>
	At a time when all these events are happening we have the 
implementation of what is known as the Mifflin plan on the west 
coast. This has been a major disaster for outlying communities in 
British Columbia in the way it was implemented and the buy back 
scheme that was put in place. There is a growing perception that we 
have an out of control, uncaring bureaucracy and department really 
doing a disservice to the west coast.
<P>
	We already know what management has led to on the east coast. 
With that example as a precedent, the people in British Columbia 
want to avoid that at all costs. It is a very important industry, 
recreational, commercial and sport fishing.
<P>
	I would like to state very clearly for the record that there is 
nothing in this new fisheries act that the minister and the 
department cannot do under the existing act except extinguish the 
public right to fish. The central and deplorable change with respect 
to fisheries management is that the minister gains new unfettered 
powers to do what currently requires the specific authorization of 
Parliament or cabinet. For a minister and department that have 
singlehandedly mismanaged this resource so completely to be 
handed even more absolute power would be a derogation of the 
trust placed in us as Parliamentarians.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	It is further testimony to the government's inability to manage 
and allocate a resource and to honour its historic common law 
regarding the public right to fish.
<P>
	It replaces the public right to fish with private fishing 
agreements or what the bill calls partnership agreements. These 
fishing agreements would be similar to the aboriginal fishing 
agreements the government currently enters into with native bands. 
The native only commercial fishery was recently undermined by 
the supreme court's decision on Van der Peet in 1996, NTC 
Smokehouse in 1996 and the Gladstone decision in 1996.
<P>
	The court ruled specifically against an aboriginal commercial 
right to fish, saying they had no right to an exclusive fishery: ``B.C. 
natives do not have a constitutional right to catch and sell fish 
commercially''. Here we go again, more appealed decisions 
leading to supreme court rulings in order to bring the bureaucrats 
and their captive minister to their senses.
<P>
	Bill C-62 does not address the real problems in the fishery, for 
example declining stocks, problems with Alaskan interceptions and 
the need for strict enforcement for conservation measures.
<P>
	There is a growing awareness in the public that the present 
fisheries act does not give the minister the authority to enter into 
exclusive fishing arrangements. There are some simple solutions to 
the problem. Clear criteria ought to be established for the transfer 
of fisheries management to the provinces should the provinces 
want that authority. Fish do tend not to notice political boundaries.
<P>
	I would like to mention some specifics about a very important 
case that really has not received much attention. On November 14 
in Vancouver Judge Campbell finally came down with a decision. 
The plaintiffs in this case were halibut fishermen who felt they had 
been aggrieved by the process and that the minister had exceeded 
his authority in respect to the way in which halibut licences were 
reallocated from what is called a shotgun fishery, where all licence 
holders know the season and everyone goes out to catch what they 
can in the allotted time. It was changed from a shotgun fishery to an 
individual transferable quota. In the process of consultation leading 
up to the issuance of these individual transferable quotas there were 
a lot of things which came to light in the court case.
<P>
	The plaintiffs are really saying that this was a rigged exercise, 
that the department had a predetermined agenda and that there were 
going to be winners and losers and that the personnel in DFO in 
charge of this exercise were totally uncaring as to who were the 
winners and who were the losers. It actually utilized this process to 
predetermine to some degree who the losers would be, but it would 
all be done under the guise of consultation and it would all be 
orchestrated in such a way that this initiative would look like it 
came from the halibut fishermen when in actual fact it was an 
initiative of personnel in the senior bureaucracy. This is a very 
interesting document. It is only about 50 pages long.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Some of the things that are in it are indeed things of which I do 
not think any federal department could possibly be proud. It is my 
estimate that the taxpayers of Canada will be responsible for, if not 
hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars in damages to these 
aggrieved licence holders that were shut out.
<P>
	I will quote a few things from page 37 of the document. For 
example, the judge finds that the implementation of this process 
was an authorized decision of the administration of the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans. Then on page 39 the same judge 
determines that he will consider the decision to be that of the 
minister. Then on page 43 he concludes that the plaintiffs were 
entitled to procedural fairness and on the following page 
determines-

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the hon. member's time 
has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve felt he had to justify himself because 
he was born and raised in the city. I could say the same thing since I 
am from Lévis, but in Lévis, there are also eels. But this is not what 
I want to talk about.
<P>
	For four years, between 1980 and 1984, I was political assistant 
to the best minister of Fisheries that Quebec ever had and I 
remember very well how hard we had to fight to have our 
autonomy respected.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Do not name him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> I will not. The hon. member asked me not to give his 
name, but everybody knows who I am talking about. He is a man 
with an imposing presence to whom everybody pays attention 
when he enters a room-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> And also because he needs two seats when he sits 
down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a more serious note, I want to say 
we, in the official opposition, are against Bill C-62 which is being 
debated on second reading. With unanimous consent, I could 
perhaps be granted a brief extension of my time. I would like a few 
minutes more, because I see my time is almost up. But I will ask for 
the unanimous consent when my time is over.
<P>
	This bill is ill-conceived and full of holes. We cannot imagine 
how this bill could have be so poorly put together. The hon. 
member for Gaspé, who did some splendid work, said and I agree: 
``There is something fishy here''. We must scrutinize this 
thoroughly.
<P>
	As for the tribunals, they open up a terrible possibility. We are 
going to let a select club establish the fishing rules in consultation 
with the minister in Ottawa. The minister wants to decide with his 
officials what will happen in this sector. This always surprised me. 
They want to decide from Ottawa while the fish is in the ocean. It is 
very difficult to bring an official from Ottawa to the fisheries.
<P>
	The way these bureaucrats see things, they would like the fish to 
come to Ottawa so they can examine them. We are not fish. We will 
not let them act like this. We will not let the government do this 
without us saying a word. With its majority it will probably end up 
passing this bill, but we are against it.
<P>
	The role of the provinces in the fisheries is not recognized 
enough. Also, there is not enough consideration given to those who 
make a living from this resource. They are not given the authority 
to develop rules and better ways of controlling the resource. The 
people, fishers are not being consulted enough.
<P>
	I would have a thousand other things to say but I will leave it at 
that. I wanted to add my voice today to those of the hon. members 
for Gaspé and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	They may not have fish in Montreal, but they do eat fish. These 
consumers are important. Because of that, someone such as the 
hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has a right to speak up, 
and he did so very well. I hope others will not follow the example 
of members opposite who remain silent.
<P>
	They are invisible. We cannot mention their absence in this 
House, but we can talk about their invisibility. I just wanted to 
point it out.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business as 
listed on today's Order Paper.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COMPETITIONACT">COMPETITION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 22 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-266, an act to amend the Competition Act 
(protection of whistle blowers), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the pleasure to speak to Bill C-266. There are four points on 
which I wish to expand. To get a bit of meat on those bones, once I 
am finished, I would suggest that people read the previous debate 
of October 22 when the hon. member for Nickel Belt outlined very 
substantially the objectives of this bill.
<P>
	The bill is designed to enhance the provisions of the Competition 
Act. It will do so by allowing an employee to make an anonymous 
report of an employer's offence under the Competition Act to the 
Restrictive Trade Practices Commission without threat of 
dismissal, suspension, demotion, discipline, the loss of benefits or 
privileges of employment, termination, harassment, coercion or 
any other action which would otherwise disadvantage the 
employee.
<P>
	A second part would protect the employee from retaliatory 
action by the employer if the employee refuses to take action for an 
employer that constitutes an offence under the Competition Act.
<P>
	I would suggest that the act has directed its focus on the 
protection of the employee and the employee's job.
<P>
	The hon. member for Longueuil said on October 22 that there 
will be or could be situations in which a person may want to 
maliciously damage the reputation of the employer. That has to be 
addressed a little more closely in this bill. I understand the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7207"> 7207 </A></B>
<P>
reasoning for the protection  of the employee. I also would like to 
see a little more focus on the employer's position as well.
<P>
	One of the main reasons that makes me think along this line is 
that in the justice system we have all witnessed situations in which 
a person or a company has been wrongly accused. By the time they 
go through the process of establishing their innocence, their 
reputation is damaged. We are talking about business here and it 
could have an effect on that.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Another provision is that the employer be liable for a fine of up 
to $100,000 or two years imprisonment if found guilty of 
retaliating action against an employee under the aforementioned 
circumstances.
<P>
	I would suggest two things, one of which is the concept that a 
fine or prison internment be also applied to the other side of the 
equation: if an employee maliciously and knowingly attempts to 
harm the employer through this process.
<P>
	I would also like to refer to a comment made by the member for 
Fraser Valley West in the October 22 debate. He felt that in his 
wisdom and with his resources the $100,000 fine and the two years 
imprisonment was a little steep. In a comparative analysis, the first 
thing that would come to my mind would be the punishment for 
drunk driving which is meted out in certain cases where it would be 
less than two years for someone who drives drunk and kills 
somebody and less than $100,000 in fines. That should be looked 
at.
<P>
	My fourth point concerns the confidentiality of the employee, 
except in cases where upon inquiry the commission finds that the 
employee knowingly accused the employer falsely. I have already 
made reference to that. It is a good thing because if somebody is 
going to falsely accuse someone, then it should be brought to 
everyone's attention that they did try to do something maliciously.
<P>
	I would also like some thought to be given to the employer's 
position on confidentiality. I would think it would be prudent to put 
the employer in the position of confidentiality until there is some 
substantiation that there is a valid charge.
<P>
	Some other observations of this bill are on a more positive line. 
Unlike previous bills which have sought measures that would 
prevent the unfair gasoline pricing at the pumps, which is what this 
bill is targeting as the example, this bill works within the 
Competition Act. It is not going to overtly increase the cost of the 
bureaucracy. Also, it does not appear to be imposing unnecessary 
regulations upon the marketplace. Those are two promising aspects 
of it.
<P>
	It will also enhance the commission's ability to conduct 
investigations by allowing the commission to act upon confidential 
information. Currently, six sponsors of a  complaint are needed 
before the commission can pick it up. This will allow people to 
feed that information into the commission. We could probably 
expand on this by saying that this may be a situation where a stitch 
in time will save nine by getting on top of the situation earlier.
<P>
	The Reform Party sees a lot of positive aspects to this but we 
also see some negative aspects which I have mentioned. It is 
positive in the promotion of competition and competitive pricing. 
It also strengthens and vigorously reinforces the competition and 
anti-combines legislation. It does indeed provide penalties for 
collusion of price fixing.
<P>
	As I said, we are quite positive on this but we do have some 
reservations from the employer's position in relation to 
confidentiality until it is substantiated and to the amounts of the 
fines and charges. I would suggest that penalties be applied to the 
employee if they falsify their statement to the commission.
<P>
	I will conclude because otherwise I would be reiterating an 
excellent debate that occurred on October 22.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being approximately 1.40 p.m., the 
House stands adjourned until Monday at 11 a.m.
