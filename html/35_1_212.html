	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to 
table, in both official languages, the government's response to 
15 petitions.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, six years ago the world watched in 
horror as the tragic events of Tiananmen square unfolded. For 
many Canadians these events changed our lives forever. They 
propelled us into action. We rallied, we spoke out and we made 
the difference.
<P>
	To commemorate those who lost their lives in Tiananmen 
square, on May 28 I participated in a democracy walk at the 
University of British Columbia. I paid tribute again on June 4 at 
Forest Lawn cemetery in Burnaby, British Columbia. At both 
locations there is a statue of democracy erected by Canadians to 
remind us about the tragedy.
<P>
	My decision to run for political office was in large part due to 
the events of June 1989, for as I watched Chinese men and 
women risk their lives for something we all too often take for 
granted here in Canada, I realized that I needed to give back 
something to the country that welcomed me with such open arms 
in 1969.
<P>
	I am proud to say I am still fighting for human rights 
improvements, both in China and around the world. 
Unfortunately the human rights situation with regard to human 
rights advocates in China has not improved significantly since 
1989. The recent arrest of several Chinese dissidents in the run 
up to the sixth anniversary of the Tiananmen square crackdown 
and the strict surveillance imposed on others once again 
demonstrates that China continues to violate international 
standards of human rights.
<P>
	One of the most enduring values uniting Canadians is our 
common commitment to freedom, democracy and human rights. 
Respect for human rights is a key to international peace and 
prosperity and it contributes to a global environment within 
which we Canadians can best pursue our interests.
<P>
	As I have long believed, the issue is how to promote most 
efficiently good governance and the rule of law in China.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	There are a number of ways to help influence and encourage 
China to better respect human rights. Multilaterally we take 
steps in organizations such as the United Nations to make our 
point. Bilaterally we discuss human rights issues with our 
Chinese counterparts. Development assistance lets us work with 
China to strengthen areas vital to human rights development. 
Trade is also a powerful tool. It encourages co-operation, and 
co-operation leads to understanding and appreciation, with 
which we can better manage concerns such as human rights 
development.
<P>
	Furthermore, initiatives undertaken by people like ourselves 
continue to emphasize to all concerned that Canadians care 
about human rights. Rest assured that I will continue to work for 
the improvement of respect for human rights and democracy in 
China.
<P>
	As I tell both my cabinet colleagues and my Chinese 
counterparts, I am a friend of China. I will continue to speak out 
against human rights violations in China, but at the same time I 
will continue to work within my means as a federal minister to 
help China develop in a meaningful way.
<P>
	Pointing out violations of human rights is essential. So too is 
dialogue between Canada and China. Dialogue lets China and 
Canada share concerns and provides the foundation to address 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13286"> 13286 </A></B>
<P>
important issues such as human rights proactively. This is the 
effective way to promote  change in China and this is the cause 
my government and I will continue to follow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise today on behalf of the official opposition 
to mark the sixth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre 
in which thousands of people, most of them students, died for 
democracy and the advancement of human rights in China.
<P>
	On June 9, 1994, the Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific stated 
in this House, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Surely there is evidence that increased political flexibility is a byproduct of 
economic liberalization, and governments that have opened their markets to 
international trade are more sensitive to the views and reactions of other 
countries.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The federal government's policy of giving priority to the 
economic aspect in its relations with China, in the belief that 
China would then become more sensitive to Canadian human 
rights concerns, has been a monumental failure.
<P>
	Even as China is seeking full membership in the World Trade 
Organization and after Team Canada paid that country a visit 
last November, we learned last December that nine Chinese 
dissidents had received sentences ranging from three to twenty 
years in prison.
<P>
	According to Chinese authorities, the only crimes committed 
by these people were membership in unauthorized political 
organizations and planning the distribution of leaflets marking 
the third anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
<P>
	By coincidence, at least 12 other Chinese dissidents were 
recently arrested in the run-up to the sixth anniversary of the 
bloody crackdown on the Beijing Spring in Tiananmen Square, 
which, as you may recall, left hundreds if not thousands of 
people dead. Yet, as the hon. Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific 
so eloquently said earlier, China continues to openly violate 
international standards of human rights.
<P>
	The secretary of state even told us that the situation of 
Chinese human rights advocates has not improved since 1989. 
Despite government claims that trade liberalization is the best 
way to promote respect for human rights, we must recognize that 
the secretary of state's admission points to the failure of the 
government policy in this regard.
<P>
	If-as the federal government maintains-its policy is 
credible, why were there no improvements in the human rights 
situation in China? As the secretary of state mentioned, if trade 
is a powerful tool that leads to co-operation and, in turn, to an 
improvement of the human rights situation, why have the 
Chinese authorities remained so inflexible?
<P>
	Furthermore, how can the Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific 
claim that Canada influenced the course of events following the 
tragic events in Tiananmen Square?
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	How could we have any influence on events when, during his 
trip to China, the Prime Minister of Canada himself turned a 
blind eye to what the Chinese leaders are doing?
<P>
	It is not by whispering quietly in his Chinese counterpart's ear 
that the Prime Minister of Canada, or Canada for that matter, 
will prompt the Chinese leadership to change its unacceptable 
attitude toward human rights. As we can see, this new policy did 
not produce the expected results; it was, to say the least, 
ineffective.
<P>
	However, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs said recently, 
instead of opening its eyes and taking direct, consistent and firm 
action against countries that violate human rights, the federal 
government would rather pay court to them in order to establish 
trade relations with them.
<P>
	Expressing discontent with the laissez-faire attitude of 
Canada with respect to human rights, the minister announced a 
while ago the Canadian government's intention to embark upon 
a series of trade initiatives with a number of countries, 
regardless of their human rights record.
<P>
	This is a fine example of double talk on the part of the 
government. To add insult to injury, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs went as far as to propose to ASEAN nations, some of 
which have a long tradition of openly violating human rights, 
that Canada represent their interests at the G-7 Summit in 
Halifax, next week.
<P>
	In closing, I hope-but I am not holding my breath-that the 
government will not go on addressing human rights issues 
behind the scenes, as in so doing, it is playing into the hands of 
the dictators and tyrants of this world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to the message of the secretary of state on 
China and Tiananmen square.
<P>
	Certainly all of us have the memories imprinted on our minds 
of the horror and the terror and disbelief of what happened some 
six years ago. We need to think about what we have in Canada, 
freedom of speech, freedom of association and all of the good 
things that are part of our democracy and what it really means 
when we think back to those days.
<P>
	Those people did not die in vain and China is moving forward 
as slow as it may be. China has a very major future in the world. 
It is a time to think of China and look at what that country means 
in the big picture of the world. I remember my visits in the late 
1970s and in the early 1980s. I think about a country that was 
very agrarian, backward to our western way of looking at things.
<P>
	I think of all the people in their blue and green clothes, the 
thousands and thousands of bicycles. I think of going to the 
movie theatre where I spent six cents to get in and where in the 
middle, because there was a Canadian there, they played ``Red 
River Valley''. Somehow they thought that was the national 
anthem of the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13287"> 13287 </A></B>
<P>
	I remember the curious way people dealt with us as westerners 
but how friendly they were and how important their family and 
social structure was to them. I think back to being in the schools 
where education is such an important part of their society, where 
they go for six days a week, where they start at eight in the 
morning and finish at six at night and how they do not have text 
books so they have to read it on the blackboards outside the 
school. The people are very industrious, hard working. 
Commerce is important and there is a hidden power, a so-called 
sleeping giant in China.
<P>
	China has changed a lot in the last 10 or 15 years. It now has 
double digit growth rates, unemployment, a massive movement 
from rural to urban, a dismantling of the state owned business, 
an aging leader who sort of keeps it together, but it will change 
dramatically.
<P>
	For those of us who have been watching closely I do not think 
we can believe the speed at which this change will occur. There 
is a new era for China coming. It is hoped there will be a 
peaceful change to democracy from the chaos that might 
otherwise occupy that country.
<P>
	The government still operates in the old way but I believe the 
new government will look toward the true power of China and so 
will come democracy in the 21st century. There is a great 
opportunity for China and for us in dealing with China.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	The Chinese government must control corruption. It must 
solidify economic reform and it must carry out democratization 
not just from the communes but on through the villages, the 
towns, the cities and ultimately in the national government.
<P>
	With all of this I believe firmly that human rights will come 
and that human rights reform will be part of that movement. I do 
not believe there is any way the Government of China will be 
able to stop that.
<P>
	What is our role? Our role is to speak out against violations. 
This gives the people both in and out of China an opportunity to 
feel strength from our opposition. We need to provide assistance 
in developing governments and so on. Above all, the isolation of 
China will not accomplish the goals we all hold for China in the 
future.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP)</B> 
moved for leave to introduce Bill C-330, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (review process and disclosure by prosecutor).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to introduce this 
private member's bill for first reading. In essence it introduces 
or enacts the recommendations of the Donald Marshall inquiry, 
now some years in passing, for a better, more open and 
independent procedure for dealing with those who claim to have 
been wrongfully convicted.
<P>
	At the moment that process is done in house by the 
Department of Justice. It is a very time consuming process. It 
seems there is no sense of urgency. There is no easy disclosure to 
those involved. Those who are claiming to be wrongfully 
convicted are pleading to their adversary for some mercy 
essentially.
<P>
	We have had the cases of Milgaard, Marshall, Morin, Kelly 
and Morrisroe. Many cases have been taking two, three and four 
years to address. This bill would speed that process up and make 
it more open. It would be a distinct improvement in the process.

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Minister of Finance)</B> 
moved that Bill C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of 
the budget tabled in Parliament on February 27, 1995, be read 
the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
lead off debate on third reading of Bill C-76, an act to 
implement certain provisions of the February 1995 budget.
<P>
	The bill seeks to give concrete reality to the non-taxation 
measures announced in the budget, a budget of reform and 
renewal that has been described as historic.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This means that, over the next three fiscal years, this budget 
will translate into cumulative savings of $29 billion, $25.3 
billion of which will be the result of spending cuts. This is by far 
the most ambitious series of measures proposed in a budget 
since demobilization, after the Second World War.
<P>
	The objectives set are extremely important, but so are the 
means used to achieve them. Indeed, in order to achieve lasting 
fiscal consolidation and then fiscal balance, it is essential to 
change the role and the very structure of the state. We will 
continue to reap the benefits of this budget in 1997-98 and 
beyond.
<P>
	These measures will have a very significant impact on future 
levels of federal spending. By 1997-98, program spending will 
total $108 billion, compared to $120 billion in 1993-94.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Although it was a tough budget, Canadians approve it. They 
approve it because they know we have to stop writing IOUs and 
get on with the business of building the 21st century economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By 1996-97, our financial needs, that is the new money which 
we have to borrow on financial markets, will go down to $13.7 
billion, or 1.7 per cent of the GDP. Canada will fare better than 
any other G7 country.
<P>
	The public debt will stop growing faster than the economy. 
The debt to GDP ratio will start decreasing. This is the key to a 
manageable financial situation, and it is the reason why we are 
not merely trying to reduce the deficit. Indeed, we are also 
determined to start the Canadian debt ratio on a downward trend.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me emphasize that these projections do not rest on rosy 
assumptions. On the contrary, prudent assumptions that were 
more pessimistic than the private sector average were used. The 
assumptions were backed up with substantial contingency 
reserves. We will continue to rely on prudent assumption. We 
will continue to set short term targets that make impossible to 
postpone action. We will continue to take whatever action is 
needed to meet our objectives. This is the course we will stay 
until the deficit is eliminated entirely.
<P>
	Let me turn now from the budget background to the specific 
elements of the bill before us today. As the provisions of the bill 
have already been discussed at some length in the House, I will 
focus on a few highlights and draw the attention of members to 
the one amendment that is more than a technical amendment.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am referring to the transfers to the provinces. We will never 
have the kind of structural changes needed if we do not reform 
our system of transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	We must implement a system which will better meet today's 
needs, and we must also be able to fund that system over a long 
period.
<P>
	As regards the first requirement, we feel that the conditions 
set by the federal government for transfer payments in sectors 
which clearly come under provincial jurisdiction should be 
reduced to a minimum.
<P>
	Currently, the Canada assistance plan transfers come with 
many needless conditions that restrict the provinces' capacity 
for innovation and increase administrative costs. In short, the 
costsharing method no longer helps the provinces which are 
clearly responsible for designing and delivering social 
assistance programs and for implementing them as efficiently as 
possible, in accordance with the needs in the community.
<P>
	This bill will deal with the situation by providing funding for 
the Canada assistance plan in the same way as the established 
programs financing did in the areas of health and 
post-secondary education. As a result, the current breakdown 
into three 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13290"> 13290 </A></B>
<P>
transfers no longer has any basic justification. That is why we 
are combining them  into one single block transfer program 
called the Canada health and social transfer, starting in 
1996-97.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer represents a new, more 
flexible and mature approach to federal-provincial fiscal 
relations but the physical situation demands that the new system 
also be less costly than the current one. That is why when the 
CHST is fully implemented in 1997-98 the total of all major 
transfers to the provinces will be down by about $4.5 billion 
from what would have been transferred under the present 
system. However to put this into perspective, the reduction will 
equal about 3 per cent of aggregate provincial revenues.
<P>
	We believe our approach to provincial transfers passes three 
very important tests. First, the federal government has hit itself 
even harder. Second, the provinces have been given ample 
notice of the government's intentions. Third, the reduction in 
transfer payments is equitable across provinces.
<P>
	In addition to the introduction of the Canada health and social 
transfer, the bill also includes other measures that will help to 
reduce the cost of payments to provinces. One of these measures 
is the reintroduction of a 5 per cent eligibility threshold to the 
fiscal stabilization program. This will restore the program to its 
original function of compensating provinces for revenue losses 
in the event of severe economic downturns, that is, where 
revenues decline by more than 5 per cent.
<P>
	I want to turn now to a number of allegations about the CHST 
which members of the official opposition and the Reform Party 
have made in the debate on Bill C-76. Some opposition 
members have been confused about the additional flexibility 
which the CHST will offer provinces in the area of social 
assistance.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for the riding of Quebec alleged that the 
government was misinforming Quebecers when it said that 
federal conditions on social assistance transfers were being 
reduced. Let us be clear on what is happening here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill is a major reform of the system of federal transfers to 
the provinces and territories that will lead to the Canada health 
and social transfer, the CHST.
<P>
	Starting in 1996-97, the EPF and the CAP will be replaced 
with one single mechanism, the CHST. Contrary to the existing 
system which is based in part on costsharing agreements, the 
CHST will be a block funding mechanism, like the EPF. 
Accordingly, transfers will not be determined by the provinces' 
spending decisions as they are under the cost shared programs.
<P>
	The new arrangement will eliminate inherent limitations of 
the former cost shared programs and reduce longstanding 
irritants.
<P>
	Provinces will no longer be governed by rules determining 
which expenditures are eligible for cost sharing and which are 
not. They will be free to find innovative approaches thanks to 
social security reform. Administrative costs of cost sharing will 
be eliminated. Federal spending will no longer depend on the 
provinces' decisions concerning delivery of their welfare and 
social services programs and the identity of recipients.
<P>
	The Canada health and social transfer is a new vision of 
federal-provincial fiscal relations which gives more flexibility 
and freedom to the provinces while increasing their 
accountability, and provides more stable fiscal arrangements to 
the federal government.
<P>
	This approach will bring about more mature fiscal relations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary North has been giving us 
contrary advice on how we should deal with transfers to the 
provinces. First she says there has been no consultation with 
provincial governments about the future of federal transfers and 
that the federal government has been too hasty in setting out 
important parameters for the health care system which will 
affect Canadians for years to come. However, in the next breath 
she attacked the government for precisely the opposite error. 
She asked how provinces in the health care sector are supposed 
to plan if the federal government will not tell them how federal 
transfers will be structured in the future and how much the 
provinces can expect to receive. The hon. member cannot have it 
both ways.
<P>
	The government has taken a very sensible approach in dealing 
with the provinces. In the 1994 budget the government gave the 
provinces a two-year breathing space prior to making any cuts 
in transfers. In the 1995 budget, transfer restraint does not take 
effect until 1996-97, even though action is being taken in the 
federal backyard in 1995-96. The provinces have been given 
two years to manage the reductions and adjust their programs. 
At the same time the CHST provides more flexibility for 
provinces to make the necessary adjustments.
<P>
	In addition, the government will soon begin consulting with 
the provinces and the territories to develop a permanent method 
of allocating the Canadian health and social transfer among the 
provinces from 1997-98 onward.
<P>
	The federal government remains committed to a co-operative 
and productive approach to federal-provincial relations.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Third, under clause 13 on the new CHST, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development shall invite all provincial 
governments to work together to develop, through mutual 
consent, a set of shared principles and objectives that could 
underlie the new Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	The official opposition is trying to depict this quest for shared 
principles and goals as an artificial issue.
<P>
	Its members would like the House and Canadians to believe 
that this whole process is nothing but a plot to underhandedly 
impose new conditions, methods or penalties. This is what I 
have to say about such comments.
<P>
	``Mutual consent'' means that no government in Canada can 
be subjected to new principles and objectives against its will.
<P>
	In other words, only the governments that freely agree to new 
objectives and principles will be bound by them.
<P>
	Governments that do not agree would not be bound by those 
objectives and principles.
<P>
	So, if some provinces, including Quebec, do not agree, they 
will not be bound by the objectives and principles approved by 
other governments. Things cannot be made any clearer.
<P>
	Indeed, this is usually what ``mutual consent'' means, an 
agreement made by consenting parties. The wording of the 
legislation is quite clear on this issue. I do not see the need to be 
more explicit than that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Fourth, the Reform Party has proposed eliminating cabinet's 
role in enforcing the Canada Health Act as well as considerably 
reducing the role of the Minister of Health. Instead it would turn 
over this job to the federal court.
<P>
	Hon. members should recall that Bill C-76 makes no 
substantive amendments to the Canada Health Act, only 
consequential amendments required by the ending of the 
established programs funding and introduction of the CHST. 
The five Canada Health Act criteria whose enforcement will be 
affected by these motions relate to universality, 
comprehensiveness, accessibility, portability and public 
administration.
<P>
	The current procedure for applying penalties to a province is 
as follows. The Minister of Health initiates the process by 
consulting the province. If the province has not given a 
satisfactory undertaking to the minister to remedy the default 
within a reasonable time, she refers the issue to the governor in 
council. The governor in council decides whether penalties are 
appropriate, how much they should be and whether they should 
be reimposed.
<P>
	Under the Reform proposal, the minister would instead apply 
to the federal court. The federal court would decide whether 
penalties were appropriate, how much they should be and 
whether they should be reimbursed.
<P>
	This government strongly supports the Canada Health Act, as 
does an overwhelming majority of Canadians all across this 
country. The member for Winnipeg North is here. He has spent 
his whole life advocating and supporting the Canada health 
system. I am sure he would agree with the view of the 
government and my own view that if we should turn the 
decisions on enforcement over to the courts, we would pull away 
one of the most fundamental principles behind the act, which is 
that we as politicians and as a government must take 
responsibility for the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	It is the cornerstone of this government. We will not accept 
any amendments that weaken the ability of the federal 
government to enforce the delivery of a system that Canadians 
find is one of the most attractive features of living in this 
country.
<P>
	The provisions of the Canada Health Act which the Reform 
Party object to have served Canadians well since that act was 
passed over a decade ago. Reformers are seeking to water down 
the enforcement of national medicare standards, but we will not 
waver from our commitment. The Reform amendments would 
have the courts decide how the Canada Health Act is to be 
applied. Canadians have elected us as parliamentarians to do 
this job. We do not intend to shirk that responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Fifth, some opposition members seem to suggest that all our 
problems would disappear if only the federal government would 
abandon health care and other social programs and give the 
provincial governments more transfers of tax points.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian government has no intention of giving up its 
responsibilities in terms of funding major social programs. The 
Canada social transfer will help to subsidize the programs which 
are essential to all Canadians, including Quebecers, and its 
contribution will reach almost $27 billion by 1996-1997.
<P>
	Canadians all know how important these programs are, and to 
suggest that the federal government should withdraw from them 
is preposterous, as preposterous as the suggestion that Ottawa 
should replace these transfers by giving up tax points. The 
Canadian government needs all of these tax points to fulfil its 
obligations towards all Canadians, including Quebecers. 
Everyone knows that, because they mean more for the have 
provinces than for the have not provinces, tax points put the 
underprivileged provinces at a disadvantage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13292"> 13292 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another issue raised in the bill and in further debate has been 
subsidies to business. In the course of program review, 
departments across the government took action to reduce 
business subsidies. Overall we are proposing to cut business 
subsidies by 60 per cent. This includes agriculture and 
transportation subsidies that were designed decades ago.
<P>
	The bill proposes to repeal the Western Grain Transportation 
Act and to terminate the western grain transportation subsidy 
paid to railways effective July 31, 1995. The reform of the 
WGTA will result in savings of $2.6 billion over the next five 
years.
<P>
	This is much more than a deficit issue. The elimination of the 
subsidy will encourage the development of value added 
processing and the production of higher value crops. It will 
result in a more efficient grain handling and transportation 
system. It will help maintain our market access for grain sales in 
foreign countries and comply with our obligations under the 
agreement establishing the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	A number of further initiatives will facilitate the transfer to 
the new system. These include a payment of $1.6 billion to 
owners of prairie farmland plus a $300 million transportation 
adjustment fund. The bill also provides for the regulation of 
maximum freight rates that can be charged by railway 
companies to move grain from the prairies.
<P>
	There is an amendment to the bill on the matter of freight rates 
that I would like to point out to the House. Clause 21 of the bill 
has been amended to strengthen the provisions governing the 
review of the maximum regulated freight rates. Instead of an 
automatic sunsetting provision for maximum rates, the Minister 
of Transport will be given the authority to determine whether the 
rates should be fully deregulated during a review in 1999. These 
amendments are designed to provide greater rate protection to 
shippers. Should the benefit of full rate deregulation become 
apparent during the period leading up to the review, the Minister 
of Transport will have the authority to remove the maximum 
regulated rate protection.
<P>
	The bill also proposes the elimination of the Atlantic freight 
subsidies under the Atlantic Region Freight Assistance Act, the 
ARFAA, and the Maritime Freight Rates Act, the MFRA. These 
subsidies which have proven inefficient in reducing shipper 
costs are of marginal and declining importance to regional 
economic activity. This measure to take effect this July will save 
nearly $100 million a year. To help ensure that the elimination of 
the subsidy contributes to a better transportation system, the 
budget announced a five-year $326 million transportation 
adjustment program.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I would like to respond to some of the specific criticisms 
made about the Western Grain Transition Payments Act. First, 
the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, the critic for the 
official opposition, during his speech on May 31 stated that the 
transition payment of $2.2 billion is tax free. The payment being 
made by the government to owners of prairie farm land is $1.6 
billion and is taxable. The payment is neither $2.2 billion nor is 
it tax free.
<P>
	The hon. member has also suggested that transition payments 
will be made to beef and hog producers in western Canada. The 
payments are being made to owners of land which in 1994 
produced grain or land which was in summer fallow in 1994 and 
which in 1993 grew grain. Payments will not be made to western 
beef and hog producers.
<P>
	I know the hon. member has a long history of being interested 
in grain transportation. In committee he gave a very eloquent 
defence of his position. He told me he had worked on the issue 
many, many years ago. I very much appreciated his comments 
and I simply wanted to put on the record some of the 
perspectives of the government on the issue.
<P>
	On behalf of the NDP, the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake stated that with the repeal of the 
WGTA, elevator points would lose $1 million annually in 
income. The repeal of the WGTA will result in increased 
transportation costs to producers. This will encourage producers 
to move from being oriented on exporting grain to increasing 
local consumption of grain to increase diversification in the 
economy on the prairies.
<P>
	This diversification will in turn create more jobs on the 
prairies. For example, the construction of a new canola crushing 
plant in Moose Jaw was recently announced. This plant will help 
diversify the local economy by producing value added 
processed products.
<P>
	The same member has suggested that we as members of 
Parliament need a chance to study the effects of the removal of 
the WGTA. Ever since the WGTA was enacted in 1984 it has 
been the subject of studies and ongoing reviews. There were 
numerous studies conducted before the WGTA was passed. As 
well, there have been an extensive number of studies on the 
WGTA reform conducted by industry, academics, various 
consultants, as well as by the federal and provincial 
governments over the past decade.
<P>
	This is not the time to study nor to continue delay. Now is the 
time to act. I am sure the member from the New Democratic 
Party understands how dramatic these changes will be on the 
prairies. We are all looking forward to a responsible, 
co-operative attitude among the producers, shippers, rail 
companies and provincial and federal governments to make sure 
this works. It is no longer the time to study.
<P>
	There are also a number of amendments in the bill on the 
public service. The measures I have outlined so far, along with 
other initiatives arising from the program review, mark the 
transition to a more focused, effective and frugal federal 
government. Reducing the public service was not an objective of 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13293"> 13293 </A></B>
<P>
program review. Such a reshaping of the government's role and 
the spending cuts it entails will unfortunately have an effect on 
the employees delivering services to Canadians on behalf of the 
federal government.
<P>
	By the time the 1995 budget actions are fully implemented, 
federal employment is expected to decline by some 45,000 or 
about 10 per cent. Natural attrition and the programs currently in 
place are inadequate to deal with changes of this scope. The 
government appreciates the valuable service its employees 
provide. We are committed to managing the reductions in a fair 
and orderly fashion.
<P>
	In keeping with this commitment the bill proposes changes to 
the Public Sector Compensation Act that will allow for an early 
departure incentive. This incentive could be taken by as many as 
13,000 to 15,000 employees in the most affected departments. 
We estimate the cost of the program for the public service, the 
military, certain separate employers and the crown to be about 
$1 billion which will be included in the 1994-95 fiscal year.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Other proposed changes to the act will allow for cost neutral 
changes to non-salaried terms of employment and for certain 
new kinds of leave. In addition, we are proposing amendments 
to the Public Service Employment Act that will give public 
sector managers more flexibility in staffing arrangements.
<P>
	Employees affected by the downsizing who decide not to take 
advantage of the departure incentives will have a reasonable 
period to find employment elsewhere in the public service, but 
that period cannot be indefinite. The government simply cannot 
afford to pay people for not working.
<P>
	Accordingly the bill also includes amendments to the 
workforce adjustment directive so that surplus employees in 
most affected departments who decline departure incentives 
will cease to be paid after six months and will be laid off after 
one year unless alternative employment is found.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board recently signed an 
agreement in principle with the public service unions to assist 
employees affected by downsizing. He will be working through 
joint labour-management adjustment committees to assist 
affected employees in making the transition from the public 
service.
<P>
	Our goal in introducing these and other transition measures is 
to be fair to the taxpayer as well as to the federal employees 
affected. We believe the program balances the objectives.
<P>
	Today's legislation will play a key role in setting the country 
on the course of fiscal responsibility and government renewal. 
These measures are absolutely essential if we are to meet our 
deficit targets and refocus the government on its priorities and 
on the country's needs.
<P>
	We have drawn directly on the advice of Canadians from 
whom we heard several months before the budget and who 
subsequently gave us advice after the budget. Canadians in turn 
have shown their strong support for the budget. They know it 
will promote better public finances and a stronger economy.
<P>
	To secure the savings that will lead to the improvements we 
must pass the legislation as quickly as possible. Anything less 
will compromise our ability to reach the objectives we have 
promised Canadians and our commitment to a secure and 
prosperous future for ourselves and our children. I therefore 
urge all members to give the bill final approval in the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak at third 
reading of Bill C-76, which implements certain provisions of 
the budget tabled in Parliament on February 27, 1995.
<P>
	I was listening a little while ago to the parliamentary 
secretary who spoke about the hearings held by the finance 
committee and I had the impression that we did not attend the 
same hearings. People did not come to tell us that they were in 
favour of the budget measures. They did not come to tell us that 
these budget measures put the country on the track that they 
wanted to see the government follow. On the contrary, the vast 
majority of witnesses said that in the last two years, since the 
tabling of the Minister of Finance's first budget, the federal 
government always targeted those in the greatest need.
<P>
	What people will remember, and what they said at the finance 
committee hearings, is that the government, in the last two 
years, has continued to make cuts in what we believe to be 
fundamental, Canada's social programs. What people will 
remember of the last two budgets is that there were cuts of $5.5 
billion in unemployment insurance in the first budget and that 
the number of weeks of benefits to which claimants are entitled 
was reduced by a tightening up of the eligibility criteria. That is 
what people will remember.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	What will stand out from the last budget and Bill C-76 in the 
mind of Canadians is that the government went one step further. 
The last budget added $700 million to the $5.5 billion in cuts 
already announced. This is what the Minister of Finance did, and 
Canadians will not forget.
<P>
	People will also remember the tightening of the 
unemployment insurance eligibility criteria, especially those 
who had to turn to that last resort program because they lost their 
job. They will remember that it is this government that tightened 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13294"> 13294 </A></B>
<P>
eligibility criteria and reduced the number of insurable weeks. 
What happened to those people? I have seen many of them in my 
riding office since last year and they have had to go on welfare. 
These people, already disheartened and depressed by the 
economic situation and the loss of their job, have had to apply 
for welfare benefits.
<P>
	Do you know how many people the Liberal government is 
responsible for shifting from unemployment insurance benefits 
to welfare? In Quebec, 50,000 more people joined the already 
impressive ranks of the 800,000 on welfare. This is what people 
will remember of this government, and what they have been 
blaming it for since the tabling of the first two budgets.
<P>
	I will also add this: for the last two quarters or so, for the last 
five months, no jobs were created in Canada, there was no net 
creation of jobs. The economy is stagnating. Do you know what 
that means on a technical level? It means that our economy is 
slowing down and that we may be headed faster than we think 
toward another recession. That is what this government is 
offering us and that is what Canadians will remember.
<P>
	The measures taken by the Liberal government over the last 
two years have led to more poverty in Canada. Do you know 
that, during the last two decades, the number of poor families in 
our country has increased 41 per cent? Forty-one per cent in two 
decades.
<P>
	Do you know that the poverty rate among single parent 
families headed by a woman exceeds 52 per cent? It is a 
catastrophe. A 52 per cent poverty rate among single mother 
families.
<P>
	Do you know what that percentage is in Sweden? We tend to 
forget that. In Sweden, the poverty rate among single mother 
families is 6 per cent. Fifty-two per cent in Canada compared to 
6 per cent in Sweden. There is a problem somewhere, and I 
understand perfectly why women in Quebec have had enough of 
this situation.
<P>
	I understand perfectly why, two weeks ago, women have 
started marching to demand that their rights be recognized, to 
demand that they be treated fairly, to tell both the Quebec and 
the federal governments that they have had enough of this 
poverty, that they have had enough of politicians who promise 
them the moon during the election campaign but who, as soon as 
they come into office, start taking away what little bit these 
women have. That is what people are saying today and what 
women were saying when they marched on Quebec City.
<P>
	Do you know what kind of hourly wage for a normal 37 1/2 
hour workweek a single mother with a child needs to survive? I 
figured it out a few times because several women in tears came 
to my constituency office to tell me that they could not make 
ends meet. To survive, they  need the equivalent of a minimum 
hourly wage of $10 for a 37 1/2 hour workweek.
<P>
	The $8.15 minimum wage demanded by the women who 
marched on Quebec City was symbolic. They wanted to see 
government decisions take a new direction, and this was the 
direction they were looking for as part of a new social covenant 
for Quebec. They wanted the government to change its course, 
to review the entire income security program, and they wanted 
the program to include not just training but re-entry into the 
labour force. This was the fundamental message these women 
were trying to get across when they marched on Quebec City last 
week.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	I was pleased with the response of the Quebec government. It 
did not take the approach that seven demands out of nine had 
been met. I do not want to get into a numbers game, but the 
important thing is the direction adopted by the government of 
Quebec in response to these women. The direction of the 
response by the government of Quebec on Sunday is more 
important than any numbers and that direction is clear.
<P>
	One thing is certain, the Quebec government has not lost sight 
of the real world. We can see this in its approach to the economy 
and also in its compassion for its citizens. The message Sunday 
from Premier Parizeau was clear: the government of Quebec 
will work to improve the lot of the least fortunate, taking rapid 
and direct action in seeking to respond to all of women's 
demands. This is only normal, it is vital for 52 per cent of 
Quebec's population, the proportion represented by women. The 
government of Quebec will address these areas that are key to 
the survival of lone parent families headed by women.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec will be all the better placed to 
meet these needs once Quebecers have decided to stop frittering 
away their energy arguing and complaining about the 
constitution, which is what they have been doing constantly for 
50 years, in an attempt to carve out for themselves a decent 
place-nothing more than what anyone else has-just a 
respectable place within the system, and for all that we have 
tried, they not only refuse to let us take our place, but they also 
refuse to even recognize our differences.
<P>
	Once we have settled this issue over the next few 
months-yes, it is a question of months-all of our energies, all 
of our tax money will be devoted to helping these women, and 
these men, the most needy Quebecers, who will be able to at 
least have hope that their situation will improve. I think that the 
message that the Premier of Quebec delivered Sunday was clear 
and I think that the comparison is easy to make. When we see 
that the Government of Quebec is holding out its hand, when we 
see the federal government's partial answers to the neediest 
women of our society, its general orientation and its actions over 
the past two years, I think that the situation is clear.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13295"> 13295 </A></B>
<P>
	Just look at what Quebecers are choosing between: a federal 
system which has brought public finances to ruin, with a current 
debt of $548 billion and a forecasted total debt of about $800 
billion in another four and a half years; a federal government 
which has introduced two consecutive budgets cutting 
unemployment insurance, federal transfer payments and which 
could eventually make cuts to the old age security system; and 
the Government of Quebec, which is orienting itself towards 
helping the neediest Quebecers, I think that the choice to be 
made in the fall is clear. We must get out of this system, which is 
all about cuts like the ones contained in the last budget and like 
those they are bringing in through Bill C-76, a system which 
will continue in that vein over the next few years.
<P>
	I would like to digress and pay tribute to these women who 
marched on Quebec City, pay tribute to their courage, 
perseverance, their faith in a brighter future for Quebec and for 
all Quebecers. I think that they have demonstrated that if we are 
determined to make society a better place, if we stop depending 
on power hungry politicians like the ones we have faced across 
the way for 18 months to make a change, we can make progress. 
When we see people coming to Quebec City to face their 
politicians, who actually want things to change themselves and 
give people hope that things will fundamentally change under a 
sovereign Quebec, that is already a great victory for the women 
who marched all the way to Quebec City.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to tell these women, when they were 
passing through my riding, Saint-Hyacinthe, how beautiful they 
are, simply beautiful, how they were beautiful in spirit and 
beautiful in heart. They expressed their heartfelt concerns and 
the Government of Quebec answered that things would change, 
that they could hope for a fundamental change in their case, 
because they and others like them should not be held responsible 
and made to pay for the 52 per cent poverty rate. It is inhumane. 
A society with any sense of dignity should be ashamed of 
perpetuating this poverty, especially among women who are 
single parents and have had to put up with this for decades.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	One wonders why these women did not march on Ottawa as 
well. Why not? They could have marched on Ottawa, but these 
Quebecers realized they would be wasting their time marching 
on Ottawa. They would be wasting their time, because this 
government is bankrupt, has no vision and has shown no 
compassion during the two years it has been in power, despite its 
commitments in the red book. That is why they did not march on 
Ottawa.
<P>
	This government gives us nothing but cutbacks. It does not 
talk about controlling public spending, improving the economy 
or improving social justice in Canada. It just keeps cutting 
blindly, although this will have no visible impact in four years' 
time. Unless this big federal  machine stops overheating, 
billions and billions of dollars worth of cuts every year will have 
no impact at all.
<P>
	Speaking of cuts, the latest budget brought down by the 
Minister of Finance, as implemented in Bill C-76, cuts away at 
transfer payments to provincial governments. In Quebec alone, 
and this we cannot accept, 32 per cent of federal transfers will be 
cut over the next three years. This is very serious: 32 per cent of 
federal transfers will be cut in Quebec.
<P>
	Predictably, every time a decision is made in Ottawa, a 
decision over which the Government of Quebec has no control at 
all, in Quebec City they have to cut not only the fat but the lean 
as well. It may be predictable but it is intolerable that the 
Minister of Finance in Quebec City does not have full control 
over the money that comes in and the money that goes out every 
year.
<P>
	How can you expect a government to be able to plan ahead for 
the next three to five years? It is impossible. Because the 
Canadian government cuts 32 per cent of its transfers to the 
Government of Quebec, the Government of Quebec is being 
saddled with a number of financial problems because the federal 
government is not doing its job. The federal government is 
offloading its problems with the deficit by cutting transfer 
payments.
<P>
	The federal government is delighted when it sees a nice flag 
flying over an infrastructure project in which it invested 20,000 
or 30,000 dollars. On those occasions, you will see not just the 
minister but his assistants and his parliamentary secretary right 
up front at the sod turning ceremony. But when it is a matter of 
being responsible and controlling the public spending, they are 
not interested.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are good at shovelling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> They certainly are. Cuts in federal transfer 
payments to the Government of Quebec will cost Quebec $650 
million next year. This offloading of the federal deficit will 
mean that next year, the Government of Quebec will have a 
shortfall of $650 million. Ultimately, we will lose $2.4 billion 
because of federal decisions over which the Government of 
Quebec has no control.
<P>
	But there is more than that in this bill. The bill contains 
another instance of strong arming by the federal government. 
This is the kind of tactic we have come to expect from the 
present Prime Minister who was the right-hand man of Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau in 1980 and in 1981, when the Canadian 
constitution was patriated against an almost unanimous decision 
of the National Assembly to veto patriation unless Quebec's 
historic demands were met.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13296"> 13296 </A></B>
<P>
	The present Prime Minister was also the chief instigator of the 
demise of the Meech Lake accord in 1990. No one will forget 
that. We all remember how he walked up and down the hallway 
with his cellular phone while inside, the Leader of the Official 
Opposition in Manitoba, Mrs. Carstairs, was taking her cues 
from him and doing his dirty work.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	He is the one responsible for the collapse of the Meech Lake 
accord. Quebecers remember that too.
<P>
	Now, another blow is being struck by the federal government 
with Bill C-76. The blow comes from our national expert, who 
is making his right hand man, the Minister of Finance, do his 
dirty work.
<P>
	Bill C-76 provides for the continuance of national standards 
for health care and the introduction of new ones for welfare and 
post-secondary education. And if the provinces-for these 
people, Quebec is just another province-fail to comply with 
these standards, they will be cut off just like the unemployed and 
the people on welfare were cut off and like seniors soon will be.
<P>
	Permit me to contradict the parliamentary secretary. No, the 
provinces are not being given greater autonomy. It gives me a 
pain in my stomach to hear talk of provincial autonomy, when 
welfare, post-secondary education and health are already 
provincial matters, within Quebec's jurisdiction. Giving greater 
autonomy in areas of provincial jurisdiction-now I have heard 
it all.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary talks of greater autonomy and 
greater flexibility. On the contrary. Not only will federal 
intrusion into areas already established by the constitution 
continue, but the provinces will be bound and gagged and told 
that, if they fail to meet the Canada-wide standards established, 
the government will find one way or another to cut them off, to 
not give them any transfer funding.
<P>
	This is the sort of flexible and co-operative federalism the 
government is offering us with a simple bill on public finances.
<P>
	When Bill C-76 was initially tabled, there was a great outcry 
in Quebec. Imagine setting national standards in 
post-secondary education for Quebecers, in particular. You can 
bet there was a reaction in Quebec when that came out. 
Quebecers were outraged. They understood that, if this bill were 
implemented, 75 per cent of people of Canada would be 
deciding about education in Quebec. Imagine the effect on the 
backbone of our culture, of what makes us distinct and of what 
makes us a people if our education were determined by the other 
founding people.
<P>
	No people in the world would accept such conditions. It 
makes no sense. So here we have the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Finance, our worthy representatives of 
Quebec,-and I see the member for Brome-Missisquoi with a 
smile on his lips-closing their eyes and concerns to the 
development of Canadian  standards for post-secondary 
education and making Quebec toe the line on pain of being cut 
off. This is their idea of federalism.
<P>
	Given the general outcry provoked by his initial project, the 
Minister of Finance, at one point-I think it was during the 
debate at second reading-proposed, in a move which is very 
unusual on the floor of the House, to table amendments 
following speeches by the Leader of the Opposition who 
opposed this measure, by the critic from Mercier and myself. He 
threw them out just like that, saying that they could meet 
Quebec's demands. We did well not to react right away because, 
when we received in writing the amendments which were passed 
yesterday by the government side, we realized that not only did 
the minister not solve anything but that he made things even 
worse. The second version was worse than the first one. They 
were laughing at us.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> They get everything wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier: </B>Absolutely. No wonder this country is in such a 
mess.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the amendments passed yesterday by the 
liberal majority say the following: ``The Minister of Human 
Resources Development shall invite representatives of all the 
provinces to consult and work together to develop, through 
mutual consent, a set of shared principles and objectives for the 
other social programs referred to in paragraph (1)(<I>d</I>) that could 
underlie the Canada Health and Social Transfer''. Other social 
programs include not only health but also post-secondary 
education and welfare.
<P>
	First of all, what is meant by ``mutual consent''?
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	We have heard it over the past 15 or 20 years; ``mutual 
agreement'' has meant that as soon as seven provinces with 50 
per cent of the population agree, there is mutual agreement. Not 
only is the agreement mutual, but it becomes a Canadian 
consensus, no matter what Quebec believes.
<P>
	This is the route we are going with Bill C-76, and the 
provisions regarding the Canada social transfer if they are 
adopted under their present form. Mutual agreement could mean 
the agreement of seven provinces with 50 per cent of the 
population. The federalists opposite with their blinders on will 
see it as a Canadian consensus. They used to be called the 74 
fools. I do not know how many of them there are now, I did not 
count them, but I do not think anything has changed. Even they 
will accept that Quebec is made to toe the line if there is mutual 
agreement with seven provinces accounting for 50 per cent of 
the population.
<P>
	This is what is meant by mutual agreement, it becomes a 
Canadian consensus and must be abided by, and it says right here 
that if it is not, they will cut funding. ``Canada health and social 
transfer may be provided for a fiscal year for the purpose of-'' 
Among the listed purposes are the following: ``promoting any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13297"> 13297 </A></B>
<P>
shared  principles and objectives that are developed, pursuant to 
subsection (3), with respect to the operation of social programs, 
other than a program for the purpose referred to in paragraph 
(b).''
<P>
	What this means is that because these types of consensus have 
been arrived at through mutual agreement, as I explained earlier, 
if one province does not abide by these mutual agreements, 
these sorts of Canadian consensus, its funding will be cut in a 
drastic manner and without warning.
<P>
	Picture this. A Canadian consensus is arrived at regarding 
post-secondary education, with seven provinces accounting for 
50 per cent of the population, excluding Quebec, and they say: 
``From now on, this is the way education is going to be, and this 
is the route all provincial governments are going to follow''. If 
Quebec refuses to toe the line, because of its distinct culture and 
because it is a distinct nation, it will lose billions of dollars in 
transfer payments. This is what is called co-operative 
federalism according to Bill C-76.
<P>
	We have a suggestion to make to the government: it should 
immediately abolish all provisions concerning the Canada 
health and social transfer and, before anything else, meet with 
the Quebec government to discuss its withdrawal. It should 
withdraw from any area of provincial jurisdiction like health 
care, post-secondary education and welfare. It must leave those 
areas to Quebec. It must transfer tax points to the Quebec 
government as a compensation and stop annoying Quebec with 
those darned national standards, those Canada-wide standards.
<P>
	That is what Quebec wants and that is the essence of Quebec's 
message.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> There is also another message that we could 
send to the federal government, given what we heard at the 
finance committee. We could certainly add another message. 
Some Canadian provinces want national standards; they want 
standards for everything. The federal government should meet 
with these provinces and determine the standards with them and 
with all the Canadian groups outside Quebec who want such 
standards. Let them choose and implement the standards, but 
they should leave Quebec alone. That is the second message we 
want to convey to the government about Bill C-76 and the 
Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	There is another point we must make in the context of this bill 
and it concerns the Crow's benefit. That benefit raised passions 
in Quebec in the past. Do you know why? Because, in 1982, 
another Liberal government was in office at the time and they 
understood strictly nothing about that issue. I remember that, in 
1982, the actual minister of International Affairs was 
responsible for the Crow's Nest rate issue in Quebec. He was the 
only french speaking member of the group who could 
understand what a crow, a nest and a train were. At least, it was a 
beginning.
<P>
	There was a terrible fight in 1982. Do you know why? Because 
the Crow rate, a grant for western grain transportation, a 
preferential rate structure for the shipping of grain products 
from the prairies to the various export points, was established in 
1897.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Since 1897, we have built a balance between east and west, 
between grain production in the west and livestock production 
in the east, especially in Quebec. We also grow grain in Quebec, 
but mostly for animal feed, while in the west wheat is grown for 
export. This balance evolved over the years: grain in the west, 
livestock in the east.
<P>
	When you eliminate the preferential rate known as Crow's 
Nest, when you eliminate the subsidies paid year after year by 
the federal government to railway companies, to allow them to 
charge below cost, you are breaking the balance. The 
disappearance of the preferential rates will mean a local price 
for grain in the west that is $8 to $15 a metric tonne below the 
international price.
<P>
	Do you know what that means? It means that by breaking the 
balance you are giving a competitive advantage to western 
producers who, with a price for grain of $8 to $15 a metric tonne 
lower than the international price, will be able to produce more 
meat animals. This situation is accepted by eastern producers 
and in particular those in Quebec. They reason that things have 
changed since 1897, and they accept that the subsidized rates 
known as the Crow's Nest rates must disappear.
<P>
	However, we should not go too far. That is the way it was in 
1982 and that is the way it is today, but we should not go any 
further. In other words, when you eliminate this advantage, you 
must simply do away with it and bring transportation rates to the 
level at which they should normally be, that is to say the real 
transportation cost for the hopper cars which carry grain to the 
various export points.
<P>
	If you go beyond that, if you give a federal compensation-24 
per cent of which is being paid by Quebec taxes-to increase 
livestock production in the west so that they can compete with 
Quebec hog producers, for example, we no longer agree. We 
cannot accept that federal money be used to help western 
producers compete against their Quebec colleagues. It would be 
totally unfair. Not only do they subsidize, but they subsidize in a 
big way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13298"> 13298 </A></B>
<P>
	They ask everybody to tighten their belts while giving $1.6 
billion in compensation to western producers. And contrary to 
what the parliamentary secretary said earlier, this $1.6 billion is 
tax free, which means that, in fact, we are giving $2.2 billion to 
western producers in compensation for the fact that the 
preferential tariff is going to be eliminated within the next five 
years.
<P>
	Nobody warned the Quebec milk producers when milk 
subsidies were cut, $35 million in one shot. There were no 
transition measures, they did not offer any when our markets 
were opened up under NAFTA and, afterwards, the GATT 
agreement which is now the World Trade Organization 
agreement. They did not compensate them at all. Nor did they 
compensate the unemployed when they cut UI funds by $2.5 
billion annually.
<P>
	In a period of fiscal austerity, a time when it is said that the 
federal system is bankrupt with a debt of $548 billion, they are 
ready to give what amounts to $2.2 billion to western producers. 
It is totally unfair because, as I said earlier, Quebec's money will 
be used to increase the competitiveness of western cattlemen 
who are going to compete with Quebec hog and beef producers. 
This is why we are against this part of Bill C-76.
<P>
	If we must amend the Crow rate, let us eliminate it and the 
subsidy that goes with it; we must let the free market set the 
tariff and leave it at that. This is what we must do when we are 
bled white because of the state of public finances and when 
everybody is asked to make sacrifices. Moreover, they do not 
even recognize that the elimination of the Crow's Nest rate will 
have considerable impacts on Quebec. According to an analysis 
done by Professor Garth Coffin of McGill University, Quebec 
will have to absorb between $24 and $46 million per year in 
losses because of the government's policy.
<P>
	I think that the current Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and the current Prime Minister forgot what the Crow rate did for 
Quebec in 1982.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	It would be in their interest to remember that, because Quebec 
producers remind them, either here or in their riding office, of 
what the Crow rate means for them, of what it means for them to 
have their dairy subsidies cut again and again. They were asked 
to make greater sacrifices than other classes of population in the 
last budget; their dairy subsidies and various income 
stabilization plans were cut and they were especially concerned 
when our borders were opened, as we did here a bit over 
zealously-if you will allow me the expression-by opening our 
borders wider than anywhere else in the world. Americans, who 
are in favour of free trade in the milk industry, are the second 
most protectionist in the world after Japan. That is something.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I have only a few minutes left, but I would 
like to add a last point. Veterans affairs is another issue that I 
consider important. Bill C-76 contains clauses that are hitting 
veterans very hard, but even more so  their families. Speaking of 
veterans, we can go back to World War I or II, but we must not 
forget those who fought recently. Soldiers were sent by the 
federal government to represent Canada in peacekeeping forces 
and some of them died while in the performance of their duty. 
Their families however must go on with their lives.
<P>
	Concerned with justice, my colleague and friend, the member 
for Châteauguay, presented amendments to Bill C-76 to prevent 
the federal government from acting unjustly towards them. His 
colleague for Chicoutimi made a brilliant plea in favour of the 
amendments yesterday. I thank him for that, since the member 
for Châteauguay had pressing obligations elsewhere. Yesterday, 
the member for Chicoutimi presented the analysis made by the 
member for Châteauguay and I will comment on it, since the 
Bloc Quebecois considers that in no case must a budget lead to 
social injustices, as this measure would do for veterans.
<P>
	Briefly, in Bill C-76 the government gives up its obligations 
and commitments towards veterans despite historical promises 
made on their honour by this government and its predecessors. 
The government knows very well that these cuts will add to the 
plight of the families of these veterans and force them to turn to 
other public services, provincial in this case, for the help they 
need. Someone said earlier that the federal government had 
become an expert at shovelling. Well, this is another case of 
shovelling.
<P>
	This government not only shows disrespect for veterans, their 
memory, their families and all they had to go through, but it 
passes on to Quebec responsibilities which were initially that of 
the federal government. For example, clause 42 of Bill C-76 
amends the Children of Deceased Veterans Education 
Assistance Act. This amendment is the first step in the gradual 
elimination of a benefit giving children of deceased veterans a 
chance to pursue their studies. The 85 orphans who presently 
receive this benefit are all, except one or two, children of 
deceased soldiers who participated in Canadian peacekeeping 
missions. We are not talking here about the two world wars but 
about recent peacekeeping missions in which Canadian soldiers 
died.
<P>
	Not only did those children lose their fathers who died while 
defending peace, democracy and freedom, but they are now 
being deprived of a chance to further their knowledge. 
According to Bill C-76, students who were receiving the benefit 
up to the day the budget was tabled will continue to be entitled to 
it, but the department will accept no further applications. In 
1993-94, that assistance program cost $315,803. It is not so 
much, but that is the Minister of Finance's great initiative, his 
masterpiece.
<P>
	Not only are the poorest in our society being attacked, but now 
the children of those who lost their lives fighting for peace are 
being attacked also. We oppose this. Clauses 68 to 72 amend the 
War Veterans Allowance Act by putting an end to the payment of 
allowances to veterans who were involved in the resistance. We 
are  talking about allied resistance fighters who made the same 
contribution as official soldiers, as official armies, to bringing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13299"> 13299 </A></B>
<P>
about peace and freedom during the First and Second World 
Wars.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	These clauses are aimed at gradually eliminating the 
allowances payable to these veterans who were military allies, 
who immigrated to Canada at the end of their service and who 
lived here for at least ten years before asking the government for 
assistance. The government is cutting off their allowances 
simply and brutally.
<P>
	Clause 69 repeals sub-section 6.1 of the Allowance Act. This 
sub-section 6.1 provides that allied veterans who took part in 
the resistance will continue to receive the allowances 
established according to their financial circumstances, as long 
as these allowances were awarded on March 2, 1992 or before.
<P>
	With this provision, by repealing this sub-section, the 
government is cutting off allowances to more than 3,000 people 
in Canada. This provision will also have the effect of taking 
away the allowances of more than 1,000 resistance veterans 
whose Old Age Security and Canada Pension Plan benefits put 
them just above the income level that would normally qualify 
them for health care benefits.
<P>
	And speaking about health care, a few weeks ago, I received a 
letter from people in my riding of Saint-Hyacinthe that was 
quite meaningful and may illustrate the awful and disrespectful 
treatment we give to veterans and their families.
<P>
	Mr. Hervé Bélanger, the secretary of branch 102 of the Royal 
Canadian Legion in Saint-Hyacinthe wrote the following: ``The 
executive committee of branch 102 learned recently that 
veterans living in the Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue 
Hotel''-veterans injured in active duty-``will have to pay 
more for their rooms, as rates will go from $547 to $703.80 per 
month this year, or a 28 per cent increase'', all because of a 
decision taken by this government.
<P>
	Do you know how much rates have gone up for these veterans 
since 1990? They pay 198 per cent more. But because there are 
very few of them, and they do not have the energy and strength to 
get organized, after having served their country, and in some 
cases lost a limb-some families were left fatherless-, they 
cannot get organized, their numbers are dwindling, and they are 
not a force to be reckoned with, so the Liberals have no use for 
them. The Liberals do not see them as an organized lobby, so 
they think nothing of slashing their assistance. This shameful 
slashing is taking place because they do not have names like 
Bronfman or Desmarais, and because Liberal ministers never 
visit them as they visit the Desmarais and the Bronfmans, even 
if it means going as far as California. So, they are not accorded 
fair and just treatment.
<P>
	For all these reasons, not only during the vote, but also after, 
and during the referendum campaign in Quebec,  the official 
opposition will strongly and firmly reject Bill C-76 as well as 
this government which is more centralizing than any other 
government-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, but his time has 
expired.
<P>
	Debate resumes with the hon. member for Kootenay East.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the round of applause from my Bloc friends very 
much.
<P>
	Coming to the House, I have come to the conclusion that one 
does not have to be crazy, but it helps. It makes me think of the 
situation where the inmates are in charge of the asylum.
<P>
	The government came here on a promise of openness. The 
government came here on a promise that we were going to be 
able to get into debate, get into a situation where the people of 
Canada were going to be represented in the Chamber. As 
opposed to openness, what have we had? Closure.
<P>
	I refer to a very profound one-minute statement made by my 
colleague from Calgary Centre yesterday, and I know that 
Liberals would want to hear it again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In opposition the Liberals howled at Brian Mulroney with righteous 
indignation over his government's use of time allocation to ram through 
legislation. With such sincere compassion for democracy, one would expect this 
Liberal government's record in the use of time allocation to be squeaky clean 
compared to Mulroney. Let us compare.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mulroney used time allocation 35 times to pass 200 bills. That is 17 per cent 
of his bills. Shame on him. Counting today's time allocation motion, the little 
guy from Shawinigan has used time allocation an unprecedented 11 times in 
only 59 bills. That is 19 per cent of his bills passed using time allocation, 2 per 
cent more than Mulroney.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Congratulations, Liberals. A parliamentary record. Does this mean that this 
Prime Minister is less democratic and even more arrogant than Brian Mulroney? 
Is that possible?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	It is a very good question. Time allocation is absolutely 
inexcusable in that the Liberals have on Bill C-76 turned 180 
degrees from their red book. There is no mandate on the part of 
the government to be able to bring forward Bill C-76.
<P>
	Why would we be into a situation of time allocation? The 
House might be interested. The list is moderately exhaustive but 
it is important to get on record how the government has either 
exhibited poor management and planning or, in the alternative, 
legislation by stealth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13300"> 13300 </A></B>
<P>
	Poor management and planning would say it is impossible to 
understand that the following bills in the Commons are awaiting 
start or completion of second reading, all of which are supposed 
to be completed by June 23: Bill C-62, an act respecting the 
achievement of regulatory goals; Bill C-71, an act to amend the 
Explosives Act; Bill C-78, an act to provide for the 
establishment of a program to enable certain persons to receive 
protection in relation to certain inquiries, investigations or 
prosecutions; Bill C-81, an act respecting the Buffalo and Fort 
Erie Public Bridge Company; Bill C-82, an act to amend the 
Royal Canadian Mint; Bill C-83, an act to amend the Auditor 
General Act; Bill C-84, an act to provide for the review, 
registration, publication and parliamentary scrutiny of 
regulations and other documents; Bill C-88, an act to implement 
the agreement on internal trade; Bill C-90, an act to amend the 
Excise Tax Act and the Excise Act; Bill C-91, an act to continue 
the Federal Business Development Bank under the name 
Business Development Bank of Canada; and Bill C-92, an act to 
amend the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	That is not all. The next list is of bills in committee: Bill C-7, 
an act respecting the control of certain drugs, their precursors 
and other substances and to amend certain other acts and repeal 
the Narcotic Control Act; Bill C-58, an act to amend the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police Act; Bill C-61, an act to establish a system of 
administrative monetary penalties for the enforcement of the 
Canada Agricultural Products Act; Bill C-64, an act respecting 
employment equity; Bill C-66, an act to amend the Western 
Grain Transportation Act; Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms 
and other weapons; Bill C-72, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code on self-induced intoxication; and Bill C-85, an act to 
amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act.
<P>
	I might have something to say about that act in a couple of 
minutes.
<P>
	The list continues: Bill C-86, an act to amend the Canadian 
Dairy Commission Act; Bill C-87, an act to implement the 
convention on the prohibition of the development, production 
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their 
destruction; and Bill C-89, an act to provide for the continuance 
of the Canadian National Railway Company under the Canada 
Business Corporations Act.
<P>
	Then we have bills awaiting or in report stage: Bill C-41, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code on sentencing; Bill C-45, an act 
to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the 
Criminal Code, the Criminal Records Act, the Prisons and 
Reformatories Act and the Transfer of Offenders Act; Bill C-52, 
an act to establish the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services; Bill C-65, an act to recognize and 
dissolve certain federal agencies; Bill C-70, an act to amend the 
income tax application rules; Bill C-75, an act  to amend the 
Farm Improvement and Marketing Co-Operatives Loans Act; 
and Bill C-76, an act to amend certain statutes to implement 
certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on 
February 27.
<P>
	Just to top it off, bills awaiting start or completion of third 
reading: Bill C-54, an act to amend the Old Age Security Act, 
the Canada Pension Act, the Children's Special Allowances Act 
and the Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	It begs the question of why the backlog is sitting there. Is the 
government actually in a situation of such poor management and 
planning that it would be expecting the House to be working 
exhaustive hours and that it would be expecting to be able to 
shove this kind of legislative package through in such a short 
period of time because of poor management and planning? Is 
that the reason, or is it legislation by stealth?
<P>
	Legislation by stealth happens when a government decides it 
will regularly and frequently use time allocation, as pointed out 
by my colleague from Calgary Centre. One interesting things 
happens when we get into legislation by stealth. We end up with 
legislation by exhaustion.
<P>
	The standing committee that considered Bill C-68 finally 
rose at 1 a.m. I sat in on a few sessions which were very detailed 
and thoughtful. I commend the chairman of the committee for 
listening to all sides of the question, treating the motions by the 
opposition as serious motions, and allowing time for discussion.
<P>
	To show the House how we end up with legislation by 
exhaustion, the parliamentary secretary to the justice minister 
brought in no less than 79 amendments to the legislation on 
behalf of the justice minister. Why in the world would a bill be 
so flawed, so full of holes, so badly drafted that the government 
would actually have to bring in 79 amendments to its own 
legislation? That is unheard of.
<P>
	It is really hilarious that in committees there are a few rogues 
but as a general rule we find members vote the party line. The 
parliamentary secretary who sits in the meeting will say: ``I 
really don't think this is good''. Guess what? We end up with 
party members voting the party line. That is the way it happens 
in the House too.
<P>
	In this instance I am happy to report that under legislation by 
exhaustion, as is being practised by the government, 2 of the 79 
amendments brought forward by the parliamentary secretary 
were rejected by members of his own caucus. That is how 
disorganized the Liberals are. That is what happens when we end 
up with legislation by stealth and hence legislation by 
exhaustion.
<P>

<P>
	It permits rushing bills through the House such as Bill C-76. 
The government has no mandate to bring it to the House. It 
allows the government to push it through under time allocation. 
It will also be able to push through Bill C-68 and Bill C-41, two 
of the more contentious bills, under the whole ruse of time 
allocation and pressure because there is so much legislation. It 
could have and should have been properly planned so the people 
of Canada and their points of view would be properly 
represented.
<P>
	In a couple of minutes I will talk about the relationship of high 
taxation to Bill C-76 and the lack of understanding on the part of 
the Liberals with respect to high taxation. Before doing so, I 
quote the from an article in the Calgary <I>Sun</I> on the weekend 
entitled ``Tax cheats grow'' about the frustrations of Canadians:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>COMPAS' survey of 820 adult Canadians last month showed respondents 
frustrated by corrupt politicians, government waste, overpaid officials and high 
taxes, in that order.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It's a common sense moral view that says if our leaders cheat I'm going to 
cheat.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I want to make it very clear that I am not suggesting for one 
minute anyone in the House is cheating.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	However I am talking about the perception of many 
Canadians in casual situations around the kitchen table or in a 
coffee shop. Common sense says that they do not understand 
what politicians are doing and think they are out of control. That 
is why I find legislation by subterfuge, legislation by pressure, 
to be completely unacceptable particularly when it comes to the 
issue of MPs pensions.
<P>
	MPs pensions are a focal point or a pressure point the 
government chooses to completely misunderstand. Just because 
a few high paid people are at the front end who are in for the 
millions of dollars, the majority of backbenchers are prepared to 
go along with it. It is absolutely outstanding. In this case we 
have pressure on parliamentarians to bring the matter forward. I 
predict the MPs pension plan will be slid into the House and out 
of the House just as quickly as possible. Therein lies the 
frustration of people with coffee shop common sense.
<P>
	I will deal with the bill specifically. Clause 38 of Bill C-76 
gives cabinet far too much arbitrary power and discretion to 
decide how much to withhold and when and why transfers to 
provinces should be withheld. More significant, it allows 
cabinet to withhold any federal transfers, not just transfers 
under the CHST.
<P>
	Clause 48 is probably the single most troubling clause. In the 
departmental briefing our researchers attended, officials told 
them their legal interpretation of section 13(3) was that it would 
be possible for the federal government to unilaterally impose 
national standards. If the government cannot provide us with a 
guarantee that any national standard must be arrived at with 
unanimous provincial consent, we could not possibly support 
the clause.
<P>
	We have a tremendous amount of difficulty with clause 50 and 
clause 51. They deal with the whole Liberal mindset of giving 
the government executive power, giving the government power 
that actually puts it in a position where it no longer has to refer to 
the House.
<P>
	I think back to last June when we were in the pressure cooker. 
The government jammed through legislation on the Yukon 
Indian land claim settlements and Yukon self-government. It 
was jammed through the House. The difficulty is that although 
there were 14 land claims settled, only 4 were covered by the 
legislation. It means that kind of thing can come back to Ottawa 
and never see the House. There can be further settlements on 
behalf of the people of Canada by a closed group of people in the 
executive of government. It will never have the transparency 
that it must have in a democracy. It is just absolutely 
unacceptable.
<P>
	We really have a lot of difficulty with clauses 50 and 51 in Bill 
C-76. Basically they give cabinet too much authority with 
respect to determining what is or what is not a violation of the 
CHST. They allow the government to withhold any federal 
transfer, not just the CHST transfer, if it concludes there has 
been a violation.
<P>
	This raises the question of why they would do it. Why would 
they have this executive power? Why would they put this clout 
in the hands of the federal government? One of the main reasons 
is that it is a confused attempt to control social expenditures.
<P>
	The government is famous for saying that it will be preserving 
health care. What an empty threat. As it keeps on diminishing 
the amount of money that is transferred to the provinces to 
administer the program, how in the world will they have any 
clout to preserve health care? The difficulty I have is the basic 
question that if the government is talking about preserving 
health care and if the government is doing away the ability to 
transfer funds to the people, how will it do it? It will do it by 
having the legislation and being able to point to the legislation. 
It is basically like saying we know we will not be transferring 
any money but if we could, we would not. It is an absolute joke.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	It also gives rise to concern about what is happening in 
Ontario where Lyn McLeod with her Liberal red book has 
absolutely laid an egg. The provincial red book being brother of 
big red book is seen for what it is, basically empty promises.
<P>
	I and every person in Canada with the exception of members 
on the other side have seen from the time that Lyn McLeod 
introduced the red book her popularity started to slide. It is 
because people said they will not be taken in again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13302"> 13302 </A></B>
<P>
	With the will of the people of Ontario talking about workfare 
and with these clauses that give the ability to the federal 
government to withhold funds, is the will of the people of 
Ontario to be thwarted by the people in Ottawa who will say they 
will not be transferring sufficient funds for a workfare program? 
It has to be considered.
<P>
	I talked earlier about tax increase. One of the wildest ones was 
the roll back of the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. 
Capital is capital, money is money; whether public or private, 
money is money and should be treated exactly the same way.
<P>
	This was a direct slap to the people of Alberta. I am absolutely 
astounded the Minister of Natural Resources of all people did 
not have the fortitude to stand up to this onslaught on people and 
industries in Alberta. It is really shameful she backed off and 
was not there to be counted.
<P>
	Perhaps I should explain my understanding of what the Public 
Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act is. Crown corporations such 
as B.C. Hydro and Ontario Hydro are not subject to certain tax 
provisions from the federal government, whereas private 
corporations that might be in the same utility business such as 
Trans Alta and other corporations like that are.
<P>
	The purpose of the PUITTA was to give a credit. In other 
words, the public utility privately owned would then end up 
paying the taxes and receive a credit back from the federal 
government. By rolling it back the government under a different 
guise and under a different name basically gave a tax increase to 
the people who rely on the utilities in Alberta. It was not only 
Alberta, it was Nova Scotia and Labrador, two areas that can 
least afford that kind of subterfuge in terms of a tax increase.
<P>
	In the case of Nova Scotia, one of the most interesting things 
is that there was an attempt on the part of the provincial 
government to turn around and get out of the hydro business. I 
suggest it is something that might be considered by Ontario 
Hydro, B.C. Hydro and the rest of the public utilities. There is a 
place for government and there is a place for private enterprise 
and the efficiencies that come with private enterprise.
<P>
	Now if it does we can count on the fact that the federal 
government will have its hands in the wallets of the people of 
any other jurisdiction who choose to make what could be a very 
sound judgment otherwise.
<P>
	I see two fundamental problems. I combine the issues of 
integrity and leadership. From the <I>Financial Post</I>: ``High taxes 
turn Canadians into cheats''. I will quickly address the question 
of integrity and leadership. From a June 3 article concerning a 
poll done recently for the <I>Financial Post</I>: ``They cheated 
because they were disgusted with governments, politicians, 
regulations, the welfare system, bureaucrats and excessive 
taxation. Excessive pay to officials and politicians, government 
waste and especially political corruption are the main drivers of 
citizens' desires to tax cheat. The message for  politicians is 
they should focus on their own personal conduct if they do not 
want citizens to destroy the welfare state through the silent 
rebellion of tax cheating.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	``Besides documenting the degree of outrage and 
dissatisfaction with the government in this country this poll 
reveals that Canada's current levels of taxation are simply not 
collectable from a large segment of the population. Put another 
way, it means that most Canadians are unwilling to support the 
current level of government spending''.
<P>
	That is instructive because in the Reform Party's taxpayers 
budget we recognize that. We balance the budget. We stop the 
overspending within three years without one dime of a tax 
increase. This survey absolutely underscores that. I repeat: ``Put 
another way, it means that most Canadians are unwilling to 
support the current level of government spending''. There is 
absolutely nothing to give me any cause for comfort that the 
government has that message yet.
<P>
	What happens when the government does not listen? What 
happens to taxes and tax cheats? Here are a few of the points 
discovered by this survey. Two out of five or 42 per cent 
admitted paying cash for goods or services in order to avoid 
taxes, GST or provincial sales taxes. One out of five or 20 per 
cent admitted they have hidden income in order to evade income 
tax.
<P>
	Another 14 per cent said they have either smuggled or bought 
smuggled cigarettes or alcohol to avoid paying taxes on these 
commodities; 72 per cent said they would pay cash to avoid 
taxes if given the opportunity; 56 per cent said they would hide 
income if they could; 34 per cent said they would buy smuggled 
cigarettes or alcohol or smuggle them into Canada if they had 
the opportunity; 13 per cent admit they cheated whenever 
possible by paying cash; 5 per cent hid income whenever 
possible; 3 per cent bought contraband goods or smuggled goods 
whenever possible.
<P>
	Further on in the survey it was pointed out that 15 per cent of 
Canadians said they will definitely tax cheat in the future by 
paying cash under the table; 8 per cent said they would hide 
income; 5 per cent would buy contraband or smuggle goods. Of 
all surveyed, 53 per cent said they personally know people who 
pay cash under the table; 37 per cent said they know cigarette or 
alcohol smugglers or buyers of contraband; 36 per cent said they 
had knowledge of people cheating by hiding their income.
<P>
	A staggering 77 per cent of those polled said they have 
become more determined to avoid taxes than before. Of this 
percentage, 42 per cent said they are much more determined to 
avoid taxes; 35 per cent said somewhat more determined. Only 
16 per cent are less or somewhat less determined to avoid paying 
taxes in the future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13303"> 13303 </A></B>
<P>
	This comes about in my judgment through the lack of a clear 
exhibition of integrity and leadership on the part of politicians. 
We have a core problem, integrity.
<P>
	I have come to know some of the government members and I 
appreciate them, their friendship and their integrity. In the last 
election under the red book and under the promises and under 
the whole political process, were they ignorant that they could 
not fulfil the promises or did they get into government by 
stealth?
<P>
	There is one person in my mind in the House who stands out as 
being a person of quite exceptional integrity. This person was 
joined by the member for Halifax and the member for 
Beaches-Woodbine in a press conference clearly setting out 
his objections to Bill C-76. All three of them were absolutely 
decrying Bill C-76, how it could not work, how it should not 
work, how it was turning its back on the principles under which 
the government was elected. All three did it and only one of 
them still stands to this day, the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Let me make my position really clear. There are very few 
things which the member and I would find in common. I totally 
disagree with his position on gun control. I completely disagree 
with his position on criminal sentencing and the rest of those 
provisions, and I absolutely reject his position on Bill C-76. He 
came to the House, elected by the people of 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce to represent them as their member of 
Parliament. He said he would stand up for what he knows to be 
right.
<P>
	In a quote from the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> today, under the member's 
name who will vote against the budget:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Accusing the Liberals of betraying their principles and reneging on 
campaign promises to protect social programs, the veteran member is planning 
to vote against his government's budget today.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``I cannot contribute to tearing down a system which I for 29 years in the 
House helped build up with the Liberal Party'', (he) told the Commons during 
final debate Monday on a bill to implement last February's budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The bill contains provisions to cut $7 billion from federal transfers to the 
provinces for welfare, post-secondary education and health care and role those 
transfers into one block fund.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(He) predicted the social program cuts will hit those in need the hardest, 
``widen the gap between the rich and poor'' and lead to ``social unrest and 
increased crime''. And he said they could ``quick start or aggravate a recession 
that might be coming on''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I want to reiterate I do not agree with the member's point of 
view. I would find it impossible to stand with him when he votes 
against this bill on the same matter of principle. I think he is 
completely wrong. It even borders on being immoral when the 
government of the day turns around and says to members on the 
gun control bill: ``You did not vote our way, you are out''.
<P>
	This member has been an outstanding chair of the justice 
committee. What will happen? Is the Prime Minister to oust him 
as well? What happens when he does? What he does then is 
undermine the whole issue of integrity and leadership on the 
part of politicians.
<P>
	In 1994 the government had a unique opportunity. It is true 
that its members came to Ottawa either in ignorance or stealth, 
misunderstanding the reality of what was involved with the 
economics of the day, totally missing the mark, decrying the fact 
that the Reform Party had the audacity to tell people the biggest 
single problem was the debt and the way it was eroding social 
programs.
<P>
	In 1994 they missed the opportunity. They arrived here with 
unrealistic expectations, and clearly the budget of 1994 showed 
that. In Bill C-76 and under the budget of the finance minister 
for the first time in 25 years we saw a real cut in spending of a 
net reduction of approximately $10 billion. Unfortunately 
because the government arrived here with unrealistic 
expectations, in the intervening period from October 1993 until 
February 1995 guess what? Interest charges had increased $10 
billion. Here we have this government taking $7 billion out of 
social spending, a total reduction in expenses of $10 billion, 
which will impact everyone in Canada, only to pay the extra 
interest on the money that they have had to borrow in the same 
period of time. It is called treading water.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	At the moment under the government we are giving away our 
sovereignty. He who pays the piper calls the tune. Right now we 
are turning that tune over to foreign investors who are coming in 
and in their own wisdom are continuing to fund the expenditure 
binge of the government.
<P>
	The government is taking Canadians $110 million further into 
debt every single day. That is $1,800 per second. We are further 
and further into debt. We are destroying our ability to sustain 
health care and pensions.
<P>
	I decry the government's lack of leadership and its offloading 
on to provinces. It fails to realize that there really is only one 
taxpayer.
<P>
	I also draw to the attention of the House and to Canadians the 
fact that it is bringing pressure and through that pressure are 
bringing interesting ways to be able to push legislation through 
the House.
<P>
	I call on Canadians to make the government accountable. Do 
not give it the free ride it is getting at the moment. Make it 
accountable in its constituencies by phone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13304"> 13304 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, in bringing forward Bill C-76 the government shows 
a lack of integrity, because there is no mandate for it to bring 
forward Bill C-76. As a consequence, I will be voting against 
Bill C-76.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate.
<P>
	This is not an easy budget and it certainly has been the subject 
of a great deal of discussion. It does signal some fairly 
significant changes in the way government in this country 
carries out its business and its service to Canadians. 
Nonetheless, notwithstanding what the member who just spoke 
had to say, I think we realized very well when we ran for election 
in 1993 and when we made certain commitments to Canadians as 
part of that election that this country was facing a difficult 
economic situation.
<P>
	Certainly a good part of the commitment we made to 
Canadians was a commitment to deal with that very difficult 
economic and fiscal situation. This budget is stage two of doing 
that and of continuing our two prime commitments to the 
country: one, jobs and economic growth to provide a more 
prosperous future for all of us and for those who come after us; 
and as part of that, deficit reduction to a target of 3 per cent of 
GDP by 1997, half of what it was when we took office.
<P>
	It is really important to remember that without achieving that 
target many of the other things that we want to do as a 
government and that I believe Canadians want to do as a nation 
will not be achievable.
<P>
	Let me speak of a couple of things in particular on which I 
have been receiving a great deal of feedback from constituents 
and from others. One thing is the Canadian health and social 
transfer, which is certainly a cause for significant concern. It is 
one of those major changes I talked about in how we carry out 
our responsibilities as a government in this country. I do not 
think it helps to pretend that it is not a significant change when it 
is. However, it was a necessary change in order for the federal 
government to maintain some influence and some impact over 
health and social programs and post-secondary education.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	By combining the transfers to the provinces to cover those 
three fields of post-secondary education, health, and social 
services, what we are doing is maintaining the ability with 
smaller amounts of money to have some influence on all three 
areas of expenditure.
<P>
	I think we are also getting rid of some rigidity in the system. 
As one who has worked closely with a number of agencies in my 
community, I am well aware of the frustration that has been 
there with the stringent requirements of existing social 
programs and the existing Canada Assistance Plan Act, which 
prevents really innovative and often preventive programs from 
being funded under the current act and under the current transfer 
programs. As a former municipal councillor, I  well remember 
the frustration of some very good programs not being eligible 
for federal funding.
<P>
	The combined transfer allows the provinces to be more 
innovative. I expect and hope to address prevention in the 
delivery of all three of those programs. It also signals very 
clearly that those three programs are very much linked. 
Education is very much a part of solving some of the social 
problems this country has. Health is very much a part of solving 
both educational and social problems that we have.
<P>
	I would like to provide some information that will make that 
point very clear. Let us look at the poor children in our country. 
It is a shame for a country with the wealth that Canada has to 
have well over a million children living in poverty. A poor child 
is four times as likely to become seriously ill, die, or even 
commit suicide. Poverty has a direct impact on our health 
services and of course on the quality of life for those families 
living in poverty. A poor child is only one-quarter as likely to go 
to university as the average Canadian child.
<P>
	I learned a long time ago that these issues are not separate 
from each other. There is not much point in treating an elderly 
woman for bronchitis and then sending her back to a damp 
basement apartment because she cannot afford adequate housing 
and does not have enough money in her purse to feed herself 
properly. She will soon be back, if not with bronchitis then with 
something more serious, unless the whole problem of her social 
environment and the amount of money she has to live on is dealt 
with.
<P>
	With the combining of these payments I certainly hope that 
the provinces will start recognizing the link between these three 
fields of public policy and public spending and start to set the 
priorities so that we are dealing in preventive ways. We are 
concerned about the extra cost of our health care system. Yet I 
believe that unless we deal with the social problems, in 
particular the issue of poverty, which tends to contribute to ill 
health, then we are never going to solve the problems of an ever 
growing cost of health care.
<P>
	People are concerned about national standards and so am I. 
Very clearly we are setting the residency principle that no matter 
where you live in Canada, people cannot be required to be a 
resident of a province to be eligible for social assistance.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	There are two other principles, which are not incorporated in 
the legislation and which I am concerned about and have heard 
concerns about. It is all the more important to recognize that the 
combining of payments to the provinces is a way of keeping 
some clout in all three fields as our share of those expenses 
diminishes. That has been happening under the existing 
agreement and will continue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13305"> 13305 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope we will endeavour to negotiate as national principles 
with the provinces that need be the basis of 
establishment-anybody in need would be eligible for 
assistance-and that there be an appeal process to the social 
welfare system.
<P>
	Another issue of great concern to my constituents is the 
significant and dramatic changes we are making in the public 
service.
<P>
	We have taken a thorough look at what government does, and 
in virtually every area of government activity we are looking for 
better and more efficient ways to serve Canadians at less cost. 
The result of that over the next three years is going to be a 
substantial reduction in the number of people working for the 
public service.
<P>
	There are measures in the bill that will make it easier for those 
affected by the downsizing to get on with their lives in a number 
of ways. We expect a vast majority of people will take advantage 
of the early retirement incentive, which has already been passed 
in regulations. It will enable them to leave the public service on 
full pension and remain in their communities as contributing 
members.
<P>
	The second measure in the legislation is the early departure 
incentive, which will allow people to voluntarily leave the 
public service and get on with other opportunities or another 
job.
<P>
	I compliment the President of the Treasury Board for showing 
some flexibility on how the downsizing is being managed and 
for doing what appears to have been resisted a few months ago: 
allowing people who are interested in leaving the public service 
to vacate their jobs and make room for somebody else who does 
not want to leave at this time.
<P>
	As long as we are spending one third of the taxes we collect 
from Canadians just to pay interest on the debt, there will 
continue to be pressure on our social programs, pressure on the 
services government can deliver. It is extremely important 
therefore that the primary direction of the budget is to reduce the 
deficit, reduce the amount we are wasting on interest. I regard it 
as a waste because it accomplishes nothing for us. Yet the 
amount continues to spiral every year and will continue to eat 
away at everything we want to accomplish as a government and 
as a nation.
<P>
	I encourage the finance minister to continue with greater tax 
fairness, as he has done in the budget. I encourage him to look at 
every way possible of reducing the foreign debt, because it is 
money going out of our economy and not being taxed in Canada
<P>
	There are things that many of us do not want to see in the 
budget, but I believe that fundamentally it is heading in the right 
direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to ask some 
questions today and to make a comment or two.
<P>
	I listened thoughtfully to the member's comments regarding 
Bill C-76, the matter before us today for third reading. I found 
her remarks quite interesting.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	I do have a couple of questions I would like to ask. The first 
question relates to the farm subsidies that are important to the 
people in my constituency. The second question relates to the 
health transfer. These are matters I addressed yesterday at report 
stage.
<P>
	I am quite concerned about the long term implications on the 
prairie economy, particularly on those communities that are 
affected by the elimination of the Crow benefit as a result of this 
legislation. It has been estimated that each delivery point on the 
prairies served by the Western Grain Transportation Act will 
lose approximately $1 million annually as a result of this 
legislation.
<P>
	Within my constituency are some 40 to 45 elevator points that 
could be classified in this category. This means that the farm 
communities in my constituency will lose $40 million to $45 
million a year in funds that are currently in those communities. 
For example, $1 million every year out of the town of Glaslyn is 
quite significant.
<P>
	This is the first question I want to put to the hon. member 
opposite. In any of her discussions with her colleagues, whether 
they be members of the cabinet or just members of her caucus 
about support for this bill or in any of the research she has done, 
has she seen or investigated any reviews that look at the 
implication of the removal of the subsidy on the farm 
communities of western Canada?
<P>
	This money is supposed to be replaced by investments for 
value added production. I wonder if she knows of any study that 
has been done of where the investment capital is coming from to 
support the value added production on the prairies?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time for questions 
and comments should you wish an answer is nearing an end. 
Would you please give the member time to respond if you wish 
her response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate your intervention. 
Although I have other questions for the member, perhaps if I 
could have an answer for those two, it will satisfy me for the 
time being.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not represent an 
agricultural community although the preservation of the 
agri-food industry and the preservation of strong agricultural 
production in this community is of great concern to me and to 
my constituents.

	I am not an expert, as the member well knows, although I 
understand his need to make these statements and ask these 
questions in the House. He knows this is not an area of expertise 
for me and it would be unfair of me to even try to provide an 
answer to the kinds of questions he has asked.
<P>
	I am sure the minister would be more than happy to share with 
him any reviews that have been done to provide whatever level 
of briefing he would like to have provided to him and to answer 
any questions he has.
<P>
	I am quite surprised he is asking these questions in the House 
of somebody he knows does not have expertise in that field 
instead of already having sought those answers from the 
minister. After all he has had over two months to follow up. I 
would encourage him to do that since I know the minister would 
be most happy to co-operate in providing him with any 
documentation and any explanations he needs for his 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, could you 
clarify for me how much time was used on questions and 
comments?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> A little over five 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, with 
pleasure I rise to debate third reading of Bill C-76. As you know, 
I am a member of the finance committee and have been 
inextricably intertwined with the development of this bill for the 
last nine months.
<P>
	Nine months ago the Minister of Finance came to the 
committee and directed its members to begin the first ever 
prebudget consultations. This was the first time the finance 
committee went out in advance of the preparation of the budget 
to talk with Canadians about their will, their concerns, their 
interests in the preparation of what is possibly the most 
important aspect of the legislative year.
<P>
	During the debate committee members talked with over 600 
members of the Canadian public about the budget. Despite what 
the member for Kootenay East said in his reference to time 
allocation, I can say unequivocally that this budget has probably 
had more discussion, more debate, more consultation than any 
budget to date in the history of the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	When we talked with our fellow citizens it was clear and 
interesting the level of consensus that we were able to build. The 
message from the Canadian public, from region to region, was 
very similar. In effect, they agreed that the government must 
take responsibility, that the deficit must be reduced and the debt 
managed. There was agreement to that. There was agreement by 
and large that the method of reduction should focus on 
expenditures as opposed to revenue or tax measures.
<P>
	The people of Canada said to the committee, as members of 
government and members of Parliament, to take a message back 
to the minister that said start with government and then move to 
program reduction, but please start with government, get your 
own House in order. That made sense to us.
<P>
	It was in December when the committee reported to the 
Minister of Finance. Then as an individual member of 
Parliament I went to my riding of Brant and had lengthy 
discussions with the constituents there. I had public forums and 
individual groups of Canadians actually took it upon themselves 
to think about the issue of budgetary management and fiscal 
responsibility. I congratulate them for the time they spent in 
preparing briefs that were subsequently presented to the finance 
minister.
<P>
	After that we waited. The budget was presented in February 
and in the interim we know what the international community 
was like. Things were upset financially. The international 
community challenged us to make sure that a tough budget was 
brought in. We watched with trepidation, with worry but 
knowing all the time that the minister would respond directly to 
the information he received from the committee and from those 
of us who as members of Parliament provided him with our 
points of view and the points of view of our constituents.
<P>
	In February the minister did proffer a budget that responded to 
the needs of Canadians. He clearly indicated a direction so that 
we will move to a deficit of GDP ratio of 3 per cent as we 
promised in our election platform and in the red book. He has 
listened to Canadians because the deficit is being reduced 
primarily through expenditure reductions versus revenue 
measures in a ratio of seven to one.
<P>
	Finally he responded to the issue of getting government right, 
saying that cuts will be made in government first and then move 
to programs. When this is looked at we find a new structure has 
been created for the federal government. We are embarking on a 
change in the role of the federal government.
<P>
	As the system of legislative review progressed the finance 
committee took the budget bill into committee and continued its 
deliberations and its open consultations with the people of 
Canada and talked further about the details as they had been laid 
out in Bill C-76. It was interesting that the focus of the debate in 
committee shifted. People feel that the government has taken 
fiscally responsible initiatives.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The nervousness in the public marketplace has quieted and we 
are now looking at the thing which we call new government 
structure. We spent a lot of time talking about the structural 
changes, because they are different.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13307"> 13307 </A></B>
<P>
	I have to make the analogy that we have given birth to 
something which is quite new. It is significantly different from 
what the people of Canada have seen in the past. Government 
has been restructured. Many departments have been downsized. 
There will be a physical downsizing of staff to the tune of 45,000 
individuals. Longstanding Canadian assets, CN for one, will be 
privatized. Finally, but not exclusively, the way that some 
transfers to the provincial governments are made will be 
changed.
<P>
	We have something which is distinctly new and something 
which is very different. Our job now as a government is to 
recognize that we have created a fiscal framework which is 
fiscally responsible and under which we as a Liberal 
government must continue. We must develop our baby in a very 
Liberal way.
<P>
	We looked at the strategies which the government has 
planned. The Minister of Human Resources Development will 
be presenting a new strategy for unemployment insurance in 
September. The government is undertaking and will over the 
next year begin discussions on pension review, looking at the 
CPP and all the bits and pieces that go into providing a safe and 
secure retirement for Canadian citizens.
<P>
	The new block transfer to the provinces has to be looked at 
very carefully. It is quite a different transfer than in the past. It is 
a block transfer. It contains the same standards of requirement 
for health care, but it addresses education and social assistance 
as well. We have to be very careful with that transfer because it 
does talk to our future as a country.
<P>
	I was fascinated by the witnesses as they came before the 
committee and encouraged us to maintain national standards, a 
federal presence in the continuing development of those 
programs, while recognizing the need for flexibility and control 
in the provinces. With that transfer we have provided an 
opportunity to do just that.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development will be 
working very closely with the provinces to build a mutual 
consent on the development of new principles and guidelines. 
That speaks volumes about a new structure, a new role for the 
federal government, and its responsibility to facilitate 
discussions among the provinces to find the best possible 
strategies to provide health care, solid post-secondary 
education and social assistance. It gives the government a new 
opportunity at the federal level to use different strategies and 
not just the control of cash, which continues to be very 
important.
<P>
	In the report to Parliament at report stage the finance 
committee indicated that it would prefer that the Canada health 
and social transfer continue as part of the federal responsibility 
over the next number of years. However the government must 
facilitate discussion. It must consider using new technologies 
and new techniques, perhaps like a social audit, comparing 
provincial  successes in these different areas. That is the job 
which we as parliamentarians take.
<P>
	One of the critical situations which will occur is the loss of 
45,000 public servants. I recognize that our public service is the 
best public service in the world. As did my hon. friend from 
Ottawa West, I would like to mention that the President of the 
Treasury Board did respond to the very good submissions made 
by the public service unions and has put together a labour and 
management committees to ensure that the downsizing is done 
in a humane, fair and equitable manner.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	These kinds of activities speak volumes to the kind of 
government we are. It will be important for us as a government 
to now work within a new fiscal framework, to continue the 
Liberal tradition of providing fairness, equity, compassion and 
understanding so that we continue to be the best country in the 
world in which to live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my comment relates to my earlier intervention. I 
did ask the member who spoke just prior to this member some 
questions about the farm economy. The bill in fact addresses the 
farm economy quite significantly. Whether or not members of 
this House are from farm constituencies, they have an obligation 
to understand the implications of legislation on all Canadians 
regardless of where they live.
<P>
	I would have thought that a bill that has such substantial 
impact on rural Canada would be something that all members of 
the Chamber would be able to address. It seems to me that we as 
MPs have an obligation to Canadians as well as our own 
constituents.
<P>
	The member indicates she is a member of the finance 
committee. Is she aware of any studies relating to the long term 
implications of this legislation on rural communities? 
Specifically where will the investment to replace the lost 
income come from to ensure that these communities are able to 
continue to exist?
<P>
	Keeping in mind what I said earlier, in my constituency alone 
income that presently exists, up to some $40 million a year will 
be lost as a result of this bill, all from rural communities. A 
considerable investment will have to be made in order to make 
that up.
<P>
	My other question deals with the health care part of the bill. 
The member will recall that earlier this week the Canadian 
Hospital Association expressed what it said amounts to a call to 
arms against the plans in this bill for health care. Essentially the 
Canadian Hospital Association president said that the 
reluctance of the federal government to match its moral 
commitment with a financial commitment is inexplicable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13308"> 13308 </A></B>
<P>
	Can the member of the finance committee explain what has 
happened to the federal government's fiscal commitment to 
health care?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Madam Speaker, the member spoke 
directly to the comments I made earlier. The point I was making 
is that this budget creates a whole different structure for the 
federal government in terms of what it looks like and the role it 
plays.
<P>
	When we look at the implications for agriculture particularly, 
I represent a combined rural and urban community. I am very 
sensitive to the needs of rural Canada. I can tell the hon. member 
without a doubt that the rural members in our caucus have talked 
long and hard about the implications here as we have done with 
health care, with education, with downsizing, with all the 
structural changes that are occurring as a result of this budget.
<P>
	The minister who is responsible for agriculture and agri-food 
is from Saskatchewan. Rest assured that the issues facing rural 
people are front and foremost in our caucus, in our cabinet. We 
do recognize that we have to watch the implications of this 
budget in the long term and plan to ensure a strong and healthy 
future for rural Canada.
<P>
	When we talk about the health issues, the government is fully 
and totally committed to the five pillars that currently exist 
under the Canada Health Act. That has not changed and will not 
change. It is a hallmark of our government to maintain full and 
solid health care for Canadian citizens.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, to 
speak on this bill to implement the budget is a challenging task, 
as it forces us to put in plain words the sweeping changes 
proposed in this budget, changes which will affect provinces 
with the largest percentage of underprivileged people more than 
the others, and Quebec in particular.
<P>
	The federal government announced its intention to bring 
about deep structural changes in Canada and that is what it is 
doing with this budget, without any debate except for this 
budget debate. This budget is choking the provinces which are 
the worst off by reducing transfers dramatically. At the same 
time, the central government keeps making surpluses on the UI 
fund. Now, the government wants to retain the ability to impose 
on all the provinces common direction and principles.
<P>
	I will start with this latter aspect. First of all, let me remind 
you that, as soon as this bill was introduced, the Bloc Quebecois 
denounced the excessive powers the federal government is 
giving itself with this bill, presumably to implement as required 
national standards to other social programs.
<P>
	Since social programs are later described, in clause 53, as 
including programs in respect of health, post-secondary 
education, social assistance and social services, it is obvious 
that the government intends to use transfer payments to impose 
standards regarding other social programs as required.
<P>
	Our interpretation was endorsed by many. But when the 
Official Opposition held an opposition day on the budget and 
Bill C-76, the Minister of Finance furiously criticized this 
interpretation. Strangely enough, to be able to criticize us for 
our misinterpretation, the Minister of Finance himself had to put 
forward amendments to his own bill. That is right, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Himself?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Himself. We, in the Official Opposition, have 
not been sitting in this place for very long, but from what we are 
told, it is quite unusual for a finance minister to put forward, just 
to prove his point, amendments to his own legislation, 
amendments which in this case were submitted in writing only 
weeks later.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance takes the trouble to prepare 
amendments well in advance, you figure that this time, he is 
going to try and fine-tune the bill and incorporate what he says 
into the act. So, what did he say?
<P>
	He said: ``We want to give flexibility to the provinces.'' 
Great! Now, what does his own amendment to his bill say? 
Basically, it says the following. Perhaps it comes as a surprise to 
the finance minister that the Official Opposition can read bills.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Clause 13 essentially says this: Subject to this Part, a Canada 
Health and Social Transfer may be provided to a province [-]for 
the purposes of: (<I>a</I>) establishing interim arrangements to finance 
social programs [-].It has been said that the provinces should 
enjoy greater flexibility. (<I>b</I>) maintaining the criteria and conditions 
in the Canada Health Act [-]; (<I>c</I>) maintaining the national 
standard, set out in section 19 [-]; (<I>d</I>) promoting any shared 
principles and objectives that are developed, pursuant to subsection 
(3), with respect to the operation of social programs [-].
<P>
	Again, what are these social programs? They are those we 
identified earlier: post-secondary education, social services and 
welfare. This clause can only be read as follows: ``A Canada 
Health and Social Transfer may be provided for the purposes 
of'', among other things, ``promoting any shared principles and 
objectives that are developed, pursuant to subsection (3)''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13309"> 13309 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will use the transfers to promote these 
principles. Ah! Whenever the central government uses its 
transfers to promote something, there is cause for concern. As 
the old saying goes, ``Old habits die hard''.
<P>
	What does subsection (3) say? It says this: ``The Minister of 
Human Resources Development shall invite representatives of 
all the provinces to consult and work together to develop, 
through mutual consent,''-not unanimous consent but mutual 
consent-``a set of shared principles and objectives''-for the 
social programs being referred to, namely post-secondary 
education, social services and welfare-``that could underlie the 
Canada Health and Social Transfer''.
<P>
	The only good news is that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development would invite representatives of the provinces. Yet, 
since the minister was elected, he has not seen fit to invite the 
provincial employment and human resources ministers. It says 
that he would invite them, but it does not say when.
<P>
	That clause, with its various paragraphs and sub-paragraphs, 
can only be interpreted as reflecting the federal government's 
intention to use transfers to promote principles which are not 
unanimously approved-thus leaving the possibility that 
Quebec, and perhaps other provinces, might not agree-, but 
which are common principles. The idea is to use transfers to 
promote common principles.
<P>
	Considering how careful the Minister of Finance was before 
submitting his amendments, it is clear that the government 
intends to meddle even more in provincial matters. The goal is 
crystal clear: to ask the provinces to follow common principles 
and objectives regarding post-secondary education, social 
services and social assistance.
<P>
	However, the provinces are fed up with the cuts announced. 
What are these cuts? I will repeat them, but I will use a different 
perspective. We were told on numerous occasions that these cuts 
would total $7 billion but, in fact, it is more than that and those 
who are listening to us realize that.
<P>
	When someone's salary is reduced-for example, if a person 
earning $450 a week is told by the employer that he or she must 
accept a $150 cut per week so that the company will 
survive-that person knows that the cut is either temporary, 
which means that he or she will lose $150 multiplied by the 
number of applicable weeks, or permanent, which means that he 
or she will lose $150 every week.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	However, when the provinces are faced with a $4.5 billion cut 
one year, followed by a $2.5 billion the next, the total is not just 
$7 billion. From 1994-95 to the end of 1997-98, the provinces 
will have been deprived of $12.3 billion. This means that the 
cuts which they, in turn, have to make are not temporary ones. 
They have to be structural cuts, since they do not even know 
what to expect next.
<P>
	Quebec is particularly affected. It will lose at least 27 per cent 
of those $12.3 billion. This is an enormous amount, given that, 
from what we hear, the reform announced in Montreal, which 
raises so many concerns, will result in savings of only $180 
million. I say only, because that is the sad truth. So when we hear 
members singing the praises of renewed federalism, I think they 
have a lot of nerve-and I hope ``culot'' is not 
unparliamentary-because the truth of the matter is that these 
changes will bring about major disruptions in the services that 
people receive. And thanks to federalism, these disruptions will 
be blamed on the provinces.
<P>
	The provinces will have to cut spending, and the public will 
suffer the consequences this will have for health care, education, 
social services and welfare. National standards for health care 
will be maintained but the provinces will have to cut back 
drastically, perhaps not so much on health care but on education, 
welfare and social services.
<P>
	The government announces reforms but makes these cuts 
without considering the consequences, because it wants to 
cultivate this image of a responsible government, and so it 
transfers the problems to the provinces and the private citizens. 
Meanwhile, and this is not in Bill C-76, it is in the budget but is 
not mentioned because it has separate legislation and the 
government is not going to meddle with unemployment 
insurance just now, the government is letting the Unemployment 
Insurance Fund run a surplus. Five billion dollars this year 
alone. Five billion dollars next year.
<P>
	Soon there will be another recession, and people are 
predicting one, although we are right in the middle of a 
so-called upturn, but it is not a good time for everyone. It is not 
a good time for a lot of people, and now they are predicting 
another recession. When? Who knows? In a few months, in a 
year or two years, but the fact remains that the provinces, which 
have seen their welfare rolls increase even now, during this 
economic upturn, and it was like that this month in Quebec, the 
provinces will be stuck with dealing with an increasing number 
of people on welfare and the accompanying increase in social 
needs, while the federal government has this fund, so that it will 
not only be able to maintain unemployment insurance benefits 
but will also be in a position to lend a helping hand to the 
provinces while intruding on their jurisdictions. It will no longer 
have to set certain criteria for programs. It will make the 
decisions itself. The government itself will intrude into fields 
that are not its own.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Yes, Mr. Speaker, we are changing Canada. Much more surely 
than if we amended the Constitution, but not in terms of 
flexibility. No. The only flexibility in this is the flexibility to 
cut. Some flexibility. All the rest gives the central authority-as 
in Bill C-76 and other legislation-the central government 
powerful means to change the structure of Canada by making 
Ottawa even  more the brains and operational centre of Canada, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13310"> 13310 </A></B>
<P>
to the point where the provinces will soon hardly even be 
regional structures, they will be branches of Ottawa.
<P>
	Quebecers are a distinct people and form a distinct society. 
They have repeatedly tried to make a place for themselves in this 
country. Their demands were modest. Inadequate would be a 
better word than modest in terms of what Robert Bourassa asked 
for at Meech Lake. Quebec kept getting ``no'' for an answer. 
Now, reforms are being made, but not the reforms Quebec 
wanted. These reforms are in completely the opposite direction 
and they are leaving Quebec much worse off.
<P>
	Quebecers now know that their only hope lies in solidarity, in 
combining their tax dollars so they can plan, be prepared and 
invest where they want rather than have the course of the 
province's development imposed by a central government, 
which cuts where it feels like it and collects money where it 
feels like it.
<P>
	Those of us on the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development heard repeated calls for strong national standards 
across Canada, except in Quebec. We have nothing against 
generous social services for everyone, quite the opposite, but we 
want to establish our own standards, because peoples and 
nations organize themselves, run their economy and do business 
according to their own priorities and objectives.
<P>
	Under existing conditions, Quebecers have no choice, if they 
want a future, but to gather up their money and their means and 
make their own laws and treaties.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have an opportunity at third 
reading to discuss the federal budget and specifically the 
implementation legislation that we have before the House today.
<P>
	There is no question in my mind that I fully support this 
budget. I fully support Bill C-76, the implementation bill that 
will bring it about. I believe that the actions the Minister of 
Finance has taken and the actions this government has taken are 
appropriate and necessary.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	I understand that not everybody in Canada is happy with 
everything in the budget. However, the important thing is that 
most Canadians, although there are things in the budget they 
might not like, realize that the action that was taken was 
necessary, given the fiscal situation the country found itself in.
<P>
	The average Canadian out there understands what members of 
the opposition do not understand. That is, if we are to have the 
government act responsibly and if the government is to cut back 
expenditures, then there will be an impact on individuals. 
Canadians understand that and know that is to happen. Because 
they realize the necessity of it, this budget has widespread 
support in the country.
<P>
	This is a good budget because in it government recognizes 
that it has two basic responsibilities and that both 
responsibilities have to be fulfilled if the country is to operate 
efficiently and with a social conscience. Those two 
responsibilities, quite simply put, are fiscal responsibility and 
social responsibility.
<P>
	We have a fiscal responsibility. We have a responsibility as a 
government to operate in a prudent manner. We need to be 
businesslike but remember that we are not a business. We must 
ensure that each Canadian taxpayer receives full value for each 
dollar that is spent.
<P>
	However, in addition to this fiscal responsibility, the 
government understands and Canadians understand that 
government also has a social responsibility. We do things not to 
earn a profit from doing them but because they are the right 
things to do. We fund medicare as a federal government not 
because we can make money at it but because it is appropriate to 
provide Canadians with medical care. We have an old age 
security system not to make a profit on it but because we 
believe, as Canadians, that it is appropriate that we collectively 
provide for the security of those in our society who have reached 
65.
<P>
	It is important for us to understand that government has this 
social responsibility in addition to this fiscal responsibility. It is 
also important for Canadians to understand, which I believe they 
do, although I do not think the opposition understands, that we 
cannot have one of these responsibilities without the other.
<P>
	Before I came to the House I had a job in the private sector. I 
had the opportunity to work with people who were in financial 
difficulties. In a large sense what we face as individuals in our 
family budget is not a whole lot different from what the country 
faces today. The options on how to deal with it are frankly not a 
whole lot different. I have had individuals who have come to me 
in financial difficulty. Perhaps they bought a house that was 
larger than they should have and their mortgage was bigger than 
it should be. Perhaps they bought a larger car or a second car and 
went into debt more than would have been prudent. Perhaps they 
ran up their credit cards on things that maybe they should not 
have bought. At the end of the day they find themselves 
overcommitted financially, much like Canada today finds itself 
overcommitted financially.
<P>
	There are a number of options you can take as a financier, just as 
there are a number of options the government can take. You can be, 
as some members in the Bloc have suggested, like the bank and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13311"> 13311 </A></B>
<P>
say: ``Oh, you are in difficulty. You are having difficulty with 
your finances. I will tell you what I will do, I will just increase 
your credit card limit by another $5,000 so that you can go out 
there and maintain the level of expenditures you have always 
had.'' This might work for a month or two, but it is not going to 
work in the long term and it is not the fiscally responsible and 
for that matter the socially  responsible thing to do, either as a 
government or as the individual banker who might be dealing 
with that client.
<P>
	Or you can take a different approach, the approach the Reform 
Party has often talked about in the House in terms of how to 
handle an overcommitted debt situation. We can say to a person: 
``You are going to absolutely stop spending now. We will go 
down your budget and hack out. It does not matter whether you 
are going to have enough money to feed your family or to keep at 
least one car on the road so you can get to work, or whether you 
will be able to buy clothes or pay for your kids' education. No. 
The only thing we are going to think about is that you are 
overcommitted financially. We will cut that all out right now 
and at least balance your budget. You might starve and you 
might not have any shelter, but by Jiminy Cricket, we will have 
your financial situation in order''.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	That is what the Reform Party suggested in its counterbudget. 
It said we should slash everything and get it all down into a nice 
neat package in three years. It just does not work that way, just 
as it would not work for the bank client to simply cut everything 
at once.
<P>
	There is an appropriate middle course to take. It is one we 
would take as individuals and one we have taken as a 
government. It is simple. We would come to an understanding 
that we have spent too much, that we are overcommitted 
financially and that we do need to put our house in order, but we 
must do it in a responsible way. In the case of an individual the 
debt would probably be consolidated and the payments spread 
over a number of years so the payments could be made according 
to the level of income. In time the problem would be resolved.
<P>
	A fiscal regime is not imposed that is impossible to live with. 
The federal government has taken this approach. It is 
understood that our expenditures were too high. It is understood 
that we were spending too much money. It is making the 
adjustments in a gradual, prudent, responsible way that 
Canadians can afford.
<P>
	This is the essence of the budget. It is what makes the budget 
work. It is why the budget is accepted across the country. 
Canadians instinctively understand that we have taken an 
approach they would have taken in dealing with their own 
family budgets.
<P>
	I want to compliment the minister and the government for 
having seen clear to take this approach. We will move ahead in 
the next fiscal year and the following fiscal years. We will 
improve our financial situation and improve Canada's fiscal 
situation year after year. We will do it in a manner that 
understands our social responsibility and which maintains the 
social safety net for Canadians. It will maintain the Canada we 
have built over the last 50 years, a Canada we are proud of and a 
Canada which the Liberal government is committed to protect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to compliment the member opposite on his 
speech, particularly since during his speech he referred to the 
Reform Party as the official opposition, which is what really has 
been happening in the House.
<P>
	The member went into detail on his private life, particularly 
in terms of private individuals who are overly committed 
financially and how he would fix their situation. I find it rather 
ironic that if the federal government were in the same position 
as any business or individual, it would have been bankrupt a 
long, long time ago.
<P>
	At a time when the provinces are balancing their budgets, one 
after the other all the way down the road, the member seems to 
think that the federal government is somehow different, that it 
does not have to balance its budget. It is off somewhere after a 
future election, off into the sunset somewhere, which is very 
much the old style promises of the old style politics.
<P>
	Why does the member think that the federal government is 
different from the provinces which are balancing their budgets 
one after the other all the way down the line?
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Madam Speaker, if I referred to the Reform 
Party as the official opposition, I certainly apologize for that. I 
certainly did not mean to provide that party with a status it does 
not have and never will.
<P>
	No one is suggesting that the federal government does not 
need to balance its books. It needs to eliminate its deficit and in 
time bring its debt down. Similarly, as individuals if we were 
overcommitted at some point in time we would want to bring our 
individual debt down and to spend only what we were bringing 
in in a given year. The Reform Party is suggesting that we do this 
at a pace and in a manner which totally ignores the needs of 
individual Canadians.
<P>
	I can go to any budget for a business, an individual, a 
government or a province and I can look at certain lines, rip 
them out and come to a balanced budget. That is easy. It is 
simple. However, we have to remember that behind each line on 
the budget, behind each stroke of the pen, there will be an impact 
on people. We have to remember the impact it will have on 
people and not simply do a number punching exercise.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13312"> 13312 </A></B>
<P>
	The same thing holds true for the government as holds true in 
our personal lives. We have to be responsible, we have to be 
prudent and we have to remember the consequences of our 
actions. The government will balance its budget. It will bring its 
financial house in order, but it will do it in a responsible manner 
which will recognize the needs of individual Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member began his comments today by 
saying that the budget measures were necessary. I wonder if he 
could clarify that.
<P>
	This move today takes approximately $1 million per elevator 
point away from communities in western Canada. The budget 
bill essentially withdraws about $400 million worth of federal 
commitment from the province of Saskatchewan alone with no 
plans in place to manage what is left behind. Can the member 
tell us today how it is possible that he thinks it is necessary?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Madam Speaker, it is very important that we 
remember that all Canadians, all parts of our society are going to 
share in it. Have there been reductions in Saskatchewan? Surely 
there have been, as there have been across the country. 
Everybody has to pitch into this equally everywhere. Provinces, 
individuals, businesses, agriculture and industry, we all have to 
work together on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka. As a 
fellow member in the northern Ontario caucus under his 
chairmanship I know he is an excellent member of Parliament 
for his riding. In his short but effective speech over the last few 
minutes we have seen a side of the member which is not 
surprising but is very inspirational. I would like to tell the 
member publicly that his comments were right on the mark. He 
said many very important and true things.
<P>
	I will reiterate something which the hon. member said, and I 
may be paraphrasing him. We have our Reform colleagues and 
thankfully they are not the official opposition. His apology 
should have been to Canadians, not to the Reform Party. The 
Reform Party is constantly calling upon us to run Canada like a 
business, like a bank or like a large corporation. It is one thing to 
run a country in a businesslike fashion; it is another matter to 
run a country like a business.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	The member for Parry Sound-Muskoka hit it right on the 
head when he said that a government is first about people. In 
February the Minister of Finance presented a budget that was 
about people, about Canadians. While wanting to preserve those 
things in our society that make Canada a special place, he also 
presented things that deal with the concerns Canadians have that 
we respond effectively to our deficit.
<P>
	We know that each year our national debt is growing. We have 
made a commitment as a government to deal with the growth in 
the debt. We made a commitment as a party competing with 
others to govern this country back in the fall 1993 election to get 
the annual deficit down to 3 per cent of the GDP. If we listen to 
the Minister of Finance carefully and analyse the kinds of 
results that are available, we will meet our 3 per cent target and 
quite possibly do better than that.
<P>
	As my colleague said in his speech, the government is first 
about people. It is not just a business. Along with several other 
members of this House, I am a member of the finance 
committee. I had the opportunity to hear and read hundreds of 
witnesses and their presentations last fall as the finance 
committee undertook the prebudget consultations and prepared 
its report for the minister as part of the overall guidance he was 
seeking in preparing for the budget.
<P>
	With very few exceptions, the witnesses we heard did not call 
for massive slashing of programs. They did not call for 
draconian measures that would turn back the clock and bring us 
back to the middle ages. Consistently we were told to deal with 
the deficit, not to raise personal income taxes and not to forget 
the importance of this country's social infrastructure. The 
infrastructure ensures that all Canadians have a fair stake in the 
future.
<P>
	The natural resources of the country belong equally to all. We 
expect mining companies to find minerals and metals and to 
extract those resources. In so doing they pay a share to the 
community at large to the provincial treasuries and to the federal 
treasury. We expect forest companies to harvest our forests. At 
the same time we expect them to give something back in terms 
of stumpage fees and taxes because all Canadians own those 
trees. All Canadians can benefit from our resources.
<P>
	This is why a Liberal government has proven to be the most 
effective in doing this over the decades. Liberal governments 
have consistently been able to find the way to balance the needs 
of industry and business to be profitable. That is important for 
job creation.
<P>
	On balance with that there is the need to ensure that all 
Canadians have equal access to the benefits of the country. We 
can hardly blame Parliament or finance ministers for doing great 
damage to the country when we have the best country in the 
world.
<P>
	Even though we can criticize past governments for mistakes, 
the Canadian attitude which is one of balance, taking care of 
those who have and those who have not in a fair and balanced 
way is the kind of country the world admires. That is why 
Canada is in its way so much of a leader. Other countries look to 
us for examples. As I mentioned, in the prebudget consultations 
last fall we heard a call for balance, deal with the deficit, do not 
raise personal taxes and make sure that everybody is treated 
fairly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13313"> 13313 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not think any of us can say that as a country we do this 
perfectly. Sadly, the rate of illiteracy is still too high. The rate of 
poverty particularly among children is still far too high. We still 
have household and family violence. We still have crime.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	All we can do is work together to do better and to improve our 
communities and the quality of life. Liberal governments have 
consistently been able to find the way to do that. The budget as 
represented in Bill C-76 takes us a long way down that road.
<P>
	I pick out one example of the kind of leadership Canadians 
have come to expect and can continue to expect from this 
government. I pick out an issue that became a hot issue in the 
lead up to the budget, the possibility there would be taxation of 
employer paid health benefits. Those are the benefits provided 
to those in the workplace for drugs and dental care, paid fully or 
partially by the employer.
<P>
	There was a notion that perhaps the government was thinking 
about taxing these employer paid benefits. Many people spoke 
out against this. I received numerous cards and letters from 
constituents. The minister heard from the finance committee in 
its report that at this time no such measures should take place.
<P>
	The finance committee suggested what had to be in the mind 
of the minister, because it makes sense. That is, the current 
system is unfair to the working poor, who must pay for their 
health benefits out of after tax income. We called on the 
industry, the insurance companies, dental providers, and asked 
if they would work together to help us find a way so all 
Canadians can be covered when it comes to drug benefits and 
dental care. I was very impressed, as I am sure my colleagues in 
the committee were impressed, by the very positive response 
from the insurers and from the dental providers that they would 
try to find a way in which all Canadians can be covered in some 
fashion for drugs and dental care. I am not saying we are there 
yet, but I have in the last two weeks seen some very strong 
evidence that this challenge is being responded to in a very 
positive way.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance responded thoughtfully and carefully 
and decided not to move on that. This will give us some time in 
this country to find a way to make sure all Canadians are treated 
fairly when it comes to those particular benefits.
<P>
	There are elements of unfairness on the subject of RRSPs as 
well. The more income you have, the more you can contribute. If 
you are poor, you are not as likely to be able to contribute to an 
RRSP. There tends to be an imbalance toward Canadians with 
higher incomes. Here as well reform is in the wind.
<P>
	The whole issue of aging and pensions needs to be rethought 
in this modern era. The minister has wisely deferred on this 
issue pending further research and consultation.
<P>
	I emphasize to my colleagues in the House, to my 
constituents, and to all Canadians that the public support for Bill 
C-76 and the budget is tremendous. It is a fair and balanced 
approach.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have listened very carefully this morning and this 
afternoon to the arguments presented by my Liberal colleagues 
across the way. I am surprised that they continue to argue we are 
not in a serious situation, that they are somehow being more 
compassionate than we are in what they are doing, that they are 
not seriously addressing the debt and deficit situation.
<P>
	Is balancing the budget not the most compassionate thing we 
could ever do to preserve our social programs? Is it not the fact 
that we must stop borrowing more money, that we must 
immediately come to a situation where we stop increasing the 
interest payments? Are these interest payments not the most 
serious threat to our social programs?
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	If they are the most serious threat, is not the most 
compassionate thing we can do to get our house in order to 
balance the budget as quickly as possible, decide on what is 
important and get there as quickly as possible?
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	I appreciate his suggestion that Liberals are more 
compassionate, although he put it in the form of a question. I 
would like to answer his question with a resounding yes.
<P>
	The member fairly asks if it is not more compassionate to deal 
with the deficit. That is the essence of his question. It is logical 
to deal with the deficit. It is not an issue of compassion. I submit 
that if we were to have taken an approach as proposed by the 
third party, the Reform Party, compassion would have gone out 
the window.
<P>
	When we are undertaking an operation as difficult as putting 
the finances of the country back on track, that is not something 
we can do overnight. It is like moving a huge ship. They have to 
have a number of little tugboats that work diligently to get the 
ship turned around in the harbour.
<P>
	The finance minister recognizes, if the Reform Party does not, 
that you cannot do this overnight. With the draconian measures 
the Reform Party proposed in its own prebudget budget, the 
numbers frankly did not add up. It is something like the Harris 
budget plan for Ontario, for which there is a very indecipherable 
bottom line.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13314"> 13314 </A></B>
<P>
	The issue of compassion must be balanced certainly by logic. 
That logic must lead us to a conclusion that is fair to all 
Canadians. For example, let us just say we are going to have a 
massive tax cut and that would be fair. It is more fair to the rich 
and less fair to the poor. If taxes are slashed 30 per cent, as Mr. 
Harris pretends he will do, then certainly if I were rich, which I 
am not, I would have a greater benefit than a poor person.
<P>
	While the member's question in the context of his own party's 
philosophy might seem fair, I go back to my comments in my 
speech that a country is not a business. While it might need to be 
or should be run in a businesslike fashion, it is not a business. It 
is first about people. There is no way we can close our eyes, turn 
the pages of the budget, and stroke out items with a pen without 
considering their impact on people.
<P>
	This government has taken action. The program review 
undertaken by the ministers of the crown has resulted in 
measures that will be effective. The result is in the reaction of 
Canadians and the reaction of the marketplaces around the world 
to the budget. There has been an extremely positive, balanced, 
and well considered response to this budget. That is the proof 
that the budget has hit the mark.
<P>
	With that I suggest the member go back and look at his own 
prebudget plan. It would be too generous for me to say it was 
compassionate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, today I would like to tell a story, the story of Nibor 
Dooh, a mythological character from history who landed on the 
shores of the great country of Adanac. Adanac was a peaceful, 
prosperous, and tolerant place when he arrived. The people had 
no complaints, other than those that are inevitable in life. Nibor 
Dooh went about the land telling the people of Adanac that their 
lives could be much better than they were. They could be richer, 
more tolerant, and more prosperous. If they followed his scheme 
they would be much better off.
<P>
	The good people of Adanac scratched their heads in 
bewilderment. ``We already work the land'', they said, ``and we 
look after our families and we look after the less fortunate in our 
communities. How can we all do so much better?''
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	``It is very good news'', said Nibor Dooh. ``You all remember 
that awful Xram, who said we have to steal from the rich to give 
to the poor. You were right not to listen to him. Stealing is 
wrong. I can make you all rich without any of that''.
<P>
	The people scratched their heads a bit harder. How could this 
work? ``Well'', said Nibor Dooh, ``it is all a bit complicated. 
First we take from the rich to give to the poor and then the poor 
are rich, or they are richer. So we can take from them and give 
back to the rich. Then the rich have even more, so we can take 
more from them and give to the not poor any more, and so on''.
<P>
	The people of Adanac scratched their heads some more. They 
really did not understand how this all could work. ``Look'', said 
Nibor Dooh, ``it is all in this wonderful book by the philosopher 
Sen Yek. It is called <I>The General Theory of Employment, 
Interest and Free Money</I>. I can't say I quite understand it 
myself'', said Nibor Dooh, ``and I am sure you wouldn't, but 
trust me. It will all work out''.
<P>
	Nibor Dooh assembled the elitist class in the country to help 
him rule the land. He explained that this way it would not be so 
bad that initially he had to take from them. He was to hire a lot of 
them and they could all get together, look very clever and rule 
the ordinary people. They would have to adopt his ideas, some of 
which were actually very odd. After a few years, they would 
even claim that it was their culture and that it was what made 
their country great and gave it its identity.
<P>
	Nibor Dooh was able to convince some of the tribe of Aidem 
to explain his scheme to everyone in the land. Aidem had a lot of 
influence and most of his tribe were part of the upper elite class.
<P>
	At first the whole thing seemed to work to perfection. The 
elite class paid more, but not much more. They got to be rulers 
and talk in very clever and compassionate sounding ways. The 
tribe of Aidem praised them with great praise and Nibor Dooh 
went up and down the great land of Adanac taking small 
amounts of money from the people to give back to the rich but 
also giving them large amounts of money that he said he had got 
from the rich without taking much from them.
<P>
	``Look how well it is working'', he told them, and the Aidem 
echoed him. ``I take a small amount of money from you and I 
increase it. I do more with it than if you keep it yourself. I 
provide free health care for you. I will pay you a pension when 
you get old. I take care of the poor among you better than you 
could. I provide work for those without jobs, and if I cannot 
provide work I pay them anyway. There is no need for any of you 
to concern yourself with your neighbour's well-being, for I, 
Nibor Dooh, take care of all those who have problems''.
<P>
	Every once in a while some village idiot would ask how he 
could defy the laws of economics, but Nibor Dooh would just 
smile patronizingly and wave copies of the works of Sen Yek and 
Htiarblag. Nibor Dooh was so clever and so urbane that the 
people just laughed at these idiots.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13315"> 13315 </A></B>
<P>
	Other quite vicious people spread rumours that Nibor Dooh 
was actually borrowing from the rich and promising to pay them 
back with the money of the poor. No one listened, because if it 
were true he was making the poor richer and they would easily 
be able to pay for what they had consumed now.
<P>
	No one worried about tomorrow. Adanac became known as 
one of the best countries to live in. As the years went by there 
was a gradual but marked change in society. People did not take 
as much responsibility for their own affairs. They did not save 
their money for when times were lean or when they got to be 
older. People did not take as much interest in helping their 
neighbour as they did previously. A saying became common in 
the land: ``Don't worry, Nibor Dooh will take care of us'', and 
Nibor Dooh became a very popular person in the land of Adanac.
<P>
	Another gradual change began to occur. The poor people had 
to always pay a little more to Nibor Dooh every year for the 
services he provided. Every year there were more and more 
people who did not have jobs. Some of the people began to 
murmur and ask questions. It appeared as though they were 
paying more to Nibor Dooh than they were getting back in the 
services he provided. Some of the people from the Aidem tribe 
came to Nibor Dooh's rescue. They told the people Nibor Dooh 
was doing what was best for them. They told the people of 
Adanac they were becoming a more caring and compassionate 
society, kinder and gentler than they used to be.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Nibor Dooh was looking more tired and worried 
than he once had and had less time for the common people. ``See 
how he wears himself out for us'', they said. They did not know 
he had to spend more and more time begging the rich to lend him 
more and more. They knew that Nibor Dooh kept saying the rich 
would have to pay more, but somehow it was always them who 
had to pay more.
<P>
	They began to listen to people criticising the whole 
arrangement. Some were the old time village idiots like Reklaw 
and Namdeirf, and others were new voices like Notserp 
Gninnam. Notserp really annoyed Nibor Dooh with his 
impertinent questions like where is all this money coming from 
to provide all these services? Why are we paying almost half of 
our hard-earned money to Nibor Dooh? Why are the services 
declining but the amount we give Nibor Dooh keeps increasing?
<P>
	Also about this time Notserp made the discovery that Nibor 
Dooh was actually taking from the poor and giving to the rich. 
Notserp discovered that Nibor Dooh had an agreement with the 
wealthy in the land whereby they would give Nibor Dooh money 
if he gave them a portion of what he collected from the poor 
every year. Aidem came to the rescue of Nibor Dooh again but 
the word got out to the people he was taking from the poor to 
give to the rich. Some of the poor people saw they were not rich  
enough to afford what he demanded of them and they began to 
demand that this stop.
<P>
	Nibor Dooh began to accuse Notserp of being heartless and 
cruel for making such a suggestion, but Notserp contended that 
we must not keep giving more to the rich because it would 
enslave the poor. In return Nibor Dooh accused Notserp for 
wanting to slash and burn these wonderful programs. If we went 
back to allowing people more control over their lives the 
country would fall apart.
<P>
	The Aidem tribe also contended that if Notserp had his way 
we would lose our identify as a nation. Nibor Dooh said the poor 
would be unable to defend themselves from the adversities of 
life. When people asked Notserp about this he explained that we 
are all becoming poorer because we were giving so much of our 
hard earned money to the rich. He said it was wrong to steal from 
the rich and that since we have borrowed from them we have to 
pay them back. He said going into debt to them had not made us 
richer and would not so we should stop borrowing and just pay 
them back.
<P>
	Notserp became more and more popular with the poor people 
as they began to realise he was telling the truth. The trust the 
people had in Nibor Dooh began to disappear. The Aidem people 
tried valiantly to defend Nibor Dooh, but the stranger their 
explanations became and the wilder their attacks on Notserp the 
less convincing they became. People asked Notserp how he 
could keep attracting larger and larger audiences even though 
Aidem and Nibor Dooh called him such terrible names. You 
cannot fool all the people all the time, he told them.
<P>
	Finally the people became so angry that they sent Nibor Dooh 
back to the land of Larebil and proclaimed Notserp their new 
leader. Notserp told them clearly he was not a magician, but 
neither was Nibor Dooh. He said: ``There are simple answers to 
your problems, but they are not easy ones. Nibor Dooh has made 
us poor and we will have to go back to working hard to fix the 
damage he caused. It will take years but at the end you will feel 
better not because of what I have done but because of what you 
have done''.
<P>
	That is what happened. The people worked hard but they felt 
proud of the work and they learned a great lesson. They could 
take care of themselves better in the long run than Nibor Dooh 
could with his grand scheme of taking from the poor and giving 
to the rich.
<P>
	That is the end of my story. One observant person realized 
Nibor Dooh is Robin Hood spelled backwards. Just like Nibor 
Dooh was Robin Hood spelled backwards, what he did was 
backwards. All his great schemes that had the effect of stealing 
from the poor to give to the rich were backwards. We are doing 
the very same thing in Canada. The government, like Nibor 
Dooh in my story, has convinced the people it can do more for 
the people than they can do for themselves.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13316"> 13316 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I listened to the arguments all morning and I heard them 
repeated over and over again. The government is taking from the 
poor and giving to the rich. We borrow from the rich and they get 
richer. Every year the situation deteriorates.
<P>
	A parallel to this story can be found in the history of Canada 
for approximately the past 25 years and it is still unfolding. 
What is the answer? Get government less involved in the lives of 
people. Let them take care of themselves; stop interfering. 
Reduce the size of government and government programs and 
reduce taxes so people have more control over their lives.
<P>
	Like the people of Adanac, Canadians are becoming 
increasingly cynical of government and politicians. They need 
to realize there is absolutely no compassion in doing what we are 
doing, taking from the poor and giving to the rich. They need to 
realize there is nothing noble about being told they cannot take 
care of themselves, their families and the less fortunate without 
the help of a wise, all seeing government. That is the great 
lesson of this story.
<P>
	Like the people of Adanac, we have the will, the imagination 
and the energy to live well and to share generously all by 
ourselves and that is what we need to do.
<P>
	What are the key points in this story I created? Governments 
have created the impression that by borrowing money, by going 
into debt, we are being compassionate and caring. Nothing could 
be further from the truth. We are enslaving our people, 
especially our children. We are taking the money from the 
hardworking, ordinary, not wealthy people of Canada and we are 
giving it to the rich by our schemes.
<P>
	People pay over one-half of their money to the government. 
What tactics does the government use to transfer this money 
from the poor to the rich? It convinces the people it can take care 
of them better than they could if they were allowed to keep their 
hard earned money, which is a myth. Many people in Canada are 
beginning to realize this myth. Another tactic government uses 
is to keep telling the people: ``Trust us, even if you do not 
understand it all. The government is doing what is best for the 
country''. This too is a great myth.
<P>
	All the names in this story are spelled backwards. For 
example, the tribe of Aidem that helped Nibor Dooh and the 
elites to spread their lies across the land is the media. Aidem, 
like Nibor Dooh, was able to get some of the elite tribe to help 
him convince everyone that being left wing is more 
compassionate than being right wing, but it proved to be a myth. 
Before these left wing Liberal ideas were spread across the land 
of Adanac, Canada spelled backwards, we had strong families 
and communities to give support to those in society who were 
less fortunate. When these ideas of Senyek were spread across 
that land  it began to erode the strength of our families and 
charitable institutions.
<P>
	Notserp, whose name I will let others decipher, began to tell 
the people these ideas of Nibor Dooh would not work. The 
agreement Nibor Dooh had with the rich to borrow money was to 
destroy the land. That is happening in Canada today. By 
borrowing money we are destroying our country.
<P>
	The grand experiment this country has undergone for the last 
25 years or so has not worked. Hard work, strong families, 
community organizations, values that emphasize responsibility, 
these have made our country great, not this idea that big 
government programs have made our country great and make us 
a great society. Nothing could be further from the truth; it is a 
myth. The government still creates the impression it can take 
better care of us than we can take care of ourselves if we were 
allowed to keep our hard earned money.
<P>
	Nibor Dooh created the impression that he could multiply the 
money he took from the people but in the end it was a myth. The 
opposite actually happened. He impoverished the people. This is 
happening in Canada. My hope is that we can learn a lesson from 
the story I have told. We cannot keep taking from the poor and 
giving to the rich.

	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have been listening to this fairy tale and I think there 
is a fairy tale within a fairy tale; some rather strange myths 
articulated by the member opposite.
<P>
	I ask members present if they agree with the myth that perhaps 
the member is right about us interfering too much and that, 
following his logic, a person without food and shelter should be 
left without food and shelter.
<P>
	The member is very much a proponent of the marketplace. I 
ask him if he believes that begging on the street is the 
marketplace's answer to helping people in vulnerable positions 
to find enough food and wherewithal to support themselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
been listening all morning to the same type of reasoning, the big 
flaw in what is happening in Canada today. We are trying to 
convince the people these big government programs, the 
borrowing of money to sustain all of this, are the answer to our 
problem. This absolutely is not the answer.
<P>
	We have to run government in a businesslike manner. We have 
to be more responsible. We have to allow people to assume 
responsibility for their lives. If the member is suggesting that if 
we remove this from them and we have big government 
programs we are solving the problem, she should take a look 
around her. She should open her eyes.

full religious tolerance and co-operation within a new, plural

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
wish to draw attention today to the sixth anniversary of the sad 
events that took place in June of 1989 in Tiananmen Square, 
where thousands of students were massacred in the violent 
crackdown on their democratic movement by the Chinese 
leadership.
<P>
	Despite the hopes that this widespread movement had raised, 
democracy is no further ahead today in China.
<P>
	All the while, this government just turns its back on the 
promotion of human rights by concentrating exclusively on the 
economic aspect of its relations with China.
<P>
	By repudiating a well-established tradition of promoting 
human rights, the government reduces the status of Canada to 
that of a minor and petty market power lacking vision, with a 
foreign policy based on double talk.

careful consideration of euthanasia and physician assisted

<P>
	Of importance is the emphasis on palliative care which must 
be addressed by the medical community and all levels of 
government through its promotion of public health policy. This 
was a consistent theme presented by witnesses before the

<P>
	Canadians are asking what control they and their families 
have in the direction of their own care. Certainly all issues 
surrounding the withholding and withdrawal of life support need 
very close attention with public education and input.
<P>
	It concerns me that judges may be given leniency in handing 
out mercy killing sentences, once again calling into question the 
integrity of our justice system. Respect for life and the 
protection of the most vulnerable in our society should be 
paramount in public health policy and the law.

Mr. Speaker, recently I had the wonderful opportunity to present 
a new Canadian flag to the children at Wentworth Consolidated

<P>
	As we stood around the flag pole in the beautiful spring

nationhood, the respect and care that our flag deserves, and the 
great price paid by our veterans to make our nation so great and

which they watched baby fish grow from eggs caught from the 
nearby fish hatchery. When these young fish are big enough the

tomorrow is the opening in Toronto of the first official round of 
negotiations on the inclusion of Chile in NAFTA, which, 
according to the Minister of International Trade, will make this 
agreement more vigorous, flexible and open. We are pleased to 
note this sudden conversion to free trade on the part of the 
Liberals, who so fiercely opposed the signing of the free trade 
agreement with the U.S.
<P>
	Today, the federal government is in favour of every free trade 
initiative: free trade with Asia by 2025, free trade with Europe, 
free trade here, there and everywhere. That is Canada's new 
motto. A sovereign Quebec will make an economic association 
offer to Canada. Given our current commercial ties, this is an 
offer that can hardly be refused.
<P>
	With a volume of trade with Canada 150 times that of Chile, 
Quebec certainly has at least equal merit.

Expo 2005 has ground down into an unpleasant east-west tug of 
war in which the west appears to be shafted yet again in a 
decision rigged to favour Ottawa over Calgary.
<P>
	The foot dragging Minister of Canadian Heritage 
demonstrates how the momentum of mediocrity can sustain a 
faltering political career as his indecisiveness cripples the bid 
process.
<P>
	How did a process based on integrity and fairness become so 
tainted that Ottawa is now lobbying more fiercely than ever 
before? The Mulroney way is back. Once it appeared that 
Calgary was going to be awarded Expo 2005, the backroom 
politics of the Mulroney years took over the process, and an 
incompetent minister was the perfect foil by which the emergent 
controversy could gather momentum.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals are faced will a real dilemma for not only did the 
independent review committee unanimously recommend 
Calgary but this fact was also widely reported. Although 
choosing Ottawa over Calgary will be a difficult public choice 
for the Liberals, the confidence exhibited not only by the 
lobbyists but also by cabinet reveals that the Mulroney way is 
still very much a part of Canadian politics.

individual. Mr. Taher S. Madraswalla has been on a peace 
mission for 14 years.
<P>
	In October 1981, at the age of 18, he left his homeland of 
Ahmedabad, India, on a bicycle tour and now 14 years and some 
116,000 kilometres later he has visited 30 countries spreading 
his message of peace.
<P>
	Throughout Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia 
and now Canada he has spread the word of international 
brotherhood, peace and understanding. Fittingly the last stage of 
his mission will be to cycle to the headquarters of the United 
Nations where he is hoping to bring his message to the 
secretary-general.

with acid rain and other environmental problems has gone on 
under the auspices of the institute.
<P>
	It is shortsighted in the extreme to cut off this research. We 
may well regret many years from now that the government saw

this week is National Transportation Week. In a country as vast

<P>
	Most of the largest Canadian port, the Port of Vancouver, is 
located in my riding of Vancouver East.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addition to fast growth of its traffic in the movement of 
goods, the port of Vancouver has a very dynamic cruise industry 
which in 1994 delivered an estimated $140 million in benefits to 
the British Columbia economy and over 580,000 passengers.

	Recently the Ballantyne pier, built in my riding in the 
twenties, reopened its terminal to help serve the cruise industry. 
This season the Ballantyne terminal will greet 64 of the 292 
sailings calling on the port of Vancouver.
<P>
	The terminal is now a state of the art facility for new cruise 
ships, boasting passenger loads of 2,000 to 3,000 people, thanks 
to new gangways that have the capability to be set up in a record 
seven minutes.

Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government has a very poor record of 
keeping its promises on open government, independence of

Liberal brass respects the right of members to vote freely in the

seals expected to show up just to make up the needed members 
and then bark yea or nay as they are told.
<P>
	The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has expressed 
some real concerns about the federal budget. While I do not 
share his specific concerns I support his right to vote freely in 
the House to keep the promises he and the Liberals made in the 
red book, the promises the Liberals are now breaking.
<P>
	It is unfortunate the Liberals do not support this right. We 
have already seen three Liberals punished for not toeing the

Mr. Speaker, at a meeting in Paris Saturday, European and 
NATO Defence Ministers agreed to create a new rapid reaction 
force that would be responsible for protecting and assisting 
peacekeepers in Bosnia. Now it seems that Russia, a member of 
the contact group on Bosnia, is opposed to the creation of this 
rapid reaction force.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell us whether his government 
officially supports the creation of such a force and whether 
Canada will contribute in a specific way?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs have made it clear that Canada supports the 
initiative taken by the British and the French, but so far, the 
Canadian government has made no decision on whether to 
contribute troops or equipment. Our consultations are 
continuing, and a decision will be made, either positive or 
negative.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if this kind of force were to be limited to a 
Franco-British expeditionary unit, it would lose much of its 
credibility and effectiveness. The Dutch have already agreed to 
support this force and may participate. We know that Dutch 
peacekeeping missions have a profile similar to those led by 
Canada. Perhaps Canada should consider this in a favourable 
light.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether in his opinion, 
Russia's opposition may lead to some second thoughts about 
setting up the rapid reaction force proposed by the United 
States, France and Great Britain?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think Russia's position makes any difference in 
the arrangements made by the British and the French. We are 
continuing our consultations with other countries that may 
participate in this force.
<P>

favour of Canada's participation.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I said that we will consider favourably the 
possibility to consider it, to use diplomatic wording.
<P>
	The Prime Minister should also consider the possibility that 
Russia will use its vote to exercise a right of veto at the security 
council of the United Nations. If it does that it would be very 
difficult to consider the force.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister share the opinion of Foreign Office 
Secretary Douglas Hurd to the effect that unless a rapid 
deployment force is created the peacekeepers should withdraw 
from Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not want to extract from the Leader of the 
Opposition a yes that he is not ready to say at this time. I know 
another yes that he is very keen on. I am very keen on a no.
<P>
	My view is that the presence of Canadian troops and others 
under the UNPROFOR group is still extremely useful in 
maintaining some peace in many parts of the former Yugoslavia. 
While they are there they are available during emergencies 
supplying drugs and food.
<P>
	They have done this very well in the last three years and have 
saved a lot of lives. Canadian participation is still very good. We 
favour what the Brits and the French are proposing but that does 
not mean we have to participate necessarily. We have made a 
good contribution.

ways, it is somewhat more a European problem than a Canadian 
problem.

Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	During his visit to Ottawa, the chairman of the International 
Chamber of Commerce urged G-7 countries to get their finances 
under control in order to guarantee solid economic growth. To 
arrive at this end, he suggested cutting social programs, 
decreasing the minimum wage, reducing minimum working 
conditions and restricting pension plans.
<P>
	As host and chairman of the G-7 Summit in Halifax, does the 
Prime Minister share the views of the chairman of the 
International Chamber of Commerce, Arthur Dunkel?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Dunkel is one of the members of the delegation, 
not the chairman. I find his recipe is a little strong for my taste. I 
think that there is a way to get public finances under control, in 
Canada for example, without cutting social programs 
excessively. This is, by the way, the position which the Minister 
of Finance took in the budget tabled in February.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the Prime Minister make the commitment that, at 
the G-7 Summit, amidst the recommendations made by the 
International Chamber of Commerce and the wind of 
conservatism blowing on this Parliament, he will not defend 
conservative economic policies even farther right than his first 
two budgets,

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a few days earlier, I had had the privilege to meet with 
some of the leaders of the trade union movements in G-7 
countries. Our meeting lasted several hours and, obviously, their 
positions differed from that of the International Chamber of 
Commerce. Like the good Liberal that I am, I found myself 
squarely in the middle, between these two positions.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage has done it again. 
Last year he attended a select $2,000 a plate fundraising dinner 
in his honour to help pay off 1993 campaign debts.
<P>
	The dinner was held at the Montreal home of Richard Gervais, 
a Liberal bagman who has received at least $110,000 in 
contracts from the minister's office since the gathering. It was 
attended by individuals who have direct business dealings or 
regulatory dealings with the heritage department. It is not the 
dinner that concerns us but the conflict of interest which it 
represents.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Does he 
recognize that by putting himself in such a conflict of interest 
situation he undermines the integrity of his department and the 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did participate in a number of fundraising 
events, including the one that our colleague is talking about. 
However, he is making a lot of allegations.
<P>
	There is nothing secret about anything that I have done and 
about the contributions I have made to special fundraising 
events.
<P>
	In addition, I am informed that all the procedures concerning 
both the Liberal Party procedures and the Election Canada 
procedures were followed with a great deal of 
conscientiousness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are not talking about secrecy but conflict of 
interest. This is just the latest in a long series of ministerial 
missteps. This minister has intervened with the CRTC on behalf 
of a constituent. He helped re-jig the government's satellite to 
home policy to benefit the Liberal connected Power Corp. He 
lunched with Edgar Bronfman Jr. on the eve of Seagram's 
takeover of MCA.
<P>
	This minister has violated the spirit and the letter of the 
conflict of interest code on a number of occasions and has put 
the integrity of the government in question.
<P>
	Therefore I ask the Minister of Canadian Heritage, will he 
now do what he should have done months ago and resign?
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have respected every directive of the 
Liberal Party and Elections Canada. With respect to contracts, I 
am also informed all treasury board guidelines were adhered to 
when letting out contracts.
<P>
	When one respects the rules I expect this would be recognized 
as the proper behaviour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the actions of the minister of heritage are part of a 
disturbing pattern. The justice minister places the principle of 
merit on the shelf to hire the minister of revenue's friends in 
Victoria. The minister of public works has diverted over $26 
million of highway funding to feather his political nest in Cape 
Breton.
<P>
	Despite the government's promise to restore integrity to 
government, its actions prove it is no different than the Tories it 
replaced.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister live up to his red book promises on 
integrity and ask for the resignation of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the minister said earlier, all the regulations have 
been followed. All the contributions have been made public. We 
have the list of all contributions that have been made to the 
Liberal Party, to the Conservative Party, to the Reform Party. 
Some of the contributors to this function had contributed in

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the matter of the fundraising dinners organized 
by the firm of the lobbyist Mr. Gervais, we discover that the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage has just contravened a directive 
from the Prime Minister aimed at avoiding any possible conflict 
of interest. This directive was given as the reason the Minister of 
International Trade declined to attend a fundraising dinner in 
Toronto last year.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. How can the Prime 
Minister allow the Minister of Canadian Heritage to yet again 
contravene one of his directives on government ethics?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has contravened none of our rules or 
directives. He did not use any list from his department. The 
people he met were people who had contributed voluntarily to 
the Liberal Party. This is the way it works in all parties. 
Everything we do in the Liberal Party is public knowledge. 
Receipts are issued, people can check.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="13323"> 13323 </A></B>
<P>
	This is very different from what happened in the 1993 
elections, when members of the Bloc Quebecois refused to 
provide, they were not obliged to do so, but they refused to 
provide the list of contributions they received in the 1993 
elections, and the law did not require them to. When the press 
asked them to disclose their contributions, they decided not to. 
They were not obliged to do so at the time. Only this year they 
will be obliged to do so.
<P>
	In the matter we are discussing, however, the contributions 
are public and the receipts are public. Everything is public. The 
minister did only what every member does and what every 
minister does: during party fundraising campaigns they make 
themselves available so we may do our democratic duty, which 
is to have enough funds that the public knows about available for 
an election.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the Prime Minister, we do 
not need a lesson from him or his party on funding political 
parties.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Right on. We know why he is rich.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> So, given that the Prime Minister seems to 
have stretch ethics, would he tell me how he can give different 
ministers different directives-telling one not to attend an event 
in Toronto and exonerating the other who attended an event in 
Laval-Ouest?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to point out to the hon. member that the 
legislation on transparency was tabled in this Parliament by the 
former Liberal government, of which I was a member. It is a law.
<P>
	Although the law did not oblige them to, if the Bloc 
Quebecois has nothing to hide, why did it refuse, after the 1993 
elections, to disclose the contributions it had received?
<P>
	In our case, all contributions we received we made public. We 
were required to do so and we were happy to do so, because we 
comply with the law that the Liberal Party adopted in this 
House.

raise money. We had a great dinner in the riding of the Deputy

Everybody is there and can take notes. We do that.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage is like other ministers. 
When he is invited to a fundraiser he attends. It is absolutely 
normal to do that because the contributions are public. Nothing 
is hidden. It is according to the law, according to the regulations

<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of National Revenue undertake to make a 
decision before the end of this session, bearing in mind that, 
while he and his officials are reviewing the case, thousands of 
taxpayers in Quebec are facing the prospect of bankruptcy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. It 
is true that hundreds of companies were established by 
promoters interested in investing in scientific research. It is also 
true that, in many cases, the fact that no research was carried out 
caused problems in a number of regions in Quebec and in other 
provinces as well.
<P>
	At present, there is litigation between investors and 
promoters. This is a very complicated situation, and I can assure 
the hon. member that a decision will be made by the end of the 
session, if at all possible, and hopefully before the end of June in 
any case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
the minister recognize that it is totally unacceptable for Revenue 
Canada to change the rules after a few years and ask Quebec 
taxpayers to pay back large amounts retroactively, thereby 
driving thousands of them to the brink of bankruptcy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, Revenue Canada did not change any rules. 
The rules have been in place for a long time and have remained 
unchanged. The real question is: How did it come about that the 
Canadian government put in place a system allowing promoters 
to do such things?
<P>
	Since the decision was made in 1989, the question would be 
better put to the Leader of the Official Opposition, who was a

my six years as an MP I have seen government patronage and 
corruption at its very worst. I listened to Liberal howls of 
outrage and calls for integrity, competence and honour when 
they were in opposition. Now they are sitting on the other side of 
the House and of course the tune has changed. This government 
is showing the same arrogance as its predecessor and it thinks 
that popularity polls can justify patronage appointments, 
backroom deals and political payoffs.
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister is why the double 
standard? If Roch LaSalle resigned, why will not his minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

rules, the legislation and the guidelines which we have initiated.
<P>
	Fundraising is an occupation of all parties. I have a list of all 
the contributions the Reform Party has received. I will not read 
it. It is legitimate. I am not complaining. That party received the 
money. The list is public. The people who contributed to the 
Reform Party have contributed to the Liberal Party, to the 
Conservative Party and sometimes to the Bloc Quebecois. It is 
normal.

the Chair when they are speaking.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are not talking cash or contributions, we are talking contracts 
which arise out of those fundraisers.
<P>
	The Liberals in opposition would have demanded the 
resignation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage. I watched 
them and they would have demanded it for sure. Their disgust 
and outrage would have echoed through these hallowed halls 
and in the press. The Liberals in government however dismiss 
the minister's dinner for dollars as harmless and then they send 
out the spin doctors to minimize the damage. Brian Mulroney 
must be smiling as he watches this as he may soon be appointed 
the Liberals' patron saint.

accusation that someone paid for a contract, I will do what I have 
to do. I have been around here for a long time. I know that they 
are chickens. They make broad statements, never being able to 
pin down any contract relating to contributions. When they do

of ethics if there is no accountability for it when someone breaks 
it? It has clearly been broken here.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

accusation according to the rule of the House that there is a 
contract that has been attributed because money has been paid to 
the Liberal Party, he should make the proof and not chicken out 
from that. That is the rule of decency. They cannot prove it 
because the contribution is public.

	Ogilvie Mills workers in Montreal have been deprived of their

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister says he wants specifics. How much more 
specific can we get, with an inappropriate diversion of funds 
from a federal-provincial agreement as defined by the auditor 
general of Nova Scotia?
<P>
	This diversion of funds has been called illegal, immoral, and 
misappropriation. Yet the Prime Minister refuses to have his 
ethics chairperson look after this thing and investigate it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Lapdog.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> My question is for the 
Prime Minister. Since at least one person has called the highway 
104 scandal a misappropriation of taxpayers' funds for which 
someone will be held accountable, why has the Prime Minister 
silenced not only that member but the minister responsible for 
this unethical diversion of funds?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I have explained many times in this House, the 
priorities for highways within a province are decided by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13327"> 13327 </A></B>
<P>
minister of transport or highways within that province. In the 
case of Nova Scotia, the Government of Nova Scotia had other 
priorities, so we did what we have  done with many other 
provincial governments. When there is a need to change 
priorities, we oblige the provincial governments, as a good 
government in Ottawa should do.
<P>
	We can impose our will all the time, but everybody would tell 
us that we are not being respectful of the wishes of the provinces 
and are being the big brother deciding for them. When we oblige 
them they blame us.
<P>
	For a good situation in Canada, it is good that my ministers 
listen to the provinces whenever possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think we are looking for good government in Ottawa. We have 
yet to find it.
<P>
	Listen to the concerns here in the House, which have been 
going on since last year. Ethics, integrity, honesty, and openness 
are all gone out the door with this government. These are all 
broken promises of the Liberal red book. It is Liberal, Tory, 
same old story, right across the row here.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. Since 
we are now seeing the arrogance of Brian Mulroney over here 
with a new red book face, just how bad does it have to get before 
the Prime Minister sees fit to assign his ethics counsellor to this 
situation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when it is time for the next election all our promises 
listed on page 111 of the red book will have been met. I can 
guarantee that.
<P>
	We were elected for five years and we have only been here for 
a year and a half so far, yet we have already met two-thirds of 
these election commitments. That is not bad. We will keep 
working to meet our commitments.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	More funding is required to support efforts to establish breast 
cancer support groups across northwestern Ontario. This 
funding is especially warranted in light of data indicating the 
federal government committed greater amounts of funding on a 
per patient basis to other diseases than to breast cancer research.
<P>
	Does this government have any intention to increase funding 
for breast cancer research, education, and support groups?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, despite the fiscal challenges we face as a government, 
much is being done in terms of breast cancer.
<P>
	Among other things, we have formed partnerships in order to 
have more dollars to put into a broad range of  research projects. 
We have among others the Canadian breast cancer research 
initiative, which is a broad partnership of Health Canada, the 
Medical Research Council, the National Cancer Institute of 
Canada, and the Canadian Cancer Society.
<P>
	Additional funds are also being invested by the corporate 
breast cancer fund started by the Royal Bank. It is estimated that 
this partnership will generate approximately $55 million toward 
breast cancer research in the near future. Is it enough? It is never 
enough, but we will continue to work very diligently toward 
finding more dollars to look into this very serious disease.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has affirmed many times in this House 
that the Minister of Agriculture must treat all producers fairly, 
including Quebec producers, regarding the Crow rate issue. The 
minister remained vague on the issue and, when the 1995 budget 
was tabled, we saw that the compensation offered to eastern 
dairy producers was not fair.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Agriculture realize that western 
producers will be compensated for the loss of the Crow rate 
subsidy, but that eastern dairy producers, who will also be hit 
with cuts, will have to face the consequences of the budget 
without compensation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the budget clearly 
demonstrates that we are handling transportation issues across 
this country in a way that is even handed and fair minded. We are 
dealing with all of those transportation programs in a consistent 
fashion, whether it be the WGTA in western Canada or the feed 
freight assistance program in various other parts of Canada or 
the maritime freight rates assistance program or the Atlantic 
region freight rate assistance program.
<P>
	All of those transportation subsidies are in the process of 
being eliminated, and in every case there is an adjustment fund 
or a transition program being put in place to ease the adjustment 
from the old subsidized regime to a new economic order without 
the degree of subsidization that has existed in the past.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> today printed a story that is nothing short of 
shocking. They reported that last year our immigration minister 
personally, with his own signature, gave permits to nine 
members of terrorist and revolutionary organizations to enter 
Canada.
<P>
	These are not campus protesters. These are people from 
groups that have claimed tens of thousands of lives in civil wars 
and uprisings.
<P>
	Is this bizarre story true? Did the minister give entry permits 
to members of terrorist organizations? If so, what will he now do 
to remove them from this country?
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a ministerial permit is a tool 
that is used by officials across the country and internationally to 
try to assist individuals in various situations.
<P>
	Almost 7,000 ministerial permits were granted last year. Nine 
individuals received ministerial permits who were members of 
organizations that are automatically excluded from Canada. 
These individuals came here for periods of two days to a few 
weeks.
<P>
	An example is an individual from Rwanda who was invited by 
the standing committee on human rights. Another individual 
was from the Middle East and was involved with foreign affairs 
in multilateral peace discussions. Another individual from an 
organization that has been defunct since 1970 came to give 
testimony on the human rights situation in Central America.
<P>
	It would be very irresponsible for the member to try to 
intimate that these individuals were here and had gone 
underground, had asked for asylum or permanent residency. 
These individuals were allowed to come here for a short while 
and there was nothing untoward to the Canadian community.

	We know from press comments this morning that the G-7

<P>
	Since the conference is yet to be held, how is it that I have in

11 pages of detailed commentary about all the agreements that 
the G-7 nations have taken. Could he explain that please?

responsible for the Federal Office of Regional

sufficiently experienced to know that prior to any international 
conference, the sherpas, the various delegations get together and 
basically attempt to narrow the issue.
<P>
	The member is also sufficiently experienced to know that the 
discussions take place when the leaders gather. That is when the 
decisions are made. The ultimate decisions may well bear no 
resemblance to whatever document the member happens to 
have.

like to control their respective leaders and get them to say what 
they want. However it is my experience that rarely happens.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
allow me to provide just a bit of background to my point of 
order.
<P>
	Last Friday, June 2, in Oral Question Period I asked a question 
of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in which I 
brought to the minister's attention the case of Mr. Victor 
Sumbley, who has had enormous difficulties securing a visitor's 
visa for a family member to come to Canada.
<P>
	In reply to my question the minister of immigration 
responded with the following: ``Today he,'' meaning me, 
``decides to do some constituency work after all because there 
have been a lot of complaints from Canadians in Calgary, 
Alberta who cannot get the time of day on immigration matters 
from members of Parliament. It pleases me, finally, to see the 
member of Parliament stand up for his constituents.''.
<P>
	I have no quarrel with the accusations made by the hon. 
minister of immigration. I am quite accustomed to his style of 
debate. However, in the interests of accuracy I must insist that 
the Speaker ask the hon. minister to recognize one very impor-

tant point. Mr. Sumbley, a successful Canadian for whom I have 
made an  intervention is not my constituent. He is, in fact, 
represented by the member for Mount Royal, the Secretary of 
State for Multiculturalism and the Status of Women.

	Mr. Sumbley turned to me for assistance in his immigration 
case because that member refused to Mr. Sumbley's face to 
assist.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1995">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1995</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-76, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 27, 1995, be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I understand that the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville had the floor when we interrupted the debate 
for question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
briefly conclude my answer.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite continues to perpetuate the myth, 
the fairy tale, that there would be fewer poor people if we 
continued having more and more big government programs and 
big government bureaucracy.
<P>
	If we borrow money year after year we will be driving our 
children into the poor house. Who does he think pays for big 
government? It is the poor people of Canada who right now are 
being driven into the poor house to pay for it. The government 
keeps saying that Canadians need to have fairer taxes. All that 
does is raise the taxes of everyone. The government has raised 
the taxes for the poor, for the hard working, for the labourers of 
Canada.
<P>
	The people of Canada are not being fooled by all of this. This 
is simply a fairy tale, a myth, which the government is 
perpetuating, that it is kinder, gentler and more compassionate. 
In fact, the most cruel thing it can do is to continue to borrow 
more money so that Canadians have to pay more interest and 
continue to impoverish the people. We are borrowing from the 
poor to give to the rich. That is the point I want to make.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to raise a question 
with my colleague and friend from Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	His earlier comments to the House were quite well received. 
However, I want to bring to his attention some comments which 
were recently made in a committee of the House by the 
Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities concerning 
the future of agriculture and rural communities on the prairies.
<P>
	One of the comments made by the Saskatchewan Association 
of Rural Municipalities was with respect to the government's 
claims that crop diversification and value added production will 
be a direct result of the elimination of the Crow benefit. The 
Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities said this in 
its opening remarks:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy whether the elimination of 
the Crow benefit will expedite the move toward diversification and value-added 
opportunities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It must be mentioned-that lack of capital is a significant obstacle to the 
realization of many successful value-added businesses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It concluded the section by saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our association has made consistent statements to federal and provincial 
governments that the establishment of equity and/or capital venture funds is 
necessary for Saskatchewan to fully realize growth in value-added processing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I believe very strongly that the position brought forward by 
the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities 
represents the view of many communities in rural 
Saskatchewan. They realize that with the withdrawal of the 
Crow benefit their communities will lose income and will need 
to find alternative sources of income to maintain not only their 
tax base but their quality of life.
<P>
	The development of equity funds is one way to ensure that 
investment capital will exist. However we all know that the 
number of communities that will lose significant amounts of 
money will never be in a position to attract all of the investment 
necessary.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Will the member for Yorkton-Melville inform the House 
whether he supports the Saskatchewan Association of Rural 
Municipalities' position in this matter and what sort of 
investment opportunities he thinks will result because of the 
loss of the Crow?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Very briefly, Mr. 
Speaker, I have a hard time making the connection between what 
I had to say previously on this question but I will offer some 
comments anyway.
<P>
	We have clearly stated that a transition period should have 
taken place before the Crow rate was pulled out. This transition 
would have allowed much of what this member talked about to 
take place. If it is suddenly pulled out it is going to be much 
more difficult for people to adjust to the changes that will take 
place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13330"> 13330 </A></B>
<P>
	We had a plan to do this. We would have taken the Crow 
subsidy and rolled it into a farm program that would have helped 
farmers make the transition. That should have taken place. As it 
stands now farmers will probably have a very difficult time.
<P>
	The changes that have been made probably eventually would 
have had to come but because of the way it was done by the 
government it is going to put farmers in a very difficult 
situation. I hope that is an appropriate answer to the member's 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the hon. member for Vancouver East.
<P>
	I am pleased today to speak on third reading of Bill C-76. I 
begin by reading from page 16 of the Liberal red book which was 
the book we campaigned on during the election. It establishes in 
many ways the mandate of the government. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will adopt a two-track fiscal policy, matching a drive 
for jobs and growth with a comprehensive approach to controlling debt and 
deficits. The two tracks run parallel: fiscal discipline will support economic 
growth, while growth and jobs will enhance government revenues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the basis of our platform and of our budgets.
<P>
	The 1995 budget pursues both the goals outlined in that 
statement. Infrastructure projects are creating jobs across the 
country. I am certainly pleased to have them creating jobs in 
Halifax West. This program is an excellent example of job 
creation activities as one side of the two track approach.
<P>
	The other side is also very important. We are attacking the 
debt and deficit. This attack is an important step toward a 
healthy economy, toward job creation. It creates the best 
possible climate for job creation.
<P>
	For instance, since the budget interest rates have come down a 
bit. We would like to see them come down a lot more. Everyone 
who has a Visa account, a mortgage or a loan would like to see 
interest rates come down. We hope they will. However it has to 
be remembered that if the cuts in the budget had not been as 
large as they were interest rates would probably have risen.
<P>
	Last year over 430,000 new jobs were created. That is largely 
due to the fact that interest rates were lower than they had been 
at times in the past.
<P>
	If interest rates had been raised right after the last budget a lot 
of jobs would have been lost. In my area of Halifax West there is 
some concern because of the large civil service presence in the 
Halifax area. People who are being affected by the reduction in 
the civil service are very concerned.
<P>
	The number of civil servants being cut is 45,000 across the 
country. When we recognize how many jobs that were created 
last year, over 430,000 jobs, you can see how much you can lose 
by having interest rates rise. What we lose in civil service jobs 
we hope to make up for by keeping interest rates low. That is a 
very important point.
<P>
	Keeping interest rates low is very important in terms of the 
disposable income that people have to spend on things. If they 
are paying more for their mortgage, paying more for their Visa 
account, paying more for all their loans they have less to spend 
on consumer items, less to keep the economy going.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	As we all know, expenditure reduction is a key to reducing our 
deficit. We cannot reduce our deficit without reducing our 
expenditures. That is why the government will reduce 
cumulatively over the next three years $25.3 billion. We are 
doing this without increasing personal income taxes.
<P>
	We are maintaining our assault on the deficit with 
fundamental changes to the structure of government. 
Government must still be active but we have to find ways to 
reduce duplication. We have to realize the things that are the 
most important, find the priorities for government and reduce 
activity in other areas. We cannot afford to be in all areas all the 
time.
<P>
	We are making tough choices in the budget. There is no 
question about it. It was not an easy budget to work out. There 
have been difficult decisions made. Program review involves 
some of those decisions; it involves going through the whole 
government department by department and analysing which 
activities and programs of government we should maintain and 
which we should reduce or remove. We have to maintain the 
most important ones. It is all about sustaining the most 
important activities of government. Those are the reasons we 
have to do this in terms of government reduction.
<P>
	For those in my area and for those people who are affected by 
the cuts to government programs and the civil service, it is very 
difficult to accept and to receive those cuts. That is why it is so 
important we achieve our reduction in the civil service in a 
humane way. I spoke to the President of the Treasury Board 
when he was in Halifax some weeks ago about this matter, trying 
to maximize the flexibility so civil servants could move between 
the departments where there were possibilities of openings.
<P>
	We are also merging and commercializing many programs of 
government in order to reduce our costs. We are also doing some 
other things I think are very positive. Most people recognize it 
as part of the balancing act that happened in this and the very 
important balance provided in the budget. We have cut business 
subsidies by I believe $60 million; that is important in terms of 
balance.
<P>
	We are trying to achieve better management of government. 
We have also made changes in the new Canada health and social 
transfer. The Reform Party is telling us we have not made 
enough cuts. I do not think it has a real understanding of what the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13331"> 13331 </A></B>
<P>
effect of those cuts are on regions like mine. There will 
definitely be a real challenge in places like Halifax and 
throughout the Atlantic because of some of these reductions, 
especially  in the metro area of Halifax-Dartmouth. We will 
rise to meet that challenge. We can do it and we know we have 
to. At the same time, to say we should go much further right now 
makes no sense to me at all. It fails to realize the impact these 
reductions will have in regions like Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The people in my riding of Halifax West have told me in their 
view the budget struck a good balance between the two tracks of 
our approach. There are enough cuts to get us on track regarding 
the deficit, to get it down where it should be quickly. At the same 
time we are maintaining the important principles of our 
government, the important Liberal principles of maintaining 
social programs.
<P>
	I mentioned there is no hike in the budget in personal income 
taxes. There are new measures to ensure that taxes owed are 
collected. That is very important in terms of improving fairness 
in our tax system. There are also tighter rules for tax deferrals 
and for foreign and family trusts. It is certainly time the tax 
holiday for family trusts came to an end.
<P>
	The red book platform focused in many ways on small and 
medium size businesses. The 1995 budget contains many 
continued efforts to support small business which we all know is 
the engine of our economy and which provides so many jobs. So 
many of the new jobs in our economy are being created by small 
business and so it is very important to continue to support small 
business activities.
<P>
	The government looked to members of Parliament for input in 
terms of what we should be doing to help small business, which 
is why last October the industry committee came out with its 
report ``Taking Care of Small Business''. In November, 1994 the 
small business working committee came out with its report 
``Breaking Through Barriers''. Many of the recommendations in 
those reports were adopted by the Minister of Industry when he 
gave response entitled ``Building a More Innovative Economy'' 
which contained among others key initiatives measures to 
reduce the paper burden for business. We all hear about the red 
tape and the number of forms people have to file and deal with 
when they are in small business. It is overwhelming for them.
<P>
	I was talking recently to a friend who operates a small 
engineering business in my riding. He was talking about how he 
is always filling out an endless array of forms. It is important to 
reduce some of these forms. Also in those initiatives I 
mentioned there was a strategic procurement initiative which is 
very important to see that some of our government procurement 
comes more and more from small business across the country.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We are seeing the expansion of the Canada business service 
centres across the country to provide more services to help small 
businesses getting started or that need help with advice in terms 
of expansion. We are seeing the reform of the regulatory 
systems which will help to reduce red tape. We are also seeing 
new export financing initiatives targeted toward small business. 
The Export Development Corporation has been instructed very 
strongly to not only help the big companies but to focus its 
attention toward helping small business.
<P>
	That is very important. Small business told us the most 
important obstacles to growth and jobs and to its growth, which 
means growth and jobs, is the debt and deficit. That is why we 
attack those obstacles. The budget reaffirms our commitment to 
small business as the engine of growth and job creation.
<P>
	I am pleased that the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency is 
assisting in those efforts and doing important work. It is one of 
the most important financing tools in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The OECD has advised countries that if they want to provide 
for a strong future they should support the development of 
self-employment skills in our populations. I am pleased to 
recommend support of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to again put a question 
to a member on the government side.
<P>
	Members have had an opportunity to review the bill, to study 
it in caucus, to talk to cabinet members about it, review it in the 
finance committee and examine it in their own ways.
<P>
	The hon. member comes from a part of eastern Canada with 
some agricultural base. Therefore he should have some 
understanding of rural life in Saskatchewan. As a member of 
government he has an obligation to review the effect this 
legislation will have on rural Canadians right across Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about small business. When we in 
Saskatchewan think about small business we think not only 
about those who are entrepreneurs selling or manufacturing 
products but also those who are producing products on the farm.
<P>
	In all fairness to the government to have claimed otherwise, 
this bill and the budget in general will have a more devastating 
effect on rural Saskatchewan than on any other part of the 
country.
<P>
	With regard to the bill, the legislation and its effect on the 
farmers through the reduction of the Crow benefit, I ask the 
member if he can identify any studies that will back up his 
government's claim that this legislation will lead to increased 
crop diversification and enhanced value added production.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13332"> 13332 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time, given his commitment to small business, 
can he tell us and the farmers of western Canada what transition 
measures he believes are necessary to secure the future of rural 
communities given the immediate withdrawal of federal support 
for grain transportation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is not familiar with 
my riding and its nature. There is very little agricultural activity 
in my riding.
<P>
	The member mentions rural Saskatchewan and that I should 
have some understanding of these issues. My grandfather would 
agree because he, my mother's father, was the member of 
Parliament for Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan and spoke often of 
the concerns of agriculture in the House in the 1950s.
<P>
	The budget is balanced. Perhaps the hon. member is not aware 
that in last year's budget Atlantic Canada took quite a strong hit. 
We lost a lot of military bases. Close to my riding, the base in 
Shearwater was cut by 40 per cent. We lost the base in 
Cornwallis and have had other cuts across Atlantic Canada in the 
1994 budget. It was gratifying and satisfying to see a greater 
balance in this budget.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member talks about the problem of diversification in 
agriculture. Canola, invented in western Canada, is one of the 
products being grown more and more in western Canada and is 
providing a real good cash crop for western farmers. The area is 
also seeing more development and work in terms of bio-fuels. 
Both of these commodities are the kinds of things that can 
provide for western diversification and allow farmers to keep 
operating in western Canada, which I think is very important.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak to Bill C-76 for the second time. While previously 
I spoke on the total content of the act, today I wish to speak to 
part V of the act and particularly on social transfer and social 
programs.
<P>
	While I understand the concept behind the change of payment 
of social services to the provinces and the need for taking some 
drastic steps, I am concerned about the application of the funds.
<P>
	We all know the importance of social programs and the high 
rate of acceptance by Canadians for such programs, amounting 
to over 70 per cent of our population.
<P>
	The legislation for the Canada assistance plan was passed in 
1996, but since then over 14 million people either were born in 
Canada or came as immigrants. Provinces in the meantime have 
become more progressive and have asked for more autonomy. 
The new legislation will offer greater flexibility to the provinces 
to deal with the distribution of social programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All this would be fine if the government did not have to cut 
payments to the provinces. These cuts are necessary to deal with 
the debt and the deficit. If payments were to continue on the 
same basis as in the past, they would soon have to be phased out 
altogether.
<P>
	Although these are sensible decisions, we cannot forget those 
who will suffer most as a result of these cuts. When Canadian 
taxpayers asked us not to raise taxes, I often explained this 
would mean cutting services and programs, which would not 
help the poor and those who need social assistance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Being on welfare has become a stigma. Society has a tendency 
to label people without taking into consideration that life is not 
treating everybody in the same manner. We know that as long as 
there are rich there will be poor, but it is up to the rest of society 
to make sure the needy are treated fairly. People on welfare are 
very vulnerable and have to struggle to keep afloat.
<P>
	Too many people are poor in Canada. One child out of five 
lives under the poverty line and where there are poor children 
there are poor parents. Statistics do not mean much. They are 
just numbers and behind them there are real people. Every 
percentage point means several human beings, each one of them 
with rights and privileges like everybody else.
<P>
	In my riding many of the children in the inner schools eat only 
one meal a day provided by the school board. They wear clothes 
donated to them and never want to go home because they do not 
have a home, they have a house, often empty, where there is no 
warmth or affection. Often children look for affection elsewhere 
with the consequences we all know.
<P>
	Last week the Minister of Health was in an inner school of my 
riding to announce the head start program for aboriginal 
families. The children in the school, many aboriginal, gave the 
minister a great welcome. She spoke to the children. She spent 
time with them and this, for the children who spoke to the 
minister, was probably the highlight of their school year and was 
a great shot in the arm for the parents who were present and for 
the teachers and the principal who live with all the difficulties 
day in and day out.
<P>
	Some say God made mothers because he could not be 
everywhere. Long ago I added to the word mother, intended for 
parent, the word teacher because of the hard work many of them 
do with many of our children, especially with those who need it 
the most.
<P>
	These children are not mere numbers. They are individuals, 
our men and women of tomorrow. What an opportunity we miss. 
They could be the professionals and the tradesmen of tomorrow 
and a lot of potential is going to waste because of the lack of 
resources they are faced with. These children represent 
one-fifth of the population of tomorrow.

<P>
	The other day I visited skid row in Vancouver. In one of the 
hotels I met a young aboriginal man, and we had a conversation. 
This young man, who is very intelligent, had finished high 
school, went to college for two years and to university for three, 
and had lived a decent life until he started using drugs. What a 
shame and what a waste.
<P>
	There was also a very young woman who was coming out of 
the hotel. She was too young and too vulnerable to be going to a 
hotel on skid row. What a shame and what a waste.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This misery can be found all over the world, but in Canada we 
should not allow it to happen. CAP exists to try to give some 
dignity to people who would otherwise live in sheer poverty.
<P>
	My concern about the new system is the loss of the five rights 
which up to now have been imposed on CAP: the right to income 
when in need; the right to an amount of income that takes into 
account budgetary requirements; the right to appeal; the right 
not to have to work or train for welfare; and the right to income 
assistance regardless of the province you are from.
<P>
	Part V of Bill C-76 only maintains the fifth right requiring 
that ``no period of minimum residency be required or allowed 
with respect to social assistance''. Maintaining only this right is 
not enough. Each province could go in a different direction and 
deny welfare for other reasons. This would increase poverty and 
crime and would put even more people on the street. If a 
province denies individuals welfare, it is possible to move to 
another province, but if all the provinces do the same, where 
would people go for help? South of the border?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Poverty is everywhere. Last week, my opposition colleague 
said that in a separate Quebec, there would be no more poverty, 
but I think we will have to think very seriously about all of us 
working together, if we want to reduce poverty and improve the 
circumstances of so many Canadians. I believe that united we 
stand and that together we can get the best results.
<P>
	I know that the bill provides for consultations with the 
provinces to reach mutual agreement on social programs. But I 
also believe that if we maintain the five principles of the welfare 
program at the federal level, we can at least have a discussion 
based on these principles.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The House finance committee in its recent report has backed 
the right of appeal. This is a very sound decision and an 
important recommendation. I would like, as would many other 
people, to see this recommendation implemented and the 
remaining rights maintained.
<P>
	Let me go back to my riding where there is the only 
emergency day care in the city of Vancouver. The greatest 
majority of children in day care have drug related and alcohol 
related syndrome. The reason: poverty. In my riding, there is the 
food bank where tons and tons of food are distributed on a 
regular basis to hundreds of people. The food bank is not alone 
in offering this service; other good hearted people do the same. 
This is found all over Canada. If we abandon the rights of CAP, 
we also abandon these people creating a new category of poor. 
Because of this action we will have many more program 
disparities than we have now.
<P>
	I have met several people since budget day. These people have 
the poor at heart. They are those who work on skid row, those 
who teach in the inner schools, those who deal with people with 
disabilities. I thank these people for their assistance to me over 
this month. They really hope that when the minister of human 
resources meets with his provincial counterparts they will find a 
consensus and will keep the five rights.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not sure I could take part in this 
questions and comments period. Thank you for recognizing me. 
I would just like to ask my hon. colleague a question.
<P>
	She talked about poverty in general, mentioning Canadian 
unity and Quebec sovereignty of course, and finally, quoted the 
principle of strength through unity. That is a principle often 
quoted even in my riding. However, based on fact rather than 
principles, in 1980, the Canadian debt was approximately $90 
billion and unemployment was much lower than it is today. In 
Quebec alone, there were half as many people on welfare in 
1980 as there are now.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	So it was decided in 1980 that Canadian unity should be 
maintained. Fifteen years later, the debt has skyrocketed to 
nearly $550 billion and will reach $700 billion in just a few 
years, we are told; it is growing very fast. Unemployment is not 
double what it was, but almost. We now have 808,000 people on 
welfare. During these 15 years, we have come to realize that the 
gap between rich and poor is widening. The middle class is 
disappearing before our very eyes. Could the hon. member 
please explain how the strength through unity principle applies 
in that context?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that what my hon. 
colleague just said is incorrect because, as you know, this matter 
has implications not only in Canada but also throughout the 
world. I also think that in 1980, when Quebec decided against 
separating from the rest of Canada, the battle for separation was 
not over and this has been a source of major instability across 
the country. I think that while it may not be the only cause of 
poverty, it certainly is a contributing factor.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Vancouver East, like the hon. 
member from Halifax before her, has an obligation to all 
Canadians to review and ensure that their support for legislation 
is fair.
<P>
	I am wondering if the hon. member for Vancouver East 
understands that if the bill before us cuts $1 million from 
various rural communities that it will result in the loss of 
elevators, increased input costs for farmers and decreased prices 
for farmers. I have newspaper clippings galore here that indicate 
all sorts of problems will result in agriculture trade as a result of 
this legislation.
<P>
	How can the hon. member in all good conscience support this 
legislation when these immediate and long term impacts will be 
so devastating on prairie people?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana:</B> Mr. Speaker, not only the prairies and the 
farmers have been hit in this budget but many other people have 
as well. This budget is not good at all for the people in my riding. 
They will suffer.
<P>
	We have subsidies and subsidies were cut which of course is 
not a pleasant thing to do. However they had to come to an end. 
There is a transition period and $1.6 billion is being offered to 
the farmers to adjust to the new situation. In my duties as a 
member of the transportation committee I also asked a question 
about the effect of Crow for instance on transportation. It seems 
they are not very concerned about it. I would like to see the 
situation adjust. It is tough we have had to do that, but we have 
taken great care to be equitable in our cuts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to inform you right away that I will share my time with my 
colleague from Terrebonne.
<P>
	I am very happy to speak again today to Bill C-76, which is a 
major bill allowing this government to implement various 
provisions of the hon. finance minister's budget.
<P>
	As everyone will agree, one of the key elements of Bill C-76 
is the planned cuts to the federal government's transfers to the 
provinces. With some $7 billion in cuts to be spread over the 
next three years, $2.5 billion will be cut in Quebec alone. For the 
Quebec government, this is in keeping with its relations with the 
federal government, which, in the last 12 years, has deprived 
Quebec of $14 billion. This represents over $1 billion a year, 
which easily explains why the Quebec government is in a 
difficult financial situation. This can be seen throughout the 
health care sector. In the Montreal region alone, there is talk of 
closing between seven and nine hospitals, if I remember 
correctly.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	We must be aware that the cuts imposed on Quebec by the 
federal government are at the heart of the problem, particularly 
as far as hospitals are concerned. It is too easy to blame the 
messenger for the bad news. Real courage means taking 
responsibility and facing the situation, as the Quebec 
government is doing, unlike the people here who prefer to hide 
their decisions.
<P>
	All the cuts made in recent years have led, as my Vancouver 
colleague pointed out, to the proliferation of food banks, which 
unfortunately have become increasingly important in the daily 
lives of too many Canadians and Quebecers. Cuts are therefore 
the first element of the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	The second element is implementation. To add insult to 
injury, the federal government is not only cutting transfers to the 
provinces but also imposing its own standards. The provinces 
will not be free to use the amounts still available as they see fit. 
We know that in a few years cuts will not even be an issue, since 
there will be no more federal transfers. Yet, the federal 
government dares to impose standards.
<P>
	As the provinces already have to comply with federal health 
and welfare standards, they will now be required to conform to 
federal standards in social services and post-secondary 
education. Federal involvement in these areas violates the 
constitution.
<P>
	The rules for running the country are set out in the Canadian 
constitution. Section 93, in particular, provides for this kind of 
thing. For a great many years, we have been aware that the 
federal government contravenes the Canadian constitution, in 
particular section 93, by disregarding provincial jurisdictional 
claims in the areas of health, post-secondary education, social 
services and welfare. Despite its cuts, the federal government 
dares to impose and expand standards in areas that are none of 
its concern.
<P>
	The third and last element, which is related to the Canada 
social transfer, is the fact that the UI fund is currently growing. 
Need I remind members that contributions to this fund are made 
by those workers lucky enough to have a job and by their 
employers?
<P>
	Thanks to the insight of the hon. member for Mercier, who is 
the Bloc critic on social issues, we feel, and rightly so, that the 
federal government is preparing its strategy against the 
provinces by letting the UI fund grow, while at the same time 
going after the provinces by imposing cuts in the transfers made 
to them.
<P>
	Soon, the government will be offering to the financially 
strapped provinces money-that is money which does not 
belong to it but, rather, to the workers and companies 
contributing to the UI fund-to help meet new needs, or to 
implement readjusted manpower training programs from coast 
to coast.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13335"> 13335 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will tell the provinces: We have money. You 
do not have any, but we do. However, that money will not be the 
federal government's money. It will be money contributed to the 
UI fund by ordinary workers and by the companies which 
employ them. There is something immoral in all this, something 
which we will denounce as long as we are here.
<P>
	Our position regarding the Canada social transfer is very 
simple: It should not exist. The federal government should mind 
its own business; it should comply with section 93 of the 
Constitution and withdraw from provincial fields of 
jurisdiction. The savings thus made could be used to reduce 
taxes, and the federal government could give the tax points to 
the provinces, including Quebec. The situation would then be 
much clearer and certainly more normal.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-76 was the subject of debate on the last opposition day, 
last Thursday. The official opposition denounced the operation 
that it saw taking shape, the scheming, and that is perhaps just 
the tip of the iceberg, with Bill C-76 that we are looking at 
today, Bill C-88 on internal trade, Bill C-46 on the new 
Department of Industry, and Bill C-91, an act to continue the 
Federal Business Development Bank under the name Business 
Development Bank of Canada.
<P>
	We see in this bill, and that is our right, a scheme first to stop 
Quebec in its tracks and surround it and then to quietly lay the 
groundwork for a post-referendum scenario in which Quebecers 
will have decided to stay in Canada. And, in that scenario, the 
other provinces will find themselves in the same boat as Quebec, 
whose decision not to leave will be disastrous.
<P>
	We denounced this scheme last Thursday. At that time the 
member for Edmonton Southwest applied some, I would think, 
rather unparliamentary terms to us, and I quote: ``The Bloc 
Quebecois is suffering from tribalism, with its constant 
harangue that certain federal policies are centralist and target 
Quebec''.
<P>
	I would simply like to remind our colleague for Edmonton 
Southwest that we are doing our job, that we are perhaps 
showing some vision of the Canada of tomorrow, and that it is 
also the responsibility of the members of the Reform Party to 
help preserve the integrity of this Canada, because we are 
witnessing an insidious move by the federal government to 
centralize Canada to the detriment of the provincial 
governments that they are supposed to be representing, which 
will soon become regional governments. That is what the future 
holds. They perhaps have the right to see it this way, but this 
view is certainly not unanimous throughout Canada. It is 
disastrous for Quebec. If this scheme succeeds, a nation that has 
the right and the desire to exist may disappear.
<P>
	To be accused of tribalism is rather insulting. I wonder 
whether it was ignorance or bad faith that made the hon. member 
for Edmonton Southwest and his colleagues use such language 
and show so little understanding and respect for the position of 
the Bloc Quebecois on the future of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to draw your attention to a recent 
initiative that hardly reflects the intent of Bill C-76. I am 
referring to a flyer distributed recently in Quebec under the 
auspices of Power Corporation-friends, and we know who they 
are-and to all Canadian homes. This flyer, and we do not know 
how much it cost, describes the attractions of Canada Day.
<P>
	To spend that kind of money now is rather obscene. I may 
recall that the Department of Canadian Heritage, which is 
responsible for publishing the flyer, had a budget of $1,066,000 
for community groups which lost one million to cutbacks. This 
leaves $66,000. Imagine how much this flyer costs, compared 
with the remaining $66,000?
<P>
	This seems rather unethical. Furthermore, after the flyer was 
sent to all Canadian homes, a poll was taken, and my wife had 
the privilege of being called by the Comquest firm, always at the 
expense of the public purse. While vaunting the merits of the 
National Capital, some leading questions were asked with the 
emphasis on Canadian unity, while pretending there was no 
connection at all with the referendum, certainly not.
<P>
	You get people like the ineffable President of the Queen's 
Privy Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, 
who make fun of the Government of Quebec and its public 
consultations on the future of Quebec, a government that wants 
to provide information and find out what people think and still 
has a 1-800 line to give this information to the people of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Instead of sending these flyers, perhaps the federal 
government should write to the citizens of Canada and explain 
its vision of and its plans for the Canada of the future. That 
would be a lot more democratic than this miserable little flyer.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a brief comment and put a question to the 
hon. member with regard to the social transfer.
<P>
	As the member well knows, under the Canada Health Act the 
federal government is empowered to enforce the provisions of 
that. Those provisions are that our medicare is universal, 
portable, accessible, publicly administered, and 
comprehensive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13336"> 13336 </A></B>
<P>
	The transfer presently to the provinces with regard to health 
care is in the form of both tax points and cash. The member will 
well know from the current example with regard to the clinics in 
Alberta that the Minister of Health has indicated that in the 
event that the Alberta government does not respect and uphold 
those principles of the Canada Health Act there will be a 
withholding of the cash amounts relative to the extra billing in 
Alberta.
<P>
	Under the Canada health and social transfer, the government 
has combined the transfer mechanisms primarily because of the 
cash component. In the event that there was no cash component 
with individual programs, the government would have 
absolutely no leverage whatsoever to help to protect those 
standards and those principles of the Canada Health Act and of 
the other programs.
<P>
	The member will well know that the provinces do not 
necessarily spend the moneys transferred to them. Whether it be 
post-secondary education, health, or social programs, they do 
not necessarily direct those funds received for the purpose for 
which they were given. In fact the provinces have the latitude.
<P>
	Since the provinces are already spending the money in a form 
they believe is appropriate for their province, how would 
combining the transfers for all the programs under one impact, if 
at all, the present operations of the provincial governments?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, what struck me in my 
colleague's question is that, in the spirit of the Constitution, a 
jurisdiction like health falls strictly under the purview of the 
provinces. It is unconstitutional for the federal government to 
intervene in the way it does, exchanging assistance for 
adherence to standards. From an historical perspective, this is an 
abuse of its power to spend. And historically, it has also always 
granted itself the corresponding powers to tax, and this has been 
going on since the end of the second world war.
<P>
	This allows it to intervene today, some might argue in a 
responsible way, but I must say that we in Quebec have no need 
for this. We are stuck with the federal government, stuck with 
paying it $30 billion each year and stuck with its standards in 
areas for which Quebecers already have institutions. We have no 
pretensions, but we also have nothing to learn from it regarding 
social democracy and sound social organization principles.
<P>
	This order of things may well suit the rest of Canada. We see 
that the Canadian government holds a larger place in the hearts 
of Canadians than Quebecers: our first allegiance is to the 
government of Quebec. Therefore, the internal logic of Canada 
may make a central government in Ottawa work well. That will 
be your decision to make in the post-referendum context. But, 
now, the logic of Canada contrasts with the logic of Quebec, and 
we ask Canada to withdraw from this kind of thing and to let the 
government of Quebec keep its tax  points in order to administer 
health, all social issues and education.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in this House to speak on a bill that, 
according to the government opposite, gives the provinces more 
decision making room, while taking $7 billion away from them, 
in the space of two years.
<P>
	With absolute seriousness, the Liberals are proclaiming for 
all to hear that this is new flexible federalism. The provinces are 
not being given the right to withdraw; the federal government is 
clearly opting out financially with the aim of reducing its debt 
and balancing its budget, if possible. In reality, the federal 
government is cutting off the provinces and giving itself more 
right to supervise and to intervene.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	During the course of this debate you have heard words like 
demagoguery and bilge. I am going to quote documents of the 
present government, not documents of the Conservatives and 
not documents of the wicked separatists, but documents of the 
Liberals, who lacked the courage to note in their red book that 
they would drop the most disadvantaged after cutting them off.
<P>
	They also failed to note that they would make students in 
Quebec and Canada meet national standards after they cut off 
their financial support. I am going to quote documents from 
members and documents from ministers, who are present today 
in this House. The $7 billion cuts are contained in the latest 
budget. It provides for $2.5 billion in 1996-97 and $4.5 billion 
in 1997-98; 2.5 and 4.5 add up in my books to $7 billion in cuts, 
as set out in the budget.
<P>
	As regards the national standards, which cause the Minister of 
Finance to say, and I quote: ``[I] will be inviting all provincial 
governments to work together on developing, through mutual 
consent, a set of shared principles and objectives that could 
underlie the new Canada Social Transfer''. This is a quote from 
the minister, the member for LaSalle-Émard.
<P>
	What happens if there is no agreement, no mutual consent? It 
seems to me that, in 1981, there was agreement and mutual 
consent in the case of nine provinces out of ten. Since that 
agreement, Quebec has suffered the shame and affront of 
unilateral patriation. Our motto is: ``Je me souviens'', and we 
remember.
<P>
	We must also bear in mind that the current Prime Minister was 
a major player in this coup against Quebec, and that he is now 
promising to be reasonable, as he told this House. But if the 
future is anything like the past, in Quebec, we are in for more 
unilateral encroachments.
<P>
	They talk about agreement, respect and mutual consent, while 
at the same time federal officials are producing documents that I 
would describe politely as somewhat centralizing. The report of 
the national education standards committee, a 130 page report  
submitted to the Prime Minister recommends among other 
things-this is recommendation No. 1-that standards of excel-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13337"> 13337 </A></B>
<P>
lence be defined at every level and in every field of education 
and training. These standards should reflect the highest national 
and international levels of performance and should be regarded 
as the primary objective to be achieved by students.
<P>
	This recommendation, made in a report dated May 1994, 
under the Liberals, clearly shows the direction taken by this 
government even before any consultations were conducted: cuts 
and growing interference in an area which, I remind you, has 
been under exclusive provincial jurisdiction since 1867. That 
gives us an idea of what to expect from Bill C-76 and mutual 
consent.
<P>
	That is not all; there is more. Recommendation No. 2 states 
that a higher percentage of education spending should be 
directed to research and development. What spending? Who will 
control that spending? Every one in Quebec, including Ghislain 
Dufour and the Liberal MPPs, wants control over manpower 
training to be returned to the province.
<P>
	Further in the report, it is recommended that the federal 
government provide assistance for the development and 
administration of tests on every basic subject. It should be 
pointed out that we are talking about a provincial jurisdiction 
here.
<P>
	Another recommendation: That every level of government 
make it a priority to earmark sufficient funds to analyze and 
make maximum use of the results and implement recommended 
changes.
<P>
	It so happens that, in Quebec, we have a Ministry of Education 
with 5,000 employees. Other provinces also have ministries of 
education. In addition, in Quebec, we are currently holding a 
summit conference on education. That shows how little respect 
the federal government has for local and provincial authorities. 
Why is it so bent on increasing costly duplication and overlap?
<P>
	Through Bill C-76, the federal government makes $7 billion 
in cuts here and there. As was mentioned with regard to the 
report on national education standards, its presence is being 
intensified in exclusive local or provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	This report refers to an annual conference on national 
education problems, to a national review organization, and so 
on. From the outset, I have been trying to demonstrate that Bill 
C-76 provides for national standards, that the federal 
government's centralizing approach has led us to expect the 
worst as far as the definition of these standards is concerned. 
The only report on national education standards reflects the 
education policy contemplated by this government.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I have been unable to address the issue of 
social services or that of health care, which, as my colleague 
from Trois-Rivières said earlier, has also been under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction since 1867. Other reports by the Bloc 
Quebecois have demonstrated the federal government's 
irresponsibility in these areas in connection with Bill C-76.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to quote two excerpts from an 
editorial by Michel Vastel. The first excerpt relating to Bill 
C-76 reads as follows: ``Any province that does not mention the 
federal government's contribution will be fined. The financial 
penalty, to be recommended by the federal minister, can go as 
far as withdrawing the total contribution under the Canada 
social transfer. Such a penalty could amount to roughly $7 
billion''.
<P>
	A Liberal member asked earlier why we objected to putting 
social programs, health and education in the same bag. Failure 
to comply with a given agreement may lead to the loss of the 
whole package. For Quebec, this would translate into a $7 
billion penalty simply on the recommendation of the federal 
minister.
<P>
	The second excerpt from the same editorial is this: ``Notices 
saying something like ``This service is provided thanks to a 
contribution from the Government of Canada'' will now be 
displayed in hospital lobbies and on Quebec health insurance 
forms''. The size of letters, the colour of the maple leaf will be 
determined by memorandums of understanding, mutual 
agreements and umpteen meetings of federal and provincial 
officials.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving us the opportunity to 
speak to Bill C-76.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Mississauga 
South, for a question or a comment.
<P>
	As the hon. member may know, I always try to give the floor 
to a member from a party other than the one represented by the 
previous speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
expect that another hon. member would also like to comment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13338"> 13338 </A></B>
<P>
	With regard to the social transfers, the question has been 
raised as to whether they should be going into one pool. If the 
Bloc has a problem with grouping them together, knowing full 
well that the provinces spend the funds wherever they want 
anyway, would the member agree to mandating that all dollars 
transferred for health care be spent on health care, that all 
dollars transferred for education be spent on education, that all 
dollars transferred for social programs be spent on social 
programs, and that the provinces would have absolutely no 
discretion in that spending?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I find that, when it comes to streamlining this whole 
transfer process, Quebec probably has the ideal solution: we pay 
our taxes to the  province and we make our laws in the province. 
This is what we call sovereignty. This is what we want to do, so 
as to avoid all these problems.
<P>
	The reason why we oppose these national standards and these 
costs is very simple. As I said earlier, the number one 
recommendation of the committee on national standards for 
education provides for basic national standards on all subjects 
taught and on all training programs. The federal government 
also says in the report that it wants to see more science and 
technology courses. Sure, but if, for example, Newfoundland 
would rather offer more courses related to fisheries or social 
issues, what will happen if national standards are in place? That 
is my first example.
<P>
	Let me give you another. Do we really want to allocate the 
money earmarked for education to education, and the budgets 
for health care to health care?
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I am personally convinced that the Canadian provinces as a 
whole are responsible and that they will allocate the funds where 
it is necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the hon. member for Terrebonne, who wants 
certain powers. It is said that all the English provinces are 
getting together to demand more autonomy, that they are also in 
favour of decentralized government. Mr. Johnson says he keeps 
hearing the same message when he travels across Canada. And 
Mr. Bourassa said the same thing.
<P>
	Everyone wants more power. No one is satisfied, and 
especially not Quebec. Why do we go on making these demands 
year after year? Why do we keep saying we must do something 
that is very worthwhile and make Quebec sovereign?
<P>
	My colleague talked about education, and we realize that 
Quebec is lagging behind, because they wanted to create a lag in 
research and development. In the Gaspé alone, 10,000 students 
have left the region. I want to ask the hon. member: Why is 
Quebec not, and never will be-in my estimation-satisfied 
with the situation in post-secondary education?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for Matapédia-Matane for asking me this question. 
Education is my specialty, and although I do not think I have the 
answer, I may have part of the answer.
<P>
	First of all, as he said earlier, at the post-secondary level 
students, like workers who have trouble finding a job, have to 
cope with overlapping programs and duplication, whether we 
are talking about federal or provincial programs.
<P>
	I believe that as members of the Bloc Quebecois, we are more 
interested in education, which is a provincial jurisdiction, than 
members on the other side of the House, and I know why. They 
have other things on their minds, so let the government render 
unto the provinces what belongs to the provinces, like 
education, so they can get on with other business.
<P>
	Now I would like to explain why young people are against 
national standards for education. As my colleague said, in 
Matapédia-Matane, for instance, they might need special 
emphasis on a particular sector, and that is what the états 
généraux de l'éducation au Québec are bound to conclude.
<P>
	But how can we have national standards in an area that, when 
the Fathers of Confederation signed their agreement, was a 
provincial responsibility? Or so we are told. But how can we 
have similar standards for health care in Quebec, Ontario and 
Newfoundland? The federal government has imposed national 
standards for health care. What Bill C-76 wants to impose is the 
same medicine-no pun intended-this time for education. 
They want to set national standards for education.
<P>
	When? Just when the government is going to cut funding. In 
other words, it gives less money to a province, gives more 
orders, and the province has to fall in line, otherwise funding for 
all programs will be cut: social assistance, education and health 
care. That is why we object.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
approximately a year ago Canada began an incredible 
transformation, a change that has had a profound impact on all 
of us in this Chamber and on Canadians everywhere.
<P>
	I am talking about finally coming to grips with our national 
debt, which over the years has now reached the unconscionable 
level of $550 billion and which demands so much of our interest 
that one-third of all of the tax revenue paid by Canadians to the 
federal government goes just to pay the interest. One-quarter of 
all federal government expenditures today are simply to pay the 
interest on our debt, let alone not paying it down at all. We have 
had to come to grips with that, and ever increasing annual debt 
adding to it. It has not been easy.
<P>
	In the past governments have always been in the mode of 
giving things to people, of increasing programs, of increasing 
expenditures. Maybe it does not come easily to a lot of us to start 
to look at the reality and come to grips with our debt and deficit 
crisis. We have done it. One of the amazing things that we on the 
finance committee learned as we travelled across the country is 
that Canadians, from the richest to the poorest, all said we must 
get the deficit and debt under control. There was a lot of 
legitimate debate on how to go about it, but as we opened up the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13339"> 13339 </A></B>
<P>
public hearings Canadians were committed to the reality that we 
had to find a new way of doing things.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In the budget bill before us, Bill C-76, we have really 
attacked what in the past have been three sacred cows in 
Canadian government. The first is the western grain 
transportation subsidy, which for all of this century has given an 
incredible subsidy to grain farmers in the west to help them get 
their grain to market and to help them be competitive in what is 
really a dirty international market wracked and plagued by 
subsidies of enormous quantities in many countries.
<P>
	It will not be easy for our prairie farmers. There are 
transitional provisions to help ease the burden and help them 
find ways to bear some of the brunt of the burden. It is not easy 
for us to have to say that this can no longer be the way we do 
business.
<P>
	The second sacred cow we have had to gore is our public 
service. We have had to cut 14 per cent of our public service, or 
45,000 public service jobs over the next three years. This is not 
easy for us. Those of us who have been in government for a long 
time realize that we are fortunate have a highly competent 
public service, with people who could be earning much more in 
the private sector but who feel they have a pride in actually 
serving their government.
<P>
	This tradition was built up in Canada over this century, a 
position of great pride in our public service. Names that come to 
mind are the Robertsons, the John Holmes, and people who gave 
Canada a name internationally because of their intelligence and 
their commitment. They were the ones who got us into 
international peacekeeping. We can find individuals like this in 
every department.
<P>
	For us to say we have to cut them, let us say to our public 
servants that we recognize that maybe they do not deserve it. 
They do not. We recognize they have made a great contribution 
to our country, and it is with heavy hearts that we have to put 
45,000 people on the street.
<P>
	There are a couple of ways you can do it. We went through a 
program review. Every program was looked at to see if it could 
be eliminated or whether it could be done better elsewhere or 
whether it was really necessary in order to eliminate 
expenditures and bring down the deficit.
<P>
	The normal way to go about making the cuts is that all those 
people in a program that is axed would be asked to leave the 
public service. There are severance packages. We are 
contributing a large amount of money to ease the burden of 
transition from public to private life. However, we would be 
losing many very competent public servants if that were the way 
we were to proceed. From a management point of view it is 
quick and certain. After we on the finance committee listened at 
length to many of the public service unions we thought there 
might be a better way. We learned from them that there are 
people in many departments who might want to take the early 
retirement package and leave the public service,  even if their 
program or department was not going to be axed.
<P>
	The concept of substitution came out. The government tried to 
negotiate with the public sector unions and they almost had an 
agreement on how all the cuts could be made on a voluntary 
basis. At the last minute the agreement did not come about.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	In listening to the witnesses we determined it would be very 
important to approximate some type of voluntary substitution 
program. Those who wanted to avail themselves of the early 
retirement package could, and people could switch from one 
department to another.
<P>
	We were told all of these 45,000 jobs could be replaced on a 
voluntary basis and we therefore have encouraged the ministers 
and the finance committee to do that recognizing that in many 
cases this might not be practical. We have also asked the public 
sector unions to work with the minister in not only the 
promulgation of the guidelines for alternates but also in their 
carrying out.
<P>
	The minister has been very responsible in responding to these 
entreaties on our behalf and the unions. From what I understand 
we are to have a much more humane and practical way of 
downsizing the public service than if we took the easy way out. 
It may take longer but we will have public servants who want to 
stay in the public service.
<P>
	The third sacred cow we have had to take on is transfer 
payments to the provinces. By way of brief background, under 
the current regime that has existed up until now we have four 
types of transfer payments from the federal government to the 
provinces. One is for equalization to the poorer provinces to 
give them a certain level of public service. In the budget we have 
not cut any of these equalization payments.
<P>
	The second type of equalization payment is under the Canada 
assistance plan from the federal government to match the funds 
put forward by provinces to deal with Canadians who are in need 
or who suffer from disabilities, the most disadvantaged and the 
poor. The province establishes the program and we match its 
funding. There are very few controls or strings over this money 
right now.
<P>
	The third area is established programs financing which has 
two components. One is for post-secondary education where 
there are no federal strings attached whatsoever. The second is 
for health. We have a number of strings on this. The Canada 
Health Act says a province has to meet the five criteria of the 
Canada Health Act or else we can cut back the funding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13340"> 13340 </A></B>
<P>
	We are cutting back the $7 billion of transfer payments over a 
two-year period. We do not do this with alacrity because we 
know how important expenditures in these areas are. If anybody 
thinks we can cut the deficit without cutting in this area, they are 
wrong.
<P>
	Under this new regime there will be a combination of the three 
programs, the CAP, the EPF for post-secondary education, and 
the EPF transfers for health, into one transfer payment instead of 
the two; combining the two into one, called the Canada health 
and social transfer.
<P>
	We have not touched equalization. In the bill we have 
mandated the Minister of Human Resources Development 
through mutual consent with the provinces to develop principles 
and objectives for social assistance and post-secondary 
education.
<P>
	Members of the opposition and many Canadians who 
appeared before us said that if we continue on the trend 
established in the budget for the next two years we will run out 
of cash payments. There will be no more cash payments to the 
provinces. In some cases it will be after 4 years; in some cases 
maybe after 11 or 12 years.
<P>
	How can the federal government have any voice? How can we 
have any voice if we do not have cash? This is why our 
committee recommended in the future there must be a cash 
component. What will this do?
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	For the first time where we have very few standards today the 
provinces will have a major voice in determining the standards 
applied.
<P>
	Because the amount of the cash transfer under the Canada 
health and social transfer is to diminish by $7 million over two 
years, people say we will have less clout with the provinces to 
force them into national standards, objectives, shared principles 
or whatever.
<P>
	The object is not to force the provinces into anything. We have 
said we want the minister to sit down with them and develop 
through mutual consent. That means talking with them about the 
principles they want. This does not mean we are imposing them.
<P>
	In the future, supposing we agree on shared principles or 
objectives, we will still need some money as part of the cash 
transfer to the provinces to enforce standards such as with the 
Canada Health Act which we are not touching. This is why we 
went beyond the budget and did something which a finance 
committee has not done in the past to my knowledge. We not 
only reported Bill C-76 back to the House but we did so with an 
additional report, report 16 of the finance committee wherein we 
said that in future years future Ministers of Finance-we know it 
will be this one for a long time, many decades perhaps-must 
have a cash component in order to ensure the standards under the 
Canada Health Act or new standards developed with the consent 
of the provinces are enforced.
<P>
	Another concern related to the most disadvantaged 
economically, those at the bottom of the heap, those who do not 
have jobs, single parents whose children are living in poverty, 
those who are not working and the working poor, those referred 
to as the ones who get welfare or social assistance which were 
part of the Canada assistance plan in the past.
<P>
	In the Canada assistance plan we matched transfers but we are 
no longer doing it. It is all combined in one payment. We heard a 
tremendous amount of testimony from the National 
Anti-Poverty Organization, from community groups such as the 
one here in Ottawa working with the poor, giving them health 
care and other assistance through a number of volunteers, many 
right across the country.
<P>
	The federal government is cutting its transfers to provinces 
that are not the neediest, those with the least political clout, the 
provinces that will stop giving them the money. We have no 
control now over whether the provinces give support to the 
needy. If they do, we will match it.
<P>
	When the finance committee set out last fall to prepare for the 
budget, we reported we would have to make massive cuts. We 
said we did not want these cuts to be made on the backs of the 
poorest because they are already down and out. They are the 
ones who in many cases cannot stand more cuts.
<P>
	This is why in our report to the House of Commons we urged 
the finance minister and particularly the Minister for Human 
Resources Development when he talks to the provinces to make 
sure the most in need are not the ones who are cut out of the 
programs, children in poverty, the working poor and the others 
who are not there.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	We heard testimony from the National Anti-Poverty 
Organization that according to its best estimates only about 3 
per cent of those who are on welfare today are abusing the 
system. Even if its figures were twice what it us they were, are 
the abuses of a few people sufficient to bring down our wrath on 
all of the people?
<P>
	We have to be very careful when we are making these cuts that 
we have our priorities straight and that we do not prejudice those 
who are already the most vulnerable, those who are most 
deserving of our support in what we consider and always want to 
consider to be a compassionate and caring society.
<P>
	Because we are combining the two or three transfers into one, 
even though it is smaller there will be greater economic clout in 
the short term to enforce standards that might be agreed to and to 
protect the five principles of the Canada Health Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13341"> 13341 </A></B>
<P>
	Over the longer term and in the more distant future we are 
urging that future budgets retain a cash component so these 
principles can be observed.
<P>
	I started off by saying our national debt is a crisis we could not 
ignore. Past governments have overspent. It is not for us, I 
believe, a fruitful course to say-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
``It was the Liberals, it was the Conservatives, or because of the 
NDP's support''. It is up to us, to all Canadians, all Members of 
Parliament from all parties to deal with crises and to do better to 
build a better future.
<P>
	We have begun our all out battle against the deficit. We must 
do it fairly, humbly and with the knowledge that by doing 
something about it today, we can build a stronger and more 
prosperous Canada for our children and our children's children. 
Such is our duty, and we will do our duty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was very appreciative of the comments the member made 
referring to the Canada Health Act and other social programs 
like that. He said, and I agree with him, if anybody thinks we can 
cut the deficit without cutting in this area they are wrong. I am 
being quite serious, not sarcastic. I hope he and other people 
who are responsible in the Liberal caucus get that message 
through to certain backbenchers like the member for Halifax or 
Beeches-Woodbine.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would agree that in the case of the 
Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act and the doing away 
with the PUITTA grant, that very specifically was a tax increase.
<P>
	The second question is with respect to the downsizing of the 
civil service. The member will recall that in committee I was 
trying to draw the minister out about the reverse of the hiring 
quotas or numerical targets. Does the member understand there 
will be absolutely no attempt on the part of the Liberal 
government to achieve its numerical targets under employment 
equity when it is laying people off by using that process 
selectively to simply do a reverse hiring procedure on the way it 
is planning on doing the hiring procedure to gain its balances?
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Madam Speaker, with respect to the public 
service, we will not do away with the public service act or the 
protection which any public servant has through the Public 
Service Commission and the rules regarding employment 
equity. If the hon. member thinks we are, he is wrong.
<P>
	The beauty of the way we are going about the layoff is that it is 
being undertaken in consultation and in co-operation with the 
public sector unions as well as with management in Treasury 
Board and the various departments. That is why we have 
something which can  work and which will achieve the level of 
substitution on a voluntary basis that we were hoping for.
<P>
	In terms of PUITTA, members will understand that in the last 
budget year we spent $249 million reimbursing public utilities 
which had been privatized and which were in the provinces. We 
were reimbursing them for the income tax we collected.
<P>
	How did they get into the private sector in the provinces 
anyway? They were privatized originally by the provincial 
governments in order to make them more efficient and in order 
to create capital funds for deficit reduction for the provinces. 
Now they are working in the private sector. They were a function 
and a creation of the provincial governments.
<P>
	These utilities and the provincial governments were insisting 
that we continue to give them $249 million a year. Were the 
provinces prepared to rebate the corporate taxes collected by the 
provinces to these utilities? Not one was, even though they were 
creations of the provincial governments. If the provincial 
governments are not prepared to rebate the corporate taxes to 
them, why should the federal government? It is a real anomaly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to take the floor to briefly thank my Liberal 
colleague for so respectfully listening to all of our speeches. I 
would like to make a few comments before asking him my 
question.
<P>
	As he said at the beginning of his speech, he shed some 
crocodile tears because of the abolition of 45,000 public service 
positions in Ottawa and across Canada. I have half a mind to ask 
him where the Liberals boasted about cutting 45,000 positions 
in the red book they talked so much about during the election 
campaign. Since everybody already knows the answer to that 
question, I will not ask it.
<P>
	However, I would like to say that public servants probably 
have more reason to fear a Liberal federalist government in 
Ottawa than to fear the sovereignists who promise that they will 
be integrated into the Quebec public service-a promise that 
will be kept-in their draft bill. These public servants have 
much more to fear, and we now hold the proof-45,000 jobs 
cut-from the other side of the House, because that is where the 
cuts are coming from, and not from our side.
<P>
	I would also like to mention something that my colleague did 
not deem worth repeating in his speech. The cuts for the next two 
years will be in the order of $7 billion, I repeat $7 billion. If we, 
on this side of the House, are mistaken, if this is not truly what is 
written in the Martin budget, perhaps they could give us proof 
and give us other figures than those that the Minister of Finance 
already gave us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13342"> 13342 </A></B>
<P>
	Now to my question. Earlier in your speech, hon. member, 
through you, Madam Speaker, you said to us: ``There are no 
strings attached whatsoever to post-secondary education. Of 
course, we have a number of strings attached on health''. So, 
why does a committee on national education standards exist and 
why has this committee already issued a 130 page report on 
national education standards?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Terrebonne for his questions. First, as regards the 
public service, the minister and the committee insisted on some 
form of co-operation between the unions and the government 
concerning substitution, that is that the retirement arrangement 
must be accepted by individual public servants. Perhaps, and I 
hope so, in the next three years, all government retirees will 
follow the course of substitution making use of the generous 
benefits offered by the government.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Secondly, as concerns national standards in education, neither 
our committee, nor the minister nor the budget will require 
national standards in education. This is surely part of the 
negotiations undertaken by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	In listening to all the witnesses, we were very grateful to a 
group that suggested the standards in the area of education be 
not national, but international, standards of knowledge and 
excellence, given the area is a competitive one.
<P>
	And we, like all Canadians, in Quebec, in British Columbia or 
in any province or territory, must take international competition 
and our own system of education across Canada into account, if 
we are really to take advantage of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member opposite apologized twice. First, he 
admitted that the Liberals and the Conservatives were 
responsible for the national debt. I thank him for admitting that. 
Of course, everyone agrees that we must reduce the deficit.
<P>
	The hon. member also referred to three sacred cows, but he 
forgot one. He forgot the multinationals. Again, everyone agrees 
that multinationals often enjoy tax shelters which are far too 
generous. The same goes for banks. It is a disgrace when banks 
hardly pay any taxes.
<P>
	The cuts in transfers hurt the poor and the young. Our young 
people have almost lost all hope, since they basically have two 
options, particularly in rural areas: unemployment or income 
security. This situation hurts them a great deal. I wonder if we 
could provide more help to these young people.
<P>
	The hon. member did not mention the cuts affecting the 
Eastern Quebec Development Plan. The plan had a budget of 
$6.5 million. That money will not be available next year. The 
provinces will have to pay. Our farmers will have to put up with 
a 15 per cent cut this year, and another one next year, which will 
amount to a 30 per cent reduction in their subsidies. Again, 
Quebec will have to pay.
<P>
	I know that everyone must make sacrifices. People back 
home, and elsewhere, are prepared to make sacrifices. However, 
this does not mean that the poor have to make the biggest 
sacrifices. I ask the hon. member: How could his government 
provide a little help in rural areas and give some hope to people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member was right 
when he said that the poor should be a concern for every party 
and every member in this House.
<P>
	He also referred to the deficits. Indeed, the federal deficits 
were the responsibility of the Conservative and Liberal 
governments, just like the Quebec deficit is now the 
responsibility of the PQ government, whose last budget did not 
do much to solve the problem. I urge all provincial governments 
in Canada to rise to the challenge and do what we are trying to do 
now.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, it is my duty to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty; the hon. member for Bourassa, 
immigration; the hon. member for Essex-Kent, agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, I have a very quick question for 
my colleague.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. The time for 
questions and comments on the last debate has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is an 
honour to stand again in the House, this place where Canadians 
look for leadership, for the proper fiscal management of the 
country, to speak to Bill C-76, the budget implementation act.
<P>
	I must share with everyone that I have considerable 
frustration in this place. Since being elected to the House I am 
convinced that one reason we have the huge problem of debt is 
that we lack an effective mechanism to control it. The reason is 
simple. Governments basically respond to their election 
platform and rightly so.
<P>
	Taking it back one step, unfortunately during election campaigns 
we have trained Canadian voters to be very selfish. Over the last 30 
years we have assisted Canadian voters to not make prudent fiscal 
decisions but simply ones that appeal to their greed. My observa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13343"> 13343 </A></B>
<P>
tion is that this has happened at all levels of government. I know 
it happened in Alberta for a number of years. Albertans were 
persuaded by politicians to vote in favour of spending their 
money in order to put the party into power that promised the 
most using the taxpayers' money.
<P>
	It never made sense to me. I feel to this day that politicians 
who engage in that practice somehow are being unfair to the 
Canadian public. What kind of an option is it to give a person 
when one party says: ``Vote for us and we will give you these 
benefits'' and another party says: ``If you vote for us we will not 
give you those things''. People will vote for the party that will 
give them the most.
<P>
	I am very happy that has now turned around. I am happy that a 
sizeable proportion of Canada's population is beginning to face 
reality. People are voting for and electing members who stand 
on a policy of fiscal responsibility, of reducing government 
spending, of reducing the amount borrowed each year, of 
reducing the debt and hopefully in the long run of reducing the 
amount of taxation.
<P>
	It is a false assumption that if the government stops taxing the 
taxpayers or borrowing against the future taxes of our children 
and grandchildren somehow our economy will suffer. That very 
process erodes our economy more than if we were to stop doing 
it.
<P>
	We need to stop and think what happens when we as a country 
borrow money. We borrow a certain proportion from ourselves 
and it stays in the country. Presumably it stays in circulation and 
aids the economy. When people clip coupons from their Canada 
savings bonds and collect the interest, they may use the money 
for goods and services which adds to our economy.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada also borrows a great deal of money offshore. Every 
year it sends large amounts of money for interest out of the 
country. It is only logical that if it did not have a foreign debt 
then that money would stay in the country and would not just 
disappear.
<P>
	Members need to be very serious in responding to what is the 
new fiscal wisdom of Canadian taxpayers in electing 
parliamentarians who are committed to reducing government 
expenditures and taxes. In the west where many Reformers were 
elected, it was the pivotal point in the platform which attracted a 
lot of voters. I hasten to add that to a certain degree it was what 
attracted voters who voted Liberal because the Liberals also 
included in their red book promises of more honesty in 
government, more openness and better fiscal responsibility. 
They promised it but what needs to be asked is whether they are 
actually delivering it.
<P>
	Here again I want to be as gentle as I can but I must also as 
honestly as possible, level with the Canadian people on what is 
actually happening.
<P>
	I have referred to some of these numbers in a previous speech 
but they bear repeating. When speaking of millions of dollars 
some people understand, but when speaking of billions a lot of 
people do not have the insight on what a number of that 
magnitude means. A good way of explaining it has to do with 
what happens if a person has a lot of money and is able to spend a 
dollar every second.
<P>
	If I had a million dollars it would take approximately 11 and a 
half days to spend it at one dollar per second. If I had a billion 
dollars and I was spending it at the same rate it would take 32 
years. When you put that into perspective you realise that the 
government is still overspending this year in the budget which 
we are being asked to approve, more than $32 billion. That is 
how much the government is borrowing in addition to the 
present debt. People need to grab hold of the magnitude of the 
problem, its severity and its urgency.
<P>
	If you have ever done any boating you will know that if you 
have a hole in the hull the water will come in. Depending on the 
size of that hole, it may be insufficient to take a little cup to bail 
out the water because the water may be getting too deep to bail. 
Maybe what you need to do is to plug the hole. You need to put 
something into the hole to prevent the water from coming in.
<P>
	The same thing is true with the national debt. The debt is so 
large and the interest payments on that debt are increasing at a 
rate over which we have no control. It is true the government is 
borrowing less now than it did last year. Can I be so brave as to 
commend the government for borrowing $32 billion this year 
instead of the $40 billion that it borrowed the year before?
<P>
	Let us also put this into perspective. A good way to compare 
this is to use straight ratio and proportion. Let us consider the 
debt picture, the expenditure picture and the borrowing picture 
as it might relate to a family. I have used some of these numbers 
before.
<P>
	A $120 billion expenditure, which is approximately what the 
government spent on programs three years ago, might equate to 
a family expenditure of $48,000. At that time the government 
was borrowing $40 billion, which equates to $16,000 borrowed 
by the family. Everyone understands this family is in trouble. Its 
income is $48,000 but it has spent $64,000. It has borrowed 
$16,000 in order to make up the difference.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	It is true that the picture is now a little better. Instead of 
earning $48,000, this family is now earning about $52,000. Lo 
and behold, the borrowing, which has gone down to $12,800, 
results in a total value of $64,800. It has actually gone up.
<P>
	However, the frightening thing is that in proportion, this 
family, with an income of $48,000 per year in 1992, would have 
had a debt in proportion to the Canadian debt of $168,000. The 
government was elected in the fall of 1993. After one year the 
debt had grown from $168,000 in proportion for this family to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13344"> 13344 </A></B>
<P>
$184,000 and  now in proportion to $220,000. Clearly we are not 
heading in the right direction.
<P>
	Somehow I wish we could impress the government with a 
better sense of the urgency of attacking government spending 
faster than it is because the water is still coming into the boat at a 
rate considerably faster than it is able to bail it out. The budget 
needs to be balanced and it needs to happen fast.
<P>
	One of the problems is the mechanism of approving the 
budget. In my view and I believe in the view of most Reformers 
and probably a number of Liberals and some of the members 
from the Bloc, certainly many constituents have expressed to us 
that it is just not good enough. Is it not then regrettable that we 
have an inability to actually represent that?
<P>
	The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has made the news 
because he has had the courage to stand up against the 
government's policy on the budget and is voting against it. He is 
voting against it for completely opposite reasons from where I 
am coming from, but he believes that he is representing his 
constituents. That puts a finger right on the problem. The person 
who says this budget is not good enough ought not to be making 
news. He should be simply applauded because he is in the 
majority.
<P>
	I do not often dream at night because I have late nights and 
early mornings here, as we all do, and usually when I hit the 
pillow I am unconscious, but I had a little dream last night. This 
is a fictitious dream, because I do not want to tell a lie.
<P>
	I dreamed that in the House we actually had individually the 
freedom to vote on the budget as we really believed. I wonder 
what proportion of the members in the governing party would, if 
there were absolutely no ramifications to their decision, 
honestly express themselves and actually say: ``No, this budget 
is not quite good enough''. I really wish that members could 
have that freedom in the House. If they did, with that would 
come a mechanism which would force the bureaucrats, those 
who drive the agenda here in Ottawa, to go back and say: ``Look, 
we need to do some more cutting. We can be more efficient. We 
can save money''.
<P>
	Members of my party have identified many areas where there 
is rampant wastage. It is not attributable to the government now. 
It is just the way it has always been done. The government, with 
its majority, have it in its power to fix it if it would only have the 
courage. I wish it would. Perhaps my dream will come true. 
Perhaps tonight there will be sufficient numbers of the 
governing party that will say: ``I will stand on principle and I am 
going to vote the way I really believe''.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I will respect those people who vote in favour of the budget if 
they honestly, truly believe that this is the best way to manage 
the fiscal affairs of the country. I have no problem if they vote in 
favour of the budget because of that honest and sincere belief.
<P>
	I have a tremendous problem with people who believe that it 
is not good enough but who do not have the freedom to so 
express themselves. To me that is an aberration of the 
democratic process and is the root cause of the huge debt, the 
deficit, the huge interest payments, payments of $40 billion plus 
per year. These payments would be more than adequate to 
provide a wonderful health care system, to subsidize adequately 
the post-secondary education and give Canadians the ability to 
invest in the future of our country and in the future of these 
young Canadians.
<P>
	It is a missed opportunity. Let us blame the past. Let us say 
that it was the governments of the past that did this to us. That is 
fine. It does not really matter who did it. As it says in the good 
book, the borrower is a slave to the lender and we have become 
slaves to the national debt. The member for Willowdale who just 
spoke pointed out very clearly-he did not use the word 
obscenity, but I will use it-the obscenity of the fact that $1 in 
$3 is used for paying the interest on the debt. I really wish we did 
not have that.
<P>
	The politicians of the last 30 years, which is before most of us 
were here, so arranged the affairs of the country that we now 
have the problem and we have to deal with it.
<P>
	I sincerely hope that my little three-year old grandson can 
some day say: ``My grandpa when he stood in the House of 
Commons was able to persuade members on the government 
side to have courage and he thereby helped to save this country 
from going even deeper and deeper into debt''.
<P>
	We would set a tremendous precedent if this happens tonight. 
If enough members of the House of Commons would have the 
courage to vote against the budget I believe it would be the first 
time that it would have ever happened. It would be headline 
news tomorrow. It would say we finally have in Ottawa a group 
of people who stand on principle, who do what is right.
<P>
	The government has failed to attack the problem of 
government spending. Instead it has replaced that by adding 
additional revenues. I am very much offended by measures like 
the rescinding of the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. I 
believe it is very unfair.
<P>
	This is a country where we believe in free enterprise, where 
we know that business has built this country. It is extremely 
unfair to think of two Canadians standing side by side, one of 
them buying natural gas or electricity from a utility that is 
owned by a government and another buying utilities from a 
privately owned firm. Because one of these Canadians buys 
utilities from a government owned organization he or she pays 
no income tax but the other one pays income tax. To me that is 
unfair.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13345"> 13345 </A></B>
<P>
	Members can stand up and try to defend that. I do not want to 
sound just like a person whining about my region. That is not the 
total picture. We need to look at all of Canada. I submit very 
seriously that if it is good for one province, it is good for the 
country. We need to seriously ask ourselves the question 
whether such an inequitable tax is good for the country because 
it differentiates between Canadians based on their situations.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I have appreciated the opportunity to speak on this matter. I 
would be delighted to respond to any questions members have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the member used some words that seemed a little contradictory. 
In one instance he was admonishing the members to vote the 
way they believe, yet depending on some other questions, the 
member is admonishing members to vote along with their 
constituents. I simply raise this contradiction. If the member 
really believed that, then he along with at least the other three 
Reform Party members who are supporting gun control would 
also represent their constituents and vote for gun control.
<P>
	The Reform Party took the liberty to produce a pro forma 
budget to put on the table what its plans would be. As we all 
know, they were basically to trash social programs and 
particularly to tax seniors. In the hypothetical situation that the 
Reform Party did form a government and did have that budget, 
would the member admit here and now that the Reform Party 
would have to borrow at least $100 billion before the deficit 
would be reduced to zero over the term of the mandate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
respond to what is indeed a very good question.
<P>
	The hon. member used the word that our prebudget suggested 
trashing the social programs. Those were the words he used. 
There is a huge difference between trashing something and 
replacing it with something better. There is a huge difference 
between breaking down a house and leaving a hole in the ground 
and breaking down an old house in order to make room to build a 
new and better one.
<P>
	If we were to analyse what the Reform Party is proposing for 
social programs, it is proposing a better system. We believe in 
individualizing social security so as to do away with all of the 
problems which arise when UIC and social security are 
competing.
<P>
	The poor person on UIC or social security has to refuse a job 
at $8 an hour because if he or she makes a little money in effect 
they are taxed 100 per cent on it. There is a tremendous 
disincentive to taking a part time job because of the loss of 
benefits. If that were individualized according to our plan, then 
the individual could take a part time job, supplement their 
income and use their personal retirement and their personal 
security  plan only as needed to top up in order to meet the needs 
of the day.
<P>
	If the member would like to take the time to do the arithmetic 
on it, I would be pleased to sit down and help him with this. If he 
were to do the actuarial math on how the money grows, if he 
were to look at the employer's and employee's contributions he 
would see how they grow. He would see how quickly the total 
benefits substantially exceed what can be given through a 
bureaucratically driven and inefficient UIC program. Perhaps 
then the member would have a different view of what it means to 
replace a social assistance program that is not working with one 
that is logical and defensible.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I feel constrained to rise because of the 
comments of the hon. member opposite about this wise and 
logical social program for Canada that his party is suggesting.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that the program the 
Reform Party seems to be proposing is a program that would 
work for the rich and not for the underprivileged or for people 
who just need a leg up in our country. It is a program intended to 
put more money in the pockets of people like the hon. member, 
people who have an upper middle class income and is not a 
program to support the people who need our assistance.
<P>
	There is another interpretation for the fact that Liberals are 
voting together on the budget. As Liberals, unlike members of 
his party, we have the same common goals. We have the same 
common core set of beliefs and we do agree on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate this question and 
would like to answer it by asking another question.
<P>
	A good economic system will benefit all Canadians. If we 
look at the history of the industrial world going back over the 
last 150 or 200 years, there have been some very rich people. It 
is also true when there are some rich people that it generally 
provides many good jobs and a good livelihood for a lot of 
people.
<P>
	What is better, for everybody to be taxed to death and we try to 
help a few people with handouts, or to allow those with good 
leadership abilities, good business skills to set up an economic 
environment in which they could thrive? Maybe they would do 
fairly well and perhaps the people in the neighbourhood who had 
been on UI and social welfare and were making $12,000 a year 
could now have jobs with the new firm at $30,000 a year. That 
happens. If we look at history, that is the way the economy 
works.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13346"> 13346 </A></B>
<P>
	When businesses are excessively taxed there is the exodus 
which has been experienced and observed in Ontario. Excessive 
taxation and a bad economic climate are not a promotion of 
business. Ultimately everybody, not just the rich, but the 
working class as well suffers more than they would under the 
other regime.
<P>
	At the same time we need to be very careful here. Over and 
over I hear Liberals saying that we are a compassionate society. 
I believe that too. I believe in individually helping people who 
need help. If that is really true and a government system is taken 
away, we can count on individuals and organizations moving in 
to fill the gap and they will do it more efficiently.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I carefully listened to the speech made by 
the member from the Reform Party. He talked abundantly about 
the debt. He used good images to explain it, especially when he 
used the family as an example.
<P>
	I realize today that no matter what the debt is and no matter 
what the cuts are, the debt will go up anyway. My friends from 
the Reform Party very often say that we are going to hit the wall, 
which is what I think also.
<P>
	My friend says that the situation is urgent, that we have to 
move rapidly and find a solution to the problem because water is 
getting into the ship. At the same time, my friend tells us that he 
has dreams and wishes, but the dreams and wishes will not lead 
to a solution. It does not matter what solutions we bring here, if 
they are not accepted by the government, they mean nothing.
<P>
	Does my friend have the sensation sometimes that he is 
doomed to paint the ship while the ship is sinking?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Madam Speaker, it definitely does seem sometimes 
that the ship is going down, but I am not totally pessimistic. I 
believe there is a window of opportunity. That is why I am so 
sincerely urging that government members set a precedent 
today. Defeat the budget in order to force it to take more 
dramatic measures to balance it quickly so that the ship does not 
go down. My dream is for the individuals to do that based on 
their own conscience.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in the twilight moments of the 
debate on Bill C-76. If I may say, the House is in a mood of 
detente and relaxation which it is not always in. I have 
appreciated the comments made on both sides of the House in 
the last hour or so.
<P>
	Bill C-76 represents a translation of the undertakings made 
by the government when it was elected and basically its program 
that it would conquer the deficit, reduce the national debt by a 
dynamic program of creating new jobs, generating new 
revenues. This is essentially the thrust of the budget.
<P>
	Members will notice the attention to prudent economies, the 
cutting of government operations, new approaches to federalism 
and federal-provincial relations. At the same time there is a 
redefinition because it inevitably follows in the 
federal-provincial balance.
<P>
	I think this was the basic promise made by the Prime Minister 
and it is reflected in the budget, that in approaching the 
economic crisis our emphasis would be on job creation.
<P>
	We have also undertaken to maintain the integrity of the 
social services structure, in particular medicare; to maintain the 
Canada pension plan, the social security structure that 
distinguishes Canada from the United States and other countries 
committed to the free market economy; and interesting and new 
approaches to unemployment insurance. We are getting away 
from the static approach intended to present a situation of 
continuing dependency by a new emphasis on job training and a 
new emphasis on training people for a better future and giving 
them some confidence in their ability to achieve that.
<P>
	Last, in the area of federalism the approach to 
federal-provincial transfers in some senses redresses a balance 
in federalism that had occurred by glosses on the system 
established by the federal government entering what we could 
say in retrospect, were areas of provincial constitutional 
responsibility. There the argument was and it was a necessary 
one, that if the federal government had not moved in these areas 
the provinces would not have moved either and there would have 
been a vacuum in terms of important areas of social policy.
<P>
	I will have something more to say on each of these particular 
issues at a later moment.
<P>
	I do note that Bill C-76 will implement a savings of $29 
billion over the next three years: $5 billion in 1995-96; $10.6 
billion in 1996-97; and $13.3 billion in 1998. We think this is a 
responsible, realistic way to go. It sets out a program. A budget 
not less than any other type of law is itself a system of law in the 
making. It is a dynamic system and we build upon the 
achievements of one year in the next year. We have set up those 
goals on the basis of a three year period.
<P>
	I think this is a very important part of the government 
economic structure. We have honoured the undertaking of no 
increases in personal income tax rates. We are closing the tax 
loopholes and we look for continuing guidance from Parliament 
and members on that. We are trying to improve tax fairness. That 
is an objective. At the same time the incentive to get the 
economy moving again will be to avoid increases in personal 
income tax rates. I mention in social services the maintenance of 
the integrity of the pension system because this has been a very 
important part of retirement planning for senior citizens and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13347"> 13347 </A></B>
<P>
others approaching that condition. That is maintained and it is 
very important in terms of-
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I regret to interrupt the 
hon. member.
<P>
	Pursuant to order made Monday, June 5, 1995, in accordance 
with Standing Order 78(3), it is my duty to interrupt the 
proceedings and put all the questions necessary to dispose of the 
third reading stage of the bill now before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Correct me if I am wrong, but I was under the impression that 
government orders were extended by some 12 minutes because 
of a ministerial statement made earlier in the day. I am 
wondering if perhaps we are not ahead of ourselves here.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The clerk tells me that 
you are indeed right.
<P>
	The hon. member may continue. Government orders have 
been extended by 12 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for that very graceful reprieve, if I may call it that. It gives me an 
opportunity to continue the dialogue. I think I can pick up from 
the middle of the sentence if I can recall the beginning of the 
sentence. Here it is, in any case.
<P>
	We have tried to emphasize a policy of fairness to all regions, 
which brings me into the area of federal-provincial powers. One 
of the great dilemmas in establishing the new system of 
transfers to provinces is you are recognizing that these are areas, 
constitutionally, of provincial responsibility. They are in 
essence moving back. One is in effect cutting through the gloss 
of custom that has been established over the last 20 or 30 years. 
In fact the general feeling in Canadian political circles is that if 
the federal government had not acted the provinces would not 
have either and this was the reason for the federal initiative. If 
the power returns effectively to the provinces, it will be done 
through the system of the block transfer, the new Canadian 
social transfer.
<P>
	Some statistics are relevant and important. The average cut to 
the provinces in terms of transfers will be 4.4 per cent, which is 
less than the 7.3 per cent the federal government is imposing on 
its own programs, and there is a period of two years' notice built 
into that, which becomes very important in areas such as 
education, where planning far ahead is very important to 
individuals entering the structure, not merely to 
administrations.
<P>
	One issue raised here is the ability to maintain national 
standards. Can it be done solely on a matter of reliance on the 
good faith of individual governments? Will there not be 
somebody out of step? I think this is a matter on which we are 
still waiting for the work the minister of intergovernmental 
affairs is doing, but let me say that I think there is no doubt that 
constitutionally in certain areas we still have the power to 
impose and enforce the national standards. Enforcement, as 
such, is an  ineffective system of social control. ``Friendly 
persuasion'' and ``example'' are the bywords. I think in this 
particular area we will find a large and increasing degree of 
federal-provincial co-operation because of what are, after all, 
the common goals.
<P>
	I was examining on the weekend, in the constituency of one of 
my colleagues, in Richmond, the area of intergovernmental 
co-operation, not merely federal-provincial but federal, 
provincial, and municipal. The process of co-operation can 
work. It is not our belief, in any case, in contrast to 
prognostication of gloom and doom, that in making the block 
transfers to the provinces the national standards will disappear 
and we will get an anarchic system of different standards such as 
Voltare described with the situation of the French civil laws. As 
he said when he left Paris, every time he changed his horse he 
would be under a different system. I do not think we are dealing 
with that.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Our message on this is that the status quo of the 
federal-provincial arrangements, the practice that had grown up 
over the last 30 years, was bound to come to an end as provinces 
accepted their own obligations of maintaining common 
standards throughout the country and not falling behind. Here 
the finances are related directly to the power and there is the 
two-year building in period in which federal and provincial 
governments can work out and eliminate any contradictions.
<P>
	There in essence is the budget. It is best to finish on the 
general philosophical note that it does reflect the promise the 
Prime Minister made during the election and it would not be a 
negative, give it up approach to eliminating the deficit. We 
would expand the economy and would generate new revenue by 
creating new jobs. The budget cannot be divorced from our work 
in manpower. It cannot be divorced from other activity in other 
departments directed toward this goal, and it does rest on a large 
degree of faith in the ability to manage federal-provincial 
relations in a renewed spirit of co-operative federalism.
<P>
	I think this is one of the keynotes of the present government, 
that it is reviving attitudes of co-operative federalism that for 
various reasons and for various attitudes of political parties 
have been dormant for some years.
<P>
	On this basis, I am happy to commend Bill C-76 to the House 
for adoption.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's remarks, but I must 
take him up on the fact that the day after the Reform Party issued 
its alternative budget we were together on a radio program in 
Vancouver, at which point he hammered me because in that 
budget we had similarly proposed the maintenance of standards 
through co-operative agreements among provinces. This is very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13348"> 13348 </A></B>
<P>
consistent with Reform Party policy that we should have less 
power at the centre.
<P>
	I will never forget the hon. member saying that as an expert in 
constitutional law he would tell me that it will not be possible 
for the central government to either create or enforce such 
arrangements because there is no leverage. I am now very 
pleasantly surprised to hear that he has come around to the 
policy the Reform Party had pronounced before this budget 
came out and which he now feels is doable.
<P>
	I have a practical question for him. Even though the Reform 
Party says that it would support this kind of an effort, does the 
hon. member really believe that a maverick province like 
Alberta would slow down its efforts to privatize and rationalize 
medicare by for example allowing more of the services to be 
provided by the private sector? Does he believe he could get 
from Alberta agreement of the nature he thinks is necessary if 
even at the present time, when there is a threat of withholding 
funds, this province, according to the minister, apparently is 
doing all those nasty things?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to respond 
to the learned hon. member. He has, in spite of his dour mien, a 
delightful sense of humour for those who know him very well.
<P>
	I do recollect this debate conducted at a distance of 3,000 
miles with bad telephone connections. I feel his telephone 
connection was not as perfect as mine on this. When he 
presented his shadow budget I did suggest to him that perhaps he 
had not paid enough attention to structural problems of 
government, that he had to spell it out.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	By the way, I should never be as egotistical as to suggest in a 
public debate or elsewhere that I was an expert in this or in 
anything else. The hon. member will remember Lord Justice 
Denning's reply to somebody who quoted to him somebody and 
said ``This is an expert''. Lord Justice Denning replied ``Is he 
dead?'' The answer was ``No, milord, he is among the living''. 
Lord Justice Denning said ``Well he is not an expert. The only 
expert accepted by the common law is somebody who has been 
dead for 20 years.'' This status will undoubtedly occur to the 
hon. member at a certain period in his career.
<P>
	What I did try to suggest was that he needed more work on 
examining the unstructured approach to co-operative 
arrangements between the federal government and the provinces 
he was presenting. I think the hon. member will recognize that 
there are gaps in his armour. I know he is an expert on the South 
Seas, on skiing, and on very many things, and I respect his 
knowledge of economics. However, on this thing I did suggest 
that the Reform Party program was rather light.
<P>
	To return again to his basic question, I think it is a matter of 
changes in attitude. The attitude of federal-provincial relations 
is different from what it was 20 or 30 years ago. One sees the 
arrangements in the province of Quebec, a province where the 
government is  committed to a program of separation from 
Canada. But if we look at the structure of administrative 
arrangements developing between the two governments, there is 
a good deal of solid empiricism in that. I would predict that the 
Premier of Alberta will also recognize the advantages of 
co-operation.
<P>
	We have no objection in this government to privatization. In 
fact if one examines the budget there is great emphasis on 
privatization. Getting rid of the CNR is something the hon. 
member himself has proposed in the past. If one in looks at it, we 
are very much into privatization too. However, in the 
examination of national standards, we will use friendly 
persuasion to ensure co-operative-

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ)</B> moved that Bill 
C-277, an act to amend the Criminal Code (genital mutilation of 
female persons), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, my heart is filled with emotion as I 
open debate today on Bill C-277, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (genital mutilation of female persons). It is filled with 
emotion because this bill deals with a cruel practice to which 
millions of women are subjected in the name of a so-called 
cultural value.
<P>
	What I am trying to do today is help prevent mutilation of 
female genitals at least in Canada and Quebec. My heart is also 
filled with emotion because I realize that I am speaking for a 
great many women who will never get to speak publicly. I am 
referring to the victims of this practice.
<P>
	Finally, I will be delivering my speech with great respect, 
respect for immigrant women, foreign cultures and ethnic 
communities. This respect should underlie every word spoken 
on the subject of traditions, for traditions are part of every 
human being's make-up and respect for human beings is what 
my bill is all about.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is twofold: to deter and protect; to 
protect innocent victims, and deter any would-be offender. That 
is why the bill has two parts: criminalization of the act per se, 
and punishment for anyone involved.
<P>
	Moving to the heart of the matter, allow me to set the problem 
in context by briefly recapitulating the facts and figures 
regarding genital mutilation of female persons, then 
summarizing arguments in favour of such practice and, finally, 
setting this practice in the Canadian sociopolitical context.
<P>
	First, the facts. To give a better idea of what genital mutilation 
means, let me describe briefly the three different operations 
currently performed. The first one is circumcision, or sunna, in 
which the tip of the clitoris is removed. The second is called 
extended circumcision, and involves the complete excision of 
the clitoris or partial excision of the labia minora and labia 
majora and the stitching of the genitals except for a small 
meatus. As for infibulation, it is similar to extended 
circumcision, with the added feature of suturing with a product 
supposed to fasten the wound.
<P>
	Depending on the country, the act is performed by a barber, a 
midwife, an elder, or a health professional. It is estimated that 
there are currently between 80 and 120 million excised women 
and young girls, mainly in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
<P>
	In October 1994, <I>La Presse</I> reported that 6,000 girls between 
the ages of 7 and 22 are excised everyday. Six thousand per day, 
Madam Speaker. This is a situation of concern to me and I hope 
that it will be of concern to other members as well. On May 22, 
the international press reported the case of a ten-year old 
Egyptian girl who died after being excised; her 12-year old 
sister was admitted to hospital in serious condition.
<P>
	Having heard the technical description of the operation, we 
can easily imagine the serious effects it must have on the women 
on whom it is performed. Here are a few among those on record: 
haemorrhaging, infections, obstetrical complications, 
cysto-vaginal or rectovaginal fistula, cysts, violent pain, 
impaired sexual response, psychological disorders, and death.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	In addition to this long list of possible consequences, there is 
another specific problem affecting excised women who 
immigrate to Canada. When these women realize that they are 
``different'', they may experience problems in their social and 
love lives. For example, during a medical consultation with 
female practitioners who were not aware of that practice, a 
social worker helping immigrants told of many mutilated 
fiancees or wives who were abandoned by their partners after 
these men had sexual relations with women who had not been 
excised. Imagine the double trauma experienced by these 
women who are mutilated and then abandoned, which is of 
course contrary to the expectations generated by their 
traditional family environment.
<P>
	Because this operation is still common in many regions of the 
world, there are many explanations justifying it. Some are more 
esoteric than others, but all are objectively wrong. I will 
mention a few of the more surprising ones, without 
commenting.
<P>
	Childbirth is easier for the excised woman. Female genital 
organs produce smelly and unsanitary secretions. Male 
circumcision is done for aesthetic reasons; consequently, 
women should undergo a similar type of operation. The clitoris 
could kill a first child, especially if the child's head touches it 
during delivery. Women whose clitoris is intact become 
nymphomaniacs. The clitoris generates too much excitement for 
the man. Virginity is preserved. Fertility increases, since female 
genital secretions kill sperm.
<P>
	Those are the arguments most often used to justify these types 
of genital mutilation. I want to point out that, contrary to 
popular belief, no religion prescribes genital mutilation of 
female persons.
<P>
	Although genital mutilation may seem a problem occurring 
far away from us, according to some witnesses, it happens here, 
in Canada and in Quebec. Since our society is open to 
immigrants, this tradition that goes against our values has 
unfortunately been imported along with other values more 
similar to ours.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13351"> 13351 </A></B>
<P>
	Between 1986 and 1991, Canada has accepted 40,000 
immigrants from countries where mutilation is an accepted fact 
of life. In 1992 alone, 3,245 persons from countries where 
genital mutilation is tolerated or encouraged have settled in 
Canada.
<P>
	As I said earlier, we have been told that little girls are subject 
to genital mutilation here, in our country. These last few years, 
health professionals and people working with some cultural 
communities have been able to confirm this situation. It is hard 
to put a figure to such a taboo. However, physicians have 
reported being asked by parents to perform mutilation on their 
young daughters. Other physicians have had to operate on 
children to repair the damage caused by such mutilations.
<P>
	Social workers have been in contact with victims or families 
of victims who have told them about this practice. Recently, in 
May 1994, the director of the Ottawa African Resource Centre 
stated that many African immigrants manage to subject their 
daughters to mutilation in Canada, despite a directive to the 
contrary from the College of Physicians of Ontario. He said that 
families were sending their daughters overseas to be mutilated. 
We know that several Canadian physicians have been asked to 
perform genital mutilation. He adds that the fears publicly 
expressed by a Somalian woman were founded, since the 
African community checks whether the girls have undergone 
this operation.
<P>
	This is a serious issue that calls for action in the name of the 
moral and human values we share. One of the reasons why no 
action has been taken against this practice may be the Canadian 
multiculturalism policy, which has been rejected by Quebec and 
is highly controversial in English Canada and also among the 
Liberal members themselves. Some people attribute the lack of 
legal action to the confusion experienced by social workers, 
community stakeholders and the police. Others feel that they 
should respect the traditions of the various groups now living in 
Canada, since all cultures are equal, whatever their customs.
<P>
	In the current multiculturalism context, more than a few 
people are paralyzed by the fear of being labelled as 
ethnocentric or racist.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, it would appear that this uncertainty, which is the 
direct result of the multiculturalism policy, is far from being 
removed. For example, we recently read in the daily <I>La Presse</I> 
that, because of this policy, Canada was identified by the world 
Islamic movement as an ideal place for Muslim immigrants to 
be exempt from the application of civil laws and instead be 
subjected to the sharia which, as you know, does not respect at 
all the principle of equality between men and women.
<P>
	When you read things like that, the feeling of helplessness of 
social and community stakeholders comes as no surprise. In 
fact, these workers might be reluctant to sue members of 
immigrant families perpetuating the practice of female genital 
mutilation.
<P>
	We talked about the Multiculturalism Act. Let us now take a 
look at the overall legislative framework related to genital 
mutilation. This is an important issue, because the Minister of 
Justice refuses to amend the legislation. Currently, there is no 
legislative provision which expressly prohibits that practice.
<P>
	However, as the Minister of Justice pointed out, proceedings 
could be instituted under some sections of the Criminal Code 
which relate to assault and bodily harm. It should also be 
mentioned that this practice violates the provincial acts 
protecting children, various charters of rights and freedoms and 
international agreements.
<P>
	Our bill would complement the existing legislation by 
reinforcing it. As I said at the beginning, the bill is twofold. By 
adding another provision to the section dealing with dangerous 
bodily harm, we would officially recognize that this practice is 
harmful and dangerous to the individual. Also, the operation 
itself would be criminalized, and a penalty is provided for those 
directly or indirectly involved in the procedure.
<P>
	To include that clause in the Criminal Code would leave no 
doubt as to the legal status of the practice. It would become a 
criminal act carrying a term of up to five years imprisonment. 
The members of cultural communities which promote this 
practice will immediately be informed and warned officially 
that in our country, genital mutilations are considered 
mutilations, not just a tradition. There is no reason for us to 
hesitate about adding a section to the Criminal Code regarding 
this issue.
<P>
	In fact, the Code already contains sections prohibiting acts 
which are foreign to our culture and no one ever formally 
complained. I cite as examples sections 290 and 293 which 
prohibit bigamy and polygamy. In my humble opinion, these 
acts are much less harmful to the health of women, yet they have 
already found their place in the Code. This refutes, I believe, the 
minister's argument that we should not unduly encumber the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Another reason the Minister of Justice says there is no need to 
act is that charges can already be laid under existing sections in 
the Code. Theoretically, the minister is correct. However, for the 
reasons invoked to explain why to this day no lawsuits have been 
filed, in particular those I mentioned earlier, I am of the opposite 
opinion and I firmly believe that we must adopt a very precise 
section which unequivocally sets out the nature of the prohibited 
act and prohibits participation in such an act.
<P>
	In addition to this need for judicial precision, adopting a bill 
would meet another need which the government rarely 
addresses: defining the social policy of multiculturalism. We 
must bear in mind that the act is not just applied and interpreted 
in this House, but well beyond it. Acts are written for the whole 
public, and the public is feeling the concrete effects of this 
problem. We have this problem precisely because of the big fuss 
that  our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13352"> 13352 </A></B>
<P>
governments have made over the wonderful multiculturalism 
policy.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	To correct this problem we must formally define the limits of 
government policy by clearly stating which cultural practices 
are not acceptable and are against the principles of our society.
<P>
	Finally, the Minister of Justice believes it is preferable to 
concentrate on educating immigrant communities instead of 
introducing special legislation. I agree with the minister that 
public awareness campaigns and educating the public are 
important. They have their place in this case as they did when 
Parliament passed legislation on drunk driving. Members will 
recall the massive advertising campaign that accompanied these 
amendments to the legislation. The government did a good job.
<P>
	Why could it not repeat the exercise, this time to prevent 
genital mutilation? Why not pass Bill C-277 and at the same 
time organize a public awareness campaign targeted to health 
care and social workers and immigrants from countries where 
mutilation is practised?
<P>
	Canada would not be the first country to adopt specific 
measures in this respect. Other countries like Great Britain, 
Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy and one Australian 
state have already done so. Two American states are considering 
similar action. Like Canada, these countries are host countries 
that have to deal with cultural practices that differ from theirs 
and are against their principles. They have responded to this 
challenge.
<P>
	Before I finish, I would like to mention the many instances of 
support for legislation against genital mutilation. First I would 
like to mention the now defunct Canadian Advisory Council on 
the Status of Women which in March 1994 published a detailed 
study on the problem in Canada and firmly recommended 
adopting such measures. There is also the resolution passed by 
the international conference on population development, which 
I attended, and the Canadian Council on Refugees; also the 
resolution passed by the International Federation of 
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and by the Canadian 
Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs.
<P>
	The following organizations have also spoken out in favour of 
legislation: the Association of Country Women of the World, the 
Commission des droits de la personne du Québec, the Quebec 
Minister of Justice, the Conseil multiculturel des femmes 
professionnelles, the Service d'information en contraception et 
sexualité du Québec, the Cercle des fermières du Québec, 
Violence Info, the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Rights Associaton, 
the Mouvement des femmes chrétiennes, Quest for the 
Eradication of Female Genital Mutilation and the Réseau des 
femmes noires francophones de Toronto. When the minister 
declares in the House that groups concerned do not support the 
legislation, I really wonder where he got his information.
<P>
	Here is one example. In her letter of support for my bill, Janis 
Burgaski, the chair of the Conseil multiculturel des femmes 
professionelles wrote the following: ``We have come to realize 
that not all traditions are to be encouraged and that some are 
even cruel and undesirable. From having spent time in certain 
communities and being of the same sex, we discover that stories 
we considered part of the past are still true today. Under the 
circumstances, we believe the bill is a step in the right direction. 
Women oppose this type of abuse''.
<P>
	The Liberal Party has promised to make up time lost in the 
area of health and women. This government prides itself on 
being one of the most ardent defenders of the rights of women on 
the international scene. In September, it will proudly send a 
delegation to the conference in Beijing. I invite it to use the 
opportunity to announce that it has put words into action and has 
adopted legislation making it a criminal offence to mutilate 
women's genitals, as other countries have done.
<P>
	I would also invite the Minister of Justice to take time to 
reflect. For the past several months, he has been working to 
criminalize certain behaviour involving the possession and use 
of firearms in order to protect the public and resolve certain 
problems. Why would he not do the same thing in another area, 
that of genital mutilation?
<P>
	I would also invite the members of this House to support my 
bill and thus reaffirm women's right to bodily security. We have 
a responsibility to all women, regardless of where they come 
from or their culture of origin. In choosing a country, women 
should be assured that they will find there the protection to 
which they are entitled. This is the intent of my bill.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I commend the hon. member on her initiative 
in bringing forward the motion today. This is an issue like many 
horrors that is easily ignored, an issue we must face and about 
which I feel very strongly.
<P>
	This is not an issue, however, that the government has 
ignored. The hon. Minister of Justice assured me in discussions 
we have had that it has been on the agenda for approximately one 
year, that he has taken the time to meet with members of cultural 
groups and to meet with women in Canada concerned about the 
particular issue, and that he has studied it carefully. He also 
indicated to me and to members of my caucus that he will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13353"> 13353 </A></B>
<P>
continue to listen on the subject. That is obviously witnessed by 
the fact that he is present for the debate today.
<P>
	In 1991 by a unique set of circumstances I made the 
acquaintance of a young professional couple who was fleeing an 
extremely oppressive situation in a north African country. I will 
talk a bit about them and about my indirect personal experience 
with this terrible subject matter.
<P>
	These people were secular Muslims. They were persecuted by 
a fundamentalist regime for expressing their more moderate 
views and for associating with persons who shared those 
moderate views. I am straining here not to invade their privacy 
and I am of necessity therefore being vague about details of their 
professions, nationalities and other identifying features.
<P>
	In any event, I am happy to say the Canadian immigration 
system worked. It delivered for this couple. They became 
refugees and then immigrants. Now they are citizens living and 
working in the freedom of our great country. They became 
friends of our family and particular friends of my daughter who 
is the same age as the young woman.
<P>
	Shortly after achieving refugee status they came to see me. 
The woman needed to consult a doctor because she wanted to 
have children and she needed advice. She had been the victim at 
the age of 12 of female genital mutilation. Her clitoris had been 
crudely removed, her labia minora excised and her labia majora 
incised to create raw surfaces so they could be stitched together 
forming a cover of skin and scar over the vagina. There is in this 
type of mutilation a small opening left to allow for urination, for 
menstruation and for the pleasure of the man who would 
ultimately become her husband.
<P>
	Like most Canadians I had never been confronted with it 
before although I knew about it. We were able to find a surgeon 
who was of assistance and who performed a procedure that gave 
some relief and ultimately allowed my friend to more 
comfortably perform bodily functions and happily to bear two 
gorgeous children who are Canadian citizens. One of them was a 
Canadian before her parents were.
<P>
	I was struck then and I remain struck now by the image of this 
beautiful young woman, the same age as my daughter, 
intelligent, alive, youthful and because of our system politically 
free.
<P>
	Even with what we have done for her we can never put things 
back the way they should be. She can never, ever enjoy sexual 
relations with her husband. She bears scars and will suffer 
physical side effects for the rest of her life. She will have pain 
both physical and spiritual that we can only imagine. She will 
bear this pain stoically, with dignity, and thankfully with the 
support of her husband. She bears the terrible memory of the 
mutilation act, of the midwife with a razor, of no anesthesia, of 
her mother and others holding her down, of the blood, the pain, 
the fear, the convalescence, and to what end? The end to be 
served was that of her own oppression.
<P>
	They mutilate women, damage them. In this rite women are 
treated like chattel, like livestock. They exist to be used for 
labour, to bear sons and for sexual gratification that they cannot 
share. They mutilate them so they will be faithful, so they will 
not enjoy sex, so they will not run away, so someone else will not 
take them. It is done in the name of manhood, in the name of God 
or religion, in the name of the preservation of a way of life and in 
the name of a culture; but nothing comparable is done in these 
cultures to men.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe passionately in the diversity of this country; in the 
right of Canadians and of people who come here to display their 
religions, their cultures and their ethnic origins; in the equality 
of the sexes; and in respect for religious and cultural practices of 
others.
<P>
	I believe religious headgear like the keppah, the turban and 
the Muslim veil should be accepted by Canadians in our 
everyday life. I believe we should be colour blind in our 
policies. I believe in employment equity.
<P>
	As much as I believe in all these things, I also believe that 
practices like female genital mutilation cannot and must not be 
tolerated in Canada. Throughout the world between 85 million 
and 115 million girls and women have suffered this tragedy. Its 
defenders say, quite incredibly to me, that it is a right of passage 
like ear piercing or the male right of circumcision. The 
mutilation of female genitalia cannot be compared to these other 
minor procedures. It has no purpose but to suppress.
<P>
	I do not want to impose my views unilaterally on foreign lands 
or cultures, but I believe that we can and must come to grips with 
this practice within our own borders.
<P>
	I know and I accept the assurances of legal experts that female 
genital mutilation is covered by the more general sections of the 
Criminal Code concerning assault. However, as a woman, as a 
mother, as a sister, as a daughter and as a citizen of the global 
village, I do not think that is good enough.
<P>
	I urge the government and all members of the House to take 
the extra step to help to educate others, to help to educate across 
the world and to educate within our borders so that people 
understand that if they participate in the act of female genital 
mutilation we believe it is wrong. If it takes an amendment to the 
Criminal Code in the final analysis after we have studied it, after 
it has perhaps gone to committee and after we have looked at all 
factors, I will rise in the House and support it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with respect that I rise to speak to Bill C-277 
presented by my colleague for Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13354"> 13354 </A></B>
<P>
	I will read the bill as she has presented it to bring the impact 
once again of the horrible mutilation to the public view. The 
amendment will include:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A person who</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) excises or otherwise mutilates, in whole or in part, the labia majora, labia 
minora or clitoris of a female person; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) aids, abets, counsels or procures the performance by another person of any 
of the acts described in paragraph (a),</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In 1992 the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons 
expressed concern over a rise in the number of requests for 
infibulations, which is the cutting off a young girl's genital parts 
including the clitoris and the subsequent sewing together of the 
opening leaving room for only urination and menstruation. We 
are addressing the issue today because the increase is reason for 
concern.
<P>
	Canada has been cited by the World Health Organization as 
being one of 40 countries involved in the practice of what has 
euphemistically become known as female circumcision but is 
more correctly referred to as female genital mutilation or FGM.
<P>
	FGM causes any number of both short and long term problems 
including excruciating pain; hemorrhaging; occasional death; 
exceptionally high rates of infections to the urinary tract, 
bladder, reproductive organs and bowel; menstrual and 
pregnancy problems; anaemia and disfiguring cysts which not 
only reduce or eliminate sexual pleasure but often result in 
extreme pain during intercourse and can even prohibit it.
<P>
	Unlike male circumcision there is no dispute within the 
medical community as to the benefits versus the harm of female 
genital mutilation. The medical community judges FGM to have 
no benefits and is harmful in many ways with both the short and 
long term implications already cited.
<P>
	Charles Kyazze, head of Ottawa's African Resource Centre, 
believes that FGM is being performed primarily by members of 
African communities where it is accepted and perpetuated as a 
legitimate cultural practice. It is also being performed in 
hospitals by doctors who argue that if they were not performing 
the procedure in a controlled environment, the child would be 
exposed to a much higher risk of infection and would suffer 
much more pain during and after the procedure. In some cases, 
Kyazze says, families are sending their children to Africa for the 
procedure.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	That Canada has been recognized as a state in which this 
procedure is practised, in private homes as well as in hospitals, 
validates our argument to codify female genital mutilation in 
Canadian legislation.
<P>
	Christine Hodges cited recently in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> the 
story of a Chadean woman who, reluctant to have her daughter 
suffer the procedure and despite pressures from her mother and 
grandmother to have it done, had decided not to have the 
procedure performed on her children. However, because her 
daughters became so distraught and unhappy at being singled 
out as different because they were the only women in their 
cultural community not to be so altered, she agreed.
<P>
	She chose the least mutilating of the procedures which would 
not carry with it the high risk of infection and would not result in 
the inability to have normal pleasurable intercourse. Despite her 
western ideas about the procedure, she recognized that her 
daughters had to live in this cultural context, remaining 
supported by the community and sharing many of the same 
beliefs. As appalled as Ms. Hodges was at the idea and action of 
FGM, she had a better understanding of the motivation behind it 
as it was presented within the context of the community in which 
it was practised.
<P>
	The point of this story is not that culture and ideas of what is 
right and wrong are relative but that within their own context 
cultural practices can be understood, tolerated and at times 
respected and admired. We certainly have no power as a nation 
to impose our own ideas and beliefs on other nations. We may 
voice our displeasure, concern or even contempt but we cannot 
expect another nation to abide by our laws and practices on their 
own soil any more than someone coming from another nation 
should expect to impose their laws and practices on Canadian 
soil.
<P>
	When a cultural action is taken from its original context and 
placed in our own, it is therefore our obligation to examine it and 
rightly judge whether it conforms to Canadian social and 
cultural norms.
<P>
	I may not wish to judge FGM as an action that is inappropriate 
in Africa, but I do condemn it as an action that is inappropriate 
within the context of Canadian culture. With that in mind I 
would like to pose the following questions with regard to not 
only this particular bill but how we address and judge the 
cultural practices of residents and citizens coming from 
countries with sometimes different and even conflicting beliefs 
and ideas.
<P>
	Where do we draw the line on how much of each culture we 
are willing to promote? What criteria do we use to judge the 
appropriateness of an action of an ethnic group? If we are not 
able to use our own cultural and state criteria then how do we 
justify prosecuting some men who claim that physical abuse of 
their wives is a cultural thing? It is one thing to allow people to 
promote their own cultures, but at what cost? Do we 
compromise what we as Canadians hold to be worth preserving 
and maintaining in the name of cultural diversity and cultural 
tolerance?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13355"> 13355 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadian laws and values should not be so cheap that we are 
willing to make compromises for the sake of not offending the 
sensibilities of others. That should not simply be with regard to 
female genital mutilation but with regard to any cultural 
practice that contradicts Canadian laws as well as social and 
civil practices.
<P>
	In answer to the above questions I suggest the following: that 
the only criteria which we as Canadians can use with regard to 
the judgment of an act are the common beliefs and laws of our 
land. If this were not the case we should be willing to tolerate all 
cultural practices from FGM to the cutting off of someone's 
hand when he or she is caught stealing or the physical abuse of 
women and children because it is culturally accepted elsewhere.
<P>
	One might wish to argue at this point that clearly the above 
acts are either directly or indirectly in violation of our laws and 
cannot be permissible; therefore, the point is moot. I would 
suggest, however, that it is inconsistent to fund and encourage 
some cultural practices while criminalizing others. What we are 
saying to new Canadians is: ``We encourage you to continue to 
live according to the standards and beliefs of your country of 
origin, but only those that we find palatable''.
<P>
	A Somali family may wish to have its daughter's genitalia 
removed because in its culture such a practice meets religious 
standards or preserves a sense of identity to their community or 
it is believed to help maintain cleanliness and health or it is 
believed to preserve virginity and family honour and prevent 
immorality.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	As Canadians do we support such views? I suggest we do not. 
If we continue to advance the current multicultural policies that 
we do, we are facilitating a platform from which practices such 
as FGM can be justified.
<P>
	I am not trying to imply that we prevent people from 
promoting their culture of origin privately. It is important in life 
to have continuity, to know where you are from and who and 
what has been instrumental in shaping the person that you are 
and will become.
<P>
	By making the promotion of foreign cultures a matter of 
public policy, we are essentially saying that although we have 
values that are Canadian they do not need to be embraced by 
those immigrating to Canada as they already have cultural and 
moral framework that we encourage they uphold.
<P>
	I wish to applaud the hon. member for coming forward with 
the proposed bill. I applaud her not only for what the bill means 
for the women who are subject to what I believe to be an 
inhuman act but also for the implicit statement it makes about 
Canada's values and beliefs.
<P>
	As Canadians we must be clear in our condemnation of a 
practice that is so mutilating. We cannot continue to stand by as 
the international community perceives us as a nation which 
tolerates such abuse.
<P>
	Finally, the Reform Party suggests that the current bill as 
proposed does not go far enough in its condemnation of the act. 
We recommend amending the bill at committee in the following 
manner, that Bill C-277 become an addition to section 267, 
rather than of section 244, of the Criminal Code. The bill would 
then read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-277 is amended by adding the following after section 267:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>267.1 A person who</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) excises or otherwise mutilates, in whole or in part, the labia majora, labia 
minora or clitoris of a female person; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) aids, abets, counsels or procures the performance by another person of any 
of the acts described in paragraph (a) is guilty of an indictable offence and 
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. member put forward five years. As it stands the bill 
will codify the act of female genital mutilation as an offence 
carrying a lesser charge that it might currently carry not 
codified. Presently a person performing the procedure in Canada 
could be charged under sections 267 or 268, assault causing 
bodily harm, but there is no codification.
<P>
	I thank my hon. colleague from Quebec for having brought 
forward this most important piece of legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very glad to have the opportunity to speak to this bill.
<P>
	The perpetuation of the practice of female genital mutilation, 
while it may be confined to certain communities, has serious 
implications for all Canadians. Ultimately this is an issue of 
human rights. As such it concerns us all and we all share the 
responsibility for putting a stop to it.
<P>
	When I came to Parliament Hill a year and a half ago I would 
never have foreseen myself speaking to such an issue. Today I 
stand here with my blinders removed, having been made to 
understand in some measure the brutality of this procedure and 
the devastating physical and emotional impact on the victims. I 
have risen in the Chamber to speak out on this issue before, as I 
did in Copenhagen at the interparliamentary union last fall.
<P>
	It is imperative that we take the strongest possible stand 
opposing violence in all forms against women, both in Canada 
and around the world. Female circumcision, as it is so 
euphemistically called, is the manifestation of an oppressive 
patriarchal philosophy. It physically mutilates girls and young 
women, destroying their capacity in the future to enjoy normal 
sexual relations in order to ensure that they reach a marriageable 
age in the state of virginity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13356"> 13356 </A></B>
<P>
	It is estimated that 80 million women around the world, 600 
every day, undergo this torment, often in the most primitive and 
barbaric circumstances, frequently without anaesthesia or 
properly sterilized equipment. The pain and the loss of blood 
may lead to shock, permanent injury, both physical and 
physiological and in some cases to death.
<P>
	The physical manifestations, although seldom reported to 
authorities, are still well known. Less is known about the 
psychological and emotional effects of the operation.
<P>
	This practice is not restricted to the third world. It is today an 
increasing concern for Canadians. For example, between 1986 
and 1991, 40,000 people immigrated to Canada from northern 
and eastern Africa. In these areas the practice is routine enough 
that it is naive to think it has not been imported. It is naive and is 
in fact dangerous to ignore.
<P>
	At the same time the argument has been made that we have no 
business imposing our cultural values on Canadian 
communities, especially Canadian ethnic communities. Canada 
is a society premised on the foundation of tolerance. Culture 
cannot and must never be used as an excuse to perpetuate 
criminal acts and violate human rights.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	As a multicultural society, we must balance our respect for 
cultural variation with protection of the rights of children, 
women, indeed all humanity. Female genital mutilation is a 
cultural practice, nothing more. It is not and has never been 
sanctioned by any religion. Let us be emphatic on this point 
when we say that no religion sanctions such practice. As great as 
our concern for cultural freedom, greater is our concern for the 
lives of our young immigrant and refugee women.
<P>
	The very fact of this debate indicates clearly the development 
of our understanding and our concern about this important issue. 
Our legal structures are evolving to accommodate the changing 
needs of Canadians. For example, I note the gender related 
persecution provision used by Canada in its refugee 
determination process. Members will recall the new guidelines 
being applied to a woman whose daughter faced potential ritual 
genital mutilation in their homeland. Canada in that case 
granted them refuge.
<P>
	At the same time, it is critical that in addressing this problem 
we must target our legislative response to bring about the most 
effective prevention. We must move with care in order to 
prevent the practice from moving still further underground and 
we must be sensitive to the communities involved.
<P>
	I commend the member for her intentions and for her work in 
bringing this bill forward. I fully recognize the critical 
importance of the principle. However, at this point, I also want 
to bring out the reservations that I have about the bill, not the 
issue.
<P>
	The bill essentially proposes to amend the Criminal Code to 
create a specific offence of genital mutilation, punishable on 
indictment, and carrying a term of up to five years' 
imprisonment. Compare this to the existing code provisions 
which contain, among the various assault provisions, the 
offence of aggravated assault which applies to everyone who 
wounds, maims, disfigures or endangers the life of another 
person and carries a sentence of up to 14 years' imprisonment.
<P>
	Moreover, section 21 of the code makes it clear that any party 
who aids or abets in the commission of an offence is guilty of the 
offence. As well, it is an offence under the code to remove a 
child from Canada who is ordinarily resident in order to commit 
any of the listed assault offences. Any person performing such 
an operation is also liable to prosecution.
<P>
	Certainly then the existing code already covers these 
offences. Let us make no mistake, the Criminal Code when 
properly applied can be a formidable tool in this battle.
<P>
	Bill C-277 is not tough enough. If the police were to charge 
under the specific offence, such as is stated in this bill, they 
would not be entitled to the stiffer penalty that we have now in 
the code.
<P>
	I am concerned about driving the practice still further 
underground. This practice is very well entrenched and hidden 
and we must ensure that it does not slip entirely from view. I 
have been advised that there has not been a single prosecution in 
Canada of this practice. Is this just because it does not go on? I 
do not think so. We are not catching it.
<P>
	Why are we not catching it? It is a brutal practice and it has 
been entrenched by the passage of time. In some communities 
the practice has great social prestige, marking the girl's 
transition to womanhood. Believe it or not, many girls look 
forward to this procedure with excitement and terror. They have 
been coerced by social pressures, the desire to please parents 
and communities or the fear of not finding a husband, into 
undergoing this brutal torment.
<P>
	It will come as no surprise that even in those areas of the 
world where the practice is common, there are still women 
working against it. The Canadian Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women notes in its brief on the subject:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Women from various African countries now living in Canada who had the 
operation as children remember sheer agony. They speak bitterly of how they 
were held down by several women despite their resistance. They strongly agree 
that they will not circumcise their daughters, would never inflict such pain upon 
them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As the document notes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13357"> 13357 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-there tends to be agreement that young girls put pressure on mothers to do it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As long as such social pressures continue to exist, the 
Criminal Code is of limited value in this fight. I understand the 
argument that a specific provision of the code would draw 
greater public attention to the offence, but we must recognize 
that education is the best tool to make Canadians understand the 
barbarity of this custom.
<P>
	To recap, the existing Criminal Code provisions are adequate 
in so far as the problem can be addressed through the code. A 
progressive and an aggressive campaign of public information is 
crucial.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	The attorney general in Ontario has a task force on female 
genital mutilation. We have to study the recommendations and 
at this point I look forward and will not rule out having a specific 
Criminal Code offence on this issue.
<P>
	I am very grateful to the member for allowing me to add my 
voice with women and men in this country and around the world 
and say this is a barbaric practice that has to be stopped. I am 
very glad we have people willing to stand up and talk very 
openly about these issues which have been for too long left 
undebated.
<P>
	I really appreciate being able to stand in a public forum like 
this to discuss something so normally sensitive an issue and say 
with conviction this is an issue that violates our human rights. I 
am proud Canada is speaking out about this. I put my support 
behind whatever tools are out there to eradicate this offence.
<P>
	I will give very hard thought to how I will vote on this issue 
because I have not yet made up my mind as to whether I will vote 
in support of the existing Criminal Code amendments. I know 
they are useful. I have concerns about limiting the length of time 
and I wish the members opposite to know those concerns.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first of all, I wish to commend the hon. member for Québec for 
putting forward this bill and convincing the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to make it a votable 
item. This issue speaks to our fundamental values. I also wish to 
thank the hon. member for providing me with extensive 
documentation on the subject.
<P>
	This issue concerns me as a citizen and a parliamentarian, of 
course, but also as the father of a 16-year old daughter. I shudder 
at the thought that, had she been born in a different country, in a 
different culture, she could have been subjected to the same 
treatment.
<P>
	It is surprising and even astounding that the Canadian 
Criminal Code criminalizes cockfights but contains no specific 
provisions against female genital mutilation, because it is 
indeed a form of mutilation. We should not fool ourselves or try 
to hide behind euphemisms. Female  circumcision is simply a 
euphemism designed to take the edge off a cruel reality. There is 
no comparison between male circumcision, which can even be a 
religious rite in some regards, and female genital mutilation. We 
talked earlier about the full or partial excision of the clitoris. We 
talked about infibulation, in which healthy organs are mutilated 
on purpose.
<P>
	There is something absolutely outrageous about this 
procedure, and I was surprised to hear my colleague, the hon. 
member for London West, say earlier that the current provisions 
of the Criminal Code may be adequate, since they cover bodily 
harm and assaults causing bodily harm. The problem is that 
these provisions have been in the Criminal Code for a long time. 
They have been there for so long that people from other cultures 
who come to Canada and engage in female genital mutilation do 
not feel at all that they are guilty of causing bodily harm or of 
assault causing bodily harm.
<P>
	These people feel, rightly or wrongly, that they are acting in 
accordance with their culture. The time has come to send them a 
clear message. We certainly have no mandate to become cultural 
imperialists, but we can say: ``From the moment you cross the 
Canadian border, here is what the Parliament of Canada has to 
say. As long as you are on Canadian territory, you must adopt the 
following value, which we have adopted as our own-if you 
mutilate the genital organs of a woman, you are guilty of an 
indictable offence''. I will come back later to the penalty which 
could be imposed.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	This is the message that we should first and above all send, a 
clear, cultural message that, although we accept certain 
multicultural values, and many are acceptable, we have to draw 
the line somewhere, and we draw it here. We must say: We do 
not want any of this going on in our country. All the better if 
others follow our example and take the same legislative 
approach as we have. But we must send the message loud and 
clear that we have zero tolerance when it comes to the mutilation 
of female genital organs. We must make sure that everybody 
gets the message, because we are not only targeting people from 
other cultures; we are also targeting people on the inside, people 
who are culturally already Canadians and who, for one reason or 
another, are looking for excuses for shirking their 
responsibilities.
<P>
	The criminalization of genital mutilation of female persons 
would involve the application of section 21 of the Criminal 
Code under which everyone is party to an offence who actually 
commits it, which includes conspiring to commit the offence, 
being an accessory and attempting to commit the offence. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13358"> 13358 </A></B>
<P>
would cover far more people, in fact all those who willingly 
observe the so-called omerta, the law of silence, which is 
unacceptable in this context, and they will realize that as soon as 
Bill C-277 is passed. They ought to know that now, and in fact 
they do. There is an element of wishful blindness on the part of 
members of the medical  profession who agree to engage in the 
genital mutilation of female persons because they say that if it is 
done by lay people there would be a risk of infection.
<P>
	This does not make sense. It is like people who say that at 
least if we do the excision or infibulation, it is under anaesthetic. 
There is something very wrong with that type of reasoning. 
Whether it hurts or not is not the point. The point is whether we 
are prepared to tolerate such a brutal, I would even say bestial 
act.
<P>
	The hon. member for Québec said earlier that 6,000 young 
girls or young women undergo this horrifying operation every 
day. I saw it on television once. It was very painful to watch, and 
it turned my stomach to see a girl of ten or not even that, tied up 
with a piece of wood in her mouth to keep her from screaming or 
to stifle her screams. It was awful. These images were horrible. 
And I think no Canadian who would see this violation of the 
integrity of the human body could remain unmoved.
<P>
	I have no problem supporting the bill sponsored by the hon. 
member for Québec, for the reasons I just mentioned. We must 
put an end to this because, by tolerating or claiming to tolerate 
genital mutilation, we are merely giving further credit to a status 
that for a long time was and in some respects still is the lot of 
women in Canada and in the western world, to be a second class 
person.
<P>
	Remember that female suffrage in Canada only came after the 
First World War. The first woman to sit in this House, Agnes 
Macphail, was elected in 1921. For a long time, members of the 
female sex were considered mere subordinates. It has not always 
been easy. It is still not easy in this country to take one's 
womanhood and assert it right to the top.
<P>
	The reason you are in the chair today is not because you were 
given the position, but because you and your parents and your 
grandparents fought to put you there. What a vibrant symbol to 
have a woman in the chair. We could set an example in various 
ways, but the point should be made in another respect that, in 
terms of the status of women, major changes are still required in 
areas where this still applies.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	Equal treatment for women, obviously not only equal under 
the law-we already have this pretty well everywhere now-, 
but equal in fact. Equal in fact means having people understand, 
from the earliest age, that men and women are born, live and die 
equally-not only in law but in fact. When we accept these 
principles, we will then be able to advance the status of women 
in Canada.
<P>
	One comment on the proposal by my colleague for Québec: 
the punishment for the offence she proposes to make of the 
mutilation of genital organs is, in my opinion, not nearly severe 
enough.
<P>
	Since a charge of assault causing bodily harm can result in a 
maximum term of 14 years' imprisonment, I will suggest in 
committee, because I am sure the House will refer this bill to the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, that the 
maximum sentence be at least 14 years as well.
<P>
	The maximum sentence must be the sentence given the worst 
criminal in the worst situation. In the case of a repeat offence or 
multiple offences, the five year sentence seems inadequate. This 
can easily be done in committee. On the principle of the matter, I 
will support Bill C-277 when the vote is taken.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to lend by support to the private members' 
bill of my colleague for Quebec. The issue is extremely 
important and deserves the attention of all of us in the House.
<P>
	During the recent hearings by the standing committee on 
citizenship and immigration we discussed and heard evidence 
on gender based immigration. Canada was the first country to 
recognize gender based persecution, and women who fear 
genital mutilation have been granted refugee status. Experts say 
over 100 million women have been subjected to genital 
mutilation-what horror.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In Montreal, the Human Rights Commission is threatening 
legal action against anyone performing such an abomination on 
young girls. The mutilation is practised on young girls for 
religious and cultural reasons.
<P>
	We know how difficult it is to change traditions and customs, 
but we can at least forbid such violent acts in Canada, thus 
protecting naive young girls who do not have access to other 
cultures and traditions. The amendment to the Criminal Code 
will ensure that such a practice is neither accepted nor justified 
in our society.
<P>
	The procedure is carried out by a woman who does not even 
need to have the necessary expertise or instruments to operate 
on the young girls.
<P>
	Even though we cannot intervene in other countries, we must 
make sure that such tragedies do not occur in Canada where 
multiculturalism protects us, but does not condone practices 
which are contrary to human rights or criminal in nature.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Multiculturalists can help with educating Canadians on this 
and other issues. Nowadays new surgical techniques are being 
developed to undo the damage so that women who were 
subjected to infibulation can have children without having to 
suffer excruciating pain and can have almost the same type of 
life an 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13359"> 13359 </A></B>
<P>
adult woman is entitled  to. This is only a way to cure and we 
need to be proactive.
<P>
	We are learning more and more about genital mutilation. We 
are also learning that in some countries it is inflicted on all 
young girls. It is known that after an extremely painful operation 
conducted without anaesthetics or proper surgical tools the 
young girls will never be able to enjoy a full life as an adult and 
they often die.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Because of the facts I just mentioned and for many other 
reasons mentioned by my colleagues, I will support Bill C-277 
regarding the genital mutilation of female persons. I also want 
to thank the member for Québec for bringing this piece of 
legislation forward.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hour provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to 
the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NUCLEARNON-PROLIFERATIONTREATY">NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on May 11 I asked the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs what was being done to assure the extension of the 
non-proliferation treaty, which was then being negotiated in 
New York City. In particular, I asked what was being done to 
oblige the nuclear weapon states to respect article VI of the 
treaty.
<P>
	According to article VI, the nuclear weapon states are obliged 
to reduce their nuclear weapons. That was part of the 
non-proliferation treaty bargain. The non-nuclear weapon 
states agreed not to develop nuclear weapons, while the nuclear 
weapon states committed themselves to reducing their nuclear 
arsenals.
<P>
	What happened? Since the treaty was implemented in 1970 
the non-nuclear weapon states, Canada included, developed or 
acquired no nuclear weapons. In other words, the non-nuclear 
weapon states totally respected the treaty. On the other hand, the 
three nuclear weapon states, the United States, the Soviet Union, 
and the United Kingdom, ignored their obligations under article 
VI.
<P>
	In 1970, when the treaty was brought into force, the United 
States and the Soviet Union had 8,000 nuclear weapons. By 1990 
they had 50,000 nuclear weapons. Not only did they not reduce 
their nuclear weapons, they increased them in a spectacular way.
<P>
	Since the treaty was limited to 25 years, until March of this 
year, was necessary to renegotiate its continuation, and that is 
what was being done this spring in New York. However, one of 
the major problems with many of the countries that were 
brought to reconsider the treaty was the failure of the nuclear 
weapon states to live up to their obligations under article VI. 
Many non-nuclear weapon states asked why they should support 
the extension of a treaty that was not respected by the nuclear 
weapon states.
<P>
	That was the question I put to the minister on May 11. 
Unfortunately, the parliamentary secretary did not answer that 
part of the question. He told me, and I was extremely pleased, 
that on that very day there had been an agreement to extend the 
non-proliferation treaty for an indefinite period of time. He did 
not, however, mention the conditions. He did not say what was 
being done to oblige the nuclear weapon states to reduce their 
nuclear weapons in accordance with article VI.
<P>
	I have since learned that review conferences will continue to 
be held every five years to promote full implementation of the 
treaty and that there was a commitment to approve the 
comprehensive test ban treaty by 1996 as well as the 
establishment of certain nuclear free zones.
<P>
	Once again ask the parliamentary secretary what measures are 
being taken to assure that the nuclear weapon states will comply 
with article VI of the NPT. Also, what is being done to assure 
universal adherence to this important treaty?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is to be congratulated for his work 
nationally and with international organizations in bringing 
about security and stability to this planet.
<P>
	A few weeks ago the 176 member nations of the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty, or the NPT, together took a historic 
decision to extend the life of this key international treaty 
indefinitely, which is unquestionably the most important 
international arms control agreement in existence.
<P>
	The indefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT was a 
key Canadian objective. This treaty is vitally important to 
Canada for three essential reasons. First, the NPT establishes a 
barrier to the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. This is 
the treaty's most fundamental purpose and its most outstanding 
success. Canada and the world are more secure as a result.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13360"> 13360 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, the treaty commits all states to work toward 
disarmament, including nuclear disarmament. Our long term 
goal is the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.
<P>
	Third, the treaty provides the framework for the peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy by establishing a system of effective 
international safeguards. Our exports of nuclear technology 
under safeguard agreements have helped to sustain an industry 
that employs 20,000 Canadians directly and 10,000 Canadians 
indirectly.
<P>
	Canada played a leading role at the NPT review and extension 
conference by marshalling the support of over 100 countries 
from all regions of the world for a resolution to indefinitely 
extend the treaty.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	With the continued existence of the NPT no longer in question 
we have laid down the basis for long term security and stability, 
the essential elements necessary for further reductions in global 
nuclear inventories.
<P>
	We have now turned the corner. The cold war is over and we 
are on the road to a world with fewer and fewer nuclear weapons. 
We have a long way to go, but we are on the right track. Without 
the NPT the world would be a much more dangerous place and 
Canadians would be much less secure.
<P>
	We can be justly proud of the key role Canada played in 
securing the benefits of the NPT now and for future generations 
to come.
<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on may 
11, I asked the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration about 
the enormous number of rejected applications for landing made 
by immigrants and refugees unable to pay the $975 immigration 
tax at the Mississauga claims processing office alone.
<P>
	The minister denied the figures published in the media but 
recognized that 3,800 applications were returned because the 
required fee was not attached and that 400 loan applications 
were made. He failed to say however how many of these 
applications were rejected.
<P>
	In fact, both the minister and his officials refuse to see how 
serious the situation really is. His department has refused to 
provide us with accurate information. In the coming weeks or 
months, the minister will no doubt realize and be forced to admit 
that this problem is taking disastrous proportions.
<P>
	The only figures available so far are for Mississauga. But 
what about the Végréville centre, the largest claims processing 
office in the country? The fact is that only 38 per cent of all loan 
applications are accepted. Rejections are motivated for the most 
part by the fact that processing officers believe that claimants 
are not solvent.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, I visited a number of agencies that provide 
assistance to immigrants in the Montreal area. Among them 
were the Bordeaux-Cartierville support centre for immigrant 
communities, which is located in your riding, Madam Speaker, 
and the Service d'aide aux réfugiés et aux immigrants du 
Montréal métropolitain, or SARIMM. The people I met there 
told me they had seen people desperately looking for money in 
order to pay this tax. Some abandon the idea of having their 
spouse or children join them in Canada because they cannot pay. 
How can the minister ignore this reality?
<P>
	Immigrants contribute more to the public treasury than 
citizens born in Canada, says Professor Ather Akbari, from St. 
Mary's University in Halifax, who recently testified before the 
immigration committee. His studies show that in 1990 
immigrant families paid on average $22,528 in taxes while they 
received only $10,558 worth of public services.
<P>
	Why should immigrants have to pay a tax even before they 
land here, on top of the $500 fee required to have their record 
processed? In most cases, this is cruel, immoral, unfair, and 
discriminatory.
<P>
	Many recognized refugees cannot get permanent residence in 
Canada because they cannot afford to pay the tax. What is their 
status, then? Nobody seems to know. In the meantime, they are 
not eligible to social benefits because they are not Canadian 
residents. How, then, are they supposed to become part of the 
Canadian society?
<P>
	In 1988, a new program was initiated to help female refugees, 
especially from countries at war. Up to 1993, Canada has 
admitted only 655 women under that program. One of the 
barriers is that many of those refugees do not have the money to 
pay their fare to Canada. As a matter of fact, the government has 
refused to lend them money because they are deemed incapable 
of paying that money back.
<P>
	The least the minister could do is make loans available to 
recognized refugees when they request that kind of assistance 
and want to bring their family to Canada.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
greatly disappointed by the remarks made by my colleague from 
Bourassa. It is too bad, but what can you do?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member means well but his acquaintance with the 
facts is still at best nodding. The numbers that he quotes are very 
preliminary. The numbers in the press were not correct and even 
were they correct, too preliminary to create any kind of a trend.
<P>
	It will take some months before we see the consistency of rate 
that can give us some idea of the trends. What is important, très 
important pour mon cher ami de Bourassa, is that since the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13361"> 13361 </A></B>
<P>
February budget  announcement the number of requests for 
landing has gone up, not down.
<P>
	Since the announcement 18,000 applications for landing have 
been processed. Of the 18,000 applications, less than 3 per cent 
have requested loans. Sponsors who have had their applications 
returned because they did not include the new fee are 
resubmitting applications very quickly and with the correct fee.
<P>
	Any applicant who does not initially qualify for a loan may 
reapply at any time without penalty. In addition, as the member 
well knows, refugees have had permission to work since 
February 1994.
<P>
	The important thing for the member to know is something I 
have said to him before. The minister has said it to him. We will 
say it again. No refugee will be denied protection. That is the 
important thing.
<P>
	The other important thing for the hon. member is that he 
should not believe everything he reads in the papers.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURE">AGRICULTURE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
rural Canada there is a tremendous concern about agriculture 
employment services. These services do a great deal to make 
certain that agricultural communities throughout Canada can 
provide labour and work in those communities.
<P>
	Farms very much depend on this service. Through federal 
government studies, we see that 55 per cent of our farm 
communities feel there would be a large problem within the 
sector if they did not have some type of agricultural employment 
service.
<P>
	In my riding of Essex-Kent, in the Leamington office alone 
we have approximately 3,670 placements annually. The office 
expense is approximately $189,000. The cost per placement or 
per job for the federal government is $50. In my community it 
generates $4 million worth of labour earnings.
<P>
	That $4 million justifies those placements dramatically and 
certainly cuts back on the cost of government across the board. 
The Chatham employment office has very similar statistics with 
2,500 job placements annually.
<P>
	This service is extremely important to both employees and 
employers. As the federal government has done studies on 
seasonal work it realizes that people with $15,000 incomes will 
draw on the federal and provincial governments in excess of 
$5,000 in support payments. With seasonal work, each dollar 
that is paid to a worker is reducing both the federal and 
provincial costs. This is extremely important to all in Canada.
<P>
	The agricultural service provides quick placements for labour 
when a crop is ready to be harvested, planted or when some other 
service is required. People have to be readily available and 
placed into those jobs.
<P>
	In my riding of Essex county and in Kent county it is a 
12-month a year service with greenhouses operating all winter, 
dairy farms with crops having to be harvested through the 
summer, in the spring and the fall pruning and harvesting. These 
are very important and add diversity and part time labour all 
year round.
<P>
	The minister's working group has cited that this is one of the 
most successful examples of meeting seasonal labour demands 
in the country in its studies. It cites that it is a very timely, 
important industry for the agricultural market to make our 
seasonal industries operate properly.
<P>
	It is very clear that as CEC is in transition at this time it would 
be unable to pick up the slack if agricultural employment 
services were withdrawn. I think it is very important that the 
minister review this scenario and attempt to meet the rural 
needs.
<P>
	There is absolutely no question when I look at the minister's 
approach that I am pleased he has decided he will set up a 
committee to investigate and operate within the structure and 
possibly reinvestigate the funding that may be possible for the 
agricultural employment service. It is important that we look at 
this for all rural communities throughout Canada and make 
certain our agricultural industry is successful and prosperous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the government recognizes the importance of human 
resources development services to rural communities across 
Canada.
<P>
	As announced in the budget, HRDC is carrying out a thorough 
review and reorganization of programs and services to reduce 
overhead costs and find new ways of delivering services more 
efficiently and effectively. Every effort is being made so that 
services are accessible relevant to local needs and service 
oriented.
<P>
	As the minister of HRD has previously stated, there will be 
more points of service in rural communities after reorganization 
than there currently are. Priority will be on ensuring that all 
clients including those in smaller communities will not have to 
travel for more than one-half hour to have access to basic 
services. The addition of 300 to 400 electronic kiosks means that 
HRDC will have the potential to reach 97 per cent of the working 
age population in all areas, including those in smaller 
communities.
<P>
	In the context of that reform the minister is looking at 
developing new partnerships with the private sector, the unions 
and local stakeholders in the delivery of our services.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13362"> 13362 </A></B>
<P>
	One specific area in which this approach is being pursued is 
the area of agricultural employment services. The minister has 
already announced that his department will continue to provide 
these services for the next year. At the same time, he has 
announced that AES and CECs will be involved in the 
development of transition plans at the local level to involve 
more players in the delivery of agricultural services.
<P>
	Regions will work with industry partners to recommend 
co-operative agreements that will continue to serve employers 
in the agricultural industry. CEC is exploring options to handle 
the labour exchange function currently provided by AES. HRDC 
remains committed to the agricultural community and will 
continue to provide the best services possible.
<P>

Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned
