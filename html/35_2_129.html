<P>
	The petitioners urge all levels of government to demonstrate 
their commitment to education and literacy by eliminating sales tax

three petitions to present this morning. The first is from Mr. Bob 
Pollock of North Vancouver and 35 others. The petitioners mention 
that 52 per cent of the price of gasoline is composed of taxes and 
the Canadian Automobile Association reports that the federal 
excise tax on gasoline has already increased by 566 per cent over 
the last decade.

second petition is from Joyce Mulligan of North Vancouver and 57 
others.
<P>
	In this petition these residents of Canada draw the attention of 
the House to the fact that 38 per cent of the national highway 
system is substandard, that Mexico and the United States are 
upgrading their national highway systems and that the national 
highway policy study identified job creation, economic 
development, national unity, saving lives and avoiding injuries, 
lower congestion, lower vehicle operating costs and better 
international competitiveness as benefits of the proposed national 
highway program.

<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 91-<B>Mr. Milliken:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What were the personnel costs of the Sound and Light Show on Parliament Hill in 
1995, and what costs were incurred by federal government departments or agencies, 
other than the National Capital Commission, in respect of the said show?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am informed by 
the National Capital Commission and the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services as follows: The National Capital 
Commission, NCC, personnel costs for the 1995 Sound and Light 
Show on Parliament Hill were $35,400.
<P>
	In 1995, total expenditures in the amount of $103,407 were 
incurred by Public Works and Governments Services Canada, 
PWGSC, in respect to the NCC Sound and Light Show.
<P>
	This was a one-time contribution, consisting primarily of a 
$100,000 payment to the NCC for the purchase by the NCC of a 
projector for the Sound and Light Show which was necessary for 
the adaptation of the show due to the restoration work being carried 
out on the Centre Block south facade.
<P>
	An additional $3,407 was incurred for the design, supply and 
installation of new stainless steel lighting brackets on the north 
wall of the Peace Tower. The old brackets which were of ordinary 
steel were corroding and damaging the stone.
<P>
	Personnel costs cannot be identified as this work, the 
replacement of lighting brackets, was included in the Peace Tower 
project.
<P>
	PWGSC, as custodian of the Parliament Buildings, is 
responsible for assets occupied by tenants and is also responsible 
for grounds.
<P>
	Other departments and agencies have no information on this 
subject.
<P>
Question No. 103-<B>Mr. Robinson:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to applications for Canada pension plan disability benefits and 
considering the time presently required between the submission of an application 
and when benefits are received, or the application is definitely rejected, can the 
Minister of Human Resources Development indicate: (<I>a</I>) the mean time, (<I>b</I>) the 
median time and (<I>c</I>) the maximum time for each quintile of applicants and what 
measures are being taken to reduce these delays?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> As part of a major  redesign of income 
security programs intended to streamline and modernize our 
delivery systems, the Canada pension plan, CPP, disability program 
was decentralized during 1996. This included the regionalization of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8047"> 8047 </A></B>
<P>
operations and brought decision making for CPP disability 
applications and reconsiderations closer to our clients throughout 
Canada.
<P>
	Roll out of the regional functions occurred on a schedule from 
November 1995 to June 1996.
<P>
	As a result, all applications for Canada pension plan disability 
benefits, except those for Quebec and Prince Edward Island, are 
received and processed in the regions.
<P>
	From January to the end of December 1996, Canada pension 
plan reveived 79,778 applications for disability benefits.
<P>
	It is a massive undertaking to move files, functions, technology 
and some staff from headquarters to 10 regions, and to train local 
personnel who will be performing new duties, all this while 
continuing to receive and process applications of the magnitude 
received by CPP on a daily basis. Delays are inevitable during a 
breaking-in period. We are in that period now.
<P>
	This adjustment period and the loss of some economies of scale 
subsequent to decentralization and the underestimation of 
resources have resulted in backlogs in some regions in the 
adjudication of disability applications.
<P>
	a) Presently, the average national time to process a disability 
application in the region is 59 working days. In some instances 
further information is required from medical specialists. These 
cases require additional time beyond the national average. The 
following reflects the time elapsed from receipt of the application 
to the time a decision to grant or deny benefits is made. By region, 
it is as follows:
<P>
	Newfoundland: 	41<BR>
 	Nova Scotia: 	35<BR>
 	New Brunswick: 	60<BR>
 	Ontario: 	49<BR>
 	Manitoba/Saskatchewan: 	43<BR>
 	Alberta: 	68<BR>
 	British Columbia: 	117
<P>
	b, c) A major redesign of the systems supporting the Canada 
pension plan disability process is under way. When it is in place in 
1998 it is expected that the average processing time for a disability 
application will drop to 30 days. This will also give us the means to 
gather, manipulate and analyse in a variety of sophisticated ways 
data regarding various aspects of our service delivery approaches.
<P>
	Until then it is not possible to provide the response time in terms 
of the median time and the maximum time for each quintile of 
applicants.
<P>
	Plans are under way to redirect as of March 1, 1997 some 
regional files to headquarters where the efforts of some 30 
adjudication staff will be redirected from the reassessment program 
to the processing of regional disability applications. Decreasing the 
backlog in British  Columbia as well as Ontario where the volumes 
are greatest will be the first priority.
<P>
	All regions are presently implementing an action plan that will 
decrease response time to an acceptable level by the end of May 
1997. This will include hiring and training additional staff, the use 
of overtime and further streamlining of work processes.
<P>
	A national committee has been established to develop an 
improved method of forecasting resources required for the 
disability program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be 
allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its approach to federal 
transportation policies, and in particular, the cancellation of the Pearson Airport deal, 
the continued neglect of Canada's national highway system, costly inefficiencies in 
the grain transportation system, and the on-going subsidization of VIA Rail at the 
expense of taxpayers and private-sector passenger rail and bus operators.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Reform supply day 
motion. There are four specific items named in the motion but of 
course others may choose to expand beyond them. I will speak on 
three of the four items highlighted in the motion, leaving the grain 
question to be handled by my colleagues from the agricultural 
sector.
<P>
	I open with a few comments on the Pearson airport contract. 
Yesterday Reform exposed some of the myths projected by the 
Liberal Party dealing with its finances. It seems unfair that the 
finance department alone should be singled out.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the Pearson airport deal. It is a myth that this 
is a payoff for Tory businessmen. The fact is that there are more 
known ties to the Liberal Party in the make-up of the Pearson 
contract holders.
<P>
	Another myth is: ``We had to cancel the deal because it was too 
rich''. The fact is that secret government documents have revealed 
it was a good deal for the government. What is more, the 
government is now in court arguing that the contract holders would 
not have made any money at all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8048"> 8048 </A></B>
<P>
	The true facts of this scandalous, mishandled political blunder 
are as follows. During the election campaign the Liberals stated 
that they thought the Pearson deal was bad and that a Liberal 
government would investigate and would cancel the contract if it 
found wrongdoing.
<P>
	I have no problem with that. To be honest, I felt the same way. At 
this point the public was ready to believe anything about 
Mulroney's old party. The problem was that when they got elected 
and investigated the contract, the Liberals could not find anything 
wrong with it. Further, studies in the possession of the Liberals 
clearly indicated that it was a good deal for the government and 
thus for the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Without one shred of real evidence the Liberal government 
slanderously attacked the Pearson contract holders using no 
evidence whatsoever and using only political rhetoric. To protect 
themselves the Liberals then introduced the most undemocratic 
piece of legislation the House has ever seen, Bill C-28.
<P>
	What should they have done? After the investigation did not 
actually turn up any evidence of wrongdoing and armed with 
studies that pointed out the value of the contract of the government, 
the Liberals should have stated that the contract was not quite as 
bad as they thought it might have been and that they would try to 
make some changes that would make it acceptable. I am sure if 
they had gone to the contract holders they could have arranged a 
few face saving changes to the contract and then pronounced it 
okay to proceed with the changes that the Liberal Party had made.
<P>
	What did members of the public get instead? Right now they 
have a legal bill that is over $13 million to date and still growing. 
They have a lawsuit with a potential settlement of hundreds of 
millions of dollars, a lawsuit that the Liberals had been warned 
about in those same secret documents in their position before they 
proceeded.
<P>
	Terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson airport would have been 
substantially rebuilt instead of being in the deplorable condition 
they are in to this day. They have no plans for the needed rebuilding 
of those terminals and they have no money in the bank. It will be 
interesting to see how the upcoming budget addresses that 
particular problem.
<P>
	Finally, there were enormous job and tax revenue losses for 
metro Toronto. The loss of direct and indirect jobs from the 
cancellation of the contract has cost the Toronto area tens of 
thousands of jobs and business activity. If there is any honour 
among the Liberals they would pay the cost of their politically 
motivated mistake from their own party account. We know this will 
not happen because that honour is not there.
<P>
	With regard to the recently released report on the national 
highway system renewal, there is nothing in it that deals with a 
solution to our deteriorating national  highway. There is nothing 
there to get excited about. It is again filled with Liberal rhetoric.
<P>
	I should mention that the press release put out by the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Transport has a neat little trick in it. It 
says: ``Not only are we excited about this but the official opposition 
has signed on and we are all singing together''. Maybe the official 
opposition did but the national opposition party certainly did not.
<P>
	The report is full of Liberal rhetoric and when it comes to real 
solutions there are not any there. There are three fundamental 
problems. A huge majority of the witnesses who came before the 
committee asked for some portion of the federal fuel tax revenues 
to be dedicated specifically to dealing with the national highway 
system. It should be noted that the government collects about $5 
billion a year in highway fuel taxes and spends a mere $200 
million.
<P>
	In a highly manipulated move the chair decided to hold a 
one-day invitation only round table discussion which he used to 
override the testimony of four months of witnesses. Virtually all 
the recommendations in the report arise out of that one-day 
meeting instead of the four months of testimony.
<P>
	The report states that the government should commit long term 
stable funding for highway rebuilding but refuses to do this through 
a dedicated account because then it would have to live up to that 
commitment, which is something it will not likely do.
<P>
	The second area where the report errs is by suggesting that 
shadow tolling is a funding source. Shadow tolling involves the 
checking of traffic and making a payment based on the traffic to the 
operator of the highway. It is a method used to repay a private 
contractor for building or rebuilding a bridge, highway or some 
other portion of highway infrastructure, but the payment still has to 
be made by the government. Shadow tolling and public-private 
partnerships are valid cost saving efficiencies but they are not 
funding sources. Unless the government is planning to rebuild our 
national highway system by the introduction of massive vehicle 
tolls, this section of the report is deliberately misleading.
<P>
	The final and most important area of the report is relying on the 
private sector through public private partnerships to deal with 
much of the highway problem.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	This in itself has much potential but only if there is confidence in 
the private sector that the government is honourable in its dealings, 
and there is much evidence that this honour does not exist. The 
government handling of the Pearson contract was only the smallest 
tip of the iceberg.
<P>
	In 1989 the government went to the private sector and asked it to 
take over the money losing VIA Rail Rocky Mountaineer. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8049"> 8049 </A></B>
<P>
private sector responded. The Rocky  Mountaineer was purchased 
by a company known as the Great Canadian Railtour Company.
<P>
	Although it was losing money at the time of its purchase, the 
Great Canadian Railtour Company spent millions of dollars 
building and advertising the Rocky Mountaineer. Today it is an 
overwhelming success story. It has increased its business by 30 per 
cent per year on an ongoing and constant basis.
<P>
	When it was taken over there were 5,000 passengers utilizing 
that system. In 1996, 42,000 people travelled on the Rocky 
Mountaineer. Also in 1996 they announced their expansion plans 
for 1997. They then went to VIA Rail and purchased the coaches 
necessary for this expanded service and sent them to Kamloops in 
British Columbia to be refurbished and to bring them up to the high 
standard Rocky Mountaineer insists on. Three months later VIA 
Rail, knowing the expansion plans of the Rocky Mountaineer and 
having sold it the cars that Rocky Mountaineer was using for this 
expansion, announced that it wanted back in. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	What is even more unacceptable is that the Minister of Transport 
is actually considering allowing it. He is not only considering it but 
actually we believe he is at the point of announcing it. This is not 
only unacceptable to me but it is unacceptable to a great list of 
other people.
<P>
	I have a copy of a letter that was delivered to the Minister of 
Transport from the organization the government is now relying on 
to bail it out of the highway system problem it has got itself into. 
The letter is from the Canadian Council for Public-Private 
Partnerships. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the case of VIA Rail's Rocky Mountaineer service the government correctly 
got out of a money losing activity. If the government wants to re-enter the business 
now that an entrepreneurial private sector operator has made it profitable, this will 
deter future private sector companies from bidding on future government 
privatization opportunities. The example of the government exiting and re-entering a 
business will send a bad signal to entrepreneurs who are looking to establish these 
types of public-private partnerships.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So much for the government's great plan to rebuild our national 
highway system. It first has to get the private sector's trust. Even as 
the government says it wants it, it is throwing this in the private 
sector's face.
<P>
	If the minister thinks that allowing VIA to proceed is good for 
tourism, why have the Council on Tourism Associations of British 
Columbia and the Tourism Alliance of Western and Northern 
Canada emphatically stated their opposition to it?
<P>
	How can the minister think allowing VIA to proceed is good for 
B.C. when every passenger VIA takes from the Great Canadian 
Railtour Company means another person staying and eating on a 
subsidized VIA Rail train instead of staying in B.C. hotels and 
eating in B.C. restaurants?
<P>
	If the minister raises the support of the Canadian Tourism 
Commission, is the minister not aware that his crown corporation 
has been subsidized to the tune of over $7 billion through VIA that 
it gives in terms of CTC dollars every year? Should he not 
reconsider that its input is biased? This is especially true if we 
consider that the vice-president of the Canadian Tourism 
Commission is a former VIA employee who was unsuccessful in 
his bid to acquire the Rocky Mountaineer and who ended up in 
litigation with the Great Canadian Railtour Company.
<P>
	The chair of the Canadian Tourism Commission marketing 
committee is vice-president of marketing at VIA Rail and was also 
involved in the unsuccessful bid for the Rocky Mountaineer. 
According to the Liberal government there is no bias I am sure.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	What public need is served by allowing a crown corporation that 
is subsidized hundreds of millions of dollars to compete against a 
private sector taxpaying company that has done everything the 
government asked it to do when it sold the route in the first place?
<P>
	I have a few interesting quotes: ``If the government does not 
need to run something, it should not, and in the future it will not''. 
That was said by the Liberal Minister of Finance. The mayor of 
Kamloops said: ``VIA Rail's plan to increase passenger traffic 
would have a devastating impact on the Great Canadian Railtour 
Company and the Kamloops economy''.
<P>
	Here is another dandy. I trust the parliamentary secretary is 
taking this one in: ``I cannot emphasize too much that we are not in 
the business of putting at risk anyone who has taken on risk in the 
private sector trying to help us out in the railway industry''. Who is 
that one from? The then Minister of Transport who is now the 
defence minister for that same Liberal government.
<P>
	What did the public have to say through organizations like the 
Canadian Taxpayers' Federation? ``Forget the Vancouver-Jasper 
decision, Mr. Anderson. Put VIA Rail on the selling block, a 1990s 
version of the Last Spike that is long overdue''.
<P>
	What is even more disturbing to me is the matter of honour with 
the Liberal government. In December the chair of the Standing 
Committee on Transport announced to me that he wanted to hold a 
round table discussion in Ottawa during the recess of Parliament in 
January. I told him I was not in favour of this because there was no 
possible way I could attend. This is not a break, as it is 
euphemistically called, but is in fact a required time to work in our 
constituencies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Not required-optional.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> It is an option for Liberals. Only Reformers actually 
work in their constituencies.
<P>
	He said: ``I really want your approval for this and I am willing to 
make some kind of a deal with you. What  do you want?'' I said: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8050"> 8050 </A></B>
<P>
``What I need is a statement from the committee that it is the wrong 
signal from the government to allow VIA Rail to get back into 
competition with the company it sold to the private sector and that 
it is sending that signal out at a time when you are counting in the 
private sector to bail you out''. He agreed to that in writing. He then 
proceeded to hold the round table which is being used to override 
four months of testimony. Then they reneged on the written 
commitment that was made.
<P>
	There is no honour on that side of the House. There is no honour 
in the Liberal Party. There is no reason for the private sector to trust 
the government as it now goes around saying: ``Help us, we have 
made a mess of the national highway system and now we need you 
to bail us out''. The private sector is capable of bailing out the 
Liberals, but it had better be awfully careful when it enters into a 
deal with the current Government of Canada, the Liberal Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just two points for the hon. 
member opposite who is a longstanding member of the transport 
committee, of which I have had the honour to be a part since my 
election in 1988.
<P>
	The member should know that a committee of the House of 
Commons is the master of its own destiny. If the member could 
possibly understand, a committee makes its decisions to proceed in 
the best way possible in order to glean all the information it can to 
make the decisions at the end of the day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> How can you keep a straight 
face?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Unfortunately the hon. member opposite would 
sooner spend his time, as he said he did, back in his riding holding 
what he called politically oriented meetings, et cetera, rather than 
doing the job that his constituents sent him here to Ottawa to do.
<P>
	We were working very hard on a triple T study, as we call it, a 
trade, transportation and tourism study. We heard a bevy of 
witnesses on the subject.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	To the credit of the chairman of that committee, he pulled 
together 22 players, who either came to the committee at one time 
or made written interventions to the committee, to sit at one table. 
It worked wonderfully. Unfortunately, the hon. member missed it. 
Not one member of the Reform Party was present. However, the 
government and the official opposition were there.
<P>
	Twenty-two people were sitting around the table. Instead of the 
usual way a committee works, hearing witness after another, 
unconnected, and only hearing one side of the story, we had all 
these witnesses sitting around the table discussing the idea of 
finding new options, exploring new ways of helping to finance a  
national highways project. One person would say something and 
another person would argue sensibly, quietly and diligently why we 
may not be able to do something.
<P>
	It was the most fruitful meeting I have been at in the nine years I 
have been sitting on committees. There was interaction at the table 
between the private sector, the public sector and members of 
Parliament who represent their constituencies. At the end of the 
day, there was a consensus among all the players. Even more 
important than pulling in witnesses and trying to come to some 
consensus as individual witnesses, it was a table that came together 
as a consensus. It was marvellous.
<P>
	The consensus was to move toward a model. We would take an 
example of a structured road somewhere in Canada and apply the 
strategic thinking that went on at that committee to the model to 
see how to crunch the numbers, to see the options of payment, and 
to see where the government and the Canadian taxpayers would be 
taking a lower risk on a particular venture. These are the great ideas 
that came out of that meeting. Unfortunately, the member opposite 
was not at it.
<P>
	On the subject of the Pearson airport deal, I have to ask myself 
about the hon. member of the Reform Party. Let us remind 
ourselves that he belongs to a party that prides itself on being the 
party of constituent consensus. Let us look at constituent 
consensus. What did constituency consensus state? In the Toronto 
<I>Star</I>, for example, on December 4, 1993, it stated: ``Prime 
Minister's Chrétien's decision to cancel the privatization deal of 
Pearson International Airport is a breath of fresh air that cleans the 
stench left behind by the shady deal worked out by the Tory 
lobbyists for friends of the previous government''.
<P>
	``Friends of the previous government''. After hearing the 
intervention of the Reform Party member opposite, I have to think 
that he could not be a friend of the taxpayers. He is a friend of these 
lobbyists, of the company run by a guy by the name of Don 
Matthews, a gentleman who was a chief Tory fundraiser and past 
president of the Conservative Party. He came forward with this 
deal. There is not even an option or opportunity for the not for 
profit corporation, the GTAA, Greater Toronto Airport Authority, 
to get into the bidding process. It was not allowed to bid on the 
project and the deal went to Paxport.
<P>
	At the end of the day Paxport, the company that won the deal, did 
not have the resources to follow through with what it wanted to do. 
What did it have to do? It had to reach out and pull in someone in 
order to meet the deal that it had promised the Conservatives. 
Therefore, it reached out to the owners of terminal 3, Claridge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Yes, Liberals, because Claridge wanted to make the 
airport work properly. However, I have to ask  the hon. member: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8051"> 8051 </A></B>
<P>
Who is he standing up for? Is he standing up for the consortium that 
wants $600 million for itself, never having put a shovel in the 
ground, or is he standing up for the Canadian taxpayer who says: 
``Government, you do what you have to do. You take these people 
to court. You make sure that you try to achieve a goal that says we 
are not going to give another penny over what is deserving, 
somewhere between $30 million and $60 million, not $600 million 
as demanded, to pay for things that were not done for the lobbyists 
and for the friends of Brian Mulroney?'' Where does the hon. 
member stand for the Canadian taxpayer?
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope I have enough time left to 
respond to the comments made by the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	First, I will deal with the last part of his tirade on the Pearson 
airport. He refers to the Toronto Star as his constituency. We know 
the Liberals play to the newspapers and we now have proof, right 
out of the mouth of the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	He keeps talking about the fact that this is a pay-off for the Tory 
supporters, but in fact, by his own admission, the principal group 
involved at the time of signing is the Claridge group which is made 
up of Liberals.
<P>
	As far as the settlement is concerned, we do not want a specific 
settlement, we want the rule of law to apply like anyone else. The 
Liberals cannot screw up, which is what they did with the Pearson 
cancellation, and then write legislation to protect their own hides.
<P>
	With respect to the highway study that he mentioned, he is the 
person who continually says that the committee is the master of its 
own destiny. I believe the chair of the committee is an honourable 
person, but he got orders from on high to disregard the 
commitments he made to me.
<P>
	The suggestion was made by the hon. member that I would rather 
be in my riding than down here doing my work. There is a 
parliamentary schedule. There is a schedule to be here; there is a 
schedule to be in the constituency. While he was dithering around 
doing who knows what, I was in my riding conferring with my real 
constituents, the taxpayers of this country, not the Toronto <I>Star</I>. I 
held 18 town hall meetings during the January recess period and the 
parliamentary secretary knows that.
<P>
	He says that they pulled in all these wonderful people. The 
principal leader was Moya Greene, who came right out of the 
transport department. He made a mistake. I asked for a certain 
report and they faxed it to me. In the report which they faxed to me 
were handwritten notes made by Moya Greene. They goofed again.
<P>
	The more the Liberals try to twist the facts, the more trouble they 
get into. They heard four months of testimony from witnesses and 
on a one day, by invitation only, round table, they brought in their 
own special people to manipulate this thing. They overruled four 
months of testimony and wrote a report based on one day.
<P>
	If that is what they intended to do, why did they waste hundreds 
of thousands of taxpayers' dollars travelling from one end of the 
country to the other? Time, money and effort were expended by all 
those witnesses who thought they were getting democracy, when 
the Liberals intended to hold a one day meeting and override the 
whole thing.
<P>
	Honour and democracy are alien words to that side of the House. 
Instead of buying a new red book they should buy a dictionary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to the remarks 
made by the hon. member and the Reform motion before the House 
which condemns the government for its approach to federal 
transportation policies.
<P>
	First, I would like to address the concluding remarks of the 
member opposite. He said that his constituents are somehow 
different than the constituents of the Toronto <I>Star</I>. I have spent 
some 16 years in television news-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> It was not just the Toronto <I>Star</I> but many other 
media outlets which displayed the same outrage on behalf of the 
people who read their newspapers, who just so happen to live in my 
riding and in the riding of the hon. member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke.
<P>
	The views of the taxpayers are seen on the editorial pages. 
Maybe the hon. member does not go beyond the editorials written 
by the paper and read the editorials with constituents' names 
attached to them. Some of them are outraged. Many have written to 
say they did not like the deal, that it was a deal which was hatched 
in the dying days of a Conservative administration that was on its 
way out because it had the worst eight year record of fraud that was 
ever established in Canadian history. On how many occasions did 
we watch, as I did, ministers on the Conservative front bench 
stepping down because of their improprieties?
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	The media outlets are there. They are doing their job. In order to 
represent the Canadian taxpayer, they are the people who are 
watching out. It is quite so these days that this House of Commons 
does not have an opposition. The opposition is the news media in 
this country and I say thank God for that.
<P>
	The government's transportation policies, the very policies that 
the hon. member for Kootenay  West-Revelstoke would have this 
House condemn, are helping to boost Canada's trade competitive-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8052"> 8052 </A></B>
<P>
ness. They are strengthening tourism. Best of all, they are creating 
jobs in Canada. That is because the transport minister and this 
government have a clear vision for the future of transportation in 
this country.
<P>
	Over many years governments in Canada invested in, operated, 
owned, regulated and controlled our transportation systems. This 
led to an overbuilt, oversubsidized, overregulated environment. 
Today however a far reaching modernization is under way.
<P>
	I believe it was the Minister of Finance who first pointed out to 
this House in one of his first budgets that the government ought to 
get out of the business of running business. That is part of the 
modernization process I am speaking to. Our government is 
working toward a more efficient, commercially driven, regionally 
responsive infrastructure that is less dependent on public subsidies. 
We are working toward transportation that a new economy can ride 
on.
<P>
	For proof of that work we need look no further than the first 
subject of today's motion, Pearson airport. Our government 
transferred control of Pearson airport to the Greater Toronto 
Airport Authority last December. That is what the people wanted in 
this country. This transfer cleared the way for the GTAA to 
redevelop Pearson to its fullest potential and to market the airport 
as one of North America's leading international gateways.
<P>
	The federal government ran Pearson airport for many years and 
it ran it well, but the federal government had neither the freedom 
nor the mandate to pursue the full commercial potential of the 
airport. However the GTAA has done both. It is free to aggressively 
market Pearson airport, to pursue new business opportunities, to 
use innovative financing for capital works.
<P>
	The commercial orientation will ensure that Pearson, Canada's 
largest and busiest airport, remains responsive to the needs of the 
travelling public, shippers, carriers and the surrounding 
community. Already the Greater Toronto Airport Authority has 
announced a major redevelopment plan for the airport that will see 
terminals 1 and 2 eventually replaced by a modern, unified 
terminal building. The redevelopment plan represents an 
investment of $2 billion in the airport; that is $2 billion, with a <I>b</I>. 
That is in addition to the $250 million worth of projects already 
under way at Pearson, including the construction of a new 
north-south runway and a centralized aircraft de-icing system.
<P>
	I emphasize that our government transferred control of the whole 
Pearson airport, not simply terminals 1 and 2. That will allow the 
airport authority to develop and put in place a vision for the airport 
as one single strong entity.
<P>
	In accordance with our government's national airports policy, 
the GTAA must also abide by strict principles of  public 
accountability. It must ensure that the concerns of airport users, the 
people who pay the bills, the local community and the taxpayer are 
not superseded by those of private interests, the friends of my hon. 
friend from Kootenay West-Revelstoke.
<P>
	The authority's board of directors must be composed of 
representatives from the community, the various levels of 
government and other participating organizations such as boards of 
trade and labour organizations. That is what our government's 
national airport policy is all about: ensuring that Canada's airports 
reach their full potential, that they generate growth, create jobs, all 
the while working in the best interests of the community and the 
country.
<P>
	The national airports policy is just one of our government's 
achievements in the air sector. We have been working hard to 
modernize Canadian air transportation. We have introduced a new 
international air transportation policy designed to better meet the 
needs of travellers, shippers and airport communities.
<P>
	Also of significant impact to Canadian travellers was the signing 
of the landmark open skies agreement with the United States back 
in February 1995. Thanks to open skies, Pearson airport is enjoying 
a significant number of new direct flights to the United States.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	On the issue of highways, just as improved air transportation 
leads to increased trade, tourism and jobs, so too does a safe, well 
maintained national highway system. That is why our government 
will be spending $292 million on cost shared highway development 
projects in this fiscal year alone. This is in addition to the 
approximately $100 million we spend each year on federally 
owned highways and bridges across the country. That is a total of 
$392 million, an amount that we just moments ago heard the 
Reform Party allege was a meagre amount.
<P>
	To quote the Reform Party member: ``The government is 
spending a mere $392 million on highways'', a mere. That is close 
to half a billion dollars. Only a Reform Party member could call an 
almost half a billion dollar investment in highways a mere amount.
<P>
	That is also why our government will be studying very carefully 
in the days ahead the recently tabled report from the Standing 
Committee on Transport which deals with the very issue of 
highway funding. It was when the report came together, when we 
returned to this House after the break, that we worked diligently 
day after day, hour after hour without the member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke who speaks so eloquently that we have a 
schedule here and a schedule there. Well, the schedule started two 
weeks ago and the member only returned to the House after our 
serious deliberations and meetings-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8053"> 8053 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. I think the hon. 
parliamentary secretary knows that it is improper to refer to the 
presence or absence of members. I invite him to refrain from that 
kind of comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Point taken, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	As the hon. members across the floor well know, highways are 
mostly the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces. The many 
funding agreements we have signed with the provinces and 
territories however are proof of our government's commitment to 
work with other levels of government to preserve and enhance 
Canada's national highway system.
<P>
	On the subject of grain transportation which the hon. member 
brought forward but did not speak to, our government's efforts to 
ensure the provision of a well maintained road system in this 
country mirror our work to modernize the rail sector. This leads me 
to the subject of grain transportation.
<P>
	The motion before us suggests that the federal government is 
responsible somehow for the inefficiencies in the grain 
transportation system. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Since coming to office, our government has taken bold steps to 
modernize rail transportation, the principal means by which grain 
is shipped in this country.
<P>
	The Canada Transportation Act for example has given Canadian 
railways the flexibility to compete by reducing costs and those 
excessive regulations. The new act has cut the number of railway 
actions or decisions requiring government approval to about 40 
from a previous high of 200. Cutting excess regulation will benefit 
not only the railways but also its customers, which include the 
grain shippers, through lower rail costs. The new act also shifts the 
focus from rail line abandonment toward the development of a 
healthy shortline industry.
<P>
	Canadian National is now a private company with the tools it 
needs to compete. Putting CN into the private sector was an 
important step in our government's plan for modernizing the rail 
transportation system. The privatization has placed CN and CP rail 
systems on a level playing field. It has also subjected CN to the 
disciplines of the marketplace.
<P>
	Not only will this move ensure the survival of the railway, but 
the gross proceeds from the sale of the crown's 80 million shares 
returned to the Canadian taxpayer in the amount of $2 billion. The 
enthusiastic response to the share offering by investors through 
Canada, the U.S. and internationally was outstanding. In fact it 
demonstrates CN's position as a strong player in the North 
American rail industry.
<P>
	Finally, let us talk about the issue of transportation subsidies. As 
even a casual observer will notice, our government has 
dramatically cut subsidies in the transport sector. We have done so 
because we believe  that those who use the transportation services 
should pay a greater share of the cost of providing those services.
<P>
	VIA Rail for example will see its annual subsidy reduced to $170 
million for the fiscal year 1997-98.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Only $170 million?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Only $170 million because prior to that, my friend 
in the party opposite, it was well over $300 million and we have cut 
the subsidy. To its credit VIA Rail has not cut services in the 
process.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I have addressed all the principal concerns set out 
in what I call this laughable motion, but by no means have I 
exhausted the list of accomplishments our government has 
achieved in the transport sector. There is the national marine policy 
for example. There is last November's transfer of the air navigation 
system to the not for profit corporation called Nav Canada, a move 
that also netted the taxpayers of the country $1.5 billion. I am 
proud to say that we are meeting our goal in this government.
<P>
	For five years I sat on the opposition benches. For five years I sat 
on the transport committee of the House and I watched the 
Conservative government-the same Conservative government 
that had its current leader sitting at the cabinet table-shelve 
document after document and not pay attention to the needs of 
transportation, not modernize transportation, not bring forward all 
the essences that make Canada great, that pull us together, that 
make us competitive and create jobs in this country.
<P>
	I am proud of this government's record and I am going to stick 
by it. I am prepared to entertain any questions the hon. member 
opposite might have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every time I hear the hon. member who just spoke I am 
more impressed with his talent. He just stood and gave 20 minutes 
of the biggest bunch of drivel I have ever heard yet he kept a 
straight face through the whole thing. Perhaps it is explained by his 
suggestion that he has a background in radio and television. I guess 
that is where he got his training.
<P>
	A couple of quick points. He said that the CN share sale was a 
huge success, and it was. In fact it was such a success that many 
Canadian purchasers wanted to buy shares. However they were not 
allowed to because the Liberal government in its document 
designated a large portion of them to be sold only outside the 
country. This was in spite of the fact that the Reform Party put in an 
amendment to say that for the first 60 or 30 days allow it for 
Canadians only and then open it up. The government refused to do 
that and many Canadian purchasers who wanted to keep the rail 
company ownership in Canada were refused because of Liberal 
policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8054"> 8054 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member says that the Pearson deal was signed in the 
dying days. I do not know, maybe the hon. member lives in the 
publishing office of the Toronto <I>Star</I> instead of a house because 
if he has ever bought or sold a house he knows that once you make 
a commitment to buy a house, the signing, the final completion 
of the contract, the conveyance comes further down the road. Once 
the commitment is made, both sides are locked in. To do otherwise 
would be a breach of contract like the one the government has 
now found itself in as ruled by the Supreme Court of Ontario.
<P>
	The hon. member said that government is oversized and 
oversubsidized and that the Liberals intend to cut it down. He also 
said that the government ought to get out of the business of running 
business. Why then would the government even consider for a 
moment allowing this huge subsidized VIA Rail currently being 
subsidized by an amount of $600,000 a day to compete against the 
private sector, the private sector that it in fact asked to take over 
VIA Rail operations? They not only did it, they were good. They 
made it one of the best successful businesses in British Columbia 
and now they want to destroy it.
<P>
	If the hon. member is so worried about the papers, tell the papers 
in Kamloops and through them all the people in Kamloops, why 
this Liberal government wants to destroy 42,000 hotel nights a year 
in Kamloops by letting VIA Rail get back into the very business it 
sold. I would specifically like to hear an answer to the question as 
to why, given his own words-unless he is prepared to go back on 
them-they would even consider allowing VIA to now go into 
competition against the Rocky Mountaineer?
<P>
	Finally, with regard to Pearson, he mentioned $2 billion in 
expenditures at Pearson airport. I have heard that amount too. The 
new head of the GTAA has said: ``We have this great plan. We are 
going to spend $2 billion''. Never mind the $800 million the 
private sector was going to spend without it costing the taxpayer a 
dime. Where is that money coming from? The Pearson contract 
specifically banned the private sector from introducing passenger 
user fees except under exceptional circumstances. Where is the 
money going to come from? Who are they going to stick for the bill 
for rebuilding the terminal now that the private sector which was 
going to do it at no cost to the taxpayer has been kicked out?
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes: </B>Mr. Speaker, I will directly answer the member's 
questions. All the the member's hyperbole notwithstanding, there 
is a right to be protected here, the right of the Canadian taxpayer in 
regard to the Pearson airport deal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> The right to pay more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes</B> The member asked if I own a house. Did I ever sell a 
house or make a contract? Yes, I have bought  a house but I have 
had the opportunity of knowing exactly what I am buying. 
Unfortunately, the Conservative government of the day sold a bill 
of goods in the dying hours of a campaign. It knew it was on its way 
out. The Canadian taxpayers recognized the deal was a sham, 
hatched by the Conservatives, and it was not going to be the right 
deal for the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	However, the government is still on the record as saying it will 
leave every option open to reach a settlement that is satisfactory to 
the Canadian taxpayer, satisfactory to the plaintiffs in this matter, 
completely satisfactory. It means a payment, interestingly enough, 
with which the consortium is not happy.
<P>
	The consortium is not happy with what it received back in 
payments to the tune of approximately $60 million. They are going 
all the way on this thing because they have bills to pay for their 
Conservative lobbyist friends; $600 million as opposed to $30 
million or $40 million. Imagine.
<P>
	There is a member of the House who represents constituents in a 
riding in British Columbia who is saying: ``I agree with those 
fellows. Let us give them $600 million because, gosh, we had a 
contract''. Let us talk about who is to be protected here. The 
Canadian taxpayers that we represent need the protection. The 
Canadian taxpayers have recognized this deal as a sham. This 
government is standing on its own two feet and making sure that 
the taxpayer is protected. It is ensuring that the right of the 
Canadian taxpayer is given paramount consideration in this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> I think we need protection from your government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Do not forget to answer the VIA question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> I know the hon. member opposite is very interested 
in the VIA question. Unfortunately, as is usually the case with the 
opposition, it is only telling half the story.
<P>
	Let us look at the full story. A private sector company called the 
Great Canadian Railtour Company is doing a fantastic job, a 
wonderful job of providing-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Why are you trying to destroy it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Do you want to hear it or do you want to keep 
yelling?
<P>
	That company is doing a wonderful job of providing a tourism 
service. It provides the customer the opportunity to get on a train, 
travel through part of the Rockies, stay overnight in a community, 
have a meal and entertainment and get back on the train in the 
morning and continue on their way to the next location. It is a 
magnificent tourism service, a first class service.
<P>
	VIA wants to run a train from one part of B.C. to another during 
the daylight hours, providing transportation to a group of people 
who live in B.C. who number in the thousands that are saying: ``We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8055"> 8055 </A></B>
<P>
do not  have enough room on this particular train. We need more 
room on another train to get from A to B.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> And lose money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes</B> It is not a luxury service. It is not going to be an 
overnight service. The members over there want to compare apples 
and oranges and cry that it is not fair.
<P>
	We are working with Mr. Peter Armstrong at the Great Canadian 
Railtour Company to try to achieve a goal that will be fair to him 
and at the same time fair to the Canadian taxpayer who pays the 
bills for VIA Rail who has said: ``We will be arm's length from 
you. You are going out there. You are going to do the business 
necessary in order to get a return on the investment of the Canadian 
taxpayers''.
<P>
	VIA's subsidy of $350 million a year is now down to $170 
million yet it is not dropping any services. We telling them to 
become commercial and get competitive. That is exactly what it is 
trying to do. However, if VIA came in and duplicated the service of 
the Great Canadian Railtour Company in B.C., the government 
would not stand for it, I would not stand for it and neither would the 
constituents of British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> I am 
pleased to speak today on this Reform Party motion condemning 
the government for its approach to various federal transportation 
policies. The Reform Party has opted to focus on the partisan 
choices made by the present government. They are entitled to do 
so, and this may be one aspect that is particularly striking.
<P>
	I wish in particular to draw the attention of the House to the 
present government's inefficiency in the area of transportation. At 
the present time, there is a fairly impressive number of examples of 
the federal government's shirking its responsibilities and therefore 
costing Quebec and Canadian taxpayers considerable amounts of 
money.
<P>
	The first example is the Pearson airport. The former government 
decided to privatize the airport, and this one made a campaign 
promise to cancel that privatization. To that end, it tabled a bill 
which the hon. members on this side of the House rejected on the 
grounds that it was inadequate, inconsistent and unrealistic. It was 
even defeated by the Liberal majority in the Senate.
<P>
	The government has had eight months now, since June 1996, to 
find a solution with the promoters of Pearson airport to settle the 
dispute without costing Canadians an arm and a leg.
<P>
	We are still waiting. Will the federal government introduce a 
new bill in an attempt to get out of this mess, which is going to 
cost, who knows, maybe $85 million to $100 million if there is an 
out-of-court settlement? If  there is a decision-the case is 
currently before the courts-the suit is for some $600 million.
<P>
	The federal government is being illogical in defending the 
privatization of Pearson airport, after the Prime Minister himself 
said while campaigning: ``This privatization must be cancelled, 
because there will be outrageous profits, $200 million''.
<P>
	Now the government lawyers are saying in court: ``No, no, the 
profits will not be that high. So they do not deserve any significant 
compensation''. The government needs to get its act Together, face 
its responsibilities, and take a stand.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as far as transportation is concerned, for the past 
three years the government seems to have been on automatic pilot. 
It has deregulated and privatized, but it also stopped doing 
something that was not necessarily undesirable in all sectors. It 
stopped monitoring the effects of these policies.
<P>
	We had an example this fall. In 1996, there was a dramatic 
increase in railway accidents. There was an increase in the number 
of deaths and accidents as a result of safety problems on the 
railway network. We had an aging network on which the lines were 
not always maintained. The government decided to privatize the 
system, which was not necessarily a bad thing. On the other hand, 
the government had no right to look the other way and cease to 
fulfil the mandate it still has, privatization or no privatization, to 
ensure the safety of our railways.
<P>
	The motion presented by the Reform Party today concerns the 
partisan approach of the federal government to its transportation 
policies. However, I think the biggest mistake, the most obvious 
weakness in the government's approach is the fact that it is 
incapable of taking a position, making decisions and acting 
responsibly.
<P>
	I gave the example of Pearson airport. There is worse yet. 
Yesterday, a judgment by a judge of the Quebec Superior Court 
stated that the federal government had failed to act responsibly in 
the matter of changing the roles of Montreal's airports at Dorval 
and Mirabel.
<P>
	Today, we have a situation where everyone is back to square one. 
There are regions whose economies have been hard hit by this 
decision. The judge made the decision on the basis of the case 
before him. For the past six months at least, the Bloc Quebecois has 
suggested two things the minister should do. First, conduct public 
hearings on the question. And second, act responsibly as the lessee 
of the facilities at Mirabel airport and Dorval.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	These recommendations by the Bloc are exactly the same 
recommendations that were made in the judgment by Judge Viau.

<P>
So it is not just an opposition party speaking out. Now we have a 
judge who made a ruling.  The federal government, which has been 
dithering for six months, will now have to pull up its socks and act 
responsibly. This is one more example of the federal government's 
lack of effectiveness in the transportation sector. This department, 
which for years had been huge and very slow to act, is now having 
trouble monitoring the reforms that have been introduced and 
ensuring they will be implemented.
<P>
	A third example is Canadian Airlines International. For many 
years the federal government has been artificially supporting this 
lame duck. According to its vision, we absolutely needed two 
national carriers in Canada. Well, one of them has been on life 
support for a number of years: it was given grants, even a tax 
holiday and compensatory funding. A precedent was set when the 
government intervened in labour relations to allow Canadian to 
survive.
<P>
	This is irresponsible, coming from a government that sees itself 
as an advocate of free competition. When it formulated this 
principle, it should have abided by it and let the companies do the 
same. Air Canada has already done a lot of house cleaning. It had to 
make some very difficult decisions in the past: lay-offs of pilots 
and other staff. Today, it is a profitable company. It operates well 
and is aggressive on international markets. It would be prepared to 
expand if the Canadian government was not paralysing it by 
limiting its international routes.
<P>
	Here we have three examples of federal government 
inefficiency, lack of decision making ability and inflexibility. They 
are Pearson airport, the Montreal airports and Canadian 
international. So we can see how the federal government has 
problems being effective in its transport policy, with examples such 
as these. One tends to wonder about the upcoming reforms.
<P>
	In December 1995, the government tabled a reform of Canadian 
ports policy. In the meantime, it tabled Bill C-44. In December, we 
considered it clause by clause, but we have heard nothing since 
then. The bill has not reappeared in the House, and communities 
are quite anxious about how their port facilities will be returned to 
them.
<P>
	Will there be enough money to return the ports to the 
communities in a reasonable state? Is the current figure of $125 
million sufficient? Will they take into consideration our 
recommendation that commercial ports like Cacouna, in my riding, 
for example, be treated differently from ferry ports like 
Saint-Siméon and Rivière-du-Loup, which is also in my riding?
<P>
	This sort of facility must be treated differently. The 
government's intention to maintain ferry services and port 
facilities, so long as the ferries continue to run, must be absolutely 
clear. We need clarity, because the longer decisions are put off, the 
greater the impact on the decision of business to settle in a region.
<P>
	Eastern Quebec, as you know, was hit very hard by the 
employment insurance reform. So the federal government must 
hasten to establish clear guidelines and make choices in order to let 
people know the conditions under which the port of Cacouna will 
become the property of the port development corporation, so that 
business wishing to set up in our region may do so in full 
knowledge of the facts.
<P>
	When a business makes a choice and says: ``I will set up a plant 
in a given sector'', this is not a short term vision. It is looking 5, 10, 
15 and 20 years down the road. However, we are in a period of very 
rapid choices. Without adequate answers in these matters, 
businesses that may have been considering settling in our region 
could decide to go elsewhere, in New England or some other part of 
the U.S. eastern seaboard, where they will know where they stand.
<P>
	I urge the federal government to take a position in this matter as 
soon as possible.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Another example of the federal government's inefficiency and 
lack of foresight is last year's reform of the line conveyance 
procedures. Up till then, before a line could be closed, public 
hearings had to be held, and if the stakeholders' could find 
sufficient justification, the line was maintained.
<P>
	The legislation introduced by the federal, which it got through 
the House but which we rejected, now allows the companies simply 
to put the line up for sale again. If the company can find a buyer, 
the line is sold. Otherwise, the line is abandoned. But they forgot to 
be specific enough in the legislation.
<P>
	Let me give you a very concrete example. On the 
Matapédia-Chandler-Gaspé line, in the Gaspé, runs the Chaleur, a 
train administered by VIA Rail. The legislation should have 
included a safeguard whereby the government could prevent 
private companies from dismantling their lines without any regard 
for the existing passenger transport networks when there is only 
one operational line, especially during winter, to ensure that this 
only line is maintained.
<P>
	The absence of such a safeguard in the legislation led to the 
current nonsense. CN is selling the portion of the line between 
Matapédia and Chandler. They have a buyer, the Société des 
chemins de fer nationaux du Québec, for that portion because it is 
used not only for passenger transport but also for freight transport. 
There is no buyer, however, for the other line between Chandler 
and Gaspé, which is the continuation, because it is used only by 
VIA.
<P>
	VIA Rail passengers are therefore being held to ransom 
following the company's decision, and the federal government has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8057"> 8057 </A></B>
<P>
absolutely no say in all this. It can only try to see, through a 
feasibility study, how the economic future of that line could be 
ensured. Again, we can see  that the federal government lacks a 
sense of planning in its actions.
<P>
	The government should implement major changes. It should take 
concrete action as soon as possible, especially as regards the 
Railway Act, so as to avoid the sale of railway lines. These lines 
would probably be better managed if they were run by local 
administrations. At the same time, however, we must not create 
situations where railway users, including passengers for whom the 
train is the only mode of transportation, see that mode disappear 
because of the inefficiency of the applicable legislation.
<P>
	This is another example which shows that the representations we 
made were not taken into account by the federal government. In 
this case, as in the others which I mentioned, the government 
displays a blatant inefficiency and it should make appropriate 
changes as quickly as possible, in order to improve the situation.
<P>
	Now that the federal government has gone ahead with 
deregulation, it must watch for the impact of this change in every 
sector. Let me give you an example. The government recently 
established Nav Canada, a corporation that will manage Canada's 
air navigation system. In this area, as with railway accidents, there 
must be an adequate follow-up as regards safety, otherwise in six 
months, a year or two years, we will notice an increase in the 
number of accidents in that sector, and we will only be able to 
deplore some situations when it is too late. I am asking the federal 
government to make sure it will allocate adequate resources for this 
initiative.
<P>
	The Reform Party says it condemns the partisan approach to 
transportation policies. The government will have an opportunity 
over the coming weeks and months to prove that its approach is not 
partisan, when it makes a decision with respect to implementing a 
partnership between the private and public sectors for the purpose 
of upgrading Canada's national highway system.
<P>
	A recommendation has been made by the Standing Committee 
on Transport, which has seen some truly impressive co-operation, 
with the Bloc Quebecois working with the government to ensure 
that, over the coming years, there will be significant investment in 
the national highway system, because it is an essential 
development tool in the context of North American free trade. In 
the future, our highway system must become increasingly efficient.
<P>
	The report suggested pilot projects, and this will be the test of 
whether the government is capable of a non-partisan approach. 
Various areas in Canada have development needs in this regard. 
These needs could be in major urban centres not equipped with the 
necessary road system, but still part of the Trans-Canada. Or they 
could be in areas like my riding, where one of the highways 
running between Rivière-du-Loup and New Brunswick has seen a 
huge increase in traffic over the last 20 years. We are very pleased 
with this increase, because  it contributes to economic activity, but 
today the highway no longer really meets the needs of the traffic 
using it.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The federal government will have to make some choices. The 
committee chairman made representations to the Prime Minister. 
His advice was that the government should go ahead with this huge 
investment, and that this new model of funding a private and public 
partnership should be tried out, allowing the government to shift 
the investment risk to the private sector and thus making it possible 
to start up projects two, three, four or five years earlier.
<P>
	Will the federal government be capable of analyzing proposals 
on the basis of objective needs criteria? Will it see there are safety 
problems, like those on the 185 through Témiscouata in my riding? 
At Saint-Antonin, Saint-Honoré, and Ville Dégelis, accidents occur 
simply because the road, which is part of the Trans-Canada, can no 
longer keep up with increased traffic.
<P>
	I hope the federal government will do something and that a few 
months from now I will be able to say: ``Yes, they did a good job in 
that area. No partisan decisions. Objective decisions that made it 
possible to start the work and thus help regional development.''
<P>
	The federal government must not forget it has a lot to answer for 
in regions with a high percentage of seasonal workers. We were hit 
on the head with employment insurance reform, and this is still 
going on, since we have found this reform systematically penalizes 
seasonal workers.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development seems be 
waking up to this. He is finding ways to change the situation. 
However, what is needed is measures to diversify the economy and 
one of the main tools is management of the transportation sector in 
Canada.
<P>
	For many decades, Quebec realized how penalized it was by the 
fact that it did not control its means of development. Since Quebec 
runs north-south, its development is linked to New England and the 
American markets. For a long time, Quebec was penalized as a 
result of a Canadian decision to promote east-west development.
<P>
	Now that we have opted for free trade, the government's 
decisions should allow for these circumstances and let our regions 
develop their potential. Remember that at the end of the nineteenth 
century, the maritimes were an autonomous region that sold as 
many goods as it purchased and generated enough jobs to support 
its population.
<P>
	However, the policies of the Trudeau years were to create large 
reserves in the regions. The message was: ``We will let the market 
create jobs in the large urban centres and then we will distribute the 
wealth.'' Today, we realize that this does not work because we are  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8058"> 8058 </A></B>
<P>
penalizing the people who work in seasonal industries. We are 
waiting for the federal government to do the right thing and use 
transportation as a tool in this respect.
<P>
	We have every reason to be sceptical. Federal action in the 
transportation sector has not been a success during the past 
decades. There was quite a commotion at one point. A few years 
ago, reforms were introduced, but we must ensure that the 
government-and the opposition will play a watchdog role in this 
respect-really has an integrated policy for the development of 
transportation, whether we are talking about the railways, air 
transportation, shipping or highway transportation. That is not the 
case at the present time.
<P>
	The government is being very ad hoc. It is trying to pacify the 
Pearson developers, but now they will have to manage another 
crisis involving Aéroports de Montréal. And the same applies to 
Canadian. My conclusion is that the federal government should 
drop its piecemeal approach, adopt an integrated transportation 
strategy and avoid partisanship. If it does, this will benefit the 
economies of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Let us hope that today's opposition day will make the 
government aware of its responsibilities and the need to act quickly 
to provide clear guidelines.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to ask for the 
unanimous consent of the House to revert to Statements by 
Members. Before I put that question, it is important to inform the 
House why I am making this request.
<P>
	I note that the Prime Minister will be making a state of the nation 
address at an invitation only luncheon at the Chateau Laurier Hotel 
at noon today. As you are aware, Mr. Speaker-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The hon. member 
said Statements by Members. We have not passed Statements by 
Members. Those come just before question-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Statements by Ministers.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am sorry but he said 
members and I wondered what he was talking about.
<P>
	He is asking for consent to revert to Statements by Ministers. It 
will take some persuading because Statements by Ministers are 
made by ministers, not by members of the opposition. If the 
member wishes to revert to Statements by Ministers, a minister has 
to ask to make the statement.
<P>
	I want him to get to the point very quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, the question has 
often been raised of whether parliamentary privilege imposes on 
ministers an obligation to deliver ministerial statements, to make 
announcements and  communications to the public through the 
House of Commons, or to make those announcements or 
statements in the House rather than outside the Chamber.
<P>
	Unfortunately we as parliamentarians have no such rights. 
Although we have no such right there was a Speaker who on 
February 9, 1982 suggested that it was a matter of personal 
ethics-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. I can see where the 
hon. member is going. The hon. member may be correct in 
suggesting some question of privilege can be raised about 
statements made outside the House, but there has been no 
statement made outside the House that he is complaining of. He is 
talking about something that may happen later this day.
<P>
	His point has been noted, but I do not believe it is a question of 
privilege that the Chair can entertain at this time. There has been no 
breech of the privileges of the House and no question of order. 
Ministers are free to make statements where they want, and I know 
that previous Speakers at various times have made rulings to that 
effect.
<P>
	I caution the hon. member that he seems to be anticipating a 
speech that may be made later somewhere else over which your 
Speaker has no control. The Speaker is not in a position to force 
ministers to come into the House to make statements after the time 
for Statements by Ministers is passed.
<P>
	The hon. member's request is irregular, to say the very least, if 
not out of order. Perhaps he could pursue the matter later after the 
speech in question rather than now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I might be permitted to put the 
question to the House I believe we could bring this matter to a 
conclusion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I would be happy to put 
the question to the House if it were a minister asking for consent. If 
we revert to Statements by Ministers and a minister does not wish 
to make a statement, we have reverted for no purpose. The hon. 
member is not in a strong position to request reversion to 
Statements by Ministers when he is not a minister of the crown. I 
do not propose to put the question to the House unless I get a 
request from a minister. It is only common sense that be the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
Perhaps the request really should come from the people of Canada 
who are being denied the chance to hear from the Prime Minister 
on the state of the nation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member knows 
that the people of Canada had the right, if the Prime Minister had 
chosen to come here this morning on Statements by Ministers to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8059"> 8059 </A></B>
<P>
make a statement, to hear whatever he had to say. It is not for the 
House, particularly the member or any member who is not a  
minister, at this stage to stand and request to revert to Statements 
by Ministers to have a minister who is not asking to make a 
statement then stand and make a statement. It is a voluntary time of 
the day and I think we can dispose of that matter now.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask 
the hon. member a question. He may recall that I was the special 
constitutional adviser to the Premier of Quebec when the decision 
was being made to construct the new Saint-Scholastique-Mirabel 
airport. I would like to ask him a question on his comments 
concerning the Mirabel affair.
<P>
	Does he have any concrete recommendations to make on the 
substantive elements of this matter, or on the transfer of all 
international flights to Dorval and the closure of Mirabel to all but 
vacation charters and cargo flights? Does he want international 
flights kept at Mirabel, and does he therefore want two 
international airports for Montreal?
<P>
	It is commonly felt that the commercial decline of Montreal is 
the result of the development of Mirabel and the lack of attraction 
for international air carriers to direct their flights there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member referred to the job he 
had when the airport was established at Mirabel. You know that, in 
Quebec, the memory of the airport's creation is rather sad, not 
because it was not a good idea to set up an airport, but rather 
because of the way it was done-by expropriating the people living 
in the area.
<P>
	This period has caused those now between 40 and 50 in the 
sovereignist movement to say there is one government too many in 
Canada. This is a flagrant example of the situation.
<P>
	Do we have a position on this? We have had one for a number of 
months, and it is to tell the federal government that here is an 
organization deciding to transfer Mirabel flights to Dorval without 
public hearings on the matter and without the government taking 
any responsibility as tenant in the contract between itself and 
Aéroports de Montreal.
<P>
	We made these two positions known several months ago. We 
ended up as the Bloc feared. We said that, if no public hearings 
were held, the government would end up in a terrible legal mess. 
We may even be just at the start of the legal mess. In the decision 
before us the judge cites the same arguments as the Bloc, that is, 
that public hearings should have been held and that the federal 
government should assume its responsibilities as the tenant of the 
Mirabel facilities.
<P>
	Our position is that, from the outset, before the need for 
transferring flights from Mirabel to Dorval was even considered, 
before any decision was made in this matter, given the major 
economic consequences involved, there should have been public 
hearings. That is what the judge said. He also said that, under the 
current lease between the government and Aéroports de Montréal, 
the government has responsibilities. Just yesterday, in spite of the 
court ruling and perhaps because he did not have the time to take a 
close enough look at it, the minister maintained that the federal 
government had no responsibility in the matter.
<P>
	If he keeps stubbornly maintaining this position and taking a 
shortsighted view to managing, the minister will hamper the 
overall development of the greater Montreal area, including the 
Mirabel area. The people of Mirabel can rejoice over the 
yesterday's ruling, because it allows them to keep their airport 
longer. Choices have to be made, and I think they were justified in 
reacting the way they did, but on the whole of the issue, we are 
faced with a situation where the decision may well be deferred.
<P>
	We know how important it is these days to be able to speed up 
the decision making process. Looking at all this, sometimes I get 
the feeling that this is somewhat machiavellian on the part of the 
federal government. By not taking its responsibilities, it puts 
Quebec at a competitive disadvantage, compared to Toronto. Is this 
a deliberate choice made by the federal government? These are 
some of the issues that would be raised if public hearings were 
held.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	In any case, as long as the federal government does not indicate 
its intention to follow up on the ruling handed down by Mr. Justice 
Viau, we have no idea of what it will do, but we are certainly 
anxious to find out.
<P>
	Will the government accept the ruling? How will it deal with this 
crisis? As things stand, everyone in Quebec is a loser: the people in 
Mirabel, Dorval and Montreal, the region's economic stakeholders, 
and those in the tourism industry. All these people are victims of 
the inertia of the federal government, which, like Pontius Pilate, 
simply washed its hands of the matter, and now we have to live 
with the consequences. It is imperative that the federal government 
react quickly and take its responsibilities, so we can get out of this 
mess, which is the worst possible situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask my colleague, who spoke about the federal government's 
many failings with respect to transportation policy, to talk about 
something he perhaps forgot, but since my colleague represents a 
region, I would like him to talk about the federal government's 
uniform policy of requiring regions to prove that they have a large 
enough clientele to support their airport, to maintain railway lines, 
when, in the regions, the means of transportation are related to 
regional development. So, if  we do not have a uniform Canada--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8060"> 8060 </A></B>
<P>
because Canada is not uniform; there is an urban Canada and a 
regional Canada-the government's transportation policy should 
reflect this situation and provide the regions with the means to 
develop.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that many Quebec 
municipalities are now trying to obtain the facilities they need to 
take over their airports, and the Bloc Quebecois supports them.
<P>
	Take, for example, the creation of Nav Canada, the agency 
responsible for managing air traffic control. We tried, by proposing 
several amendments to the bill, to put the onus on the government 
to ensure that the facilities in these airports will allow them to be 
competitive, and that the decision will not be made only on the 
basis of the market. These amendments were systematically 
rejected by the federal government.
<P>
	So the member is right to worry about this, and I think that 
people in the regions concerned must be very sensitive to these 
positions, continue their representations, get in touch with 
members of Nav Canada's boards of directors at the federal level, 
keep an ear out and call on their MPs so that they will speak out 
publicly about what is unacceptable, because airports are in fact 
one of the major tools of development. All transportation 
infrastructures are important, including airports. It is essential that 
our regions have the tools they need for development, particularly 
in a country as vast as ours.
<P>
	All this is based on the assumption that the government is 
committed to developing Canada's regions, something we have 
never heard it say. For now, the government has simply said it will 
move people to where the jobs are. This creates major economic 
problem, forcing families that have been settled in regions for 
many years to make very difficult choices, when there is no future 
for these choices, for this approach.
<P>
	If we hope to see detailed and concrete action concerning 
regional airports, there will have to be a commitment from the 
federal government to ensure the development of these regions. We 
have never been able to get a clear indication from the government 
in this regard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to assure and remind the 
member and his constituents who are watching today that the 
Mirabel and Dorval airports were transferred to the ADM. The 
reason they were transferred to the ADM was to respond to those 
local initiatives and to ensure that each one of those airports is 
managed and developed in terms of the local needs.
<P>
	It was the ADM that came forward and said: ``In the best 
interests of the Mirabel-Dorval-Montreal area, this is the proposal 
we feel will best meet the needs of the  public who are using the 
airlines, the airlines themselves and the division''.
<P>
	I just wanted to assure the hon. member that Transport Canada is 
doing a thorough examination of the court decision that was just 
rendered yesterday.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I shall be brief. I would just like to 
remind the hon. member that representations have been made to the 
transport committee. Some months ago, I wrote to the chairman of 
the transport committee and to the transport minister to state that 
public hearings must be held on the matter of the Montreal airports, 
Dorval and Mirabel. The parliamentary committee must hear the 
stakeholders. No positive response has ever been forthcoming. The 
legal mess we are stuck with now is the government's 
responsibility, 150 per cent. Now there is a problem, and the 
economic development of Montreal is at risk because the federal 
government has not assumed its responsibilities in this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing 
my time with my colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	In listening to the interventions thus far today, I am struck by the 
fact that we have a very clear example of the political debate that is 
taking place in Canada today. I think it is the debate that the 
upcoming election should largely be fought on, which is the 
competing visions of the political parties in Canada for what 
government should be in Canadians' daily lives.
<P>
	One of the best descriptions I have seen of this, although it 
involves an American writer and a description of the American 
political system, is by P. J. O'Rourke. He observed once in trying to 
encapsulate the difference between the Democrats and the 
Republicans, that the Democrats were the party that said 
government can make you straighter, smarter and taller and take 
the chickweed out of your lawn, and the Republicans were the party 
that argued that government does not work and they keep on getting 
elected and they keep on proving it.
<P>
	The argument is: How big should government be? What can 
government do and what can people do for themselves?
<P>
	It strikes me that the Liberals are captivated by a vision, a vision 
which American writer Thomas Sowell describes as the vision of 
the anointed. Convinced of their own moral superiority, they 
insulate themselves from the lessons of history. They insulate 
themselves from reality and they go on with program after 
program, expenditure initiative after expenditure initiative. They 
never seek to determine the results of these expenditures. They 
never seek to determine the results of the policies that they have put 
in place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8061"> 8061 </A></B>
<P>
	The result is we now have a $600 billion debt in this country. 
We are in jeopardy of being able to deliver the social services that 
Canadians want and need the most, those being health and 
education primarily, and old age security. We are in jeopardy of 
being able to deliver these services because the federal 
government has been following this vast array of public spending 
programs over the last few years.
<P>
	The vision the Liberals have is based primarily on the premise 
that government is good, that big government is better and if only 
well intentioned, well meaning and intelligent people could get 
their hands on the levers of power-of course they mean 
themselves when they say this-that everything would be just fine. 
They can devise a program and a government policy to solve all the 
problems Canadians have. They are the anointed, they are the ones 
that have the vision of how this can be done and if only they could 
get into power and stay in power they could solve all of Canada's 
problems for Canadians.
<P>
	I think it was ``This Hour Has 22 Minutes'' that reminded all of 
us over the Christmas break there was no session here for 51 days 
and guess what? The country just went running right along as usual.
<P>
	The Tories and the NDP, while they are different political parties, 
represent substantially the same vision. They share largely the 
same ideas although in a different form as the Liberals do. Of 
course the Liberals more than being anointed with this vision have 
also come to believe-I guess history is on their side to some 
extent-that they are the natural governing party of Canada. The 
Liberals believe that they have every right and indeed a 
responsibility to be here for Canadians and to keep on governing 
the country.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	The problem they have with the Pearson airport deal is not that 
there may be a $600 million expenditure coming out of the wallets 
of taxpayers. The fact is that the Liberals have objected strenuously 
to the deal because they did not negotiate the deal with their 
friends.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Hamilton West who earlier talked about 
the $600 million expenditure was so concerned about political 
parties rewarding their friends and insiders, why does he not stand 
on his feet and object to the $1.2 billion, or twice the amount of 
money he is talking about, the government has given to 
Bombardier over the last 15 years? How can he talk about what the 
Conservative Party has done without recognizing what his party 
has done?
<P>
	I invite the member to read ``Above the Law'', a book about Rod 
Stamler. I invite the member to acquaint himself with the history of 
dredging contracts on the St. Lawrence seaway when his party was 
in power. I invite him to look at the history of how concession 
contracts were handed out at airports across Canada. I invite him to 
look at his own party and at the way contracts were  handed out for 
the last 35 or 40 years when the Liberals were in power.
<P>
	This is hypocrisy. He cannot be against what the Conservatives 
did without looking at what his party has done.
<P>
	Do we agree that what the Conservatives did was right? No. I 
cannot agree that the dying days of a Parliament, the dying days of 
an administration, is an appropriate time for a government to enter 
into negotiations of the magnitude of the Pearson airport deal.
<P>
	There is a longstanding tradition in the country that successive 
governments honour the agreements put in place by preceding 
governments. If they choose because they believe it is in the public 
interest to abrogate the agreements, they ought never to pass 
legislation preventing those who either were or believed they were 
harmed as a result of the action from going to court to seek proper 
retribution through the court system. That is exactly what the 
government tried to do. That is exactly what was on its mind.
<P>
	If someone does something which is harmful one has every right 
as a Canadian citizen to seek redress through the courts. It is 
arrogance in the extreme for any government to attempt to pass 
legislation which would prevent people from going to court to seek 
a judicial solution to the problems they face.
<P>
	It is not for politicians to determine the harm suffered as a result 
of the abrogation of that contract. It is for the courts to decide. If 
the government has acted appropriately I am sure the courts will 
take that into consideration.
<P>
	VIA Rail is another example of the Liberal government's vision 
of the anointed, its vision that VIA Rail should be the one to run 
passenger rail service in Canada. This is an example of a private 
company which actually bought the assets from the federal 
government going into business, running a railway and doing very 
well at it. The federal government is now saying: ``Maybe we are 
missing something. Maybe we should get back into this business''. 
The government wants to use taxpayers' money to compete with 
the people who are successfully running a business.
<P>
	This business is paying taxes because it is successful. All the 
people employed by the business are paying taxes. Their tax dollars 
will be used to subsidize the federal government getting into 
competition with them. I ask Canadians if that is fair. Is that 
reasonable? Is that just? I think not. It is a manifestation of the 
vision of the anointed.
<P>
	The Prince Rupert grain terminals are important to the people of 
Prince Rupert in my riding. It is very much a transportation issue 
precipitated by the actions of this and other governments.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8062"> 8062 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	The port of Prince Rupert has a very modern grain terminal, one 
of the most modern and efficient grain terminals in the world. If a 
ship comes in to pick up grain in Vancouver it may have to be 
berthed two, three or even four times to take on its full load. If it 
comes into Prince Rupert it has to be berthed only once. There is a 
cost associated with berthing, every time a ship has to be moved in 
a harbour.
<P>
	Prince Rupert is about 400 miles closer to most Pacific rim 
markets than to the port of Vancouver. It therefore represents an 
efficiency in terms of getting grain to market. Prince Rupert has 
one of the fastest turnaround times for grain cars of any grain 
terminal in Canada.
<P>
	Because of the way the movement of grain is structured in the 
country and because of government intervention over a long period 
of time, the port of Prince Rupert cannot take advantage of the 
efficiencies it offers to shippers.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board, for example, does not sell grain 
f.o.b. the country where it is to be delivered. It sells grain f.o.b. 
port. There is no incentive for shippers to turn grain cars around 
quickly because there is no financial penalty or incentive attached 
to the use of grain cars.
<P>
	This is an example of how government intervention at this point 
is preventing the port of Prince Rupert from realizing its potential.
<P>
	I will close by saying that I really hope the next election is 
fought on the issues. I really hope we as politicians can take our 
competing visions before the Canadian people and let them make a 
decision. Should it be big government or small government? Is it 
better for them to make decisions on how their money is spent, or is 
it better to have the money sent to Ottawa to allow Ottawa to 
determine how the money is best spent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and his party are 
creating, in my humble opinion, unnecessary debate. The hon. 
member speaks highly political discourse that is quite frankly 
lacking in fact.
<P>
	We are dealing with the transportation sector. The member 
speaks of spending, smaller government and government initiative. 
I remind the hon. member that this government inherited a $42 
billion deficit in 1993. This government took that $42 billion 
deficit and in three years time turned it into a $19 billion deficit.
<P>
	How was that accomplished? This government did it department 
by department, minister by minister. This government is talking 
about the issue of the day, the Department of Transport. In 
transportation the Minister of Transport and the Department of 
Transport have made an enormous contribution to that bottom line.
<P>
	The member talks about smaller government. We have moved 
from 43 cabinet ministers in 1992 in the Mulroney era, down to 22 
cabinet ministers. We reduced the deficit.
<P>
	Because of the policies of the Department of Transport and the 
two ministers of transport, we have been able to privatize CN Rail 
and put it on a level play field with the CP rail systems. We have 
been able to take the air navigation system and put into not for 
profit hands called Nav Canada. That is a saving in those two area, 
CN and Nav Canada, of billions of dollars for the Canadian 
taxpayer. We acknowledge that reductions in government and 
reductions in subsidy have to occur, but it is a step by step process.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> It is a fair process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> The hon. member for 
Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe has put it exactly right. It 
is a fair system. It is a responsible way to reduce the deficit, to 
remove the burden on the taxpayer's back and put it on entities like 
CN or Nav Canada. This government is doing what it can in a fair 
and responsible way.
<P>
	Would the hon. member acknowledge we can do it the way Mike 
Harris, the premier of Ontario, has? We could use the Conservative 
slash, gash and gouge method of reducing the deficit, putting 
hospital care up against the wall, and putting education at risk in 
the province of Ontario. I wish he would acknowledge that we are 
reducing the deficit in a responsible, fair and progressive manner. 
Could he acknowledge that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was a little amused to hear 
the questions and comments of my friend across the way.
<P>
	First, the reduction in the deficit achieved by the government has 
been achieved largely on the backs of taxpayers by increasing 
revenues and furthermore by downloading on the provinces and 
municipalities across the country. That is how these people across 
the way balance their books. They do not cut their own spending.
<P>
	Let me give an example. These people over there are totally 
enraptured by this vision of big government. If Bombardier wanted 
my money it could come and knock on my door. It could send me a 
solicitation in the mail. It could say: ``Please, Mr. Scott, send a 
cheque, give us a donation, lend us some money because we want 
to expand our production facilities in Canada''. The House 
probably has a pretty good idea what I would tell Bombardier if it 
asked me for money.
<P>
	The hon. member may think it is funny, but these people do not 
need to ask me. They come to Ottawa and they get permission to 
steal my money. That is exactly what is going on. This is taxpayers' 
money that should be held in trust for the benefit of the taxpayers 
of Canada. It  is siphoned off and given to the cronies, the friends 
and the insiders of this government. That is what is wrong with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8063"> 8063 </A></B>
<P>
vision of the anointed. It leads to cronyism. It leads to insider 
manipulation of the system. It leads to abuse.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada stands four square against this kind 
of action. It stands four square in favour of smaller government, a 
government focused in the areas where it can be effective, and of 
getting out of areas like trying to open up a new rail service to 
compete against private enterprise in British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak to the Reform supply day 
motion which condemns the government for, among other things, 
costly inefficiencies in the grain transportation system.
<P>
	I heard the parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture 
say that the motion was laughable. The Liberal response to it was to 
laugh. Farmers across the prairies are not laughing about the 
situation they are in. They are certainly not laughing about the 
transportation mess affecting the prairies in moving their grain to 
port position. They are certainly not laughing at Reform's motion 
in the House on their behalf. They are appalled at Liberal arrogance 
and lack of action.
<P>
	They should not be surprised. The Liberals have failed to deliver 
on three-quarters of their promises related to agriculture, about 
which I have spoken in the House on past occasions.
<P>
	I will explain the situation to the House because a lot of 
members in this part of the country may not realize how serious it 
is. Currently there are 46 ships-that is a lot of grain 
boats-waiting in English Bay. An article in the <I>Western Producer</I> 
this week compares English Bay to the world's largest parking lot 
for boats. There are 46 of them sitting there waiting to take on grain 
cargo. Demurrage is being paid at approximately $10,000 a day per 
ship. It means farmers are paying close to half a million dollars a 
day because of the inefficiencies in our grain transportation system.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Lorne Hehn, the chief commissioner of the Canadian Wheat 
Board estimates that farmers are out $65 million so far because 
their grain cannot get to west coast ports. He mentioned that 
number some days ago. I am sure the number is increasing and I 
would not be surprised if the next estimate is closer to $100 
million.
<P>
	West coast shipments are at their lowest level in a decade. World 
trade is increasing. We are approaching the next millennium and 
the transportation of grain is the lowest it has been in 10 years. This 
is unprecedented, it is unacceptable, it is indefensible and it is 
unforgivable. One of the results is that Japan's food agency has 
stated publicly that it is closely watching the situation. Clearly our 
reputation is at stake.
<P>
	Farmers are very upset. I have received a letter from southern 
Manitoba which says that Canadian Pacific Railway officials have 
advised grain elevator operators along the southern 
line-Winnipeg, Borden, Deloraine-there will be no more trains 
until spring. As far as can be determined, they are blaming the 
snow. With the snow removal equipment available today, that is a 
lot of hogwash. All farmers along the line will now be second class 
citizens.
<P>
	I called my own delivery point in Saskatchewan. There has not 
been a train for three weeks as of tomorrow and they do not expect 
another train to come into that delivery point for another three 
weeks. Usually if they say three weeks, it ends up to be five or six 
or seven or eight weeks. Basically they are saying: ``No more 
movement of grain in that area until the spring''.
<P>
	This is not academic for thousands of Canadians. This is their 
livelihood. This is what puts groceries on the table. This is what 
makes mortgage payments. This is serious stuff we are talking 
about.
<P>
	The Liberal member says that this motion is laughable. I am 
appalled at the arrogance of the Liberals who would suggest that 
our concern about a major industry which is suffering because of 
transportation inefficiencies, is a laughable motion. This is chronic. 
It keeps occurring. One year it is a labour shortage. Another year it 
is a shortage of hopper cars. This year it is weather related and lack 
of locomotive power.
<P>
	There is never any accountability. All we have is finger pointing. 
The person who is the least responsible for the mess of course, is 
the farmer. If the farmers fail to deliver their grain or fail to meet 
their contracts, the farmer should pay the demurrage on the ships 
waiting in English Bay.
<P>
	The farmers are crying to get their product moved to export 
positions. They are happy to move their product. They are happy to 
abide by the contracts they have signed, unlike the Liberal 
government, as we have heard earlier. As a result, farmers are 
losing millions and millions of dollars in lost sales and demurrage. 
They were counting on having this as income to prepare for the 
upcoming season.
<P>
	Our system is full of costly inefficiencies. They suppress any 
incentive for companies to make new infrastructure investments 
such as new terminals or elevators. There are not proper incentives 
or penalties to our rail system to move grain efficiently and quickly 
to the port position. This affects our ability to compete with our 
largest trading partners in the United States and drives business out 
of Canada.
<P>
	The Liberals have failed to create an efficient and responsive 
grain transportation system that responds to the needs of farmers. 
We have terrible rail service. We have awkward, antiquated 
terminal facilities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8064"> 8064 </A></B>
<P>
	Many of the boats have to berth several times to take on one 
shipment of cargo because our terminals, particularly at 
Vancouver, are not designed to load one ship at one time with the 
amount of grain that it is prepared to take on. We have the wrong 
grain at the wrong place at the wrong time.
<P>
	What did the Liberal government do? It killed the Crow. As I 
mentioned at the time, that was easy to do. All someone has to do is 
remove the money from the budget. The Liberals did that but it was 
irresponsible to take away the Crow and not take away the 
transportation inefficiencies at the same time. The Liberal 
government had a chance to do that and it blew it. How did the 
Liberals have a chance? Initially they introduced Bill C-101 which 
became Bill C-14, with changes to the Canadian Transportation 
Act. Just about every representation we had from the prairies said 
that this bill would not improve the transportation system. It did 
not fix the inefficiencies and the costly mode of transportation we 
have in western Canada to move grain to port.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	They implemented the CAPG, the Car Allocation Policy Group. 
It is really not much change from what we had before. They were 
not able to fix the problem before and the Liberal government 
certainly did not provide the tools and put the machinery in place to 
properly allocate cars to move grain efficiently.
<P>
	We talked about final offer arbitration labour legislation many 
times and the Liberal government rejected the suggestion. 
Therefore, it is not for lack of constructive alternatives to the 
existing transportation system and it is not for lack of suggestions 
on how to improve the grain transportation system. It is a lack of 
willingness on the part of this Liberal government to effectively do 
something to fix the problem. All it has done to this point is offload 
the total cost on to the producer.
<P>
	We understand the minister is holding meetings in Calgary later 
today. He is successful at arranging meetings. He has been 
arranging meetings ever since he became the minister of 
agriculture. He has round tables here and discussions there, but he 
does not do anything. I think I got his dandruff up a little bit the 
other day. I called him a third rate lawyer. We are very frustrated on 
the prairies because he is not doing anything but talking. He is not 
taking any action and not showing effective leadership.
<P>
	In fact, on ``Newsworld'' this morning he said: ``Let's not blame 
anybody. Let's talk about this but let's not blame anybody''. I know 
why the minister did not want to blame anybody. It is because most 
of the blame falls on his shoulders and on the shoulders of his 
government. He did not want to have to point the finger at himself. 
That is irresponsible and shows a lack of leadership.
<P>
	Farmers across the prairies are appalled that the government has 
been in place for three years and has refused to take responsible 
action to improve one of the worst grain transportation systems in 
the modern world.
<P>
	It is not that the minister cannot act quickly, if he has the will. 
When there was a loophole in the grain marketing legislation 
regarding customs and moving grain across the border, within 
minutes he changed that through an order in council. The speed was 
astonishing. He must have had the bureaucrats turning cartwheels 
to accomplish it so quickly. Actually I think he had it prepared 
ahead of time. He thought he was going to lose the court case so he 
had all of his cards lined up and, bang, just like that, he had made 
the changes.
<P>
	When it comes to making changes in the regulations to the 
Canadian Wheat Board, changes to the transportation system, 
changes to car allocation, the sale of the hopper cars which has 
gone nowhere, to allowing and defending our producers who want 
to sell their products into the United States-he allowed the 
Americans to put a quota on durum sales-the minister has done 
nothing positive or constructive. The chickens are coming home to 
roost. He is to blame but he refuses to accept that blame. That is 
irresponsible and unbefitting a Canadian minister of agriculture.
<P>
	There should be incentives and penalties in the transportation 
system. If somebody does a good job there should be rewards. They 
should make a profit in doing what they are doing. However, if they 
fall short and if the railways do not have enough-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member speaks of this 
government and, in particular, the hon. minister of agriculture, as if 
to say that it is all the minister of agriculture's fault that this thing 
is coming down.
<P>
	Again the Reform Party focuses on rhetoric instead of the facts. 
The fact is that CN and CP are now private corporations. The fact is 
that winter has been very severe in western Canada and has affected 
the rails. He ignores those facts.
<P>
	To quote the hon. minister of agriculture: ``The government is 
interested in solutions''. The member for the Reform Party has the 
opportunity to give us some ideas on how we can make this 
situation better.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	He comes from the west. He knows how important it is to them. 
Instead he gets into political rancour and debate. We need solutions 
today. That is what the minister of agriculture is looking for. He is 
out there. He has been speaking directly with the players in the 
industry, in grain shipping and the rail sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8065"> 8065 </A></B>
<P>
	He is trying to co-ordinate the three areas so a solution can be 
reached, not to lay blame, not to find out who was right or who 
was wrong or who was insufficient and who was careless. That 
does not accomplish anything. Let us get on with the solutions.
<P>
	Could he stand today and give us some ideas on solutions to try 
to solve this problem, not the usual political rhetoric.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think the member was in 
the House listening when I gave my speech. I did mention some 
constructive alternatives that Reform had presented-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary on a 
point of order. This will not come out of the hon. member's time in 
reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was a little disappointed that the 
Speaker did not rise on that intervention only because the hon. 
member pointed out I was not in the House at the time of his 
remarks. I was behind this curtain communicating with my 
colleagues. There are television sets back there. I am well aware of 
every remark this hon. member made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member was 
listening, he would have known what I said. His response made it 
seem as if he was not in the House. I did not say he was not in the 
House. This shows how sensitive he is on this issue.
<P>
	If he were listening, wherever he was, whether he was in his 
chair or hiding behind the curtain, the suggestions Reform has 
made have been very articulate-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This again will not come out of the hon. 
member's time in reply. The hon. parliamentary secretary, I hope it 
is not on the same point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> No, Mr. Speaker. The hon. member said that I was 
hiding behind the curtain. I want to correct the record. I was not 
hiding behind a curtain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> While the hon. member was standing in plain 
view behind the curtain, I was making some clear comments about 
Reform's constructive alternatives to the transportation mess.
<P>
	I suggest to the member that he knows, because he sits on the 
transportation committee, that CN and CP are regulated by federal 
legislation. He is saying that government has no control over 
private companies but he knows that is wrong. He knows it is 
incorrect because recently Bill C-14 that his government 
introduced was passed which made changes to the transportation 
system.
<P>
	There were suggestions for amendments. Prairie pools came 
forward with suggested amendments. The Western Grain Elevator 
Association came forward with amendments. Every grain company 
and farm group  suggested the legislation would not solve the 
transportation problems. Reform pointed out that there was no 
reward for efficiencies in that legislation, and no penalties for 
inefficiencies. The Liberals turned a deaf ear to those suggestions.
<P>
	We came forward with specific changes to labour legislation that 
would provide for final offer arbitration to settle disputes that 
affect grain handling at west coast ports. That was an inquiry they 
set up. We presented a brief to that committee with specific 
recommendations. He has not even read it. He does not know we 
have made those recommendations.
<P>
	We have suggested marketing alternatives, other ways of 
marketing prairie grain, besides single desk selling through the 
Canadian Wheat Board, that would improve prairie marketing of 
grain on the west coast, give farmers new opportunities to move 
their grain and initiate more competition in our grain handling 
system.
<P>
	We have made those recommendations and they have fallen on 
deaf ears. The member has not even heard what we have been 
saying. He has a lot of nerve to get up in this House and say that we 
have not come forward with constructive alternatives. He is wrong 
and I wish he would apologize and admit that he has not been 
listening.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an 
opportunity to take part in this discussion. Although I must say 
after listening over the last number of moments to the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster that once again we have been subjected 
to that Reform Party diatribe which is typically negative, typically 
partisan and typically superficial.
<P>
	In my few minutes I will focus mostly on that element in the 
opposition motion that refers to grain transportation. Before doing 
that I would like to mention briefly the issue of highways and roads 
which is also mentioned in this motion. I will do so in the specific 
context of my own province of Saskatchewan.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	By way of introduction it must be noted and underscored that the 
sponsors of this motion in the Reform Party are absolute masters of 
inconsistency. They are on all sides of every issue all the time. 
They are going to do themselves some very serious physical harm 
if they continue to try to engage in those kinds of gymnastics.
<P>
	On the one hand they want to bring the federal deficit down to 
zero overnight. On the other hand whenever they hear or perceive a 
squeaky wheel that might be of partisan advantage to them, they 
want to spend more.
<P>
	On the one hand they demand complete provincial autonomy in 
areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction under our Constitution. 
On the other hand they want the federal government to get more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8066"> 8066 </A></B>
<P>
involved in things like  roads and highways which are entirely a 
provincial responsibility.
<P>
	On the one hand they want more deregulation in the field of 
transportation, less government involvement. On the other hand 
they want direct government action to sort things out when the 
magic wand of the private sector fails to deliver the desired results.
<P>
	In typically inconsistent Reform Party fashion, its members fling 
themselves upon their horse and ride off madly in all directions at 
once. To a certain extent this explains the rather severe credibility 
problem which so afflicts the Reform Party in western Canada 
these days. They want to be on all sides of all the issues all the time 
and as a result they are just not believable.
<P>
	Let me turn now to the point about Saskatchewan's roads and 
highways. The legal and constitutional responsibility here is very 
clear. This is an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is equally clear in Saskatchewan that no provincial 
government in the past 25 years, not the Blakeney government, not 
the Devine government, not the Romanow government, none of 
them has paid any serious attention to the province's road system. 
Year after year they have quite literally run it into the ground. One 
has to stretch back to the Liberal administration of Ross Thatcher 
in the 1960s to find a Saskatchewan government that put a priority 
upon transportation. It is no wonder that the province's roads and 
highways are in bad condition today.
<P>
	Recently there has been a little bit of improvement but let us 
trace the source of that improvement. Where did it come from? We 
have seen for example rehabilitation and upgrading work 
undertaken on highways numbers 1, 7, 11, 16 and 39 in 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	How was that work done? Through the strategic highway 
improvement program of the Government of Canada. For 
Saskatchewan this involves a federal investment of $35 million 
over a five-year period. The province is supposed to match these 
federal dollars for a total of $70 million invested between 1993 and 
1998. Without federal incentives, this work would not get done. 
Reform Party members either ignore this fact or they just have not 
done their homework.
<P>
	Further, there is the Canada infrastructure works program which 
we introduced in 1994. In Saskatchewan we set aside $10 million 
for municipalities for rural roads. The municipalities themselves 
contributed a further $20 million for a total of $30 million 
altogether. As a result miles and miles of this vital rural 
infrastructure have been built or rebuilt across the length and 
breadth of Saskatchewan in the last couple of years. The province 
incidentally contributed nothing to this aspect of the Canada 
infrastructure works program. It was entirely a co-operative 
venture between the Government of Canada and the municipalities.
<P>
	Most recently in our province we have established the Canada 
agri infrastructure program as part of the adjustment funding after 
the termination of subsidized freight rates. Saskatchewan's share of 
this prairie-wide program is approximately $85 million. Twenty 
million dollars was invested in 1996. Twenty-one million dollars is 
being invested in 1997. A further $44 million is coming over the 
next two years. It is all going into Saskatchewan's roads and 
highways and it is 100 per cent from the Government of Canada. 
The Reform Party again either does not know about it or simply 
chooses to ignore the facts.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Let me now turn to grain. Over the past three years we have 
moved on several fronts to deal with some of the historic 
inefficiencies in the Canadian grain handling and transportation 
system. For example we have eliminated that old Thunder Bay 
scenic route grain back haul situation which for many years 
actually subsidized the movement of prairie grain several hundred 
miles in the wrong direction. That anomaly is now gone.
<P>
	We have provided for the orderly discontinuance of some 
extremely high cost and low volume railway branchlines. That is a 
controversial subject on the prairies, but detailed analysis has 
shown that even after taking trucking costs and elevation costs into 
account, the system overall is cheaper for all of those concerned if 
those particular lines are terminated.
<P>
	We have encouraged the conversion of certain appropriate 
branchlines to shortline rail operations which can in fact function 
more efficiently than if they were to remain a part of the more 
expensive mainline system.
<P>
	We have provided in legislation for the equitable sharing of cost 
savings in our grain transportation system among the railways, the 
grain companies and the farmers. As greater efficiencies are 
achieved, as costs are actually saved, then the benefit accrues to all 
of the parties and not just to the bottom lines of the railways. The 
farmers and grain companies will also participate in those earned 
benefits.
<P>
	We have in fact, quite in contrast to the extreme rhetoric of the 
Reform Party, introduced legislation to help avoid work stoppages 
in port operations to keep grain moving, even while labour 
management disputes are being negotiated.
<P>
	I am pleased to tell the House that I have received dozens and 
dozens of letters from farmers and farm organizations across 
western Canada applauding this very forward looking legislation 
introduced by my colleague, the Minister of Labour, in his 
amendments to part I of the Canada Labour Code. I certainly hope 
that members of all parties in the House will support those 
amendments when they come forward for debate in the days 
immediately ahead because farmers are supportive of what is in the 
package.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8067"> 8067 </A></B>
<P>
	We have fostered the creation of a grain car allocation policy 
group representing the grain companies, the railways, the 
Canadian Wheat Board and farmers, to set policy principles for 
how railway rolling stock is to be distributed in the service of grain 
across western Canada. In fact, again in contrast to the inflated 
rhetoric of the Reform Party, the CAPG has been functioning quite 
well over the course of the last number of months. The parties 
who are participating in the car allocation policy group believe 
it is performing the function it was intended to do.
<P>
	All of these measures will help to improve overall efficiency and 
avoid unnecessary costs in our grain handling and transportation 
system. But still, serious problems can and do occur.
<P>
	The last time we confronted a major backlog in the grain 
transportation system was following the winter of 1993-94. By 
early spring the congestion was serious. There were many reasons 
behind the problem that occurred at that time. There was in the fall 
of 1993 a very complex harvest on the prairies. It had generated a 
heavy and complicated mixture of different grain volumes and 
different crop volumes that had to be shipped in what turned out to 
be a very complex logistical situation.
<P>
	Rolling stock at that time was in particular short supply. Hopper 
cars that we would usually lease from the United States were 
unavailable for the Canadian market due to local demands that 
existed south of the border. There were weather disruptions. There 
were labour disruptions. There was a general lack of co-ordination 
in a lot of places throughout the grain handling and transportation 
system in the winter of 1993-94 and the spring of 1994.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	To come to grips with the problem, being interested in solutions, 
not just rhetoric but solutions, we summoned all of the players 
together on May 16, 1994: the railways, the grain companies, the 
Canadian Wheat Board, the Canadian Grain Commission, the port 
operators, the unions, farm organizations and others. We came 
together to find better ways of getting the grain moving again. In 
fact after that conversation in a serious and conscientious way with 
everyone really putting their shoulder to the wheel to find answers, 
within three weeks the whole system had visibly and tangibly 
improved. By the end of that particular shipping season we had 
more than caught up. We were actually ahead of the game.
<P>
	For two years after that meeting on May 16, 1994, the flow of 
grain through the system moved pretty smoothly, until we got into 
the winter of 1996-97. Once again we are confronted with a serious 
problem. The source of that difficulty this time appears to be 
twofold and it is somewhat different from the problem that we 
faced in 1994.
<P>
	It is clear that we have been facing one of the most severe winter 
weather seasons in a long time, certainly in more than a decade. As 
it turns out the snowfall in certain parts of the Rockies where the 
grain must be moved has been heavier than has ever been recorded 
before in history. Everyone knows the kind of temperature 
conditions we have been dealing with in western Canada over the 
course of the last two to three months. We have faced and the 
railways have faced some extraordinary weather circumstances.
<P>
	As I have said on other occasions both in this House and outside, 
one has to anticipate that we could have severe weather in Canada 
in the winter. We could anticipate heavy snow and low 
temperatures during the month of January but we do have to 
acknowledge that this January was a particularly tough one. 
Nevertheless that is not an adequate explanation of the situation.
<P>
	There is another complicating factor. That appears to be the lack 
of locomotive power in the system, particularly at a time when the 
weather conditions, the low temperatures, reduce the efficiency of 
railway locomotives and it requires more locomotives than would 
normally be the case to move the same volume of grain at higher 
temperatures.
<P>
	Accordingly we have difficulties in the system. Rather than 
getting into the purple rhetoric that seems to fascinate the Reform 
Party, once again what I have tried to do is to call together the key 
players to get to the root of what is wrong. Tonight in Calgary I will 
be meeting with the Canadian Wheat Board, the Canadian Grain 
Commission, the grain companies, the railways, the car allocation 
policy group and other players who have a particular responsibility 
and a logistical responsibility for making the grain handling and 
transportation system in this country work.
<P>
	When I meet with those leaders of the grain industry tonight in 
Calgary, I will first of all thank them for making themselves 
available on relatively short notice for the discussion of a very 
serious topic. I will remind them that the topic is indeed serious. I 
will tell them that I am approaching this discussion with a deep 
sense of fiduciary responsibility, a sense of responsibility which I 
hope that they all will share, to those who for the most part will not 
be in that room tonight but have in fact the biggest personal and 
financial stake in what we will be talking about. Of course I am 
referring to the grain producers of western Canada and their 
customers around the world.
<P>
	For the most part the backlog in grain movement this winter is a 
temporary business problem to be overcome in the due course of 
doing business. Grain companies will ultimately collect their 
handling fees as the product moves through their facilities sooner 
or later. Railways will ultimately collect their freight rates. 
Politicians, officials and others will continue to collect their 
salaries.
<P>
	For the farmers, it is not that simple. They are at the end of the 
line when it comes to picking up the tab.  Handling fees get paid off 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8068"> 8068 </A></B>
<P>
the top. Freight rates get paid off the top. All the other market costs 
get paid off the top. After everyone else has been paid off the top 
the farmer gets what is left at the bottom.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	The toll gets heavier when ships are waiting, paying demurrage, 
and farmers pay more. The toll gets heavier when buyers cannot 
run the risk of further delays. When the Japanese start to look 
elsewhere for their supplies, the farmer pays again. It is not just this 
year. The bad reputation tends to linger for years to come. When I 
meet our customers in Tokyo next month they will not be easily 
reassured about the reliability of the Canadian grain transportation 
system.
<P>
	Once again the toll gets heavier when potential sales get deferred 
into a falling market at some future date. The price later will be 
less, especially with the U.S. export enhancement program 
looming on the horizon again to distort world markets with 
artificial subsidization. Once again the farmer will pay more.
<P>
	I know none of the remarks I will deliver tonight in Calgary will 
be news to any of the people in the room. They are after all the 
leaders of the western Canadian grains industry. I will tell them that 
as we grapple with the problem of what is wrong at the moment in 
our grain handling and transportation system we should all keep in 
mind who is truly being hurt by this situation, that is the farmer. We 
do not have any time to waste on excuses or finger pointing. We 
only have time for solutions.
<P>
	I want the analysis of those people at the meeting tonight of 
exactly where we are now in comparison to where we ought to be at 
this point in the shipping season and in relation to where we need to 
be week by week and month by month for the rest of the crop year. 
In other words, we must define the nature and the magnitude of 
what needs to be accomplished in the days, weeks and months 
ahead.
<P>
	Also we must define the steps that each one of us in the 
government, the private sector, the grain companies, the railways 
and so on need to take week by week and month by month to get the 
job done. In the interest of the farmers and in the interest of the 
public we need to emerge from the discussion tonight, and 
undoubtedly other discussions that will take place in the days 
ahead, with a workable game plan to deal with what is wrong and 
an absolute commitment to implement the plan without fail.
<P>
	When the grains industry in the past has been challenged with 
critical situations it has typically been able to set aside some of its 
differences on other issues, focus on the problem at hand and come 
up with creative, productive successful solutions. I hope that kind 
of attitude will prevail this evening and that at the end of the day 
farmers will benefit from a better situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment extensively on the minister's 
remarks but I will only mention one comment and ask one question 
so that others can ask questions.
<P>
	The minister referred to the infrastructure. While he praises 
infrastructure there are no permanent jobs in Saskatchewan as a 
result of the infrastructure program. On a per capita basis 
Saskatchewan is the largest loser of any province. A family of four 
falls about $80 short of the medium benefit of the infrastructure 
program across Canada.
<P>
	When we take the contribution of taxpayers to the infrastructure 
program into account, we recognize that Saskatchewan has 
transferred money out of the province to other parts of Canada. We 
have in fact exported jobs and potential rather than benefited from 
the program.
<P>
	Most of what the minister said was rhetoric. For about two 
minute the minister was hitting the nail right on the head when he 
talked about the lack of accountability in our system, that the grain 
companies would make their profits on handling the product, that 
the railways would make their profits from the freight rates they 
extract and that the politicians would get paid-he and I will get 
our paycheques-regardless of how well grain is moving to the 
west coast. That speaks of a lack of accountability in our 
transportation system for the inefficiencies that exist.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The most notable illustration of the inefficiencies right now are 
the 46 ships sitting in English Bay collecting demurrage, $10,000 a 
ship every day. They are just sitting there. The numbers are getting 
higher. It was 30-some ships a week ago. Now it is 40-some ships. 
If we do not get this fixed soon it will go to over 50 ships and over 
half a million dollars a day in potential costs to prairie farmers. 
That is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	In his speech the minister acknowledged that it was not the fault 
of farmers. How will he bring accountability to the transportation 
system? Who should be paying that demurrage? The railways have 
failed partly because of the taxation policies of his government and 
because they did not have the locomotives in place. Will they pay 
some of the demurrage? Will the grain companies that put the 
wrong grain in their terminals and plugged the system pay some of 
the demurrage? Will he wash his hands of this situation and say: 
``Let the farmers keep on paying like they have always paid. Those 
poor suckers, they have no choice. We will let them pay the shot. 
We will diddle and provide the rhetoric while they pay the bills?''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> Mr. Speaker, there were two distinct parts to the 
hon. gentleman's question. To start with he made some references 
about infrastructure.
<P>
	I believe he knows the Canada infrastructure works program as 
presently devised, even without the recent extension that has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8069"> 8069 </A></B>
<P>
discussed, would invest  something in the order of $58 million in 
Saskatchewan from federal funds. These dollars have been more 
than leveraged threefold. The amount of investment in total in the 
program in Saskatchewan if we include what the province, the 
municipalities and those in the private sector are investing is in 
excess of $200 million.
<P>
	The program has generated more than 3,000 jobs in 
Saskatchewan, some of which are of a permanent long term nature. 
Approximately 1,200 to 1,500 very valuable projects have been 
undertaken.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman demeans the value of the program in 
Saskatchewan. I hope he has the courage to go on to the campus of 
the University of Regina to explain his criticism to the faculty, the 
staff and students of the University of Regina who are benefiting 
from a new fine arts and multi-purpose building on the campus due 
to the Canada infrastructure works program.
<P>
	I hope he will explain to the people who will benefit from the 
new Lewvan overpass in Regina how he is opposed to that kind of 
important public infrastructure being built to improve the 
transportation situation around the city of Regina.
<P>
	I hope he will go into Saskatoon to explain to the people there 
how he is opposed to the infrastructure that has made a major 
contribution to the development of our high tech research facilities 
at the University of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The hon. gentleman should know as he hollers from his seat in a 
typical fashion that a portion of the infrastructure program in 
Saskatchewan was used for schools and health care facilities under 
the formula devised by the Government of Canada, the 
Government of Saskatchewan and the municipalities.
<P>
	This program has been a tremendous success in Saskatchewan. 
No matter how the Reform Party may bleat about it, it cannot 
undercut and defeat the value of that program in the eyes of the 
municipalities and many Saskatchewan citizens who have 
participated in it and benefited from it.
<P>
	On the second aspect of the hon. gentleman's question, there are 
some provisions in the new Canada Transportation Act that go to 
the issue of accountability. It is important to note that there are now 
some incentives built into the system to encourage performance on 
time and according to specifications.
<P>
	We need to have an important discussion sooner rather than later 
about the other kinds of performance standards and accountability 
guarantees that can be written into our system to ensure those who 
have obligations to perform pay the penalty that should logically 
occur when they do not perform up to the standards that should be 
expected of them.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	It is not fair in our system that others who are innocent of any 
failure to perform end up picking up the tab. The way the system 
has been structured historically, as I said in my remarks, the farmer 
tends to be at the end of the line and after everyone else has taken 
their cut the farmer gets what is left.
<P>
	It is incumbent upon every player in the system further up the 
line to make sure that they are performing their responsibilities in 
the most efficient fashion so that the maximum amount possible is 
transferred into the hands of farmers and nothing is consumed by 
way of unnecessary costs that could have been avoided.
<P>
	When a cost that could have been avoided is incurred in my 
judgment the person responsible for that cost should pay the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
aftermath of the repeal of the WGTA and the aolition of federal 
subsidy for eastern Canada, the government had earmarked $77 
million over a 10 year period to help the eastern regions to adapt to 
this, particularly eastern Quebec and the maritimes.
<P>
	Rumours are circulating to the effect that this transitional fund 
might be used, not for personal use, but for a small group targeted 
very precisely by departmental employees, or perhaps by the 
Minister of Agriculture himself. Could the minister reassure me on 
this?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Goodale:</B> Mr. Speaker, with the repeal of the Western Grain 
Transportation Act and the consequential elimination of the former 
Crow benefit we put in place a number of transitional measures. 
One of those was the western grain transition payments program 
which was a total of $1.6 billion distributed to prairie farm land 
owners in recognition of the impact upon them of the elimination 
of the subsidy that had existed for the better part of 100 years in one 
form or another.
<P>
	I am pleased to tell the hon. gentleman that the $1.6 billion has 
now been distributed. The process is completed except for a final 
handful of cases where there are some legal issues to resolve about 
land ownership and so forth.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that the payment process was reviewed, as it 
would normally be, by the auditor general. We got a favourable 
review indicating that the program had been conducted very well 
and handled according to the appropriate financial standards.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. gentleman that in terms of the program we 
not only believe the right money went to the right place at the right 
time but the auditor general appears to agree with our assessment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8070"> 8070 </A></B>

	The second part of the compensation system is the western grain 
transportation adjustment fund which totals $300 million. It will 
be invested over a period of two or three years. A portion of that-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate the minister did not shorten his responses 
somewhat to allow more questions from the opposition parties.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to debate today the Reform Party opposition 
motion condemning the government for its partisan approach to 
federal transportation policies. The government's handling of 
transportation issues is a litany of mismanagement, neglect, 
politicization and outright incompetence. From Pearson to airbus 
to VIA to our national highway system, the government has 
brought new meaning to the word botched mostly at the expense of 
the taxpayer and in some cases at the expense of private sector 
transportation operators.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	The government's record on transportation is devoid of vision. 
In the area of rail policy the government seems to feel that money 
can buy vision and decisiveness. The solutions of the sixties and 
seventies are not compatible with today's problems. No longer is 
there a bottomless pit of dollars to salvage and subsidize sinkholes 
like VIA Rail. So-called privateers like the Bombardiers that 
innovate as long as government dollars are there are not solutions 
but drains and no more so than in rail policy.
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at VIA Rail. It is one of the biggest 
money losing, over-bureaucratized entities in Canadian 
transportation. What does the government do to improve the 
situation? It subsidizes VIA Rail to the tune of $200 million per 
year and pays its executives six figure salaries to run it further into 
the ground.
<P>
	There is only one solution to get VIA out of this morass. Without 
question, putting VIA into private hands would cut costs, revitalize 
the corporation and its people and allow it to return many 
passenger routes that have been abandoned or are in danger of 
being cut. It does not take any vision to keep cutting and make a 
few dollars, but in the case of VIA it takes a special touch to cut and 
still lose money.
<P>
	If VIA were to be turned over to private entrepreneurs, marginal 
routes could once again be viable. Complacency and debt endure 
under the public ownership of VIA. It has exhibited no marketing 
strategy, business plan or scintilla of vision in its current 
operations.
<P>
	In 1989 VIA Rail made one enlightened decision. It sold a 
passenger railroad it had abandoned to the Great Canadian Railtour 
Co. With this came the birth of the new service, the B.C.-Alberta 
Rocky Mountaineer  Railroad. VIA could not make a go of it. In 
fact, it lost millions and felt that the private sector would not make 
a dime either.
<P>
	Here is an update. The Great Canadian Railtour Co. has made 
money and increased rail service on this line by an average of 30 
per cent a year since the takeover. VIA Rail, never an organization 
to miss an opportunity to lose money, screw up or betray a deal, has 
decided that it wants to compete head to head with this passenger 
route now so competently run. VIA could not turn a dime for years, 
but the federal government, prepared to enable this pettiness, is 
about to let VIA in on the action.
<P>
	How in the world can the Minister of Transport possibly justify 
allowing a crown corporation, subsidized by a weary taxpayer to 
the tune of $600,000 per day, to compete against an unsubsidized, 
tax paying, private sector company? It is another example of 
irrational and unfair strategic thinking by the Minister of Transport 
and the brain trust at VIA.
<P>
	I wonder what the projected loss is estimated at and how much 
the subsidy is going to be to prop up this bad decision. The minister 
will not admit the policy flaws of this type of decision and clings to 
the notion that throwing money at a problem will solve it. Once 
again he is confusing motion with progress.
<P>
	Rocky Mountaineer had planned to increase its capacity this year 
to meet the demands on this exceptional service. I ask the minister: 
What private sector company in its right mind would ever want to 
do business with him and his government again if such an act of 
betrayal is perpetrated by these uninspired and visionless 
executives at VIA?
<P>
	Here is some advice for the minister to get rail policy back on 
track. The government cannot simply abandon its financial stake in 
the transport industry without having the sense to recognize how 
much revision needs to be enacted to bring transport legislation 
into the 1990s. Present legislation harshly, though unofficially, 
penalizes the rail industry through the present tax structure. It 
behooves the government to rewrite rail policy, clear up the 
anomalies and set a strategy in place to allow investors to enter the 
arena with clear parameters. To encourage and support this new 
regime, the Reform Party suggests the following measures.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	First, we would encourage through tax reforms and low interest 
loans the development of short line rail operators in regions of the 
country where major rail companies are no longer viable or willing 
to provide the amount of capital needed to recreate a viable rail 
transportation industry.
<P>
	Second, we would negotiate the reform of the property and fuel 
tax structure for main and secondary rail operators to bring these 
costs into line with their U.S. counterparts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8071"> 8071 </A></B>
<P>
	Third, we would formally recognize through federal tax reform 
the environmental safety and infrastructure benefits provided by 
rail transport as opposed to modes such as long haul trucking.
<P>
	Finally, in relation to the last point, we need a thorough and fair 
revision in the overall tax structure for the nation's trucking 
industry to bring it more fairly into line with the costs now being 
incurred by rail companies.
<P>
	Currently the government gives with one hand and takes with the 
other. Since taking power in 1993 the government has done an 
inadequate job. It is mired without clear vision or policy direction. 
Governments should set guidelines and step out of the way. Right 
now no one is pleased with the situation and the rail industry is 
suffering as a consequence.
<P>
	I would like to turn to the national highway system, another 
example of a policy full of potholes. The government's recently 
released report on highway revitalization fails to address any of the 
long term funding problems that threaten the safety and integrity of 
Canada's national highways. The flaws in this report fall into three 
categories: dedication of federal tax revenues to highway renewal; 
alternative funding sources for construction and renovation of 
roadways, and public-private sector partnerships to carry out this 
renewal process.
<P>
	In committee a significant majority of witnesses supported the 
dedicated revenues concept. The committee is supposed to report 
what it hears. It did not do that. It not do that with the Canada 
Transportation Act. It did not do it with the national marine 
strategy report. And it has not done it with this current highway 
report. The committee is acting as the minister's lapdog.
<P>
	The committee's report-or should I say the minister's 
report-is misleading and an obfuscation in that it claims the 
concepts of public-private partnerships and shadow tolling are 
alternate funding sources. The fact is the only way these would 
provide a substantial source of funds is if the federal government is 
planning to repair our national highways by charging drivers tolls 
across the entire system.
<P>
	The report simply does not answer the question facing our 
deteriorating highways network: where is the money to come 
from? The government's report states it must look to the private 
sector for participation. Is this a commitment or a platitude, I ask? 
The Reform Party has real fears with anything emanating from the 
transport committee and was forced to write a minority report on 
the renewal of the highway system.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, we have three major concerns in our minority 
report, the first being dedicated funding. The federal government 
currently collects $5 billion a year in fuel taxes and spends $300 
million on highway infrastructure. By any logic this is a national 
embarrassment. Second, the majority report is misleading  on 
alternative funding sources. The concept of shadow tolling as an 
alternative funding mechanism does not answer where the money 
is to come from. And finally, the Reform Party has a major concern 
with government competition with the private sector. I mentioned 
the Rocky Mountaineer issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry the hon. member's time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. 
member.
<P>
	The hon. member addressed VIA and the Great Canadian 
Railtour Company. I would like to touch on both of them in my 
question.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	He mentioned that VIA is cutting and still losing money. I 
suppose it is losing money because the federal government has to 
subsidize it. But let us put the whole story before the Canadian 
people. The whole story is that VIA Rail had operated with over 
$300 million in subsidy per year and has had that subsidy reduced 
by the government to not $200 million as the hon. member said in 
his speech, but $170 million.
<P>
	VIA has been able to streamline, to work efficiencies into its 
company in order to maximize its return. It has managed to keep 
virtually the same VIA Rail service it had a couple of years ago 
with over $300 million in subsidy money, with only $170 million in 
subsidy. That subsidy is going down again. That company is 
demonstrating it can get on a commercially sound footing.
<P>
	Unlike some provincial governments that just slash it and say off 
you go and that is it, the government understands the need for VIA 
Rail and the service it provides for Canadians from coast to coast. 
It does not want to jeopardize that need, as some of his colleagues 
have addressed, of Canadians and communities that rely on a good 
passenger rail service and VIA is working toward that end.
<P>
	As far as the Great Canadian Railtour Company is concerned, I 
want to assure the hon. member opposite and the critic for 
transportation in the Reform Party that the government has no 
intention of watching a government subsidized rail company called 
VIA go up against any private company in Canada that is trying to 
do its job. It has no intention of doing that.
<P>
	If it can be established, and the Minister of Transport has talked 
to the people of Kamloops, he has talked to this caucus, he has 
talked on many occasions to Peter Armstrong at the company and 
VIA-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
parliamentary secretary but we have to give half the time to each 
and five minutes has now expired. The hon. member may reply.

	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, only a Liberal could say that a 
$400,000 a day subsidy is maximizing the return.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> That is not what I said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> That is what I heard you say, that VIA is 
maximizing its return. It is only getting a $170 million subsidy. If 
we want to talk about the Canadian Railtour Company and VIA 
competing head to head, if we really want to level the playing field, 
how open is the government to providing a subsidy to Great 
Canadian Railtour Company? Not very open I suspect.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is another minute and a half left. If 
the hon. parliamentary secretary wishes to speak again, I will give 
him half the time remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will say it quickly. Representations 
have been made to the Minister of Transport from this caucus, from 
the municipality of Kamloops, from Peter Armstrong, the head of 
Great Canadian Railtour Company, from VIA Rail and others. He 
is doing a full evaluation of this situation so that the right decision 
can be made in the interests of the travelling public as well as Great 
Canadian Railtour Company, a private company, and in the interest 
of VIA Rail that is trying to get on a sound footing financially.
<P>
	I give my personal guarantee that the decision the Minister of 
Transport will make is one that is based on sound input and it will 
be the right decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am at a loss. I certainly heard what 
the parliamentary secretary had to say. Nevertheless I do not fully 
comprehend or have any confidence that this decision will be made 
on economic principles as opposed to political rationale. That is the 
point of our exercise. That is the point behind my speech today.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting that there is so much discussion taking place about the 
Rocky Mountaineer. This rail company was based in my riding 
until recently when the expansion of the project meant it needed to 
move closer to its base in downtown Vancouver. I have had a lot of 
experience and direct contact with the Rocky Mountaineer.
<P>
	I wonder how many MPs in this place have actually taken a look 
at that train. I know one of the deputy speakers and the Minister of 
Justice used their free rail privileges to travel on it last year. They 
have certainly had an opportunity to take a look at it. I wonder how 
many other MPs on that side used their free rail privileges to travel 
and are now seriously considering putting this company at risk.
<P>
	This company has built up a tremendous relationship with the 
cruise ship industry. It sells trips to the cruise ship industry. The 
trip is a wonderful look at B.C. and the Rocky Mountains with an 
overnight stay on the way through.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport claims 
there is no problem because VIA Rail will only be moving people 
from place to place. Actually, all of the evidence is that that is 
absolute bunkum. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport stated that he will stop VIA Rail if it starts running a 
tourist service and not a passenger service for British Columbia. 
We will take him at his word on that.
<P>
	The service that VIA is proposing is actually between Jasper, 
Alberta and Vancouver. Fair enough. But how many people are 
going to need to travel from Jasper to Vancouver and vice versa, 
like catching a bus or a train? That is an important question because 
that surely would determine the type of facilities and how large the 
train would be. I think we can all agree that probably all of the 
passengers would travel the entire distance. So it is certainly not a 
service for B.C. residents travelling from one community to 
another.
<P>
	I would like to read a copy of an advertisement which recently 
appeared describing the service. This advertisement was issued by 
VIA Rail, so this is its words. This should bring the debate a little 
closer to what we should be talking about here. This is the 
advertisement placed by VIA Rail:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Discover Canada the way it's meant to be seen. Up close and in comfort. The 
experience awaits in silver and blue class aboard VIA Rail's western transcontinental 
train, The Canadian, beautifully restored to its sleek 1930s stainless steel style. Here 
is a classic train journey that combines the breathtaking panoramas of Canada with 
unique first class pleasures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Is this starting to sound like a train one would catch from little 
community to little community?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Silver and blue class travellers enjoy exclusive use of the park car with its famous 
observation dome and lounges, a spectacular dining car with meals to match, a 
choice of accommodations and shower in each sleeping car.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I said earlier, this is absolute bunkum. This train is being set 
up to compete with a private company that has been successful, that 
has made a go of it. To argue that any type of passenger train could 
survive these days is also absolute bunkum. VIA Rail learned years 
and years ago, decades ago that people have stopped using trains to 
travel from community to community.
<P>
	Generally speaking, people catch planes or buses and by 
preference most people will catch a plane simply because we are in 
a very rushed and hurried world and it is a lot easier to do that. 
Perhaps one could argue that the only people who would catch a 
train any more are afraid of the plane or do not like to go on the bus.
<P>
	It is completely ludicrous to argue that all of this money which is 
going to be poured into VIA Rail at the expense of taxpayers has 
anything to do with moving people from place to place.
<P>
	The debate today is about a whole bunch of transportation issues. 
I stood in the House on April 26,  1994 to speak on the ill-fated Bill 
C-22, the Pearson nightmare that keeps coming back to haunt this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8073"> 8073 </A></B>
<P>
government. That bill attempted to control the amount of 
compensation that could be paid as a result of the cancellation of 
the Pearson airport privatization deal.
<P>
	Earlier in today's debate the parliamentary secretary tried to 
convince us that somehow this whole Pearson thing was tied to the 
PCs. But of course there were the Bronfmans and there were also 
some well known Liberals, a certain senator, and Herb Metcalfe 
and Bob Wright, a Liberal fundraiser.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-22 which we debated some time ago, this nightmare that 
keeps coming back, had a special neat little provision under clause 
10. It had to be read carefully to see exactly what it said. It said: ``If 
the minister considers it appropriate to do so, the minister may, 
with the approval of the governor in council''-nicely behind 
closed doors-``enter into agreements on behalf of Her Majesty to 
provide for the payment of such amounts as the minister considers 
appropriate''.
<P>
	If that was not a set up to reward or to look after the Liberals who 
were involved in Pearson and to make sure the Tories were 
punished, then what was it? That is certainly what it looks like to 
me. Maybe because there are so many lawyers on the Liberal side 
of the House they thought they could set this thing up in Bill C-22. 
It was a lawyer's dream to pass legislation to allow that they could 
not be sued and could then determine the outcome, who would be 
rewarded and who would not.
<P>
	That was a wonderful piece of legislation. Thank goodness it met 
its fate along with the second attempt. As I keep mentioning, this 
nightmare keeps coming back to haunt the Liberal government. If 
the Liberals had dealt with this whole matter in an intelligent and 
productive way right at the beginning, Pearson today would be at 
the stage that Vancouver International is.
<P>
	And what a spectacular airport that is becoming, because that 
airport has been developed by some people who got away from 
bureaucratic nonsense and government run institutions. They have 
built a beautiful facility using a user pay fee system. Occasionally 
people complain that they have to pay $10 or $15 to pass through 
the airport. But when people can see dedicated revenues going to 
produce something, it really makes a difference. Even now when 
most of the naysayers experience that new airport, they say: ``It is 
great to see where the money went. This is really good. We like a 
user pay system that dedicates the revenues''.
<P>
	Unfortunately when we look at the state of the freeways and 
other parts of the infrastructure in the Vancouver region, nothing 
has been done for 50 years. I give credit to the foresight that our 
forefathers had in the Vancouver region, and with credit to the 
federal  government at the time, in the late fifties and early sixties 
to build a freeway that ran from Vancouver all the way down the 
valley to Abbotsford. Hardly a soul drove on that freeway when it 
opened.
<P>
	I have a friend who was living in the North Vancouver region at 
the time who had a cottage in the United States. He told me about 
the first time people drove on the freeway when it was opened. 
They asked who would ever use it. They asked when Vancouver 
would ever grow large enough to use that freeway. Now we look at 
that freeway 45 years later and it is absolutely crammed with cars.
<P>
	Because of the failure of the governments of the past decades to 
control their spending, because they have poured more and more 
into payments on the debt, they have been subtracting money out of 
the transportation and infrastructure projects. So we in Vancouver 
are stuck with a freeway that was built 45 years ago that should at 
least be doubled, probably tripled in size to meet the future 
requirements of the region.
<P>
	As some members would argue, there is a provincial 
involvement, but on most of these large freeway projects that are 
part of the Canada highway system, there is federal involvement. 
Members know that is the case. It would be a nice change for the 
western part of this country if instead of constantly having money 
sucked out, we got a little put back in to some of our major 
infrastructure.
<P>
	That does not mean patronage infrastructure the way the $6 
billion giveaway was set up. That was ridiculous. Where that 
money went was ridiculous. New seats in the superdomes. Many 
Reform Party caucus members stood in this place and criticized the 
spending of money in their ridings, and I did myself, because it was 
being spent on patronage. It was not being spent on creating jobs 
and it was not being spent on meaningful infrastructure that would 
have made a difference, that would have built for the future, that 
would have given us something to look forward to.
<P>
	I realize that-
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I regret to inform the member that his 
time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the hon. member 
that the Canada infrastructure program was done in concert with 
the provincial government and the municipalities. Those spending 
decisions were not patronage spending decisions made by the 
government; they were made by the municipalities. This was a 
municipally led program. They determined where the money would 
be spent. They came to the Ontario and federal governments, or in 
his case B.C. and federal governments, and received the funding 
necessary for the municipality.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8074"> 8074 </A></B>
<P>
	The member should not be talking about patronage funding 
coming from the federal government. That is ridiculous.
<P>
	I found it quite entertaining and interesting to listen to the hon. 
member about Pearson airport. He does mention there were Liberal 
players involved in the Pearson airport deal. Yes, absolutely. We 
admit that there were. But it is this government that is standing up 
and defending the Canadian taxpayer by saying that we do not care 
if there was a Liberal involved with Pearson Development 
Corporation or a Conservative involved with Pearson Development 
Corporation. This is the corporation that came together because 
Paxport, the deal hatched by the Tories and Brian Mulroney's 
fundraiser, did not work.
<P>
	We are saying that no matter if they were Liberals or Tories who 
were involved in Pearson Development Corporation, they are still 
only entitled to the money they spent on the project. They are 
entitled to $30 million, $40 million or $50 million, not the $600 
million the hon. member is defending that these individuals should 
receive.
<P>
	Where does the hon. member stand? Is he defending the 
Canadian taxpayer saying that the consortium is only entitled to 
what they spent or is he saying that they are entitled to $600 
million? We are saying that we are protecting the Canadian 
taxpayer. What is the hon. member saying?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few points came 
up there.
<P>
	First, aside from everything else he said, the parliamentary 
secretary should know that the auditor general, the government's 
own infrastructure auditor, said that the infrastructure program was 
a job creation failure. He warned against using this type of 
infrastructure program as a job creation scheme. Therefore, it was 
very clear to the auditor general that it was nothing more than a 
handout of money to Liberal sponsored schemes. There was plenty 
of evidence of that right across the country.
<P>
	In terms of the Pearson airport deal, what the people involved in 
that project were entitled to was their day in court. They were 
entitled to their day in court to let a court of this land decide who 
was at fault and how much the award should be. It is absolutely 
improper and a terribly bad precedent for a government to pass 
legislation that virtually dictates the outcome and protects the 
government from any sort of lawsuit. It is absolutely outrageous.
<P>
	Frankly, I do not give a hoot for the parliamentary secretary's 
personal guarantee that the Minister of Transport will make the 
most sensible decision. I do not give a hoot for that personal 
guarantee because I do not think it will be the most sensible 
decision. It will be made for political reasons.
<P>
	It saddens me greatly to see the risk that the Rocky Mountaineer 
is being put at in the interests of a political ideology from the other 
side of this House that is contrary to private enterprise in this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I found it terribly unbalanced on the member's part not to 
recognize in his speech some of the great efforts that have been put 
forward by the Government of Canada, specifically in the 
Vancouver area.
<P>
	When we think of the entire port infrastructure that has evolved 
in Vancouver, the Government of Canada has always led the way. I 
can think of all kinds of infrastructure support. Maybe the one 
highway he cited did not have quite the use it should have had at the 
time, but the Government of Canada presence in Vancouver is one 
of the most dominant of any city in Canada. I am sadly surprised 
that the member would not recognize that.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
failed to give any examples so I will give a nice example to back up 
my side of the story.
<P>
	The port of Vancouver has been treated like a cash cow for the 
government. So much in dividends has been sucked out of the port 
corporation that we cannot afford any more to build new passenger 
facilities. It is treated like a cow with its head in Vancouver and the 
udder in Ontario right here in Ottawa. It is a disgrace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity today to debate this 
opposition day motion and to speak particularly about the issue of 
highway transportation.
<P>
	The story we have to tell as a government and the types of things 
we are proposing and intend to proceed with show quite clearly that 
the resolution condemning the government is totally inappropriate, 
misses the mark and does not accurately reflect the reality of what 
is taking place today.
<P>
	Quite frankly the issue of transportation is an important one for 
me and for my riding. Parry Sound-Muskoka, part of the most 
beautiful part of the world, depends in large part on tourism. Indeed 
the vast majority of tourists who travel to my part of the country do 
so on the highway transportation system.
<P>
	In my riding we depend so much on that industry that almost one 
out of every two jobs is tied to tourism. For every million dollars of 
new tourism expenditure we attract to my riding, primarily again 
through the highway transportation system, we create 39 person 
years worth of employment. For me personally as the member for 
Parry Sound-Muskoka the whole issue of highway transportation 
is an important one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8075"> 8075 </A></B>
<P>
	I also had an opportunity with others on all sides of the House 
to participate as the chair of the natural resources committee in 
a rural development study. We had an opportunity to talk to 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast about the needs of their 
communities, about the need for improving the economic climate 
that exists in rural Canada.
<P>
	Almost to a person in the types of testimony that was provided to 
us the issue of transportation infrastructure, particularly highway 
infrastructure, came up. Not only was there the issue of tourism 
which we heard about from my constituents and from constituents 
across Canada, but we also heard about the importance of moving 
our natural resources from where we either harvest them or extract 
them in rural Canada to our markets and the importance of the 
highway transportation system to do that.
<P>
	There is also the importance of a strong highway transportation 
system in terms of being able to value add to our natural resources 
in rural Canada and of being able to move those to market in an 
efficient way.
<P>
	The committee on natural resources in its rural development 
study has examined this issue. It clearly states that transportation is 
important. The government is committed and concerned to have 
seen us as a committee of the House deal with the issue. I 
congratulate members of the transportation committee, which 
released its report yesterday dealing with the whole issue of 
highway transportation in Canada, for the work they have done, for 
the report they have tabled and for the recommendations they made 
in terms of highway renewal.
<P>
	Not only for rural Canadians but for all Canadians the highway 
transportation system is critical. Ninety-five per cent of all 
transportation that goes between cities is on our highways. 
Seventy-five per cent of all freight that we move goes by highway. 
Sixty per cent of our exports to the United States, our largest export 
partner, goes by road and 80 per cent of our imports. Therefore it is 
critical for rural Canadians and for Canadians everywhere.
<P>
	We need to look first at where we stand today. The reality of the 
situation when we are talking about highway transportation is that 
it is primarily, although not exclusively, a provincial responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Just this past October the Minister of Transport had an 
opportunity to meet in Prince Edward Island with his counterparts. 
He talked to them and dealt with the whole issue of a national 
highway policy. He received strong support from his provincial and 
territorial counterparts for the need to move forward but with a 
clear understanding that the lead responsibility in the issue of 
highway transportation rests with the provinces. The  federal 
government should and must take a role in highway policy.
<P>
	Historically the federal government has supported the whole 
issue of highway transportation since 1919. The best example 
occurred between 1949 and 1971 through a series of 
federal-provincial agreements involving the construction of the 
Trans-Canada Highway. As it had been in the previous century 
when it was linked from coast to coast by rail the nation was being 
linked coast to coast by a national highway.
<P>
	The commitment and the ongoing involvement in highway 
transportation continue today. The federal government in fiscal 
year 1996-97 is committing somewhere close to $300 million or 
$292 million through federal-provincial agreements to highway 
construction and maintenance. In addition it spends approximately 
$100 million on highways and bridges for which it has direct 
responsibility.
<P>
	Improvement in our highway transportation system is needed. 
That is why the government has had both the natural resources 
committee through its rural development study and even more 
directly the transport committee working on trying to develop ways 
to proceed, the proper actions that should be taken, the kind of 
strategy we should be looking at as a government to pursue 
improvement of our highway transportation network.
<P>
	As the report on transport made quite clear there is a need for 
action now. We have an aging system. It is considered to have a 
30-year lifespan. Right now it stands at something like 14 years. 
We are facing increased costs to maintain the system. As it grows 
older governments at all levels are having to commit increased 
financial resources to maintain it.
<P>
	There is growing congestion in our major metropolitan centres. I 
often drive to Toronto and it does not take long to see the 
congestion. There has not been adequate investment in our 
highway transportation system.
<P>
	Where do we go as a nation? Where do we go as Canadians? 
Where do we go as governments of all levels? One of the important 
things we need and one of the things the transport committee 
suggested is a national highways policy. We need a framework. We 
need a blueprint. Governments need a strategic road map to ensure 
a proper highway transportation infrastructure.
<P>
	The committee made a number of suggestions and included a 
number of components which I think are appropriate. It talked 
about the need for a long term commitment of federal financial 
assistance. It talked about the need to develop partnerships between 
the public and the private sectors and between different levels of 
the public sector and the provincial and federal governments. It 
talked about the need to explore and develop new technologies and 
best practices in creating and maintaining our highway 
infrastructure. It talked  about the need to develop innovative 
financing models to come up with the necessary financial resources 
that will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8076"> 8076 </A></B>
<P>
be required to make the major investment in updating and 
maintaining our highway infrastructure.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	On some of these points the government has made very clear 
what it intends to do. The fact that it is presently committing close 
to $300 million to highways in Canada is appropriate. We should 
continue at a minimum to make that kind of financial commitment 
to a national highway system.
<P>
	This has been debated a bit by previous speakers in the House 
but it is important that a infrastructure program be used to assist in 
transportation. In the program announced by the government right 
after the election in 1993 much of those funds were used in several 
provinces to help with important transportation related projects.
<P>
	Unlike what one member was trying to suggest before, the 
program worked based on decisions as to the local priority, where 
the money should be spent and the types of transportation 
infrastructure. If transportation was chosen the decision was made 
at the local level. It was not made by the bureaucracy in Ottawa or 
by the members who sit in the House or in the various provincial 
legislatures or by their bureaucracies. The decision was made 
where it should be made: by local councils, local individuals who 
understand and know their priorities. We should continue to have 
such an infrastructure program and part of it should be used for 
transportation.
<P>
	I will speak as a rural member for a second. It is important to 
note rural Canada has significant challenges that are somewhat 
different from those faced by urban Canada. Our transportation 
system is one of them. Obviously the geography is different. We 
have much larger distances to go. The density of our population is 
such that the need to communicate between a series of smaller 
municipalities intensifies our need for a highway transportation 
system. Our need to pursue our economies by transporting natural 
resources to market suggest that as we pursue a commitment of 
federal dollars, be it through an infrastructure program or 
otherwise, we must remember the needs in rural Canada are 
particularly high. We must recognize that when allocating the 
resources we allocate as a government.
<P>
	We need to look at our financing options. We need to be creative. 
The third party sometimes has difficulty with the whole concept of 
being creative in government, looking at new solutions and looking 
forward as opposed to looking backward.
<P>
	There are a number of creative ways to attract investment into a 
highways infrastructure. It could involve different levels of the 
public. It could involve a situation where we attract private 
investment into the infrastructure program, where we have the 
private sector invest in highways. We could recover that 
investment in a  number of different ways. It could come from the 
public pursue through governments paying back that investment 
over years as the assets are depreciated. Or, it can come from the 
public through user fees if that is the types of decisions that might 
be made.
<P>
	The key point is that we need to be creative in how we approach 
our financing of this type of infrastructure. I applaud the 
transportation committee in making that point very clear. We need 
to be creative. We need to reach out for innovative solutions in how 
we create highway transportation infrastructure.
<P>
	The motion suggests that the government should be condemned. 
It is hogwash to use that word because the government should not 
be condemned.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	The government should be complimented because in the last 
three and a half years, through its sound management of the 
Canadian economy, through the work it has done in managing 
Canada's finances, it has been able to create a financial 
environment that allows it options it would not have had if it had 
not acted in a prudent manner.
<P>
	It is appropriate to look for a second at how some of that has 
worked. First, the government has taken a deficit which was about 
$42 billion when it took over and it is going to come in somewhere 
a little over $17 billion. We will know soon when the Minister of 
Finance brings in his budget.
<P>
	The government is moving very quickly to a balanced budget. 
That will allow it to be able to make a long term financial 
commitment to a highway transportation system without increasing 
the debt. The government will be able to make that long term 
commitment without having to add on to its carrying charges. 
Sound fiscal management in reducing the deficit is giving the 
government the options to pursue such things as a national highway 
transportation policy.
<P>
	By having economic policies that have led to the lowest interest 
rates in 40 years has made it possible and attractive for the private 
sector to make investments in things like highway transportation. 
The environment has been created. That is what the economic 
policy is all about. The government has created an environment, in 
this case low interest rates, that will give the private sector the 
opportunity to make the kinds of investments that it wants to be 
able to make.
<P>
	These economic policies have led to the lowest sustained rate of 
inflation for well over a generation. It gives governments and the 
private sector the opportunity to make long term capital plans with 
some sort of surety in terms of future cost. That is what a stable 
inflation environment has been able to provide. It is working to 
allow the government to work in partnership with the private sector 
to pursue a policy that can lead to improved highway 
infrastructure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8077"> 8077 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us look at another matter. The government has created an 
environment so that trade has increased substantially since it has 
been in office. It has increased by something like 28 per cent. 
Today about 42 per cent of the value of all the goods and services 
produced in Canada come from trade. We have created the 
volume, we have created the market, we have created the need 
so that a proper investment and infrastructure can occur.
<P>
	The member talked about not wanting to invest in a highway that 
was going to be empty. The reality is that as a trading nation and 
with the volume of trade going up, again investment in 
transportation infrastructure makes good, sound economic sense.
<P>
	In summarizing, let me state clearly that first, the government 
has had some very specific policies that have helped in the area of 
highway transportation infrastructure. That is important to know.
<P>
	Second, the government recognizes that more needs to be done. 
We do need an improved highway transportation infrastructure and 
the government is moving forward in that respect. We saw it with 
the natural resources committee, we saw it with the transportation 
committee. We are seeking out solutions. The Minister of 
Transport has met with his provincial and territorial colleagues to 
come together and find the best way to go forward.
<P>
	Finally, by bringing sound fiscal management to this country, by 
creating a low interest rate environment, a stable inflation 
environment, the government has created the conditions so that 
investment can occur in our transportation infrastructure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member's speech, in 
particular toward the end when he got into fiscal policies. The only 
thing that is even more incredible in the outrageous claims that he 
has made on behalf of the Liberals is the fact that he actually seems 
to believe all this stuff.
<P>
	He talked of how the Liberal government wants to find creative 
ways of raising new highway funds. He talked about either paying 
for it from the public purse, coming from the taxpayer by way of 
government payment or collecting it directly from the taxpayer. If 
anybody knows of creative ways to extract money from the 
taxpayer it is the Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	He does not seem to recognize or accept that there is only one 
taxpayer. When the Liberals talk about making payments it does 
not matter where they get it from, it is coming out of the taxpayers' 
pockets. He talked in terms of user pay and that the user should be 
paying for this highway system, not the government. Obviously in 
the end it will be the taxpayer one way or the other.
<P>
	Let us go directly to the user. He suggested in the course of his 
speech that the highways are primarily a provincial responsibility. I 
do not disagree with that.
<P>
	I have actually two questions for the hon. member. First, what is 
his reaction to the concept of making the provincial government 
responsible for 100 per cent of the highways? The federal 
government will bow out. But before it does, let us also recognize 
that the federal government extracts from the taxpayers, the driving 
public, a 10 cent a litre federal fuel tax originally which it brought 
in and called a highway tax. The tax amounts to $5 billion a year 
but in the entire country the government spends about 5 per cent of 
that back.
<P>
	User pay? The user is paying 2,000 per cent of the cost of the 
federal government to maintain the national highway 
infrastructure. What about turning controls of highways 100 per 
cent back to provincial governments? But first tell them: ``If you 
accept this responsibility we will give you at least half'' and that is 
being generous. That is allowing the federal government to 
continue to extract from the Canadian driving public $2.5 billion a 
year and not put anything back. However, it would turn the other 
five cents over to the provinces with the explicit requirement that it 
is spent on highway infrastructure within their provinces.
<P>
	If he is prepared to do that, I would suggest that the provinces are 
prepared to accept. British Columbia spends $1 billion on federal 
fuel taxes and the government spends $200 million for the entire 
country. If it wants user pay, great. But first account for the money 
that the user is already paying.
<P>
	Second, he talked about highway transportation here in Ontario, 
his province and how necessary it is for his area.
<P>
	Let us look at bus transportation in the province. VIA Rail 
officials came before the transportation committee and in response 
to my question of how VIA could possibly justify taking an already 
hugely subsidized passenger rail fare and cut it in half, the response 
was: ``We want to increase our ridership and have a greater 
business volume so we are cutting our fares in half to take business 
away from the bus companies''. Those bus companies are tax 
paying, non-subsidized, private sector operators trying to make a 
living, trying to transport tourists to the hon. member's area, that 
he talked about being so necessary for his local economy. How can 
we possibly justify VIA Rail taking a fare that is already hugely 
subsidized and cutting it in half to take passengers away from the 
private sector?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a number of 
points. Quite frankly, members opposite speak in general terms to 
something I have had an opportunity to talk about before and which 
I am going to take the opportunity to talk about again. They do not 
understand the nature of Canada, the nature of Confederation, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8078"> 8078 </A></B>
<P>
they do not understand how this  works. The hon. member laughs 
when I talk about Canada and Confederation. That speaks volumes 
about exactly how he feels.
<P>
	This nation is a partnership of provinces and of Canadians. He 
talked about what British Columbians pay in gas tax. They do 
contribute significantly to Canada. However, other parts of the 
nation may not have the opportunity to contribute quite the same 
for whatever reasons.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	Does that mean that part of Canada gets that much more service? 
Does that mean the less advantaged areas of the country are 
doomed not to receive assistance from those parts of the country 
that are more fortunate? Is that the kind of system he is calling for? 
I suspect it is because when their rhetoric is looked at and listened 
to, it is obvious they do not understand the very fabric of Canada 
and the very nation of Canada.
<P>
	He suggests that we pay $5 million in gasoline tax and then turn 
around and send the money out and only use it for that. However, if 
we do that what happens to those public services that we provide as 
a government for which we do not collect any revenue? Does that 
mean that we do not have a national public health care system 
because there is not a revenue stream for it? Is he calling for an end 
to public health care?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood): </B>Andy, did you hear what 
he just said? He wants to increase the income tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Oh, I see, he wants to raise taxes. That is an 
interesting thing coming from the Reform Party. I think that is 
somewhat against their new start or fresh start or whatever start it is 
on this week, I am not quite sure.
<P>
	The point is that we do not necessarily say that if one has a 
revenue stream that it must be matched to a specific expenditure. 
What is going to happen? Do we take that money and divide it up 
by province? If one province pays more into it does it get more than 
the other provinces?
<P>
	We are a nation. We are a nation from coast to coast to coast. We 
are all Canadians from coast to coast to coast. We provide for 
ourselves on a national basis. I become very concerned when 
members of the third party sow the seeds of parochial 
provincialism day in and day out and try to sow the seeds of 
discontent from one region to another region. Those are the types 
of things they are talking about. Those are the types of things that 
their policies are going to lead to.
<P>
	We want a national transportation system. We want a national 
highways transportation policy. It is the Liberal government, 
through sound fiscal management, that is going to give various 
governments and the private sector collectively the ability to do 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been sitting here listening with a lot of 
interest to discussions on a national transportation policy with 
which I totally agree.
<P>
	Our colleagues from the third regional party have come up with 
their own fresh start. I think it is about the fifth or sixth time they 
have had a start on this. However, in this one they are talking about 
giving back $2,000 per family on income tax. The one colleague 
over here right now has just made a statement that he was going to 
increase income tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> B.S.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Liar.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> You just said it. Anyway, no matter what he says, I 
heard him distinctly make that statement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A point of order, the hon. member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Absolute bull.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Hold on, hold on. Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
inferring that he is quoting a comment I made that was responded 
to by another member. With regard to the comment I made, I 
simply said: ``You still have your income tax revenues''. They are 
claiming that I said something other than what I did.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Thank you for clarifying that. In fact, 
these last questions and comments have been a bit of a disaster. The 
hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka gets to reply in about 25 
seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will take the opportunity to say that 
we have, as a nation, a challenge in terms of our highway 
transportation system. The Liberal government is working toward 
finding solutions. However, those solutions have to be found in 
partnership with other public sector governments, primarily the 
provincial governments, and in conjunction with the private sector 
as well.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	This government has done a good job. It has set good economic 
fundamentals which will allow for investment in infrastructure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have before the House today a motion presented by the 
Reform Party, and I will read the first sentence: ``That this House 
condemn the government for its approach to federal transportation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8079"> 8079 </A></B>
<P>
policies''. Need I say that I could not agree more with this motion? 
With regard to airports alone, we have two clear examples of  the 
need to condemn the transportation policies of this government.
<P>
	And this is only the airports. There is also the Pearson question, 
and I will simply say that the Liberal government's decision in this 
respect has meant that we as taxpayers are faced with a law suit 
involving more than $600 million in damages.
<P>
	However, I intend to concentrate on the issue, which was in the 
news again yesterday, in connection with the decision made by 
ADM to transfer all international flights to Dorval and, without any 
real authorization, to start work at Dorval on the facilities that will 
be required as a result of these transfers.
<P>
	As you know, yesterday in Superior Court in Montreal, Judge 
Viau reversed this decision, and his accompanying comments were 
very critical of both ADM and the federal government. The ruling, 
which is 260 pages long, contained some very interesting 
comments. I will quote only three.
<P>
	The first one is more or less as follows: the judge orders ADM to 
act in the public interest. Here is a creature of the federal 
government that is accused of not acting in the public interest. I 
wonder whether we actually realize how shocking this is. Let me 
recall that well known saying: like father, like son. And ADM is a 
creature of the federal government.
<P>
	Second little pearl: the judge accused the ADM of manipulating 
the results of a study. Here again, and I underscore this, the ADM is 
a federal creature and is being accused of tampering with the 
results of a study to its advantage or to the advantage of the lobbies 
supporting it. I will not mention them here.
<P>
	Third pearl: the ADM is being accused of abusing power. This 
government offspring is being accused of abusing power because it 
decided on a radical change in the functions of these two airports, 
when the government, as landlord, was entitled to insist on 
consultation and to authorize all changes in their functions.
<P>
	I am proud to point out that our party, the Bloc Quebecois, 
criticized these practices from the outset and called on the 
government, the final authority in matters of air transportation, to 
put a stop to them. It is not up to our party to speak for Mirabel or 
Dorval.
<P>
	It is our role, however, to criticize the behaviour of the ADM and 
the government in this matter and, especially, the arrogance of the 
seven members of ADM, who, without consulting anyone, 
according to the judge, not even SOPRAM, the advisory body 
available to it for consultation, decided the future of a region and 
the future of airports in the greater Montreal area.
<P>
	We also asked, equally unsuccessfully, that the studies the ADM 
used be made public. We tried under the Access to Information Act.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Our request was turned down, because as a creation of the 
federal government, it is not subject to this act. We were denied 
access to the studies. As a result, no one knows on what basis a 
decision crucial to the regions was made.
<P>
	I will wrap up quickly. As a sovereignist, I will not complain; in 
fact, I should thank ADM and Ottawa for proving once again to 
Quebecers that, within the federal system, management without 
interference by the lobbies is impossible. We cannot hope for 
reasonable management or for management in the public interest 
over the transportation issues debated here today. Our only hope is 
for a sovereign Quebec to be managed in an honest and reasonable 
fashion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask 
the hon. member to provide more details on the consequences that 
this will have on Mirabel airport. What happens now with the two 
airports? Could the hon. member elaborate on this, because we 
need further information on this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, we cannot anticipate whether ADM 
will appeal the decision or not. Nor can we anticipate what the 
federal government will do, since the judge is asking, and in fact 
demanding, in the five conditions he set to allow ADM's decision 
to be implemented, that the government take certain measures.
<P>
	I will simply say this: millions of dollars have already been spent 
in legal costs alone by the two parties, millions that could have 
been saved had the government followed up on the Bloc 
Quebecois' recommendation to hold public hearings, where 
representations would have been made and studies submitted, at a 
much lower cost. The issue should have been discussed in public, 
not behind closed doors.
<P>
	We do not know whether the saga will continue, whether 
millions of dollars will be spent should ADM decide to appeal, or 
what the government's position will be following the judge's 
recommendations. At this point in time, I do not know what will 
happen. It all depends on ADM's decision and on the federal 
government's decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
impression I will have to continue after question period.
<P>
	There are four items I would like to discuss in this debate on a 
motion tabled by the Reform Party which attempts to express the 
dissatisfaction with the federal government's transportation 
policies.
<P>
	The items mentioned include, first of all, Pearson airport. I think 
this is a subject that has been discussed by a number of members in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8080"> 8080 </A></B>
<P>
this House. I could not agree more with those who thought it was 
very disturbing and  in fact shocking to see the way the government 
is trying to salvage this mess.
<P>
	Let me recall the facts of the case. The present Liberal Prime 
Minister said, when he was in the opposition and also during the 
election campaign, that he would reverse the former Conservative 
government's decision to privatize Pearson airport in Toronto, 
saying it would be far too expensive. They were talking about $600 
million.
<P>
	Not long ago in the newspapers, we read that one hundred 
million dollars would be needed to pay compensation alone. To 
salvage what could be salvaged and to try and honour a 
commitment, the government thinks one hundred million is too 
much.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Many citizens are talking increasingly about a second subject, 
the highway system. Many have asked their member of Parliament 
to table petitions, and I will probably table one myself. They want 
the government to spend more money on improving or repairing 
Canada's highway system.
<P>
	By the way, we deplored the fact that Quebec does not get its fair 
share. Between 1952 and 1986, only 16.5 per cent of federal 
spending on highways went to Quebec, although we have more 
than 24 per cent of the population, as you well know.
<P>
	From 1986 to 1988, spending dropped to 13 per cent. In 1991-92, 
spending dropped to its lowest level ever, 4.2 per cent. It went up a 
little subsequently, but never exceeded 12 per cent. In other words, 
half of the money the federal government should be spending on 
the highway system in Quebec is not being spent.
<P>
	There are two more items, but I think I will have to continue 
after question period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Certainly, my dear colleague. You will have the 
floor after Oral Question Period. You have seven minutes left if you 
want to use them.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., we shall proceed to statements by members.

prebudget town hall to discuss the country's current economic 
situation and to consider how best to proceed.

acknowledged that over 770,000 jobs have been created and that 
the deficit battle has almost been won. Now we must take 
advantage of our accomplishments and ensure our economy 
remains strong. Investing in youth, technology and small

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
take this opportunity to pay tribute to the FTQ, or Fédération des 
travailleurs du Québec, the labour organization where I worked for 
19 years, on the eve of its 40th anniversary. It was born on February 
16, 1957 out of the merger of the Fédération provinciale du travail 
du Québec and the Fédération des unions industrielles du Québec.
<P>
	In actual fact, the FTQ is far more than 40 years old. Its origins 
go back to the end of the last century. It builds on the old traditions 
of a combination of European and North American trade unionism, 
and is heir to the rich history of the international labour movement.
<P>
	Today, the FTQ represents 480,000 people working in all sectors 
and all regions of Quebec. In addition to doggedly defending the 
interests of wage earners of all backgrounds, the FTQ has also 
taken up the cause of the sovereignty of Quebec. As well, it battles 
for its membership's right to work and to live in French.
<P>
	The exceptional contribution the FTQ has made to Quebec 
society is universally recognized. On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, 
I wish it all the best on its 40th anniversary.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the government announced a youth jobs 
strategy. While it may or may not have political overtones, I think 
it is fair to say it is very clear there is a direct relationship between 
job potential, the ability to get and to retain a job, and the level of 
education.
<P>
	In my opinion it is absolutely hypocritical of the government to 
cut funding to post-secondary education  at the same time it would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8081"> 8081 </A></B>
<P>
put funding into a job scheme which in the eyes of many is really a 
transparent method of getting votes.
<P>
	There is a direct relationship between the scholastic level 
achieved by young people and their ability to get a job. For 
instance, six months after graduation, only 3.5 per cent of the 1990 
graduates of the University of Alberta were looking for work.
<P>

stay in school.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, prairie producers who are still considering their vote on 
the Canadian Wheat Board barley plebiscite should take a look at 
the recent Schmitz, Gray, Schmitz, Storey study which shows that 
the CWB puts more money in its pockets than it would receive 
from the open market.
<P>
	The study showed that the Canadian Wheat Board single desk 
sales monopoly enabled it to extract higher prices for malt barley 
and for feed barley as well. The four agricultural economists who 
conducted the study pegged the price benefit at an average of $72 
million a year during the 10-year period that ended in 1994-95.
<P>
	With information like this, there should be little doubt about the 
pending outcome of the producer plebiscite. The power of the 
Canadian Wheat Board is a tremendous benefit not only to the 
individual farmers but also to the country as a whole. We should all 
be doing everything we can to support the Canadian Wheat Board 
and guarantee that it has a long and successful future.

	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is the 50th anniversary of an important event in 
Canadian history. On February 13, 1947 Imperial Oil brought the 
Leduc number one oil well into production. At the time, Alberta 
was an agriculture based economy without sufficient resources. Oil 
was being imported from the United States.
<P>
	Imperial Oil Limited had persevered through the decades of 
costly but unsuccessful exploration. One hundred and thirty-three 
consecutive dry holes had been drilled before the Leduc find on the 
southern outskirts of Edmonton. This oil well represented a turning 
point for the Canadian oil industry. It quickly led to the growth and 
development of an innovative and competitive oil patch. The oil 
and the natural gas industry has been a major source of income, 
jobs and exports since then.
<P>
	The Leduc find can be considered the most important economic 
event to occur in the west in the postwar years.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in recent days we have heard a great deal about the small 
weeks anomaly in the employment insurance program. Make no 
mistake, it is a serious problem that must be fixed. But let us not 
lose sight of the overall benefits of the government's EI reforms.
<P>
	The shift from weeks to hours recognizes all work. This is 
particularly helpful to seasonal industries. The low income 
protection means that Canadians who earn less than $26,000 can 
receive up to 80 per cent replacement income. People will have 
access to EI based active measures for up to five years, even after 
their income benefits have expired. Even the divisor is a more 
humane work incentive than simply making employment insurance 
benefits harder to get.
<P>
	While the application of the program requires urgent repair, the 
fundamental reforms represent progressive and innovative public 
policy worthy of all our support.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I wish to share with my colleagues in the House during this

<P>
	To be a Canadian is to be proud of what we are and overcoming 
our differences in order to build a better future. It also means being 
a part of the larger force which draws its strength from its linguistic 
duality and cultural diversity.

	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is happening again. At last count there were some 46 
ships waiting for grain at the west coast  ports. Whenever this 
happens, the Canadian Wheat Board blames the railways, the 
railways blame the grain companies, and the minister of agriculture 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8082"> 8082 </A></B>
<P>
does not blame anybody. All this while the farmers who are the real 
victims end up holding the bag. This time it is a $65 million bag.
<P>
	Farmers are tired of all the finger pointing. They are not 
interested in who is to blame. They are interested in solving 
problems that affect their daily lives.
<P>
	This minister has to start realizing that these grain tie-ups have 
to stop. Everybody loses in these situations. I often wonder how 
long it would take the government to act if its members' 
paycheques were put on hold for several months because someone 
decided to shut down the comptroller's office during the winter.

waiting to see if his words contain something more than rhetoric. 
Today I would like to offer some recommendations to the finance 
minister which will create meaningful jobs for the more than two 
million unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	The finance minister should consider a one year freeze on the 
current interest rates which are creating jobs in fact. The finance 
minister should consider a $4,000 tax deduction for every small 
business for each new employee hired. The most hated GST should 
be cut down to 5 per cent effective immediately with a further 
provision to reduce it by 1 per cent each year, thus eliminating the 
GST within five years.
<P>

the finance minister gives serious consideration to my proposals.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the NAFTA 
and World Trade Organization were supposed to result in freer 
trade with the United States. Yet for Canada's sugar industry the 
opposite has occurred.
<P>
	In 1995 the Americans ignored the spirit of the WTO and 
slapped heavy tariffs on Canadian sugar exports. Access to 
American markets fell by more than 60 per  cent. The result: 
Rogers Sugar is closing its Winnipeg operations with a loss of 82 
jobs.
<P>
	But this is not the only sugar subsidy to prosper in the free trade 
era. The re-export program for sugar-containing products, which 
the U.S. agreed to discontinue in accordance with the NAFTA 
agreement, continues to thrive and subidize for more than a year 
after its promised termination date of January 1996. Special 
consultations to resolve the matter have gone nowhere, making it 
clear the Americans will not terminate the program until we force

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this week, 
for the umpteenth time, the government has rewritten the red book. 
After stating that the government had fulfilled its promise on the 
GST, after stating that it had fulfilled its referendum promises on 
the distinct society by passing a trumped up motion, now the 
government is at it again.
<P>
	This week, the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced, for the 
third time, with a straight face, that the CBC would have stable 
funding for five years, once the government has cut $379 million 
from it.
<P>
	This announcement was greeted with universal scepticism. How 
can a promise made by a minister on the eve of an election 
campaign be believed? But the most dead-on comment came from 
Perrin Beatty, the CBC President himself: ``We will not believe it 
until we have our hands on the cheque''.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House to tell a story of honour, distinction 
and heroism, a story that many may not be familiar with. This story 
follows the actions of the Canadian peacekeepers who served with 
distinction in Somalia.
<P>
	In unfamiliar and treacherous surroundings facing mortar, 
artillery and small arms fire, our Canadian forces performed their 
duties admirably. They secured an area of about 30,000 square 
kilometres, escorted humanitarian convoys, performed demining 
operations and destroyed vast quantities of weapons.
<P>
	Medical personnel held out-patient clinics, trained hospital staff 
and repaired equipment. Soldiers fixed machinery, repaired the

local jail and assisted the staff at  the international medical corps 
hospital. They also built bridges and schools and repaired roads and 
runways while overhead our Hercules cargo planes supported 
massive humanitarian relief efforts.
<P>
	That is the other side of the Somalia story. That is why the 
Government of Canada is establishing a medal to honour those who 
served in Somalia. They did so with distinction and deserve to wear 
the medal with pride.

the Prime Minister's office and the Ottawa elite.

	So what did Canadians hear in the bubble boy's speech? Did he 
say anything about integrity or accountability, Somalia, Airbus, 
Krever, the broken GST promise? What about the $3.5 billion he 
cut from medicare while promising to save it? How about the 1.5

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANGOVERNMENT">CANADIAN GOVERNMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we knew, from listening to the Prime Minister, that 
elections were in the air, but that does not explain the absence in the 
House of half of cabinet.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. As a rule, we do not refer to any 
member's presence or absence in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, late this morning, the Prime 
Minister painted a rosy picture of life in Canada. Clearly, the Prime 
Minister has tested the electoral waters. His remarks are very 
optimistic.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Optimistic, but so out of touch with reality.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> What are we going to do with this, Mr. Speaker? It 
makes no sense.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Question, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Yes, I am getting to my question. We will see 
how far this optimism goes. The Prime Minister was silent about 
the Somalia inquiry. Not a word passed his lips about the Airbus 
scandal. He had nothing to say about the Pearson deal, nor did he 
mention the broken GST promise, or the Canadian armed forces.
<P>
	My question, for any one of my colleagues across the way who 
can reply on behalf of the government, is as follows; Why is the 
Prime Minister so silent when it comes to matters concerning his 
government's morality?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is really touching that the leader of the separatist party is 
concerned about the future of the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Be that as it may, his litany of unjustified complaints shows 
something very important: he has nothing to complain about when 
it comes to the achievements of this government in restoring the 
Canadian economy, bringing down interest rates and creating 
hundreds of thousands of jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister wants to test the waters, he would do 
better to answer his own questions during the election campaign.
<P>
	In 1993, the red book lamented the 1.6 million unemployed in 
Canada, the millions on welfare, the one million children living in 
poverty and the high level of bankruptcy. Three and a half years 
after being elected to office, this government has captured the all 
time record of 1.5 million unemployed, three million welfare 
recipients, 1.5 million children living in poverty, and 86,000 
bankruptcies in Canada.
<P>
	My question, for any government member brave enough to 
answer, is this: When it comes to real problems, what does this 
government have to be proud of?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8085"> 8085 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I think the best answer to my hon. friend's question is to quote from 
the Prime Minister's speech to the board of trade this morning. He 
said that forecasters in the private sector are predicting that 1997 
and 1998 will be years of strong growth. They say we will lead 
most of the industrialized world in economic growth. They say the 
economy will create an additional 300,000 jobs a year for the next 
two years, on top of the more than 700,000 created since we formed 
the government.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Finally, one more sentence. ``I know'', said the Prime Minister, 
``that for someone without a job these statistics may not be much 
comfort, but I want them and all Canadians to understand what we 
are doing to combat unemployment and how I believe our actions 
will create a stronger economy and more jobs for all Canadians''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians have been listening to this line for three and a 
half years. The government members sound like broken records.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of Canada-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We will miss you.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Leader of the Opposition has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, some members across the way think 
they will miss me. Let them come to Roberval and defeat me, if 
they can. They can run any candidate-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Even the minister of defence.
<P>
	On a more serious and much sadder note, the Prime Minister, in 
his interminable speech, gave as examples of how well the 
Canadian federal system works the manpower training agreement, 
the infrastructure, the youth programs, the right of veto and distinct 
society-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. They are so blind they 
applaud. Let us look at the results. But let us look at the facts. With 
regard to manpower, nothing has been settled with Quebec. As for 
the infrastructure-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to kindly 
put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am coming to my question, 
because whether it is youth programs, the right of veto or distinct 
society, it all boils down to a big zero for Quebec.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister, how can the government, hold up 
these examples of how well Canadian federalism works and still 
keep a straight face?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we can reply with great 
confidence to the questions from the Leader of the Opposition 
because I think that people across Canada have noticed the renewed 
effort by cabinet in our integrated approach with the provinces for 
the benefit of children; we have made an integrated national child 
benefit a priority.
<P>
	Manpower has been mentioned. I would like to explain to our 
colleagues across the way that the Government of Canada has 
offered publicly-my predecessor made this offer last May 30-to 
transfer responsibility to the provinces. We have already signed 
agreements, which is a clear indication of our good faith, with two 
provinces, Alberta and New Brunswick, and we are continuing to 
negotiate very actively with the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	I can assure the Leader of the Official Opposition that many of 
these issues are well on the way to being settled.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at noon the Prime Minister, who is ashamed to show his 
face, bragged that he put the federal government's financial house 
in order by reducing the deficit. He was also full of compassion for 
the unemployed and children living in poverty.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister or to the person 
who will answer on his behalf. Does the Prime Minister agree that 
this deficit reduction is mainly due to tax increases totalling $18 
billion since 1994, a five billion dollar surplus snatched from the 
unemployment insurance fund, and a shocking $4.5 billion cut in 
our social programs?
<P>
	In other words, this government's outstanding performance 
comes at the expense of the provinces, the unemployed and the 
poor.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, our 
achievements are there for all to see. In international forums, 
whether we are talking about the International Monetary Fund or 
the OECD, all reports have indicated that Canada's economic 
performance was the best of any industrialized country.
<P>
	Newspapers in France refer to the Canadian miracle, and 
Japanese investors are now prepared to invest at rates which are 5 
per cent lower than before. We cleaned up our tax system; we have 
again become fiscally responsible; we created 700,000 jobs; we 
brought the inflation rate down to 1.5 per cent and in 1996, our 
current trade balance will show a surplus.
<P>
	These are our achievements, and the opposition cannot deny this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8086"> 8086 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this so-called Canadian miracle means 500,000 more 
children are living in poverty since they came to power.
<P>
	Will the one who speaks for the government agree that by cutting 
4.5 billion in our social programs, the government has had a 
devastating impact on the poverty rate? In other words, the 
wonderful compassion shown by the Prime Minister at noon is an 
admission of a guilt. He is the guilty party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> It came from the heart.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
opposition is so overcome by the truth that it no longer considers 
asking questions.
<P>
	But even if the hon. member did not ask a question, I think it is 
clear that our program spending, will have gone down from $120 
billion to $103 billion next year, which means that our departments 
have had to absorb the majority of our spending cuts. We cut 
administrative spending more than we cut transfer payments. In 
fact, the government cut its own spending by 22 per cent, so as to 
restore its fiscal responsibility.
<P>
	And I must say that if there had been no separatists on the other 
side, the results would have been even better.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOMALIAINQUIRY">SOMALIA INQUIRY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
Somalia commissioners accused the government of political 
interference in an investigation of a murder cover-up.
<P>
	Commissioners Létourneau and Desbarats made it quite clear 
that the government knew full well that by shutting down the 
inquiry Canadians would never know the truth about a cover-up at 
the highest levels.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Prime Minister the one question the 
government refused to answer yesterday. Why do the Liberals not 
want the Somalia inquiry to get to the bottom of this high level 
murder cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member is totally irresponsible. There is no one in Canada who 
believes that there was or there is today a cover-up of the murder.
<P>
	The government has said and I as the minister has acknowledged 
that there were many mistakes made in how the military institution 
responded to the absolutely intolerable events that occurred in 
Somalia which resulted in the killing of Somali citizens. There is 
no question about that.
<P>
	As I said and as the hon. member knows, every Canadian who 
really wants to get a clear understanding of what took place in 
Somalia knows who pulled the trigger. Everybody in Canada 
knows exactly what happened on the ground in Somalia to the 
extent that it can be determined after two years of work by the 
commission, the military investigations, the courts martial and 
everything else that took place.
<P>
	The hon. member is trying to continue to pursue an opportunity 
that he thinks his party has, that his own leader totally disagreed 
with when in September 1996 he stood in his place in the House 
and asked the Prime Minister of Canada for a guarantee that the 
Somalia inquiry would end before the election. He did not have a 
word to say about the truth or about the facts. He simply wanted it 
ended.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the House this 
minister said that the inquiry would go on maybe into the 21st 
century, maybe eight years or so. The commissioners said that it 
would be over, that they would have the finished report on the 
minister's desk by the end of December 1997. In the House this 
minister implied that it could last forever.
<P>
	The minister can bluster and scatter red herrings in every 
direction but that will not help. For the first time in history the 
Liberal government shut down an independent inquiry at a crucial 
time when they were just starting to expose some of the 
government's friends.
<P>
	What is the government trying to hide by this high level 
cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, because of my 
respect for the House and awareness that question period answers 
should be brief, I will not address all of the irresponsible and 
absolutely wrong-headed information the hon. member tried to put 
into his question.
<P>
	Let me deal with one specific issue very briefly. The hon. 
member said that the commissioners have apparently said to him or 
to someone that they would be totally finished by the end of 
December of this year. That is what I heard the hon. member say.
<P>
	Let me quote from a letter sent by the commission of inquiry into 
the deployment of Canadian forces to Somalia to the Privy Council. 
This is a quote from a document provided to the government 
through the Privy Council directly by the commission: ``Scenario 
one, the most desirable or optimum scenario''. It goes on in too 
much detail for me to take the time of the House but let me go to 
the conclusion: ``The most desirable or optimum scenario would 
result in the completion of hearings by May of 1998, followed by a 
four to six month period thereafter for the production of the final 
report''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8087"> 8087 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member sooner or later has to make an effort at getting 
his facts straight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously we 
would like that document tabled so we can all take a look at it. I am 
going on what the commissioners have said to the public in their 
news conference yesterday.
<P>
	The real issue here is that the government has obviously been 
happy as long as the guys at the bottom are being charged. The 
minute we started to move up that ladder we brought an end to this 
inquiry. For the first time in Canadian history we did that. This 
government and this Prime Minister are responsible for that.
<P>
	Why is the Prime Minister shutting down this inquiry before it 
can investigate at the highest of levels? It is happening right under 
his nose. What is the government trying to cover up by cancelling 
this inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member often refers to the bottom of the ladder. He is obviously far 
more familiar with the bottom of the barrel.
<P>
	In his previous question the hon. member talked about when the 
commissioners had assured him they would be able to report. I 
have indicated clearly that there is another view from the 
commissioners with respect to when they could properly report.
<P>
	With regard to another allegation made by the hon. member, I 
will help him out this time rather than embarrass him. Maybe I 
could suggest to the hon. member that he check his facts to find out 
for sure whether any government in Canada has ever put an end to 
an inquiry, before he repeats that allegation again.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The Prime Minister boasted about the passage of the 
employment insurance legislation. That is odd. Less than five 
weeks after the main provisions of the new employment insurance 
act came into force, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is already acknowledging the need to correct what he 
describes, with his legendary lack of understanding of the issues, as 
flaws. But time and time again the official opposition has criticized 
the absurdity of certain provisions of the system.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	In connection with the flaws he has to correct, will the minister 
deal with the case of Rita, a woman who is  receiving a meagre $35 
per week in benefits, after working twelve 35-hour weeks at 
minimum wage, because, under the new legislation, only the 
previous 26 weeks are taken into account?
<P>
	Does the minister realize that-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. opposition member 
said we had acknowledged that are flaws in the system. What our 
government acknowledges, and the Prime Minister referred to it 
this morning, is having had the courage to carry out a 
comprehensive reform, reviewing the entire unemployment 
insurance system, which was so dear to the hearts of our friends 
opposite but which no longer met the needs of the people on the 
modern job market at all.
<P>
	What this government has always maintained, as did two of my 
predecessors at Human Resources Development Canada and as I 
myself have done since my appointment as the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, is that we will closely monitor the 
transition to the new employment insurance system and, if 
adjustments are required here and there, we are prepared to make 
them in order to improve service to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
people living on $35 a week instead of $121. I have another 
question on the same subject for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	What does the minister have to say to Benoît, who, after 
accumulating 450 hours of work over 10 weeks in 1996, is eligible 
for employment insurance benefits because the transitional 
measures the minister introduced along the way penalize workers 
who fulfilled the conditions of the law in 1996?
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to soften the transitional measures to 
ensure that anyone who worked more than 35 hours per week in 
1996 will not be penalized as is currently the case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with the transitional measures, 
the government decided in favour of the person who worked the 
last 26 weeks in 1996. At the time, employers had no system to 
determine if the hours of work had actually been completed and we 
operated on the assumption that every week claimed, whether or 
not 35 hours of work were actually performed, was a 35-hour week. 
We are doing claimants a favour, giving them the benefit of the 
doubt. This way, 22 hours become 35 hours.
<P>
	As for those who may have worked 50 hours, what the 
opposition is requesting for them did not exist under the  former 
system, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8088"> 8088 </A></B>
<P>
because these hours were not insured under the system. There were 
only 35 insurable hours per week.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the defence minister's decision to shut down the Somalia inquiry 
prevents investigation of allegations of high level cover-up in the 
defence department.
<P>
	What this means is the minister is letting the lower ranks take the 
fall, while senior brass, bureaucrats and maybe even politicians get 
off scot free.
<P>
	Why is the minister refusing to hold high level officials 
accountable for trying to cover up the events surrounding the 
torture death of a Somali teenager?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member, as I have said often in the House, has had a distinguished 
career over many years in the Canadian forces.
<P>
	I simply want to say through you, Mr. Speaker, to the member 
who has put the question that surely, as was the case yesterday in 
committee, hon. members are not going to stand in the House or 
use opportunities elsewhere to tarnish the reputation of all the men 
and women who serve in the senior echelons of the Canadian 
forces.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	Everyone recognizes that mistakes were made and some very 
heavy prices were paid by people at the very senior levels of the 
Canadian forces. There have been significant changes in the upper 
echelons of the Canadian forces and the Department of National 
Defence.
<P>
	Surely the hon. member and some of his colleagues who have 
served in the Canadian forces understand that to continue to pursue 
this denigration of men and women who have made a commitment 
to Canada and the Canadian forces and who have served in the most 
distinguished and honourable ways not only in Canada but around 
the world cannot continue.
<P>
	Surely the hon. member after his distinguished service has a few 
shreds of decency left in him and-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I hope that all hon. members will use some 
restraint. I know we are all under some pressure in here. I appeal to 
hon. members. Questions should deal with administrative 
responsibility and members should refrain from attacking each 
other personally. That would be the better way to proceed and I 
would urge you to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have some understanding of how military people react when they 
see blatant unfairness in the system that is dealing with them.
<P>
	The minister's response does not change the fact that Shidane 
Arone was beaten, tortured and murdered. Then there was an 
attempted cover-up at national defence headquarters. By shutting 
down the inquiry the government is trying to cover up the cover-up. 
Why is the minister so willing to let senior officers, bureaucrats 
and politicians go uninvestigated? What is the minister afraid of?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to be absolutely 
honest, what I am afraid of is that the hon. gentleman and his 
colleagues will continue for the next two or three years with this 
absolutely unacceptable kind of approach.
<P>
	They try to paint everybody in the armed forces as being 
involved in cover-ups, involved in mismanagement and involved in 
the kinds of activities to which the hon. member and his colleagues 
keep alluding without ever once taking into account the fact that 
the vast majority of men and women in the Canadian forces at 
every level do their jobs well and honourably.
<P>
	If the hon. member really believes the Canadian forces deserve 
to be supported, he should be among the very first to stand up and 
to recognize that. I know he goes on to the bases. I hope he and his 
colleagues continue to avail themselves of the opportunity to go out 
and meet with the men and women of the Canadian forces at all 
ranks. I hope they try to get a grip on what is really going on there 
instead of continuing to try to exploit a political situation, where I 
say to my hon. friend, you are going down the tubes.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Yesterday, we witnessed a first in Canadian history. The 
chairman of an inquiry accused the government of political 
interference and clearly indicated he cannot hear all the witnesses, 
as the government is misleadingly suggesting. The minister can no 
longer provide meaningless answers, which are just a smoke screen 
used because an election is in the not too distant future.
<P>
	How can the minister still deny that the true reason why his 
government wants to end the inquiry's mandate is because the 
inquiry was about to question senior public servants and top 
military officials about their involvement is this coverup?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8089"> 8089 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I cannot 
presume, as does the hon. member, that the inquiry was about to 
question anyone in particular. Indeed, the inquiry has always 
decided who it would call to testify and how it would proceed.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	I made reference to a document sent to Privy Council by the 
inquiry, in which it is said that the commissioners' preferred 
scenario would have been for the Somalia inquiry to continue until 
the end of May 1998, with the report being completed only by the 
end of that same year.
<P>
	It would be pure speculation on my part to try to guess who was 
going to be called to testify, given that, in a two-year period, the 
inquiry heard over 100 witnesses and apparently did not see fit to 
call those whom the hon. member thinks it should have heard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister's answer is close to demagoguery. He is well aware that, if 
the inquiry was not able to hear all the witnesses, it is because of 
the delays, the problems created by his department and the army's 
top brass, who never co-operated with the inquiry, who did 
everything possible to interfere with it, and who never gave it the 
required support.
<P>
	The minister is a man of experience and he knows full well that, 
the higher you go, the closer you get to the government. Are we to 
understand that, if the government interfered in such an 
unprecedented manner to put an end to the inquiry, it is because the 
Prime Minister and the minister felt the commissioners were 
getting dangerously close to their government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as is often the 
case in the House, I will certainly give the benefit of the doubt to 
the hon. member. It is not the first time that we put an end to a 
inquiry's mandate, even though I know it takes time to conduct an 
inquiry and to find out what happened.
<P>
	As I said, it is not the first time, but we will let the hon. member 
get away with his erroneous statement, because I know he did not 
make it in bad faith. He simply does not know any better.
<P>
	But, to answer his question, nothing prevented the 
commissioners from setting up their own agenda. While there may 
have been delays in providing information, nothing prevented the 
inquiry from calling on any witness to answer questions.
<P>
	Let us not forget that the mandate of the Somalia inquiry was 
extended three times. The last time, the inquiry even told the 
government it would table its report before the end of June. We 
agreed three times. Now that we say it is time to complete the job, 
the hon. member  calls it political interference. It is fine when we 
say yes, but it becomes political interference when we say no.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
defence minister said the Somalia commissioners should not have 
accepted the job if they could not get the job done. Yet it was his 
government that allowed the shredding of documents, lying to the 
military police-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> If I understood the hon. member correctly he used 
the word lying. I would like him to withdraw that word now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw that word.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to please put his 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes. It was under the watch of this 
government that these incidents took place: the shredding of 
documents, the misleading of military police. My question is 
directed to the Minister of National Defence. What are the Liberals 
trying to hide?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure my 
hon. friend that if I was trying to hide something from the hon. 
member and his friends, it would not be nearly as difficult as 
putting a needle in a haystack because I do not think they could find 
anything that was right in front of their very noses.
<P>
	The hon. member raises this question and says that the alleged 
shredding took place under the watch of this government. The 
shredding that allegedly took place which was referred to by the 
former prime minister took place while that person was minister of 
national defence.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	The incidents in Somalia and much of what the hon. member 
alludes to happened while a previous administration was in charge 
of the affairs of the country. But we are not going to slough that off. 
Maybe the hon. member thinks that I am spending my time in the 
House and working as the Minister of National Defence to protect 
members of a previous administration or people who have gone on 
to other walks of life.
<P>
	What the government is trying to do is to clean up a mess, one of 
many, that occurred while the previous administration was still in 
power. We have not been perfect in getting it done. I would agree to 
that. But it is a long way from the total lack of understanding and 
comprehension of the events and the facts that the hon. member 
and his colleagues so abominably display in here nearly every day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, shutting 
down the inquiry at this stage is like shutting down a court case 
before all the evidence is in and asking the judge to render a 
verdict.

<P>
	The Somalia commissioners stated publicly that they have 
completed some 90 per cent of their work with only 10 per cent 
left to go. Whatever that percentage is, it involves the high level 
cover-up and whitewash of the murder of the Somalia teenager. 
The Liberals have slammed the door on the inquiry just when it 
was getting to their friends, the bureaucrats and cabinet ministers.
<P>
	With only 10 per cent of the work left to be done, who is the 
defence minister trying to protect?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we will 
have to do, I guess, is draw pictures to make sure that the hon. 
member and his colleagues will have some understanding of what 
is going on.
<P>
	I have on two occasions during question period referred to a 
document provided by the commissioners last fall, in 1996-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Table it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> I have not got the pictures drawn yet, so I will not 
table it until I can make sure they can understand it.
<P>
	The document says that the most desirable or optimum scenario 
would result in the completion of hearings by May 1998, followed 
by a four to six month period thereafter for the production of the 
final report.
<P>
	We are just coming up to two years. Even the hon. member can 
do this. There are 12 months in a year, there are 52 weeks in a year 
and so forth. He would probably understand that, even on the basis 
of the document provided by the commissioners, it is not 10 per 
cent of the work that remains to be done, they are barely half way 
through it. That is what the hon. member does not understand.
<P>
	We are not interested in a historical document. We want to be 
able to deal with the real problems and challenges facing the 
Canadian forces today, not in the year 2000.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has always defended itself by saying that the events 
and the revelations brought to light by the Somalia inquiry took 
place under the Conservatives. As the inquiry moves along, 
however, it is focussing more and more on the more recent role of 
senior Armed Forces staff and senior officers in this matter. And 
that it what is bothering the Liberals.
<P>
	Since we now know that the inquiry wanted to get to the bottom 
of the cover-ups that went on in 1995 and 1996, are we to assume 
that the Minister of Defence put an end to the Somalia inquiry 
because it was starting to get interested in what happened under the 
Liberal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker. The reason 
behind the government's decision is that, after three extensions to 
the mandate, the time had come to ask the commission of inquiry to 
produce its recommendations and conclusions.
<P>
	We felt that an inquiryt created in March 1995, which had been 
given an initial mandate to finish up by the end of December 1995, 
and had been given one extension and then another, ought at some 
point to terminate its activities.
<P>
	It was very important to the Canadian forces, and Canada as a 
whole, to ensure that lessons be learned from what we found out in 
Somalia, what happened before we went to Somalia, the incidents 
that occurred there, what was done after that-and everyone agrees 
that this was not acceptable-and to ensure that steps are taken 
promptly to change the behaviour of the Canadian forces as well as 
the way the bureaucracy reacts under such circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	If the hon. member is interested in having an inquiry that was 
going to run for another four, five or six years, that could be 
interesting from a historical point of view, but it would be of very, 
very little value from a practical one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we 
have always asked the government for was a reasonable time 
frame.
<P>
	The Somalia inquiry will go down in history as an unfinished 
investigation. The intention was to get to the bottom of the matter 
in order to rebuild the Canadian forces. We will have failed to do 
so.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister speak of the integrity of his 
government, when that same government is putting an end to the 
Somalia inquiry when it started to get too interested in the actions 
of his government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have always 
had great confidence in the judgment and fairmindedness of the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	I believe that most people will agree with me that, when 
reference is made to integrity, especially in recent days, there is 
nothing the Bloc Quebecois can teach us.

before the next federal election.

obviously is very much out of touch.
<P>
	Most Canadians understand and deplore what happened in 
Somalia that has led to all of this problem. What we are particularly 
concerned about and I believe what Canadians are concerned about 
is that as intolerable as these incidents may be there is always the 
possibility in the kind of environment that military organizations 
function that terrible situations will occur.
<P>
	We are aware that the organization and institution did not 
respond adequately. That is why by March 15 and by the end of

lengths to review the military justice system and the capability of

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, we 
are discussing the motion presented by the hon. member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke, asking the House to condemn the 
transportation policies adopted by this government. ``Condemn'' 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8093"> 8093 </A></B>
<P>
may be a big word, but we can at least censure or severely criticize 
the policies of  the federal Department of Transport. It is a pleasure 
to realize I will command the attention of the Minister of Transport 
himself, who is across the way from me.
<P>
	Before question period, I touched on two subjects, and I have 
two left. They specifically concern the people in my riding as well 
as railway transportation.
<P>
	I will illustrate the bankruptcy of the Liberal government's 
transportation policy, using examples that occurred in my riding, 
and I will start with the loss of jobs. My riding has a major railway 
centre called Charny. In fact, the name was selected to underline 
this community's strategic location as a railway crossroads.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Over the past three years, CN's privatization and cuts have 
meant the loss of 100 out of a total of 500 jobs and the closing of 
one of the three railroad infrastructure repair shops. After we 
bombarded the Minister of Transport with questions in the House 
and he spoke to the media, we showed that the number of rail 
accidents had increased using statistics provided by the office of 
railway safety of Transport Canada and the department's own 
figures. The CN agreed to keep the Joffre shop open, but in a 
different way: by selling it to an Ontario company, CLN.
<P>
	Thanks to the concerted action of the people of the community, 
to the interest generated by the media and to pressure on the 
government and CN, we kept 30 people employed fixing tracks, 
which are in ever worse shape because of a lack of resources. And 
now, the resources to maintain them are being cut.
<P>
	The rehabilitation of the central Quebec rail line, which could 
have linked Quebec City with the south, is very important to us and 
to the member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. The economy 
flows increasingly north-south, and it would be worthwhile 
rehabilitating this line. However, without the help of higher levels 
of government, including the federal government, it will be hard to 
fix what is broken.
<P>
	Rail lines are being dismantled and abandoned. I would like to 
ask the minister some questions, but Oral Question Period is over. 
In my riding, there is an intermodal station in Lévis, which was 
renovated in 1986 at a cost of $3 million. Today, CN has sought 
permission to abandon the line along the St. Lawrence. However, 
instead of using this line, Via Rail asked for permission to back the 
train from the maritimes up a distance of three kilometres over the 
Quebec bridge and then, once the train reaches Charny, it would be 
backed up again as far as the Ste-Foy station. Meanwhile, they 
abandon a station that remains in good condition.
<P>
	I could go on. These are incredible measures since Via Rail, a 
Crown corporation, is considering abandoning a station on which 
$3 million was spent in favour of a new one that could cost 
$800,000 or more, because the figure does not include the land. 
This decision should  have been made two years ago. However, on 
February 22, when a decision is to be made, Via will recommend to 
the Minister of Transport this sort of mumbo jumbo of backing up 
the train.
<P>
	I know people in Charny who are railroad experts. They have 
told me this makes no sense. Do you know that, up to a year ago, an 
employee caught backing a train up more than 300 metres was 
liable to a warning, which in certain instances could lead to 
suspension?
<P>
	And now freight trains, not passenger trains, would be backed up 
over the Quebec bridge, for which we managed to extract a bit of 
money from the federal government for renovation work and which 
remains the symbol of the decrepit state of federalism in the 
Quebec City region.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Fortunately, after many efforts by the opposition and by the 
coalition to save the Quebec bridge, we were finally successful. 
But the energy required to convince this government to do the right 
thing is unbelievable.
<P>
	I am very short of time. Ten minutes is not enough. I have two 
minutes left to speak to marine policy. All the Liberal candidates 
promised there would be something for the Magdalen Islands ferry 
built by MIL Davie. Two years later, they are still bandying around 
the idea of refurbishing the old ferry still in service.
<P>
	A summit was promised on future marine policy. Nothing has 
been done. No policy, no summit, nothing. Not a cent has been 
spent on defence industry conversion, because MIL Davie was a 
business that primarily handled national defence contracts. The 
federal government has not spent a cent on this business, on marine 
construction. It is obscene, and with the election approaching I 
would not let the Prime Minister or his ministers take credit for the 
wonderful things they have accomplished in the area of 
transportation. Yes, the member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke is 
right to criticize this government for its failure to act in the area of 
transportation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with your 
permission, I would like to ask my colleague to expand on what he 
intended to tell us earlier, with further details on the way the 
transportation sector was managed, especially in his own Quebec 
City, since he was about to do so when you signalled that his time 
had expired. I would like to give him this opportunity to fill us in 
on the missing details.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
Joliette for his interest in the matter. I am appalled to see that the 
transportation sector does not seem to be very popular. Frankly, it 
is Thursday afternoon, and many members are in a hurry to leave. 
Unfortunately, it means that a member of my own party has to ask 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8094"> 8094 </A></B>
<P>
the questions. That is a pity. This is a very  important subject, and I 
thank the hon. member for Joliette for his question.
<P>
	Before the Liberals took office, in the marine sector, under the 
Conservative government, if we compare spending on marine 
construction in the maritimes and Quebec, the ratio was 13 to 1, 
with 1 for Quebec. Of course there was Hibernia. But since the 
Liberals came to power, not a red cent has been spent by the federal 
government or the Department of Transport on marine 
construction. Not one penny.
<P>
	There is a connection with the defence industry, because marine 
construction is marine transportation, but also includes ships 
ordered by the Department of National Defence. One example is 
the <I>Preserver</I>, a supply ship. Two shipyards submitted tenders: 
Lévis and Halifax. There was a difference, but since this was for 
repairs, the difference was in the Halifax shipyard's favour.
<P>
	We asked to see the tenders. We asked the minister and the 
government but never received a reply, as usual. We used the 
Access of Information Act and found that 85 per cent of the 435 
pages submitted by the bidder had been blacked out, as we saw in 
the Somalia affair. There was no way to find out the hourly rate or 
salary. This is an important point.
<P>
	When we are talking about refitting a ship, we know that it 
always costs at least twice as much as expected. There are always 
some surprises. There is a clause called ``open and expect''. This 
clause is variable, and it is very important to know the salary, the 
hourly rate for overtime and how it will be done. So there was no 
way to get that information.
<P>
	The only way to get the information, allowing of course for the 
lag after the election, is that once the job is finished, the public 
accounts committee headed by the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, will be able to have access, 
but only once the invoices are in, which means in about a year and a 
half or two years.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Until then, there is a total blackout on any information 
concerning the <I>Preserver</I>. Other than that, there is nothing on ship 
construction.
<P>
	In the area of transportation, let us add the changes to the Coast 
Guard. This is a plan the government has found to divide its 
strengths. The Coast Guard, once the responsibility of the Minister 
of Transport, now reports to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	In the St. Lawrence Seaway, they want to start charging for ice 
breaking, and they already charge for navigational aids. Step one: 
$20 million more. These charges apply to ships that put in at 
Canadian ports. But a ship that travelled all the way down the St. 
Lawrence Seaway to the United States without ever putting in at a 
Canadian port would not pay a cent for those same  services. Yet we 
know that the Seaway is operating at a deficit. Because the ship 
does not put in at either a Quebec port or one on the Great Lakes, it 
would not pay a cent.
<P>
	The government's inertia on shipping is scandalous, yet this may 
be the most economical means of moving freight. What is missing 
at the moment in Canada is an integrated view of all means of 
transportation, a national view of transportation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise in this House to explain 
the government's policy in the area of transport. It certainly seems 
necessary in light of the comments I heard. I am surprised to see 
that the opposition members do not really understand what the 
transport policy is all about. They do not appreciate the details and 
how transportation is Canada's lifeline.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Many hon. members this side of the House have eloquently 
explained today many aspects of the government's position. I 
would particularly like to pay tribute to my parliamentary secretary 
from Hamilton. He has done such an outstanding job with the 
legislation and in the debate we have just had in putting forward the 
reasoning behind many of the decisions on transportation. His 
service in the House and on the committee has been outstanding. 
He has explained in great deal and with great eloquence the 
progress that has been made in the House and by the government as 
a whole outside the House in modernizing the transportation 
system in Canada.
<P>
	When we took office three years ago we were confronted with 
very serious problems in the transportation area. We had a 
transportation system that was overbuilt, over-regulated and 
oversubsidized. It was a system that despite previous successes of 
which there have been many was degenerating to the point where it 
could become a damaging factor to Canada's economic 
competitiveness and international trade.
<P>
	As a result of a far-reaching modernization program which is 
under way we now have very beneficial effects in the tourism trade 
and in the job creation area in the transportation field.
<P>
	The government is basically moving out of operations in the 
transportation sector which will allow us to focus on the proper 
role, that of policy making and safety regulation. At the 
government level, now that we are out of operations and the detail 
they led to, we can look at a bigger picture which for me means 
maximizing the benefits of a modernized transportation for 
Canadians. The benefits can be found in three key areas and our 
transport system is geared toward these three objectives.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8095"> 8095 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	First, we need to use our modernized transportation system to 
improve our competitiveness in international trade. Second, we 
need to make sure that our transportation system boosts tourism in 
Canada. Third, a major interest of the government is using our 
transportation system to increase and strengthen our links with the 
Asia Pacific region.
<P>
	By the end of this century, if I could spend just a moment on the 
last point, the Asia Pacific region may well be home to 60 per cent 
of the world's population, 50 per cent of global production and 40 
per cent of world trade.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister has said many times, the Asia Pacific 
region is important to Canada and Canada is a Pacific nation. This 
means there are real opportunities for the whole country but 
particularly in western Canada and in my home province of British 
Columbia, our gateway to the Pacific region.
<P>
	We must improve the effectiveness of this gateway and 
maximize the advantages to Canada of this geographic opportunity. 
That and the other two objectives I outlined a moment ago work 
toward the overarching goal of the government of job creation for 
Canadians.
<P>
	I will quickly go over the progress in these areas. We have taken 
major strides in modernizing the transportation system. In the air 
transportation sector, for example, we are commercializing 
Canada's federal airports. Under the national airports policy 
announced in June 1994 we have begun leasing Canada's largest 
and busiest airports to local control. This policy has been very 
successful and has been embraced by communities right across the 
country that recognize the economic potential of their areas 
depends upon their maximizing the advantages their airports 
present and in turn having those airports best serve the 
requirements of their local communities and economies.
<P>
	To date 17 regional local airports have been transferred to local 
control and some 40 others are in the process of being transferred. 
Under the same policy 11 small airports have been placed under 
local control and a further 23 are in the process of being transferred 
to the local community.
<P>
	I found interesting-and I listened with great care-the 
comments of the opposition with respect to Pearson airport. Thanks 
to the government's airport policy this airport is now like the other 
major airports of this country: Montreal, Vancouver, Edmonton, 
Calgary and others. Thanks to that policy Pearson is now managed 
by a local not for profit corporation representing local interests of 
the greater Toronto area.
<P>
	The Greater Toronto Airport Authority which now runs Pearson 
recently announced plans to invest $2 billion in upgrading the 
airport. This will, in turn, turn that airport into the premier gateway 
for the European traffic of the whole of the central heartland of 
North America.
<P>
	I certainly applaud the vision of the airport authority and the 
energy with which it is applying itself to achieving that goal. I 
might point out that the investment it has proposed is substantially 
higher than that which was originally proposed by other airport 
management groups in the past.
<P>
	In addition, we have transferred the air navigation system of 
Canada to Nav Canada, another not for profit corporation. This 
transaction put $1.5 billion into the federal treasury to reduce the 
deficit in that year and the debt as well. Safety will continue to be 
monitored by Transport Canada. That will be the highest priority of 
Nav Canada.
<P>
	Two years ago we signed an agreement with the United States 
known as Open Skies which created a whole new area of 
opportunity for transboundary traffic. It was part of our new 
liberalized air transportation policy that the airlines themselves 
could choose what cities they would fly between, at what price, at 
what frequency and at what times. The benefits of open skies have 
been enormous. In the 14 months following that agreement there 
was a greater increase in traffic with the United States than in the 
previous six years.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The agreement has created well over 100 new links between 
American and Canadian cities. Let me point out it is not just 
between major airports, but also smaller airports, smaller 
communities. Cities in the 100,000 to 250,000 population range 
also are getting the direct links. Indeed some cities that are smaller 
than that are having direct links established with American cities to 
the south of the border.
<P>
	Vancouver and Toronto in particular have benefited 
tremendously from open skies and the open market that exists now 
in transborder air travel. Of course, hundreds of thousands, 
millions of Canadian travellers have benefited as well.
<P>
	Let us not forget that when I talk of airports, when I talk of 
airlines, when I talk of rail, when I talk of ships, when I talk of any 
transportation mode or system, I am talking about the consumer, 
the user who takes advantage of those systems. That is what the 
systems are for and why it is so important that they be efficient.
<P>
	Let me quickly point out that other areas of air travel have come 
along. I should mention Greyhound which is now flying in Canada 
and provides low cost travel between Vancouver and Ottawa. That 
was an innovative proposal put forward by Greyhound and its 
partner Kelowna Flightcraft Air Charter Ltd. This has expanded 
travel options and has reduced costs for Canadian travellers 
throughout the year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8096"> 8096 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to marine transportation, let me say a quick word 
about Marine Atlantic. Marine Atlantic is having its subsidies 
reduced year by year. What was previously an organization which 
took very large amounts of taxpayers' money is becoming leaner 
and a great deal more efficient. It is providing equally effective 
service as it did in the past.
<P>
	We have taken the strides to modernize the marine sector. I 
would point out the Canada Marine Act was in this House not so 
long ago, in fact last year. The Canada Marine Act will implement 
this country's new marine policy. The policy which was announced 
in December 1995 calls for the modernization of the marine 
management and regulatory regime, less red tape and greater 
efficiency and effectiveness in the marine transportation sector.
<P>
	It will bring local control, local decision making and private 
sector involvement to Canada's ports. It is much the same approach 
as we have taken in the air sector.
<P>
	The policy calls for commercialization of the operations of the 
St. Lawrence Seaway. In July last year Transport Canada signed a 
letter of intent with a group representing the St. Lawrence 
Seaway's major shippers and carriers. The goal is to establish a not 
for profit corporation which will operate the seaway more 
efficiently than the current system. Decisions with respect to the 
seaway will be made at a level which is more appropriate, namely 
the users of the seaway, the people who are affected by the 
operations and the efficiency of the operations and obviously the 
costs that are charged for use of the seaway itself.
<P>
	On a separate track I should add we are also in touch with the 
Americans. We are creating a more efficient binational 
co-ordination group to manage seaway problems which are of a 
binational nature. It is my belief that working together Canada and 
the U.S. can better co-ordinate seaway management, reduce the 
duplication of facilities and ultimately save both countries, not to 
mention seaway users, substantial amounts of money.
<P>
	The marine policy calls ultimately for the modernization of 
marine pilotage and the commercialization of ferry services.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	I mentioned the bill was in the House. I trust it will be back in the 
House very soon so we can all proceed with it. As there are 
members of the opposition here, I will say that I really appreciate 
the work they did at the committee stage.
<P>
	There were two committee stages for the bill, once before the 
bill was put in and once after the bill was before them. They 
worked hard. The ultimate report was unanimous, which shows that 
we had very good co-operative spirit, which sometimes people 
watching on television what goes on in this House do not fully 
understand. At the committee level, my friends in the Bloc and in 
Reform get together with friends from this side of the House and 
work effectively in the interests of improving legislation.
<P>
	I pay tribute to the opposition members who took part 
co-operatively, constructively and effectively. When the bill finally 
comes back and members see it, they will see that the suggestions 
they have made have been given full consideration in the final 
writing of the legislation.
<P>
	I will turn to rail transportation. We must have port activity 
co-ordinated with transportation that reaches beyond our country's 
waterways. That means grain transportation in particular, which is 
often handled by both rail and marine modes of transportation. One 
reason our government is working so hard to ensure the rail sector 
becomes more efficient is our concern over the impact of rail costs 
on bulk users such as those dealing with grain, potash and many 
other commodities.
<P>
	The new Canada Transportation Act brought in last year gives 
railways the flexibility to compete by reducing costly excessive 
regulation and red tape. The new act cuts the number of railway 
actions or decisions that require government approval from 200 
down to 40. I am not happy with having 40 still on the list. I would 
prefer to have that number come down even further. Such reduction 
in red tape, bureaucracy and delay will benefit not only the 
railways themselves but obviously their customers through lower 
rail rates.
<P>
	We will again be looking at regulation in the railways in the year 
1999. It is scheduled to take place at that time. Once again I expect 
we will have a valuable discussion on that in the light of the 
experience we have gained since the introduction of the new 
transportation act last year.
<P>
	The new act shifts the focus from rail line abandonment, which 
we had in the past, toward the development of a healthy shortline 
industry. It is not generally known that Canada has some 31 
functioning railroads, not just the big two that we hear about. Many 
of those 31 are small railroads established as a result of a group of 
local people taking over a line that was abandoned by the majors 
because with their cost structures it was no longer economic to run 
it.
<P>
	Canadian National Railways is now a private and dynamic 
company. I believe it has the tools it needs to compete. Putting CN 
in the private sector was a very important step in our plan for 
modernizing rail transportation. It puts CP and CN, the two major 
systems, on a level playing field. Most important, it subjects CN to 
the discipline of the marketplace.
<P>
	This will help ensure, and I think it will guarantee the survival of 
the railway. The gross proceeds of the sale of the shares has 
brought the Canadian taxpayers a little more than $2 billion. It has 
similarly reduced the debt and deficit as was the case with the Nav 
Canada sale.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8097"> 8097 </A></B>
<P>
	Much has been made today by my hon. friends opposite about 
subsidies. I do believe they should check the record of the 
government over the last three years. Since coming to office we 
have eliminated close to $700 million in subsidies to the 
transportation sector.
<P>
	As my parliamentary secretary, the member for Hamilton West, 
so ably pointed out in response to questions and in his presentation 
to the House this morning, VIA Rail will see its annual subsidy 
chopped virtually in half by fiscal year 1997-98. I might add, that is 
substantially less than it was a few years before.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	With respect to VIA Rail hon. members should know that I have 
examined very carefully VIA Rail's application to expand service 
through the Rocky Mountains. I am well aware of the concerns that 
have been raised about the possibility of VIA Rail competing with 
Rocky Mountain Railtours which is a private sector company.
<P>
	I have listened to and I have read what the members of the 
Standing Committee on Transport have said on the issue. I have 
had discussions with my parliamentary secretary on numerous 
occasions and also with members of the Liberal caucus from 
British Columbia and elsewhere in the country on the subject. I 
might add that I have received hundreds of letters from all parts of 
British Columbia and elsewhere on the subject. I have also met 
with representatives of VIA and of Rocky Mountain Railtours, both 
of whom made excellent presentations, both of whom made 
presentations more than once. I have listened very carefully to all 
points of view and I will be announcing my decision on the matter 
very soon.
<P>
	This country was built by transportation. In the 203 years since 
Alexander Mackenzie first crossed the continent from Montreal to 
the Pacific tidewater, we have built this country on our 
transportation system.
<P>
	Our government has changed the Canadian transportation 
system and it has changed it for the better. But one thing will not 
change. One thing which Transport Canada and myself as the 
minister put above all others is safety. We not only want efficient 
transportation systems in every mode, we not only want systems 
which lock in together in a seamless web, we at every level in every 
area want to assure Canadians that they have the safest 
transportation system that we can provide, the safest that is, within 
all reasonable expectations. That is where we see our role as being 
critical. I can assure all members of the House that safety will 
remain Transport Canada's major objective in the years ahead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister had a 
few good words about the opposition regarding our work on the 
committee. I must say that the current Minister of Transport is 
always very kind and courteous.
<P>
	The fact remains, however, that some situations can be quite 
dire. As you know, I represent the riding of Lévis. It saddens me to 
see a shipyard that once employed up to 3,000 workers, a 
prosperous industry, the leading shipyard in Quebec, stop building 
ships because of a decline in shipping. This decline is the result of 
policies that discourage shipbuilding, the building of a Canadian 
fleet of merchant ships.
<P>
	I know this also concerns the Minister of Industry, but why was 
the promise made in the red book not kept? A Canadian 
shipbuilding summit was to take place in the first year following 
the election of the Liberal Party. Why did it not take place?
<P>
	Why does the government not draw inspiration from American 
policy, the Jones Act for instance, regarding shipping? Why not 
follow the same policies as those of other countries, particularly 
Scandinavian countries, on this subject? Why has the Liberal 
government not done more for shipbuilding? To this day, it has 
done nothing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, regarding shipbuilding, the hon. 
member must realize that the Canadian government has had several 
ships built for the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	After this program, which involved the construction of 12 ships, 
was completed, this government went on to have another 12 ships 
built; these ships were smaller than the big frigates built during the 
1980s.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	We are continuing this program, which, incidentally, comes 
under National Defence and not under Transport Canada, as well as 
programs administered by Industry Canada to ensure a 
shipbuilding capacity is maintained in Canadian shipyards.
<P>
	It is true that we do not have the equivalent of the Jones Act he 
referred to. The Americans themselves are currently considering 
the possibility that the Jones Act may no longer be relevant, that it 
may no longer be useful to them or to the merchant navy.
<P>
	This is a very important issue and I do not think that we can just 
follow the American example; the Americans themselves may well 
feel that exportation costs are too high because of the Jones Act and 
that the time may have come to amend the act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to put a question to the 
minister, specifically with regard to VIA.
<P>
	The minister said he will be coming to a decision soon. I trust he 
has given due consideration to the input he has received and that he 
will make the right decision. In my opinion, that decision is against 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8098"> 8098 </A></B>
<P>
allowing VIA to expand to compete against the very company that 
it sold.
<P>
	The minister mentioned that he had received a tremendous 
amount of input. I have seen much of that input. The only input, I 
believe and understand other than from VIA, which supported this 
application, is from the CTC which is in an incredible conflict of 
interest position.
<P>
	The minister also mentioned that he understands the committee's 
position. I would like the minister to know the position that the 
chair of the committee agreed to with the Reform Party. In a 
message in writing from the chair of the Standing Committee on 
Transport he states: ``As to your suggestion regarding VIA and 
Rocky Mountaineer I have no problem supporting your request''.
<P>
	A follow up to my request in writing to him states: ``that VIA 
Rail not be permitted to expand its service to compete in any way 
against the business it sold to the Great Canadian Railtour 
Company, the Rocky Mountaineer''.
<P>
	In his written response dealing with VIA Rail the chair writes: ``I 
want you to know that I agree with the position that you have 
advanced on this matter and I will support you when it comes up 
for discussion in the final report of transportation, trade and 
tourism. ``Furthermore, I have spoken with-and I will not name 
the member-the parliamentary secretary to the minister who has 
also agreed to support your position as you have stated it''.
<P>
	I have faith in the wisdom of the minister. I know he will do the 
right thing. To decide in VIA's favour would be devastating to 
Rocky Mountaineer, to British Columbia, to the tourism industry in 
British Columbia and most specifically to the town of Kamloops. I 
trust he will make the right decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is very pleasant afternoon. I 
have had kind words from the Bloc and now I have the kinds words 
from the spokesman of the Reform Party who says he has faith in 
the wisdom of the minister and he is certain that I will make the 
right decision. I can assure him that is true, I will make the right 
decision. I will make that announcement very soon.
<P>
	However, I should point out that the chair of the committee, who 
is a very hard working member from Winnipeg South, is not 
necessarily speaking for the minister in communications. We like 
to have free and open discussion in committees, be it my 
parliamentary secretary or the committee chair or member of the 
Liberal caucus who happens to be there. We know that members 
can make up their own minds what they do and how they vote. We 
have a very lose, open system in the Liberal Party, not one that is 
dominated by any authoritarian rules. I would be happy to have a 
discussion  with him face to face rather than through intermediaries 
at any time that he wishes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister in his 
remarks made reference to Bill C-14 as having made it easier to 
develop short line railways. We know quite a number of grain 
dependent subdivisions in western Canada that would make great 
short lines. However, all that Bill C-14 has done is it has expedited 
the ease with which railways can do an abandonment.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I do not see where it has helped with the creation of the short 
line. I would like him to elaborate a little on how short lines will be 
created, how Bill C-14 helps. In particular, could he elaborate on 
how potential buyers of short lines are going to be able to deal with 
the question of successor rights which, right now, is the really big 
stumbling block?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised a very 
good question, namely how has the situation improved.
<P>
	The situation has improved in this way. Previously, before 
abandonment, with the heavy and very complicated mechanisms 
that were laid on the railways, they had to show it was an 
uneconomic route. Once they had showed it was an uneconomic 
route, sometimes we suspect, occasionally on certain lines they 
tried to help to make it look bad, no one was interested in buying 
the short line.
<P>
	With the new system, there is an opportunity of having the route 
given a fair chance of being analysed by some potential buyer, 
being put forward and turned into a functioning railway.
<P>
	The previous system deliberately discouraged the type of 
entrepreneurship of which, I hope, the hon. member's party is in 
favour.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to put a question to 
the minister. Unfortunately, I am not as optimistic as he is 
regarding his government's transportation policy, particularly as 
regards airports.
<P>
	I have a concrete example and I would like to get the minister's 
answer regarding airport transfers, more specifically the transfer of 
the Sherbrooke airport, in my riding, which has been delayed since 
the government implemented its new policy. This transfer is simply 
not taking place, because those who are prepared to take over the 
airport, and who have already taken steps to that end, are asking 
that the facilities be in a reasonable shape. In order for these 
facilities to be in a reasonable shape, they are asking that, before 
giving up its responsibilities, the federal government provide $1 
million in assistance to repair the runway.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8099"> 8099 </A></B>
<P>
	My point is, and I will conclude-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but your time is up. I must 
give the minister time to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true, the pessimists are on the 
other side of the House, and the optimists are here on the 
government side.
<P>
	With respect to small airports, such as the one at Sherbrooke, 
that is what we want to do, to run airports with local input, which is 
very important, local enterprise, and local energy from the people 
on site. That is very important.
<P>
	As for money, we have set aside several tens of millions of 
dollars, approximately $35 million in all, I think, for the transfer of 
airports. Yes, there are times when people from the region, the 
particular city, say that $10 million is needed. The department says 
that is a bit too much, that it can give a lower amount.
<P>
	These are the negotiations we go through for each airport. It 
depends on the condition of the airport, and also on what was spent 
in previous years. Often an airport is in very good condition, and 
the last time any money was spent on it was maybe ten years ago.
<P>
	What is needed is to look closely at each airport, and we must 
have some flexibility in our approach. But I can assure you we have 
transferred several airports.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be dividing my time 
with the member for Comox-Alberni. Unfortunately that will 
only give me 10 minutes to discuss a national transportation system 
in shambles. I will not bother to get into the question of the Pearson 
airport mega-mess or the St. Lawrence pilotage rip-off. Instead I 
will deal with two problems which are of immediate interest in my 
specific riding, Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The most pressing is the sudden, unexpected shutdown of most 
of our branch railway lines. Early this month the two railways 
announced that service would be suspended on almost all branch 
subdivisions in western Canada, including nine in my riding with 
600 miles of track. Actually this was a bit anticlimactic. They said 
that there would be no service for three weeks, with those three 
weeks to expire some time around the end of this month, but 
service had been de facto abandoned on several of these lines for 
three weeks before they had even made the announcement. We 
have rarely seen a train since Christmas time.
<P>
	Right now west coast grain shipments are at their lowest level in 
over a decade. Forty-six ships are sitting at  the west coast waiting 
for grain. They are rolling up huge demurrage charges. Some of 
them have actually been there for a month. It is the farmers, the 
producers of the grain, who are going to have to pay for all those 
demurrage charges which at this point have already reached about 
$15 million.
<P>
	This morning the minister of agriculture admitted that it is unfair 
that farmers have to carry the entire demurrage burden. 
Unfortunately, as is his habit, he did not offer any solution to the 
problem which he had identified. He always gets half way there. He 
says: ``Yes, there is a problem. Yes, we will deal with it'', but when 
an interested party says: ``But Mr. Minister, will you please tell us 
how,'' he suddenly loses his renowned eloquence.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture loves meetings and he loves reports 
which he can ignore if he so chooses but he has little taste for 
constructive action. He is having another soiree tonight in Calgary. 
This will probably result in yet one more stillbirth.
<P>
	What it the problem? That is probably what they are going to try 
to figure out at this meeting tonight. According to the railways the 
problem is that they are short of locomotives. If this is true, I would 
suggest that perhaps usurious provincial and federal taxes and silly 
requirements for locomotives to be depreciated over a 21 year 
period could have something to do with it.
<P>
	However, locomotives can be rented. I understand the CPR has 
rented some. But it was poor planning on the part of both the 
railways and the Canadian Wheat Board that got them into the bind 
that they are in right now. We cannot blame it on the weather. Yes, 
it has been a hard winter. We have a lot of hard winters. They 
should have had their act together months ago and they should be 
sitting panting at the bar ready to go again. But they have 
completely mismanaged the system. That is why 46 ships are 
sitting in Vancouver harbour.
<P>
	It is not just demurrage that the producers are going to lose. They 
are also going to lose about $50 million because of the falling 
markets that they are going to get into by being unable to ship right 
now.
<P>
	A lot of this is due to historic inefficiency. We know that. But 
these historic inefficiencies are not addressed in the new 
amendments to the Railway Act, Bill C-14. There is nothing there 
to prevent this sort of thing. There is no pain or penalty to the 
railways if they do not organize their business and get the grain out 
when the ships are sitting there waiting for it. They get their money 
regardless of when they ship. They could haul that grain a year 
from now and they would still get the full freight rate on it. There is 
no pain, no penalty.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Transport and the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food have referred to short line railways. There is only one 
short line in Saskatchewan  and that is in my riding. It is operated 
as co-op. It does a good job because the producers run the thing 
themselves. They are not stuck with the costs of picking up union 
successor rights from previous operators. But thanks to the 
successor rights it would be difficult, if not impossible, for small 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8100"> 8100 </A></B>
<P>
corporations specializing in the business to operate these 
subdivisions which are now at risk.
<P>
	A few minutes ago when I asked the Minister of Transport about 
this issue he neatly ducked and dodged and did not reply so to date I 
have not had an answer. I do not know what the intention is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> They may not have a plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> My hon. friend says there is no intention, they do 
not have a plan.
<P>
	I would like to shift gears to another problem in my riding and 
that is the deterioration of the national highway system. Members 
opposite beat their breasts about our national obligations to bind 
this nation together. However, when we start talking about the 
national highway system, they retreat behind spurious claims that 
highways are solely a provincial responsibility. That is a red 
herring. Most highways are provincial responsibilities but the 
national highway system is a joint federal-provincial 
responsibility. It is national and I will provide a dictionary for any 
Liberal member who does not know what a national highway 
system is.
<P>
	In my riding of Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia, a 113 
kilometre stretch of the wonderful Trans-Canada highway from 
Gull Lake to the Alberta border is winding and hilly. It has not been 
twinned. Since 1979 that short stretch of road has claimed 31 lives. 
There has not been a year when someone has not been killed on that 
little stretch of road. There have been more than 350 personal 
injuries.
<P>
	I live very close to that highway. I never, unless I have no choice 
in the matter whatsoever, drive it in bad weather or at night because 
it is a death trap.
<P>
	This morning the minister of agriculture made reference to his 
claim that the province of Saskatchewan has never asked to have 
that particular piece of highway twinned. I presume he also meant 
the section from Indian Head to the Manitoba border. That is 
nonsense.
<P>
	In the fall of 1994 the department of highways of Saskatchewan 
had its money on the table to pay its share of the $35 million cost of 
twinning that one little section of highway in my riding and the 
federal government, after saying it would do it, reneged on its 
promise. What else is new?
<P>
	Then the minister of agriculture decided that we should debate 
Saskatchewan highway conditions, not the national system, but 
Saskatchewan. He said that no highway work had been done in 
Saskatchewan since the Liberal government of Ross Thatcher 25 
years ago. I wonder if he ever heard the expression, Thatcher's 
patchers, which is how they referred to the Saskatchewan 
department of highways 25 years ago.
<P>
	Yesterday's committee report confirmed what Canadians already 
know: the Trans-Canada highway system is substandard. The 
government collects billions of dollars in fuel taxes and yet last 
year it could only find $292 million for the entire national highway 
system from sea yea unto shining sea. This is chippy. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am happy that the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia is defending the NDP in Saskatchewan. The 
Reform and the NDP in many ways seem to get along quite nicely.
<P>
	He is decrying the fact that the federal government has spent 
$292 million, or whatever the figure is, on highways. I wonder 
where he would get the money, seeing as the election promise of 
the Reform Party is to cut the deficit to zero in three years. How 
would he come up with more money for highways?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad he asked that question. If 
he would read the fresh start program he would see where we 
would cut $15 billion of unnecessary government spending.
<P>
	To cover the $292 million by a multiple of three, I will give him 
two highly desirable cuts. One would be to stop giving money away 
to Liberal friends like Bombardier. That would amount to $87 
million. The other one would be to privatize the TV portion of the 
CBC. That would amount to at least $700 million. We are already 
over the threshold, so I do not need to get into the entire $15 
billion.
<P>
	As far as me being a defender of the NDP, I am a defender of my 
province, unlike the hon. member opposite who is also from 
Saskatchewan but because he is a member of the Liberal 
government has forgotten it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the hon. member's observations about 46 ships in 
Vancouver harbour running up demurrage charges. We all agree 
that is a very unfortunate situation.
<P>
	I was curious, given his known propensity for privatization and 
for respecting private industry as a way of dealing with these issues 
and his reticence to have subsidies deal with them, exactly what he 
would propose to enable the railways to move the grain faster, 
without giving them a subsidy.
<P>
	He seemed to suggest that the legislation should impose huge 
penalties on the railways, as if they were not already being 
penalized by the fact they are not getting the grain to the harbour. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8101"> 8101 </A></B>
<P>
am sure that if we asked a  railway person they would say that they 
are anxious to move it because they could make more money by 
doing that.
<P>
	What exactly is the member proposing as a concrete solution to 
this problem which would not involve either a subsidy or some 
form of government interference in private industry which he 
generally finds so offensive?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but the railways are not 
paying any penalty. That is the problem. They have a captive 
market. They can haul grain at their leisure, whenever they please. 
They are not going to lose a dime. If that grain does not get hauled 
until the next crop year, which is a possibility, they will still get 
their full tariff. The farmers will lose not only through demurrage 
charges, but also because they will have declining markets as they 
get into the new crop year. They will lose about $50 million in 
revenue as well.
<P>
	If there were contractual arrangements which obliged the 
railways to move the grain according to a specified time, then there 
probably would not be a problem. That would be an incentive for 
them to get their act together.
<P>
	It is a regulated industry. We say it is deregulated, but there is a 
freight cap. It is a semi-deregulated industry.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
bring the House up to speed, the motion we are debating reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its approach to federal 
transportation policies, and in particular, the cancellation of the Pearson airport deal, 
the continued neglect of Canada's national highway system, costly inefficiencies in 
the grain transportation system, and the ongoing subsidization of VIA Rail at the 
expense of taxpayers and private sector passenger rail and bus operators.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My colleagues have dealt in depth with Pearson. I would like to 
deal with some of the areas within the national highway system and 
some of the VIA Rail issues.
<P>
	I do not think we have to travel very far across this country, in 
whatever province we are in, to recognize that the national highway 
system is in a mess. It needs to be addressed but that is not being 
done.
<P>
	I would like to take the time to compare our highways to the 
American model. Anybody who has travelled in the United States 
recognizes that its highway system is excellent. It is superb. Why is 
that? The American system is excellent because they dedicate fuel 
tax revenue to the highway system. I believe that is a notion that 
needs to be looked at because in Canada the fuel tax revenues go 
into a big bin and governments, being governments, tend to draw it 
out. We are now in a huge mess financially because no directions 
are given to the government.
<P>
	If one or two cents per litre of gas was dedicated back into the 
highway system we would get what the driving taxpayers want, 
their taxes going back into the highways that they finance.
<P>
	Another area of concern in British Columbia is the B.C. ferries. 
People have to pay to take the ferry from the mainland to 
Vancouver Island. It is paid for by the B.C. taxpayer and the 
province of British Columbia. The real rub is that people are 
saying: ``This is part of the national highway system''. Highway 1 
goes across to Vancouver Island. It does not even cross Vancouver 
Island, it goes to Victoria whereas the west coast is Tofino. It truly 
is not a Trans-Canada highway because it does not go to the west 
coast. There should be some form of revenue to address British 
Columbia ferries, which is a huge ferry fleet simply because we 
live in a maritime climate.
<P>
	I could go on and on, but I want to leave some of my time to 
address VIA Rail. My colleague has addressed the situation where 
Rocky Mountaineer was sold to a private enterprise company 
which has been extremely successful and is doing very well. What 
is going to happen or potentially happen is that the government, 
through VIA Rail, could go into competition with the very outfit 
that it sold.
<P>
	What have we got? We have a private enterprise that bought a 
business and has done extremely well in turning it around. What is 
the government going to do? It is now going to go into competition 
with it with taxpayers' dollars. That is absolutely wrong.
<P>
	My colleague mentioned that the chair of the Standing 
Committee on Transport agrees with my colleague that the 
government should not be going into competition. He stated that in 
writing. However, the minister, just a few minutes ago, stated that 
the chair for the transport committee does not speak for the 
minister. I find that rather odd because whenever a Reformer says 
something, boy, we speak for all Reformers. However, when it fits 
the government, it says: ``No, this really is not going to fit. The 
fellow was just speaking out of context''. That just does not fit.
<P>
	I hope the minister sees fit to make the right decision. I would 
also like to remind the minister that we are going into an election. 
The transport minister is the key minister for British Columbia. If 
he is going to wander into an election abandoning British 
Columbia, he will pay the political price. I would just like to 
remind him of that.
<P>
	Another area I would like to deal with concerns the Esquimalt 
and Nanaimo Railway in my riding. A little history is required 
here. VIA Rail runs it at the moment but the E and N Railway goes 
back to 1883 when British Columbia was entering Confederation. 
It was part of the Trans-Canada Railway, part of bringing the rail 
head to the west coast.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8102"> 8102 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The original E and N Railway was to go across Seymour 
Narrows and down Vancouver Island to Victoria. That was changed 
and almost caused British Columbia to withdraw from 
Confederation. The terminus was changed from Victoria on 
Vancouver Island to Port Moody on the mainland.
<P>
	Representatives of British Columbia went to Queen Victoria and 
said: ``This is a key issue. If the terminus is going to Port Moody 
we are considering withdrawing from Confederation''. British 
Columbia did stay in but it was a key issue.
<P>
	The E and N Railway was built in 1883 by the Dunsmuir family. 
It went from Victoria to Nanaimo. In 1912 it was extended from 
Nanaimo to Courtenay. The key point is that CPR bought out the E 
and N Railway in 1905.
<P>
	Part of condition of building that railway was huge land grant, 
two million acres of timber and land. To give a rough idea, it is a 
stretch of land about 150 miles long by 30 miles wide. This 
tremendous chunk of ground was deeded to E and N and hence 
CPR.
<P>
	CPR, through VIA, does not run a decent railway on the island. 
Islanders are saying: ``Come on, there is a wonderful potential for 
tourism''. Actually rail freight works fairly well, yet the federal 
government and the British Columbia government do not have the 
political fortitude to pressure CPR to run the service well. CPR 
pops it off on to VIA but the point is that CPR received a huge land 
grant, a fantastic opportunity. It took over a billion dollars worth of 
timber through the years. They have sold through their Marathon 
Reality Agency a fantastic amount of real estate and it loses money. 
It loses $2 million to $3 million a year. That is why it got the land 
grant in the first place. The government must force CPR through 
VIA to run a decent railway.
<P>
	CPR's point of view is that it needs a subsidy, some more money. 
The minister was talking about a VIA subsidy. In my mind not one 
cent of subsidy should be going to the E and N Railway because it 
was dealt with in the land grant. The Supreme Court has said the E 
and N Railway does not constitutionally entrench British 
Columbia, that British Columbia did not enter Confederation as 
part of the railway. That was dealt with by the Supreme Court. It 
was a side issue.
<P>
	The contractual issue still remains. The contractual issue is that 
CPR must run that railway successfully through VIA. Yet the 
government refuses to push CPR. I wonder why it will not do it.
<P>
	I would like to leave some time for questions and comments. 
However the issue my colleague was addressing about the Rocky 
Mountaineer is heated by today's discussions. The minister must 
make the right decision. The government cannot sell off a railway 
to private enterprise and then turn around a few years later  and 
have VIA Rail compete against that private enterprise using 
taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	Therefore I would like to move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by adding immediately after the word ``operators'' 
the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``and most specifically, even considering allowing VIA Rail to re-enter the market 
to compete against the business it sold to the private sector''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The resuming debate will 
be on the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Leeds-Grenville.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today to participate in the opposition day 
debate on federal transportation policies. The government clearly 
outlined the role of the federal government through the 1994 
national airports policy and set itself to ensure provision of a safe, 
efficient, accountable and locally sensitive airport network.
<P>
	The first objective of the national airports policy is to maintain 
the existing high levels of safety at Canadian airports. The first 
order of business of anybody concerned with the air transportation 
industry is safety. The government is accomplishing this by 
focusing on the careful certification of all airports and the 
development of regulations after thorough consultation with the 
industry and by establishing the airports capital assistance program 
to ensure the provision of some capital at the local communities 
that might not otherwise have been able to provide the necessary 
safety infrastructure.
<P>
	The second objective is to ensure the efficiency of the airport 
network across the country. The ability of Canadian business to get 
to market, the need for Canadians to travel the country and the 
accessibility of the transportation network to tourism interests all 
call for an efficient network of airports.
<P>
	The government has accomplished this goal by ensuring the 
operation of the country's larger airports, the national airport 
system, through the operation of Canadian airport authorities; by 
recognizing that the location of smaller airports is more of a 
regional nature and more of a regional matter; and by recognizing 
local and regional governments are better able to make appropriate 
decisions concerning regional and local airports.
<P>
	The federal government is phasing out its operation and subsidy 
of such airports over five years to ensure an orderly transfer of 
responsibility. It has ensured efficiency by establishing annual cost 
reduction targets for every Transport Canada airport for as long as 
they were operated by Transport Canada.
<P>
	Efficiency improvements were required and the national airports 
policy implementation is well along to  achieving its goal of at least 
$100 million in annual savings by the year 2000. In addition, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8103"> 8103 </A></B>
<P>
airport charges are based on local site specific forecasts bringing 
the discipline of user pay user say to the operation of Transport 
Canada operated airports. This has been done over a four-year 
period in a time phased fashion to ensure time for adjustment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The third objective is to get the authorities responsible for 
managing airports to be as accountable as possible for their 
activities. There is some degree of competition between airports, 
whether within Canada or for transborder traffic with the U.S., but 
we all acknowledge that the airports may have a considerable 
monopoly.
<P>
	In Canada, we have chosen not to regulate airport charges, but to 
ensure that the communities are aware of what is being done, via 
organizations with jurisdiction over this, and via good 
administration.
<P>
	My hon. colleague, the Minister of Transport, has adopted a 
broader range of stringent principles of accountability for Canadian 
airport authorities, in order to ensure the transparency of decisions 
taken via appointments to committees, public meetings, 
operational audits and financial reports.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	These changes will be included in current leases when they are 
modified: to ensure that the local authorities responsible have the 
opportunity, first of all, to assume ownership and operation of their 
regional, local or small airport; to support the continuation of 
airport operating committees made up of airport users, as was the 
case with airports operated by Transport Canada in order to ensure 
that local decision makers receive concrete feedback from users.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The fourth objective is to improve the sensitivity of airport 
management to local needs. Decisions made in Ottawa, however 
well intentioned, cannot take the full range of local conditions into 
account. Any responsible government has to look at an airport from 
a transportation perspective. Local communities can incorporate 
tourism objectives or other local priorities. Local communities will 
decide in conjunction with airport users what level of service best 
suits that community.
<P>
	In addition, the federal government has undertaken to ensure a 
provision of airport services to remote communities where the 
federal government has an existing involvement and there are no 
alternative forms of access.
<P>
	We are doing more for airports and the Canadian air 
transportation industry to implement a successful national airports 
policy. Canadian airports will benefit from the new Open Skies 
agreement. Results to date have been as follows.
<P>
	The number of services and the total seat capacity in the 
trans-border market are up substantially. Competition has 
increased and Canadian and U.S. airlines are participating almost 
equally in the growth. Seat capacity has increased faster than traffic 
but this was to be expected in the early development of markets.
<P>
	Business, tourism and trade interests of Canada and the U.S. are 
far better served than they ever were before and the greater activity 
permits more economic development in and around Canadian 
airports. Traffic improvements are not all due to the Open Skies 
with the U.S. Canada's airlines and airports are also benefiting 
from a number of recent successes in the renegotiation of 
international bilateral agreements, that is to say new or amended 
agreements between Canada and Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, 
Korea and China.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians' degree of confidence in the new methods of airport 
administration set out in our national airport policy can be gauged 
by the rate at which communities are taking over administration of 
their airports.
<P>
	The figures speak for themselves. Today, more than 80 per cent 
of Canadian air passengers use airports that have been turned over 
to the community. By the end of 1996, the current government had 
turned over, or was nearly finished the process of turning over, 52 
airports, including the national airports in Toronto, Winnipeg and 
Ottawa, 26 regional and local ones, 12 small ones and 11 Arctic 
airports.
<P>
	By next March, the total will be 75, which represents a vote of 
confidence by numerous Canadian communities. I am sure that the 
process will continue and communities will continue to take over 
administration of their airports.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government prefers that our largest airports be operated by 
not for profit organizations. This approach has proven its worth in 
Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Montreal. These airports are 
pursuing their commercial potential by using innovative financing 
for capital works.
<P>
	The new Vancouver international terminal and runway, the 
improvements to Calgary and its successful management of a high 
rate of growth, the focusing of Edmonton's scheduled traffic at the 
international airport and the improvements to the airports in 
Montreal, all attest to the success of the airport authority model in 
the management of major airports.

<P>
	As the member for Halifax West, I look forward to that kind of 
success once the Halifax international airport has completed its 
negotiations to move to a national airport authority.
<P>
	The national airports policy is a success story of the federal 
government. I am advised as we approach the end of fiscal year 
1996-97 that we are ahead of the track set in 1994 to achieve the 
goal of at least $100 million in annual savings by the year 2000. 
This national airport system continues to play a vital role in the 
growth and development of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was enjoyable hearing the hon. member give us his 
thoughts on the Liberal policies on the national airport program.
<P>
	No doubt the hon. member has heard the word skimming before 
and is well acquainted with the meaning of the word skimming, to 
take something off the top. With regard to the national airport 
program, the program he says is doing so well with these 26 
national airports, is he aware that some of those national airports 
are already financially insolvent? They are financially insolvent 
because of the fee the federal government collects from them. That 
fee structure is based on deemed revenues and deemed profits, not 
what they really make. The government said: ``We will calculate it 
based on this projection and that projection, you will bring in this 
much money and it will in turn give you this much profit and we 
want it''.
<P>
	At least two of the airports, Calgary and I believe Edmonton, are 
already financially insolvent. The hon. member mentioned Halifax. 
Halifax is well aware of this and has hired the same financial 
consultants because they know that this is an absolutely 
unworkable formula.
<P>
	With regional airports, which the hon. member also mentioned, 
there is another form of skimming. I will use my province of 
British Columbia as an example but this problem exists in every 
province. My home airport, Castlegar, feeds six flights a day to 
Vancouver and two flights a day to Calgary. The same thing 
happens throughout my region, at Cranbrook, Penticton, 
Kamloops, Williams Lake and all those other airports. The big 
airport that is part of this national airport plan, Vancouver airport, 
relies on these small airports.
<P>
	In the case of Castlegar the federal government used to spend 
$800,000 a year to operate Castlegar bringing in only $300,000 in 
revenues. The government says: ``We still need the flights coming 
from Castlegar because that is what makes our national airports 
work, but we are not going to give it any funding. We will help it if 
it needs to rebuild a runway or a taxiway, but in the general day to 
day operation of the airport, even though it was costing us 100 per 
cent more than the revenues, we will not give  any money. We will 
phase it out and make it stand on its own''.
<P>
	That is not turning it over to local decision making; that is 
turning over financial burdens. The government should have 
allowed a larger portion of the profits coming from the national 
airports that make huge profits to be put into the regional airports 
on which the national airports rely to supply them with passengers. 
Likewise the federal government has to redo its formula to ensure 
fairness for the national airports so that they can survive and grow 
so that we will have as good a system as the hon. member would 
like to think we now have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, before I go to the substance of these 
questions, it strikes me as fascinating that the Reform Party, the 
party that always calls for faster and deeper cuts and says we are 
not going fast enough in making cuts in government, is the same 
party that when it comes to things in their backyard Reform 
members say: ``Not in my backyard. Make your cuts somewhere 
else, but not in this area''. I have heard this over and over in this 
House. On every topic they say: ``But do not cut here''. If we were 
to add it up we would never cut at all.
<P>
	On the topic of Calgary, if Calgary has problems, the biggest 
problem in Calgary is congestion. It has too much success. It is the 
growth of that airport and the authority is working to meet this 
demand. The government is taking a flexible approach on this.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	One of the problems with Edmonton is that traffic has moved 
from the Edmonton municipal airport to Edmonton International 
Airport. That has changed the circumstances. The federal 
government is working with that authority to deal with the changed 
circumstances and it will change the lease accordingly.
<P>
	It is important to be flexible and to recognize that as things 
change we must change the leases, we must look at the 
circumstances and act accordingly.
<P>
	However, I find it remarkable how the Reform Party is always 
after us to spend, spend, spend, except when it comes time for the 
budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to speak to the opposition motion today. I am going 
to speak to one aspect of the motion, the reference to the national 
highway system. The motion suggests that the government should 
be condemned for its continued neglect of Canada's national 
highway system.
<P>
	Yesterday the Standing Committee on Transport tabled a report 
in the House which made several recommendations for the federal 
government to consider with respect to the renewal of our national 
highway system. It is a coincidence that we were talking about  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8105"> 8105 </A></B>
<P>
those recommendations yesterday and today the third party is 
condemning us for not taking any action.
<P>
	I want to congratulate my colleagues on the transport committee 
for coming forth with the recommendations in the report. Indeed, I 
want to congratulate the hon. member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke. He is a well valued member of the transport 
committee. I have enjoyed working with him under the 
chairmanship of the hon. member for Winnipeg South.
<P>
	When the Minister of Transport met in Charlottetown last 
October with the provincial transport ministers, he received 
unanimous support for the idea that the federal government would 
participate in a study in which all transport ministers would get 
together to see if something could be done to address the 
deteriorating condition of Canada's national highway system. He 
received tremendous support for the idea of moving forward with 
the study. We have been encouraged by the kind of inspiration and 
attitude shown by the provinces.
<P>
	The federal government is concerned with the national highway 
system. It must be adequately maintained and properly expanded to 
meet growing Canadian demands. Trade is associated with a good 
transportation system. The highway system is also important to the 
Canadian tourism industry.
<P>
	The federal government has a long history of supporting the 
provinces and territories in developing the TransCanada highway 
system and other highways. The first federal contribution to 
highways occurred back in 1919. Ever since that time succeeding 
federal governments have provided an uninterrupted level of 
support for highway construction and maintenance.
<P>
	That should not surprise anyone. I believe we are open enough to 
realize the importance of a highway system. It is too important to 
say that it is a provincial matter and therefore we should not 
become involved. That is not the attitude I have sensed in the years 
I have sat on the transport committee. Of course, there is all-party 
participation on that committee.
<P>
	Highway transportation accounts for almost 95 per cent of 
intercity passenger trips and about 75 per cent of all freight that 
moves in this country. That is how important it is to all Canadians. I 
personally think it is too important to be left exclusively to the 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	Most of Canada's interprovincial trade moves by highway, as do 
60 per cent of Canada's exports and 80 per cent of Canada's 
imports. There is no question about the need for a national 
commitment to something that involves our lives to that degree. 
About two-thirds of the 25 million U.S. tourists who come into 
Canada each year use the highways.
<P>
	The federal government already spends a significant amount of 
money on highways with an expenditure of  $292 million on 
highway development under the federal-provincial agreement's 
1996-97 commitment. In addition, approximately $100 million is 
spent each year on federally owned bridges and roads.
<P>
	Within just a few miles of here in the last year the government 
has committed $42 million to construct a highway in which I have 
particular interest since it goes through my riding. It connects the 
nation's capital with the 401, the busiest highway in Canada. I have 
been here for a few years and people may have thought that this is 
all I have been concerned with.
<P>
	Indeed, a good deal of my energy has gone into that project 
because I can see the need for it. I can see the need for the federal 
government to get involved because a good deal of the traffic on 
that highway is there because this is the capital of Canada. Most of 
us would be fairly embarrassed if the old highway were the best we 
could do. Most Canadians would feel very embarrassed if a visitor 
to Canada from another country had to travel on highway 16, which 
hopefully will be highway 416.
<P>
	It is not just a question of congestion. Highway 16 has a horrid 
record. Three weeks ago there was another fatal crash. A father and 
his son were killed. Dozens of people have been killed on that 
highway in the past six years. I am not speaking of that loosely. 
When travelling that highway I have had some personal 
experiences of accidents that have occurred. We speak very often 
of those who were killed. Usually if an accident is serious enough 
to kill people, there will also be injured people.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the federal contribution, it has been clear for 
some time that a massive and focused effort will be required to 
maintain and upgrade the national highway system. Analyses 
conducted by Transport Canada in co-operation with the provinces 
and territories showed that Canada's highway infrastructure is 
aging. It is thought that the age of a highway is 30 years. Over half 
of Canada's major highways are approaching the maximum age 
limit for highways. It is a very serious problem.
<P>
	Highway infrastructure requires increased financial resources to 
maintain them because we have more traffic on our highways now 
than we did 30 years ago. It is no more complicated than that. 
Highway infrastructure is experiencing growing congestion in 
certain parts of our nation. My colleague mentioned in and around 
some of the western cities. My colleague from the Reform Party 
was interested in that aspect of it too. We all know there is more 
volume on our highways today and of course that will reduce the 
age in which the highways can be of service to the Canadian 
people.
<P>
	Despite the identification of highways by several premiers at the 
conference I mentioned earlier, there are still some provinces that 
have not regarded highway construction as a pressing economic 
need. We all have an understanding of the reason for that but we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8106"> 8106 </A></B>
<P>
still think as a nation that all provinces should come together under  
the guise of the federal government to carry on with the massive 
reconstruction of our highways.
<P>
	Someone has said that instead of the weather being the major 
topic of conversation among Canadians, now it is the condition of 
our highways about which we initiate conversations. I believe that 
more and more. Nearly everyone is commenting on the condition 
of Canada's national highway system.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member who introduced the motion before us today 
takes great umbrage with the focus of the standing committee's 
report on private-public partnerships for highway infrastructure. I 
want to draw the attention of the House to the committee's own 
conclusion that there is widespread agreement among the users and 
builders of the highways that we must get into public-private 
financing on a partnership basis if we are ever going to see any real 
and meaningful reconstruction of our national highway system.
<P>
	It is not my recollection that the transportation committee in its 
investigation of the relationship that existed between 
transportation, trade and tourism, decided to focus on the 
paramount need to renew the national highway system. I thought 
that was what all committee members agreed to do. Indeed, 
throughout our discussions over the past several months, I thought 
even the member from the third party was on board in relation to 
that.
<P>
	I know my time is coming to a close, but I want to mention that 
there is no more basic, fundamental way, in my view, to reach our 
goal for the future growth of this country than to start immediately 
with the very pressing problems associated with the deteriorating 
conditions of our highways nationally.
<P>
	The government is aware that this will have to be a major 
financial commitment. Although it is largely a provincial matter, 
the government is willing to work with the provinces and others to 
try and correct the network that is in need of immediate attention. It 
is a massive undertaking but we must address the problem. So 
much of our economy depends on an adequate transportation 
system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the words of the hon. member who just spoke. 
I have enjoyed working with him the past three years.
<P>
	I just want to clear up one point. I gather he is under the 
impression that I oppose involving the private sector through 
public-private partnerships. I do not. I think it is a good idea. What 
I objected to specifically are two points.
<P>
	First, the implication that things like shadow tolling are alternate 
funding sources. They are not. There are ways to save money and 
do the job more efficiently at  which I think we should be looking. 
For that aspect of it, I applaud the committee. However, the report 
suggests that it is an alternate source of funds and it is not. It is 
simply a cost efficiency and to imply otherwise is extremely 
misleading.
<P>
	Second, if we are going to involve the private sector obviously 
there has to be trust between the government and the private sector. 
We heard the specific example of highway 401 where the 
builder-operator of the highway said that it was necessary to 
negotiate an agreement with the government that it would not 
upgrade to a freeway standard the other portion of the highway that 
parallels the one the builder-operator built. Otherwise, no one 
would travel on the first one if it was not brought up to full highway 
standard and obviously the company would never recover its 
money. That trust and agreement had to be made as well which is 
understandable.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport went 
into a small tirade but when it was explained to him he understood 
the wisdom of it and withdrew his objection.
<P>
	My concern is with the deal that appears to be coming up with 
Rocky Mountaineer and VIA Rail. If the government allows VIA to 
go back and compete directly against the very company it sold, it 
sends a bad message to the private sector. I would specifically point 
out that the Canadian Council on Public-Private Partnership, the 
parent organization for that entire movement which is looking to 
build co-operation between the government and the private sector 
wrote the minister and specifically said: ``Please, do not do that 
with VIA Rail because it sends a bad message''. That is the concern 
that I have.
<P>
	The other point is that he said we need to invest more in 
highways. We heard a huge number of witnesses ask for dedicated 
revenues. The federal government spends $292 million but it takes 
in $5 billion from gasoline taxes. Some want dedication of the total 
amount and others said two cents out of ten cents. That is only 20 
per cent. It still allows the government to keep 80 per cent of those 
revenues for other purposes. This money could be put into a 
dedicated revenue fund so there is an absolute commitment for 
long term planning. The funding could not be interfered with.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I would ask for the hon. members' comments. Just before he 
answers because this is such an important issue, I would ask, Mr. 
Speaker, that you seek the unanimous consent of the House to make 
this motion votable.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The House has heard the 
proposal of the hon. member for Comox-Alberni that the motion 
be made votable. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8107"> 8107 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am sorry, there is no 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jordan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend for the 
question. We do need to develop a trust when we are embarking on 
something different. We have dabbled a little bit in the 
private-public way of doing things, particularly with road 
construction.
<P>
	I am pleased, assuming the member speaks for his party, that it 
will support this private-public membership for highway 
construction. If I misunderstood that, I apologize.
<P>
	I have some difficulty with the simplistic way Reform is looking 
at it. The hon. member is saying that two cents a litre is collected as 
a tax on gasoline, why not take the two cents and put it back into 
road construction? However, how far do we want to go?
<P>
	Where would the money for health care be generated if 
everything is designated? What is out there in the marketplace that 
is generating money which could be designated to health or 
education? That is the difficulty with the argument. I heard it when 
we travelled with the committee. It sounds like a very simplistic 
way of doing it but there is nothing wrong with that if it would 
work.
<P>
	The difficulty I have is projecting it a bit and asking how far we 
want to go with it. Do we want every dollar collected by the 
government to be directed into a specific area? If we do that the 
government's hands would be tied. It would have no money for the 
services Canadians demand and want for which there is no money 
being generated. Would the hon. member propose to use the money 
generated for highways and for no other purpose? This is the 
problem I have with the member's position.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wanted to take part in this debate on the 
Reform motion criticizing the Liberal government for its 
transportation policy, if we can call it that.
<P>
	After listening to the remarks made by the Minister of Transport 
in this debate, I too wanted to say a word or two. I ventured a 
question to the minister, but I will come back to that later, because I 
was not satisfied with his attempted response. The people in my 
region who are interested in airports in the Eastern Townships will 
not be satisfied either.
<P>
	I would like to raise two points. First, I would like to address 
airports, because, to listen to the minister, the Liberal government 
has resolved just about every problem there may have been in that 
area, when the reality is, to say the least, quite different, especially 
nowadays.
<P>
	Just look at what is happening in airports, particularly in 
Montréal, where there is a real farce being played out; this is the 
only way this situation, which has jeopardized  the future of airport 
operations in Montreal and has had a negative impact on all of 
Quebec, can be described.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Where has the Minister of Transport been doing during this 
time? What has the Liberal government been doing about the 
situation in Montreal, with people in the industry quarrelling over 
whether Mirabel or Dorval airport should be maintained? They 
ended up in court, where a judge made a questionable decision 
resulting in delays the magnitude of which we do not know but 
which, I repeat, could have untold negative consequences on the 
future of airports in Montreal.
<P>
	What did the Minister of Transport do? He washed his hands of 
the whole thing. That is the policy of the Minister of Transport and 
the Liberal government on airports. At least, that is what it is in 
Montreal; they are washing their hands of it. So, I wonder how the 
minister can rise in this House and rave about the decisions that he 
and his predecessors made.
<P>
	Let me give you another example of the kind of policy that this 
Liberal government boasts about. The minister's predecessor, who 
is now the defence minister, is known for his ability to casually 
destroy what is in place, as can be witnessed on a daily basis during 
question period and in light of the decisions he has made in every 
sector for which he has been responsible. We can see how the 
former transport minister, namely the current defence minister, did 
not care either about the real impact of his decisions on those 
concerned.
<P>
	Let me give you a specific example which involves the 
Sherbrooke airport. You will remember that, a few years ago, this 
government decided to give up its responsibilities in the airport 
sector, particularly as regards regional and small airports. This 
decision was made primarily to dump the Liberal government's 
deficit on the provincial governments and on regional authorities. 
Not only did this government offload its responsibilities onto 
others, but it did not even bother to make sure the facilities which it 
wanted, and still wants, to get rid of, are in good enough shape to be 
used by those interested in taking them over. This is exactly what is 
happening with the Sherbrooke airport.
<P>
	I raised the matter in the House. I questioned the former 
transport minister and the Secretary of State responsible for 
Regional Development on this issue, and we are still waiting for a 
decision that would ensure the runway is in reasonable shape 
before local authorities take over the Sherbrooke airport.
<P>
	What are local authorities asking for? What is needed to repair 
this runway so that it is adequate? An amount of $1 million is 
necessary. Again, we have been waiting three years for a decision. 
This is the type of policy favoured by this government, which, as 
we have seen in other areas, simply offloads its responsibilities 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8108"> 8108 </A></B>
<P>
onto the  provinces, without looking at the real consequences of 
these decisions.
<P>
	In the case of the Sherbrooke airport, I am convinced we will get 
a positive answer, because an election will soon be held. I am also 
convinced the Secretary of State responsible for Regional 
Development, who is the member for Outremont, will visit the 
regions in the coming weeks, probably right after what will 
certainly be a pre-election budget, to announce that the government 
will give a $1 million subsidy to repair the Sherbrooke airport's 
runway.
<P>
	But why did the government wait for three and a half years to 
make this decision, considering that the stakeholders have had to 
wait all that time before proceeding with other improvements? Let 
the government make its decision.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	This is what is being passed off as policy in the area of 
transportation. In the meantime, while they are refusing minimal 
assistance of $1 million for the Sherbrooke airport, they are going 
to spend millions of dollars on the Montreal fiasco in the hope of 
arriving at a logical, intelligent decision, not to mention the tens, 
even hundreds, of millions of dollars that the Pearson deal will 
cost.
<P>
	We must not forget that, during the 1993 election campaign, the 
present Prime Minister, who was the challenger at the time, 
promised to cancel the contract the Conservatives had struck with 
their friends who had contributed to their campaign coffers and 
who wanted to take over Pearson and make huge profits.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said: ``I am telling you, if you go ahead with 
this deal, we will cancel it after the election''. That is what they 
did, but how did they do it? They did it in such a way as to still be 
able to do everything the Conservatives would have liked to have 
done, which was to benefit their own friends.
<P>
	The Pearson affair is still dragging on through the courts, and we 
are going to find ourselves footing a bill that will easily top 
hundreds of millions of dollars. Here again, I am sure we will not 
learn the results during the election campaign. We will have to 
wait, just as in the case of the events in Somalia, until after the 
election to really find out what went on.
<P>
	In the meantime, the present Minister of Transport is telling us 
that one of the factors in his policy is to recognize that a large 
percentage of trade is towards the Asia-Pacific region, and that rail 
transportation in the direction of the Port of Vancouver must 
therefore be improved.
<P>
	It is obvious that there has been unbelievable growth in the 
Asia-Pacific region. It is even more obvious that the Port of 
Vancouver is located in the Minister of Transport's home province. 
On the eve of an election,  this is the kind of coincidence that can be 
helpful when meeting with future voters, those who will decide 
whether or not to renew his mandate; to go and tell them that all 
funds will be directed towards his province will probably be of help 
in an election campaign.
<P>
	Members will also recall that the former Minister of Transport 
pulled a very similar stunt when he cut the Crow rate for rail 
transportation, literally throwing western farmers not just millions, 
but billions of dollars in compensation. The bill has been estimated 
at something like $3 billion, while an amount of only a few 
hundred millions of dollars has been mentioned for all of eastern 
Canada as compensation for ending the program of transportation 
subsidies. The double standard is obvious.
<P>
	Meanwhile, what is going on with the railways in eastern 
Canada? It is obvious that improvement was called for. For years, 
we have seen CN, a public company, and CP-supposedly private 
one, listed on the stock exchange, but it thumbs its nose at its 
stockholders, or so I would say-both doing everything in their 
power to discredit shipping by rail.
<P>
	How did they do so? They provided their customers with no 
service whatsoever, which eventually gave them the opportunity to 
say that the customers were abandoning shipping by rail in favour 
of shipping by road. Once that finding was made, there was only 
one decision that could be made, of course: to abandon a rail line.
<P>
	I will give you the example of a situation that occurred in my 
riding. When I was told about it, I could hardly believe what I was 
hearing. I had to go there to find out for myself. A lumber business 
in Lac-Mégantic, Industries manufacturières Mégantic, is a major 
purchaser of American wood. Naturally, it used to used the railway 
connection with Maine to get its supplies.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	When its carloads of lumber arrived in Lac-Mégantic, they were 
left at the rail yards and another work crew with an engine, working 
out of Sherbrooke, a hundred kilometres or more from 
Lac-Mégantic, had to come bringing other employees to pick up 
the car or cars that had been left there and take them to the 
company's yard, although this could very well have been done by 
the other train on its route. This was, supposedly, not possible 
because of the collective agreements involved.
<P>
	When they had put up with this for years, with the enormous 
costs it entailed, the tremendous delays, it is not surprising that 
decision makers in the industry took another tack. Anyone would 
have done the same. When we see that a company is not capable of 
giving us the service we expect, we take our business elsewhere.
<P>
	It is crystal clear that the sole purpose of this approach was to 
downgrade railway transportation. Finally, they got much what 
they wanted. Today the network is being  dismantled. We should 
realize that it was our taxes, the taxes of everyone in this country 
which for years helped to finance the development of this railway 
network throughout Quebec. We should also realize that the global 
trend is not toward eliminating but increasing the use of railways 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8109"> 8109 </A></B>
<P>
for the transportation of goods, since people have realized how 
expensive it is to keep trucks on the roads.
<P>
	According to estimates by the Société d'assurance automobile 
du Québec, a single truck did as much damage to the road face as 
24,000 or 28,000 cars. When we consider the hundreds and 
thousands of trucks on our highways, the cost is enormous.
<P>
	Surprisingly, this is the responsibility of the provinces, so here in 
Ottawa, they could not care less how much it costs to maintain our 
highways, since they do not pay for road maintenance. If we really 
wanted a genuine transportation policy, I heard a Reform colleague 
put a question to the Minister of Transport about development of 
networks of SLR or short line railways, which will take the place of 
the companies I mentioned earlier, CN and CP.
<P>
	When we consider that this government came to power three and 
a half years ago and is supposed to have a transportation policy, it is 
amazing that when the following question is put to the Minister of 
Transport at the end of this government's mandate, ``how will your 
SRL policy work'', the minister cannot give us an intelligent 
answer. This is proof positive that they do not have a transportation 
policy. What will be the consequences of this appalling lack of 
vision?
<P>
	Today, old branch lines are being abandoned, I see this in my 
own region, and my Bloc colleagues have seen this as well. 
Hundreds of kilometres of tracks are being abandoned without any 
indication of being salvaged for further use. Meanwhile, our 
highway system will deteriorate even more.
<P>
	When, 10, 15 or 20 years from now, we have to decide to rebuild 
our railway network because we realize it makes no sense at all to 
leave trucks on the road and that we should use our railway lines to 
better advantage, we will have to spend millions and even billions 
of dollars to correct a situation this government has allowed to 
deteriorate.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa-Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very 
interested to hear my opposition colleague's viewpoint. I am sure 
he will agree with me that the federal government's transportation 
program was outstanding. It was well planned, well executed and 
attuned to the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	The Department of Transport's decision to transfer the 
Macdonald-Cartier airport to a non-profit corporation indicates 
that the federal government has decided to give regional 
municipalities direct authority.  They will be able to plan their own 
economic development and promote economic growth. The region 
will also be in a position to establish the type of airport and air 
services it wants.
<P>
	The government has done the same thing with Pearson, Dorval, 
Vancouver and all the airports in the country. Would my colleague 
not agree that the government has planned its transportation 
matters well?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I do not think, unfortunately, that you will allow me to repeat my 
entire speech, but I would have to do so to explain to our colleague 
that, no, I do not agree with his claim that the government's 
planning was marvellous and resolved all the problems in the area 
of transport.
<P>
	Quite the opposite. I have shown that the government has no 
transportation policy and that its decisions served simply to 
transfer responsibilities to other levels of government.
<P>
	When our colleague for Ottawa Centre says we must trust in the 
community and that it is a good decision to allow local people to 
decide the future of their equipment, I agree with him. However, it 
must not happen any old which way. The government has resolved 
its budget problems on the backs of the provinces without regard to 
the consequences.
<P>
	I repeat the example of what is happening in Montreal at the 
moment. A court handed down a terrible decision yesterday. Huge 
delays will result from this decision preventing the local 
community from restructuring Montreal airport services.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport was questioned outside the House. In 
response to a question on what he intended to do about ADM's 
situation in Montreal, he said it was not his business, that he had set 
up a local group and that decisions were to be made by these 
people. This is typical of this government's policies: it transfers 
responsibility without regard to the consequences.
<P>
	No, I do not agree with my colleague's assessment. On the 
contrary, I think real policy should be formulated on co-operation 
with all levels of government and take financial consequences into 
account first, to ensure the future of transport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague is not in agreement with 
the government's decision in this regard. There is another example. 
The federal government has launched a Canada wide initiative 
under the infrastructure program. There are three partners: the 
federal, provincial and municipal governments.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	This initiative has created over 100,000 jobs across the country 
and was supported by almost every municipality in Canada. Many 
mayors, including some in Quebec, applauded the federal 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8110"> 8110 </A></B>
<P>
	Now, the federal government has put up $425 million for 
another initiative under its transportation and infrastructure policy.
<P>
	Does my colleague support this extraordinary federal 
government infrastructure policy, including the latest 
announcement of $425 million in funding? Does he support this 
initiative and is he not in agreement with this kind of intelligent 
policy on the part of the federal government in the area of 
transportation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have two points to raise. First of all, the results of this 
infrastructure policy, or rather program, to which our colleague 
from Ottawa-Centre alludes, are not necessarily what he says they 
are, as far as job creation is concerned. One might challenge the 
figure of 100,000 jobs created by the infrastructure program.
<P>
	But I do not want to get into that, for I have just two things to 
point out. First, of course the infrastructure program has had a 
beneficial effect, but it has been a limited effect, both in the number 
of jobs created and, especially, in their duration. The jobs were 
created for very short periods, that is the length of time it took to 
construct or renovate certain infrastructures.
<P>
	As for the proportions, that is the regional distribution of 
infrastructure spending, here again, Quebec did not get the share it 
was entitled to expect, as is the case for all federal spending. I 
would say that, if the action of the federal government were fair 
and equitable for Quebec, we would not need an infrastructure 
program, modern programs of various public works. We would 
have the jobs Quebecers really need, quality jobs, permanent jobs, 
to ensure that our families can develop and live decent lives.
<P>
	That is what we expect of our governments and, unfortunately, 
that is not what we have received from the federal government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (London East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I express 
my appreciation for being given the opportunity to comment on 
federal support for VIA Rail.
<P>
	The Reform opposition motion before us condemns the 
government's actions with respect to a number of its transportation 
policies. I do not have the time to get into all of them but I want to 
spend a little time speaking about our government's support for 
VIA Rail. The motion is another indication, especially by the 
Reform Party, of how out of touch it is and how little it understands 
about the country.
<P>
	Over the past two or three decades Canadians have supported 
their national passenger rail service. For the Reform Party to 
suggest in its blue book platform that VIA Rail should be 
privatized, which would mean the abandonment of VIA Rail 
services to hundreds of communities across the country, surely 
does not point to  a national party that supports the needs of the 
passenger transportation of the country.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	There is something bizarre about the motion of the hon. member 
for Kootenay West-Revelstoke. The Reform transport critic said 
on June 4, 1996, as reported in the <I>Hill Times</I>: ``I have agreed with 
the concept behind all the government's transport bills over the 
past two and a half years, with the sole exception of the Pearson 
airport cancellation bill''. We have heard this song and dance 
before with regard to Pearson. He said on June 4, 1996 that he 
supports all policies, save and except that one of the government, 
but his motion today condemns what the government is doing.
<P>
	I like the member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke. He has been 
a very active member of the transport committee as I and my 
colleagues have been. For the most part he puts forward some very 
positive viewpoints and has been in agreement with the 
government in most cases. I find rather bizarre that all of a sudden 
today he decides that he is against everything he stood for just the 
other day.
<P>
	Liberal governments of the past and of today are governments 
that supported passenger rail service. When the Tories had power 
for those gruesome eight years and put this country through pain, it 
was the Liberal Party from 1988 to 1993 that fought for the 
retention and enhancement of VIA services.
<P>
	The government believes that every community needs a national 
passenger rail service. It also recognizes that the transportation 
system needs to be an affordable, integrated and efficient system.
<P>
	Everything we have done since 1993 was to put in place certain 
efficiencies that do not destroy the transportation systems but 
enhance them and ensure that Canadians have them, not only 
businesses but people who rely on our transportation services.
<P>
	I compliment VIA and its employees. They have not had a very 
good time since 1989 when Mr. Mulroney and the Tories slashed 
the VIA network by 50 per cent.
<P>
	In 1993 the government had a deficit to deal with. It had to 
impose certain cutbacks on VIA as was done with other 
departments. What was made clear, thanks to the hard work and 
dedication of the men and women who work for VIA, the 
management and employees, was that they were able to do so 
without cutting one service to the country in the past three and a 
half years even though their subsidy levels were falling by over 
$200 million. They did that in a very pragmatic, orderly way 
making sure that VIA service was available to Chatham, Toronto 
and all other parts of this great country.
<P>
	It is also clear that VIA remains committed to looking for 
opportunities and efficiencies to enhance services by working with 
their workers, by working with  communities and by working with 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8111"> 8111 </A></B>
<P>
other partners. It is looking for the opportunity to better serve 
Canadians from coast to coast with the best passenger rail service.
<P>
	It has moved to improve the attractiveness of rail service by 
making certain infrastructure upgrading to permit 100-mile per 
hour operation of trains on the Montreal-Quebec routes and 
95-mile per hour operation on the Toronto-London-Windsor route. 
The Montreal-Senneterre, the Montreal-Jonquière and the 
Jasper-Prince Rupert train schedules were revised to provide 
daylight services for local residents and development of tour 
packages.
<P>
	To reiterate, VIA is always looking at ways of enhancing its 
passenger base. VIA has worked at combining a series of fare 
increases with special promotion fares and plans to develop year 
round markets for its services.
<P>
	As a result of these service initiatives revenues have increased 
by 26 per cent and the number of passenger miles increased by 16 
per cent between 1990 and 1996. Over the same period the number 
of passengers increased by 5 per cent. The higher increase in the 
number of passenger miles is because the average trip taken by 
each passenger increased from 221 miles to 246 miles between 
1990 and 1996. It is further indication that Canadians support and 
want passenger rail service.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The best measure of VIA's success has been the steady increase 
in its cost recovery levels. Something we would expect from every 
corporation and in all our operations is that they move toward cost 
recovery. Between 1990 and 1996 the cost recovery ratio increased 
from 26 per cent to 44 per cent. This marks the first time ever that 
VIA's cost recovery has been over 33 per cent.
<P>
	Under the National Transportation Act, 1987, the government 
subsidized the operation of three uneconomical passenger services 
because it believed in treating all regions of the country in a fair 
and equitable way. Therefore the railways that the government 
supported and continues to support, the Quebec North Shore and 
Labrador Railway, the Algoma Central Railway and the Ontario 
Northland Transportation Commission, is a further indication of its 
commitment to passenger rail service.
<P>
	The new transportation act was passed by the House within the 
last year. It states that the new Canada Transportation Act 
maintains the government's commitment to remote areas along 
these routes by having the Minister of Transport enter into special 
agreements with the railways to provide financial assistance but to 
give them greater autonomy in how best to provide those services.
<P>
	It is clear and I do not know why the Reform Party does not get 
it. The country is a national federation, a country where we need 
national infrastructure. VIA is  the national passenger 
infrastructure to provide services across the country. Four hundred 
communities depend on passenger rail service. For Reformers to 
suggest in their blue book privatization and the depriving of 
Canadians of passenger rail service, or for them to suggest in their 
platform book, their new fresh start 1995, the total disbandment of 
the transportation ministry and the $750 million, indicates that they 
do not believe in the national government having any role in 
national transportation.
<P>
	This is bizarre. I have listened for the last few hours to the 
Reform Party suggesting that we ought to do more. The fact is that 
the government is doing more. I do not understand how Reformers 
can stand and say we should be doing more when their blue book 
and their fresh start say that we should be doing less or should not 
be involved at all.
<P>
	In conclusion, we continue to believe in VIA. We continue to 
believe that there are opportunities to have VIA work in a most 
efficient way and to ensure that Canadians have passenger rail 
service from VIA. We ought to continue to support VIA in its 
attempt to modernize and in its attempts to provide more service. 
VIA ought to be given the mandate and the opportunities to 
enhance its passenger ridership in all parts of the country.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. It being 5.30 p.m. it 
is my duty to inform the House that proceedings on the motion and 
the amendment thereto have expired.

	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-353, an act to amend the Criminal Code (Internet 
lotteries), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to begin 
second reading of the debate this evening. I also appreciate the 
co-operation we have had from all parties. We will hear from 
speakers this evening from every region of our country. We will 
hear from members of Parliament who represent not only urban 
areas but rural areas as well. This debate will take place over an 
extended period of time and hopefully we will design and develop 
something that will be useful for all of Canada.
<P>
	Just to put this bill in context, I would like to go back three years 
when I began my experience serving as the Parliamentary Secre-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8112"> 8112 </A></B>
<P>
tary to the Minister of Industry. One of the stories that the 
government has not told well but which is a tremendous story is the 
fabulous work that was  done by the Minister of Industry in the 
whole area of the information highway.
<P>
	Members received not too long ago the final report of the 
Information Highway Advisory Council. It is a model. The work 
produced through the support of many people from every walk of 
life and industry right across Canada has proven to be a guideline 
for not just our Parliament but for provincial legislatures across 
Canada. The work that was done in this Parliament is also 
recognized as being world class.
<P>
	Serving as the parliamentary secretary immersed me into this 
whole area of the information highway. I still consider myself to be 
a techno-peasant, but I could not help but feel some of the energy 
and the enthusiasm that came from the Department of Industry.
<P>
	I want to read a couple of recommendations that came from that 
committee work over the last few years. It is Issue No. 8, 
Information Controls, and recommendation 8.2: ``The federal 
government should take immediate steps to lead in the 
development of legislative measures with regard to clarifying the 
question of liability of owners, operators and users of bulletin 
boards, Internet and Usenet sites-The Government of Canada 
should take immediate steps to facilitate the development of a 
model code of ethics and practices reflecting community standards 
and to provide for community education programs''.
<P>
	The policy debate that we are developing here tonight is very 
much consistent with the policy framework that has been going on 
in Parliament for the last few years under the leadership of the 
Minister of Industry.
<P>
	How do we get from that report to a bill that talks about 
amending the Criminal Code to allow Internet casinos? I have to go 
back to an experience I had last summer. It was August. I decided 
to take a weekend off. I travelled to the beautiful island of Antigua. 
I have a friend that has a place down there, Sheikh Amin 
Al-Dahlawi from Jeddah, a man that I had met a few years ago. 
While I was relaxing in his beautiful resort in Antigua one evening 
I attended a presentation from a company in California, World 
Wide Web Casinos, Mr. Peter Michaels and Mr. Peter Demos.
<P>
	They gave a presentation to our group on this whole realm of 
Internet casino gaming which is emerging as a very strong force. 
We should know that there are many Internet casino companies 
throughout the world. I sat and watched the demonstration thatMr. Michaels and Mr. Demos put forward and I was absolutely 
blown away to see how people could actually turn on their lap top 
or their home based PC, and all of a sudden they could participate 
in the entertainment of gaming from wherever they were. It was 
just like being involved in a real casino, just as if you were visiting 
a land based casino.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	I had never seen anything like it. I then proceeded to sell Canada 
to them. I thought that if this concept was emerging and it was 
going to be so strong in its business activity, I asked if they would 
consider putting a land base Internet casino in Canada. They 
certainly obliged me in the sense that they thought it was 
interesting that we would consider it. That was the end of the 
discussion at that time.
<P>
	On my return to Canada I then called the Library of Parliament. I 
am sure most members will agree with me that some of the best 
researchers in the world are working at the Library of Parliament. I 
asked them what the rule of law was in terms of the possibility of us 
having an Internet casino system in Canada.
<P>
	The Library of Parliament did a fabulous study. It took them 
about two months but they did a fabulous piece of research, which 
is available to all members of the House and, for that matter, to 
anyone else who wants to have access to it. They went through the 
history of how the whole lottery business, which used to be the 
purview of the national government, was essentially devolved.
<P>
	We all know that in 1979 Prime Minister Clark began the whole 
process of devolving lotteries to the provinces. It was ratified in 
1985 but the basic rule of law that governs this system is the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	The researchers state: ``It is not clear whether or not it is illegal 
for an individual in Canada to gamble on Internet casinos, but there 
does not appear to be a provision in the Criminal Code which 
prohibits this activity. Therefore, it could be argued that the 
provincial governments presently have the right to conduct and 
manage Internet casinos. But it should also be noted that no 
provincial government has attempted to set up an Internet casino 
and the courts have yet to issue a decision on whether or not such 
an activity would be permitted by the Criminal Code''.
<P>
	They go on to say that it then becomes a question of whether or 
not the Parliament of Canada has in its jurisdiction the right to 
amend that and deal with the whole issue of Internet casinos. When 
the whole use of the Internet is exploding in front of our very faces, 
there was never ever any discussion back in 1979 or 1985 whether 
or not this was going to be a serious issue.
<P>
	It is important to note that when the researchers from the Library 
of Parliament did their investigations they said that Parliament, 
under the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, is free to modify 
Criminal Code legislation and provide a new scheme with respect 
to gaming and presumably could give the federal government the 
right to conduct and manage Internet lotteries.
<P>
	It was with that and further advice from the Library of 
Parliament that I then went to the legislative branch of this House 
and designed Bill C-53. The whole purpose of  this bill is to make 
sure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8113"> 8113 </A></B>
<P>
that this industry, which is exploding in front of our faces, be put 
under some kind of regulatory authority.
<P>
	I would like to add a couple of other important facts. Whether 
one likes or dislikes, agrees or disagrees, with the whole notion of 
gaming, the fact is that it is a trillion dollar industry. We also know 
and experts have said that the whole notion of betting in an 
underground context is now in excess of $60 billion. This is $60 
billion worth of gaming through bookies, et cetera, where there is 
absolutely no sort of monitor or regulation on it at all.
<P>
	Now we are going to be faced with this whole new realm, 
Internet gaming. Rather than being reactive to the situation which 
is evolving we should be proactive. We should go to committee on 
a bill like this and listen to expert witnesses who will tell us the 
pros and the cons. They will tell us the rules and regulations that 
need to be addressed.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Internet gaming is going on right now with companies that do 
this totally on their own. There are absolutely no background 
investigations. There is no random process testing. There is no 
prize payment bonding. There is really no adequate consumer 
disclosure of game odds or expected value of the win of all games. 
There is no control of underage gambling. There is no information 
highway federal tax. I will deal with the notion of government 
revenue related to this shortly.
<P>
	Other aspects include truth in advertising, money laundering 
control, hacker protection and arbitration of disputes. These are 
some of the issues that really should be discussed. At the end of 
that discussion legislators can decide how they want to handle this 
issue.
<P>
	We have been given a trust in this Parliament not to be reactive 
but to be proactive. We must lead the way in looking at the realm of 
Internet gaming. As a G7 country that is highly respected in the 
whole area of the information highway, this would be an 
opportunity for us to do some extraordinary groundwork in this 
area. Ultimately this could lead to treaties with other countries.
<P>
	Presently over 200 million people sign on the net every day. It 
was only 20 years ago that there were 50,000 computers in the 
whole world. Today 50,000 computers a day are sold. As this 
industry is exploding in front of our very eyes, let us take a 
leadership role and make sure the proper regulation and control is 
put into this very important sector of the entertainment economy, 
Internet gaming.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-353, whose purpose is to 
amend the Criminal Code with respect to Internet lotteries.
<P>
	I think the hon. member was right to talk about co-operation, 
because we intend to co-operate fully on this bill, considering the 
very significant proliferation nowadays of gambling, lotteries, 
betting, and so forth.
<P>
	Internet and computer games are also coming increasingly 
widespread. As the hon. member said earlier, more than two 
million people a day surf on the Internet. This is a little like letting 
two million people into a casino, since these computer games 
include gambling, lotteries and betting.
<P>
	Considering the easy access and the total absence of regulation 
of this sphere of activity at present, and also considering that 
Internet users may be minors and can get into the net at any time, it 
is important to take the time to study this bill. We must find out 
whether this bill does what it is intended to do, which is provide 
adequate legislation to regulate gambling, lotteries and betting on 
the Internet.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	For the time being, as I told the hon. member, and I say it again 
here in this House, there is no problem with the principle: we will 
co-operate. Where I do have a problem, and I hope we can settle 
this in committee, is about the games of chance the federal 
government will want to control on the Internet.
<P>
	I realize that Internet represents communications and that is a 
federal jurisdiction. However, lotteries are a provincial matter. I am 
thinking of the casinos in Hull and Montreal, in Ontario and in 
western Canada. These casinos are operated and managed by the 
provinces but are also subject to the Criminal Code and existing 
legislation.
<P>
	What bothers me in the bill is that it allows the Government of 
Canada to establish or operate a lottery on the Internet, in 
accordance with the regulations. It allows the Government of 
Canada to grant a licence to an Internet service supplier, with 
everything that entails. Of course we are in favour of a bill that 
provides a legislative and regulatory framework to protect the 
public and deal with this whole new field, this new way of dealing 
with the Internet and lotteries on the Internet. However, I would 
have liked to see this done with due respect for the jurisdictions of 
Quebec and the other provinces.
<P>
	So yes, we are prepared to give this bill the attention it deserves, 
because it is a very interesting bill. We pledge our support on 
second reading so the bill can go to committee, where it can 
eventually be examined with a view to improving it and, above all, 
to bring it in line with the jurisdictions of the provinces and 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to commend the hon. member for introducing Bill 
C-353. I certainly do not want to go on  record as saying that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8114"> 8114 </A></B>
<P>
Government of Canada should now get into the lottery business on 
the Internet. I do not think that is the issue here. The issue is quite a 
different one.
<P>
	We need to recognize the significance of the Internet in our 
contemporary society. It affects virtually every part of our daily 
life. We can do all kinds of things on the Internet. I made a brief list 
of some of the things that can be done on the Internet.
<P>
	We can buy, sell, trade, travel, read newspapers and magazines, 
play the stock market, do banking, talk to politicians, sign out a 
book at the library and upgrade a computer. We can send a postcard 
or a greeting. Many other things can be done on the Internet. All of 
them can be done by text, voice or even video.
<P>
	Introduced in this area now is Internet gaming; this is now a very 
real thing. Internet gaming is appearing in many jurisdictions 
around the world, usually in those jurisdictions where the gaming 
laws are not nearly as fixed as they are in Canada. Let us look at the 
situation of Internet gaming in the world today.
<P>
	The key to success on the Internet and all other casinos is traffic. 
In other words, a lot of people must participate in the business. 
Worldwide gambling in recent years has gone from a $500 billion a 
year industry to over a trillion dollars. That is a rather significant 
increase. Worldwide it has been estimated that in excess of a 
trillion dollars is wagered annually on various forms of gambling.
<P>
	For example in Great Britain over 90 per cent of the population 
participates in some form of legalized gambling. Australians wager 
almost $2,700 per capita annually on gaming entertainment.
<P>
	Conservative estimates for the Internet gaming market in the 
United States projected a total potential market of $8.25 billion in 
1996 and it will grow to $22 billion by 1998. Internationally, 
market estimates for Europe and the Far East predict potential 
markets by 1998 of $29.2 billion. This is the market opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	The Internet is a worldwide telecommunications network that 
allows the users to communicate with one another with no 
geographic boundaries. That is the issue. As a result of this 
tremendous flexibility of communications, it has become the next 
frontier for commerce.
<P>
	The major inroad envisioned by business in the Internet is the 
ability to perform large scale, large dollar transactions over the 
network. That is seen by many as the true power of the Internet, 
where costs can be substantially reduced for businesses, allowing 
them to advertise and sell to practically millions of consumers and 
businesses worldwide.
<P>
	The member talked earlier about the success of a casino 
depending upon traffic and many, many people. The Internet has 
magnified the number of participants tremendously. Therefore, 
there is a very real potential for people who are interested in this 
particular business.
<P>
	Let us look at a couple of facts and figures. Worldwide the 
gaming market, as we have just indicated, is a trillion dollars plus. 
In the U.S. it is $400 billion. Earnings of legal U.S. casinos-and 
we are talking about not only the Internet now, we are talking about 
all gaming-were $188 billion in 1995. Earnings of traditional 
illegal bookies were $60 billion in 1995. The market outside the 
United States is more than $500 billion per year. If we add those 
numbers up, we will see that a tremendous amount of money is 
going into the gaming business.
<P>
	In the Internet there are 50,000 computer networks involving 90 
countries. Internet users worldwide are some 175 million, which is 
expected to grow in the next two years to about 200 million. It 
becomes very clear that this is a very significant issue.
<P>
	Who are these people on the Internet? It is rather interesting to 
look at the demographics of the people who are involved. The 
typical Internet user is male and 44 years of age. Thirty-nine per 
cent of them have a college degree and an annual income of about 
$48,000.
<P>
	If we compare those statistics to the typical Las Vegas/Atlantic 
City casino gambler, the proportion of males is 51 per cent 
compared to 60 per cent on the Internet. The median age is 48 
compared to 44 on the Internet. The percentage with college 
degrees who gamble on land based casinos is 29 compared to 39 
per cent on the Internet. The percentage of people with college 
degrees is much greater in those using the Internet and gambling on 
the Internet than is otherwise the case. The average income is 
$43,000 for those using land based casinos compared to $48,000 
for those using the Internet. It is a very interesting group of people 
which is involved in this issue.
<P>
	Has this become a serious issue in a variety of places? Yes, it 
has. In fact the Interactive Gaming Council has been formed in the 
United States to come to grips with this particular issue. What is its 
role? That new industry organization, the Interactive Gaming 
Council, has been formed to represent the burgeoning interactive 
gaming industry. It is currently establishing a framework to address 
defined issues. It recently met in Scottsdale, Arizona on January 
19, 1997.
<P>
	An assistant attorney general, Mr. Alan R. Kesner from 
Wisconsin, was the guest speaker. He reconfirmed that law 
enforcement agencies and regulators need input and guidelines in 
order to fully understand Internet gaming and to go forward with 
ideas on regulation and taxation. Mr. Kesner's remarks indicated 
that there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8115"> 8115 </A></B>
<P>
is an enormous public demand for gaming entertainment as proved 
by the huge proliferation of gaming throughout the United  States 
and Internet gaming will probably be just another venue.
<P>
	However, the public must be protected from those Internet 
casinos which would take advantage of them with all sorts of unfair 
practices. The hon. member just gave us a rundown, almost a 
catalogue, of some of the things that ought to be covered. It is a real 
issue. Here in Canada the question is not whether we will have this, 
but rather when.
<P>
	Again I want to underline that I am not necessarily a proponent 
of gaming of any kind. In fact, I am not. I believe it has some very 
negative connotations. On the other hand, there are many people 
who do use it. It is a way in which a lot of charitable organizations 
and non-profit organizations raise funds and do tremendous good in 
various communities by supporting junior hockey and a variety of 
service clubs. So I suppose there is some merit in this area.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Canadians are already gambling on the Internet and money is 
leaving the country. We need to ask ourselves where the 
responsibility lies to make sure that if there is going to be Internet 
gaming that it be done in a way which is more or less controlled, to 
eliminate fraud, to eliminate abuse and to protect the consumers 
who are involved.
<P>
	Just before I got up to speak one of my colleagues on this side of 
the House said: ``If you want to control the Internet, good luck''. I 
think that is true. It is a tough one to control. I am not so sure 
anybody can, but we do have to take steps to try to do it.
<P>
	If the committee will come to grips at least with that part, it will 
have made a major dent into the question because it is very 
significant. It has to do with the whole issue of privacy which is 
very significant also. It directly involves our banking community 
and other financial institutions that use the Internet to transfer huge 
sums of money from institution to institution and also across 
international and national boundaries. If nothing else, this bill will 
have a spin-off in another very significant area.
<P>
	I want to commend the hon. member who was the parliamentary 
secretary. And by the way I will interject here to say I wish he were 
still a parliamentary secretary, but that is none of my business. That 
is between him and his boss, I suppose.
<P>
	Is there a responsibility for Bill C-353 for Canada and for the 
federal government? Yes, I believe there is. The hon. member 
reviewed some of those provisions, so I will not go into them now. 
The question is one where we need to distinguish-oh, my 
goodness, I only have one minute left and this is such an important 
bill, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I want then to indicate rather significantly that I believe if the 
government is going to regulate it should not get involved in the 
actual running of a casino itself. That ought not to be in the bill. If 
there is any suggestion, and I think there is, that the government 
might have that permission, the bill should be amended so that it 
does not do that, but that it can license private persons or private 
corporations to do it. Regulate them so that the consumers' 
interests are protected and that money is transferred without getting 
involved in the laundering business and things of that sort.
<P>
	In conclusion, we do support the principle of the bill. There are 
some suggestions and it has the opportunity of moving us forward 
to truly becoming a leader in the Internet business and on the 
information highway.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me 
to speak on this legislation. I commend my colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood who from time to time brings issues forth 
in this House. They are usually very controversial but are necessary 
for the public to have debated in places like the Parliament of 
Canada and the provincial legislatures.
<P>
	I know sometimes people say the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood sometimes comes up with ideas that cause 
some of his colleagues some difficulty because they would prefer 
not to have them debated in a public forum. Perhaps this is one of 
them.
<P>
	This bill goes into an area where there has been considerable 
controversy in the province of Nova Scotia, perhaps also the 
province of Alberta and some of the western provinces where 
gaming, casinos and video lottery terminals have been taken over 
and regulated by governments and have become a source of 
revenue for governments. It begs the ethical and moral argument 
about whether or not gambling is sinful, whether or not gambling is 
something that should be spurned or shunned and whether or not 
government should be involved in it. There are very important 
debates which should and must take place.
<P>
	At the same time some of the very people who raise all those 
questions are the same people who say that governments should cut 
back on personal income taxes, find other sources of revenue that 
they are not stripping arbitrarily out of the wallets of individuals. I 
would say to those individuals that they cannot have it both ways.
<P>
	It seems that it is human nature that people sometimes like to 
play games of chance. I am a victim of playing games of chance. I 
like to play scratch and win games. I do not think I go through an 
airport that I do not pick up a $2 ticket. It is $2 one I can afford. It is 
my bit of fun perhaps at the end of the week on the way home on a 
Thursday night or a Friday morning. Periodically I win a few 
dollars and periodically I lose a few dollars.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8116"> 8116 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I do it because I want to do it. I as an adult make a conscious 
decision that is what I want to do. I do it in a framework knowing 
that the lottery corporation, be it in Ontario or be it the Atlantic 
lottery corporation, properly regulates the game. I do it knowing 
what my odds are because they are printed on the back of the 
tickets. I do not have to worry about whether it is a scam. I do not 
have to worry about whether it is one of these mail order things that 
say ``do this and you win eligibility for a $20 million prize''.
<P>
	I do it with the full knowledge that the Canadian institutions of 
government have regulated it and are making sure that the printed 
odds are actually the odds in the game and that I am not getting 
ripped off. I make the conscious choice to do it.
<P>
	What the hon. member has put before us in the middle of all of 
this controversy about gaming and video lottery terminals and 
whether they should be in corner stores or whatever is very 
important. He has hit on the leading wave of technology, the 
Internet.
<P>
	It is quite amazing because I am not one of those people who are 
not terribly technologically proficient. I fumble around on my little 
computer at home. Most times my five-year old son Stephen or 
Matthew is able to browse me through where I want to go a little 
easier than I can do it.
<P>
	The reality is it is a wired world today. That is what it is. The 
reality is, as the hon. member opposite just stated, that we can do 
pretty much anything. From my home on Saturday I called up 
<I>Debates</I> from the previous Parliament on the Internet. I was 
amazed that I could actually do it. It also means that my 
constituents can do it. I can buy car insurance. I can find out where 
I want to shop. I can book a holiday anywhere in the world. I can 
find out what temperature it is on a beach down on the west coast of 
Florida. The world is wired. It is the new wave.
<P>
	Anybody who thinks they are able to keep off the Internet the 
provision of leisure gaming services is crazy. It is already there. 
Today in my office-I did not know you could do this-I sat down, 
worked around for bit and hooked up with the Liechtenstein 
Gaming Corporation in Liechtenstein. It is a city, a mountain, a 
river, and that is it. That is what the place is. I was in the 
Liechtenstein Gaming Corporation casino.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Were there free drinks?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> No, there were no free drinks. There are no 
free drinks anywhere any more.
<P>
	It was properly regulated. The first thing it indicated was that 
this gaming corporation was sanctioned and regulated by the 
Government of the Duchy of Liechtenstein according to 
internationally accepted guidelines and procedures. I had a bit of 
comfort that I  was not dealing with the mob. I was not dealing with 
somebody some place down in the United State, Aruba or 
somewhere running a scam on the Internet.
<P>
	If I wanted to do my scratch and wins I had to set up my account. 
I had to be verified. If I won, it automatically went into my bank 
account in Canada just like that, an instantaneous transaction.
<P>
	The hon. member's bill does two things. It focuses on whether or 
not gaming is something that grown adults in a modern democracy 
should be allowed to access. I think it is a matter of choice. I know 
people sometimes get addicted to gambling. People get addicted to 
many things: cigarettes, driving their cars around the block too 
often or laying on a beach and getting sunburned.
<P>
	We cannot take those few people who legitimately have a 
problem and say to everybody else that they will be barred from 
free choice. The free choice is there now. It exists. It is out in 
cyberspace. It is on the Internet. We can do it today from the 
comfort of our rec rooms.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member's bill says that if this is now happening the 
Canadian government should look at whether or not it should 
regulate it, whether or not in this era of regulation the Canadian 
government wishes to get involved with it.
<P>
	It begs other important questions, not just ones on regulations. It 
begs some important questions about provincial government 
involvement. A few years ago there were lotteries and it was never 
conceived that there would an Internet with 50 million users and 
bumbling people could actually sit in their rec rooms and find 
something on it, talk to somebody around the world and get into the 
Liechtenstein Corporation Gaming casino.
<P>
	The bill asks whether it is reasonable that the Government of 
Canada should consider whether it wants to be in the business and 
if it is in the business how it relates to the provincial governments 
and the previous agreements on lotteries that were made a few 
years ago. It brings up the whole issue of regulation on the Internet 
and the protection of Canadian consumers.
<P>
	Somebody browsing on the Internet tonight may get hooked up 
with a casino somewhere down in the South Pacific run by a hacker 
with a big bank account, wearing a pair of shorts, drinking a pina 
colada and laughing all the way to the bank. If such people know 
the Canadian government or the provincial governments have the 
proper systems and safeguards in their lottery acts, and if they are 
going to get into video gambling and video lottery, they would 
probably choose to do it from the highly distinguished regulatory 
regime of the Canadian provincial and federal government.
<P>
	I am very pleased to have spoken on the bill. Once again the hon. 
member has brought forward a piece of legislation that is both 
timely in terms of revenue and in  terms of the issues of the day. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8117"> 8117 </A></B>
<P>
hope at the end of this hour to see the entire subject matter referred 
to committee so the broad range of issues that must be dealt with 
are dealt with in a timely fashion. I hope people on both sides of the 
issue will be accorded the time to put forth their points and 
hopefully we will have come to a conclusion and a 
recommendation to government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
privileged to speak today on Bill C-353 presented by a colleague. 
He is someone the House has grown to know as one of its foremost 
members in terms of generating ideas. Many people talk about 
creating ideas, but in the context of the private sector it is 
interesting to know that the hon. member who earlier styled 
himself as a techno peasant. He should not be so willing to 
deprecate himself with such terms. He has earned the esteemed role 
of the wizard of ideas within the House of Commons.
<P>
	It is interesting the House would be seized with an idea that is of 
the 21st century. The Internet is something that we all know is one 
of the most interesting modes of communication. It has gripped 
every country and can be translated for many people around the 
world in various forms, whether music, sending information, raw 
data or transmitting important information to people.
<P>
	Every month the growth on the Internet worldwide is anywhere 
from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The current world usage is some 50 
million. That number will be closer to 250 million as we reach the 
advent of the next millennium.
<P>
	The hon. member has taken a personal experience and tried to 
contextualize it, to make it relevant to the House of Commons. He 
has given the House of Commons and the committee that will 
hopefully treat this with relative speediness an opportunity to 
understand the importance of how we are to regulate.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Dartmouth indicated earlier how we 
need to get above and beyond allowing the mob, the underworld or 
unsavoury elements from taking control of the growing area of 
gambling. There are certainly ethical considerations dealing with 
gambling as there are ethical considerations dealing with the 
Internet in terms of pornography and the dissemination of hate 
literature.
<P>
	The House must at some point quickly come to grips with those 
issues, lest Parliament be treated as irrelevant in the age of 
cyberspace. Compliments of the help of the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, we are allowed to begin to look very 
seriously at the question of the Internet. We can also look at the 
question of where the federal government can best use its authority.
<P>
	Because the Internet is interprovincial-it is also 
extraterritorial-it makes no sense to have the provinces look into 
it from a regulatory point of view and to regulate those companies 
which would receive information so that those who are gambling 
not only  within Canada but around the world might have an 
opportunity to know they are doing so within a trustworthy context.
<P>
	Trust is very important in this context. Canada is considered a 
leader not only among the G-7 but certainly around the world. It is 
important to note that because we are basically a country that has a 
high degree of trust when it comes to relationships and transactions 
of various types. We are in the very unique position of being able to 
actually look forward to a day when we might be able to regulate 
this industry.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	Other members will have an opportunity in the next few minutes 
to relate their interests in the bill. However I will summarize mine 
as being the ability to license it, to regulate it and ultimately in the 
interests of the taxpayer to tax it so that billions of dollars that 
might potentially be leaving the country might remain here.
<P>
	Let us follow the wisdom of the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. Let us get the bill into committee and let 
us keep the bad guys out of it. I applaud the hon. member for his 
wisdom, foresight and his ideas. May the wizard live long.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to 
speak today on legislation that is precedent setting and very 
important to all. The issue of gambling in society has always been a 
contentious one. I am generally against gambling because I have 
seen its negative effects. Whether or not we like it gambling is an 
age old form of entertainment that is here to stay. Today the gaming 
industry is estimated to generate $1 trillion worldwide.
<P>
	Another thing that is here to stay and is taking the world by 
storm is the Internet. Industry experts estimate that there are 50 
million Internet users worldwide and this figure is increasing by 10 
per cent per month. It is natural to assume that these two popular 
pastimes would somehow come together. The results are Internet 
casinos that are becoming a very lucrative business and are 
completely unregulated and completely untaxed.
<P>
	In Canada we have done a pretty good job of controlling our 
gaming industry through an earlier federal-provincial agreement. 
The provinces now reap the benefits of regulated gaming. I think 
everyone is aware of the astounding profits made from provincially 
run casinos. My riding is just northeast of Windsor, Ontario, where 
millions of Americans and other tourists flock to the slot machines, 
blackjack and roulette tables. This has become a prized possession 
for the Government of Ontario because of the amount of foreign 
dollars it gives directly to the province.
<P>
	Regulated gambling seems to work for Canadians. It can offer an 
extremely popular form of entertainment. It also does a great job of 
subsidizing our taxes, not to mention that it generates employment.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8118"> 8118 </A></B>
<P>
	Internet casinos can offer many of the same benefits. However 
right now they are not benefiting anyone except the occasional 
winner of a hand of poker. As it stands right now, Internet casinos 
are almost entirely based offshore in remote locations where the 
laws affecting gambling are not very strict, places like Antigua 
or Equador.
<P>
	Via the Internet we can play the tables or the slots from the 
luxury of our own offices or home computers anywhere in the 
world. I can be sitting in Wallaceburg playing a round of poker with 
a gentleman in Hong Kong, a lady in Australia, and the dealer is 
dealing the cards from the Caribbean. Best of all, nobody has to 
know. The gamblers earnings as well as the earnings of the casino 
go completely untaxed. This is exactly what is going on.
<P>
	The bill proposes a reasonable solution to the problem of 
unregulated gambling on the Internet. Instead of letting Internet 
casinos make millions on an island in the South Pacific, the bill is 
asking Canadians to take a better look at the benefits of this 
industry in our own backyard. If Canadians have accepted 
regulated gaming establishments then why not regulate Internet 
gaming as well? By allowing Internet casinos in Canada we can 
effectively limit the dangers involved in gaming and regulate the 
casinos activity.
<P>
	With an estimated 175 million Internet users by the end of 1997 
the potential revenues are astounding. New security measures and 
software are making Internet users more comfortable with the idea 
of Internet commerce, cybercash or Visa and MasterCard 
transactions.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Many countries around the world are realizing the potential of 
Internet gaming. They have determined that the Internet is a 
popular reality that cannot be controlled. Other countries have also 
realized the fiscal benefits of regulated gaming. In order to 
minimize and eliminate fraud and illegal activity, we should permit 
regulated Internet casinos in Canada.
<P>
	I have recently discovered the benefits of the Internet. My 
grandchildren are using it every day for their homework and other 
projects. It can be a great tool. However, it can also be abused. It is 
the job of the government to avoid illegal and fraudulent activity on 
the information highway. If Internet casinos were legalized, then 
regulated, we could essentially end these problems.
<P>
	I support the bill by the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood for those reasons. I would encourage 
members from all sides of this House to consider the benefits of 
this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to this bill presented by my 
colleague from Broadview-Greenwood. Since he was sent here by 
his constituents over eight years ago, he has never ceased to apply 
his own creative, forward  looking brand of politics. He has, in this 
bill, asked Parliament to look down the road to what is looking at 
us in the face, a new world of Internet communications, a world of 
many things, as colleagues on both sides of the House have 
described.
<P>
	The government is going to have to direct its attention to this and 
this is as good a time as any. We should strike now before we end 
up with problems that are even more difficult to deal with.
<P>
	This is not a bill, as I understand it, that promotes Internet 
gaming, but rather is a bill that causes the federal government to 
occupy a field that is not now occupied at all. One of our colleagues 
earlier mentioned the Liechtenstein casino which he found 
available on the Internet here in Canada. There are perhaps many 
facilities available.
<P>
	However, many of the members here believe that the federal 
government should look very closely at this now and occupying the 
field. What field is it and why? The field is that of gaming by by 
computer on the Internet.
<P>
	As I understand it, the person who wants to gamble would 
establish a credit with a casino or gaming organization anywhere 
outside of Canada and, in many cases, involves jurisdictions where 
there is not much in the way of regulation. People would first 
establish their credit and the software can actually be in the 
computer. They would simply play the games on their own 
computer. However, before the game is played, they make their 
bets and access their credit outside of Canada. If they win their 
credits go up and if they lose their credits go down. The legitimate 
operators settle with the banking facility almost immediately or 
whenever the people have agreed with them. In any event, it is 
there.
<P>
	In between the person and the gaming facility outside of Canada 
is what we call the service provider or server, which is a quasi-local 
communications provider who will permit your computer to access 
the Internet to the gaming organization. So that is the field.
<P>
	Right now from Canada we can access anything we want from 
around the world, as my colleagues have so amply supplied. Why 
we want to occupy the field is perhaps more important.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	The first thing identified has been the absence of any regulation 
at all. We all remember the Irish sweepstakes many years ago, 
before the federal and provincial governments had lotteries. That 
was the only way a Canadian could buy a ticket to win anything 
other than at the horse races.
<P>
	Ultimately, Canadian jurisdictions decided to occupy the field 
and provided us with lotteries. The Irish sweepstakes may still be 
there, but there are lots of opportunities for Canadians to put a few 
dollars away on a lottery chance. They do it in huge numbers.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8119"> 8119 </A></B>
<P>
	There are reasons to believe that Canadians will put large 
amounts of dollars into Internet gaming. We cannot prove it, but 
we believe it is there. Just as the Internet has mushroomed, 
Internet gaming could mushroom. As a result, there will be a 
dollar outflow when debts are made in this fashion.
<P>
	Second, there is every indication that if there is profit to be made 
in this, and to be sure there is, organized crime will move in. 
Organized crime looks for profit, a vacuum or an opportunity. In 
this case, it is almost certain that if there are profit opportunities in 
an unregulated way, organized crime will move. It begins with a 
little extortion here or there and then it applies its resources to 
cornering, controlling and monopolizing what is otherwise a free 
market activity. This is not regarded, in our society, as a good 
thing. It would be considered a bad thing if Canadians were gaming 
through an organized crime mechanism. It is also a vehicle for 
money laundering, which we have decided is anti-social.
<P>
	Third, if the government were to be involved it would provide 
order in an area where there is now not any order at all. It can be 
accessed by anyone: minors, fraud artists. Order will prevent or 
reduce the risk of that being the case.
<P>
	Other colleagues have mentioned the possibility of taxing for the 
general well-being the service provider or gaming organization 
which would be able to operate if this were regulated and 
authorized under a licence, if the federal government chose to do so 
or if the federal government and a province chose to do so. There 
are lots of reasons why the federal government should occupy the 
field. It could be a complex issue. For that reason, I know 
colleagues will want to have the benefit of committee views on 
this.
<P>
	I support the bill. I want to see Parliament look ahead at what the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood is holding out before us. I 
hope this Parliament will be able to take a forward step and get 
into, if not the gaming business as we have done in lotteries at least 
regulate the field so that Canadians can do it in a fair way, in a way 
that suits our social mores.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Carried.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point 
of order. I believe you said industry, when in fact it is supposed to 
be justice.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The motion that was put to 
the House referred to industry. Is the House content that the matter 
be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, it would be appropriate to refer it 
to the justice committee. Also, the vote was on division. Is that 
correct?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> As the parliamentary 
secretary wishes.
<P>
	Is it agreed that the matter be referred to the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs rather than the Standing Committee on 
Industry?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is it agreed that the 
motion be carried on division?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Accordingly, the bill 
stands referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It being 6.25 p.m., the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock a.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.26 p.m.)
