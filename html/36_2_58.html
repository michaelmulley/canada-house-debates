<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA POST CORPORATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 5, 1999, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-238, an act to amend the Canada Post 
Corporation Act (mail contractors), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to participate in the debate on this private 
members' bill put forward by the NDP.  In a nutshell, this bill 
would remove provision 13(5) from the Canada Post Corporation Act 
which excludes rural route mail couriers from section 3(1) of the 
Canada Labour Code.  I am opposed to this bill and I believe that 
most of my colleagues are as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state from the outset some of the problems.  First, I 
would acknowledge that there are severe problems concerning how 
rural route mail couriers are treated in Canada.  I want to 
acknowledge the member of the NDP for recognizing this, although 
I do not agree with his solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to identify what is happening with the rural 
route mail couriers.  As independent contractors, rural route 
mail couriers must submit tenders for their jobs and then 
negotiate a contract with Canada Post after the fact.  That is 
what is happening right now.  That is why they are so frustrated. 
Of course, we do not see that in the private sector.  It would be 
ludicrous to bid on a job and then enter into negotiations for 
compensation after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post does not have any guidelines for the tendering 
process or contracting process that would ensure fairness.  The 
mail couriers believe that they are being asked to do jobs under 
extremely poor conditions, at very minimum wages, and they are 
being force by Canada Post officials to lower their bids to 
maintain their contracts.  There is a very serious problem with 
the rural route mail couriers and something needs to be done 
about it.  In speaking with some of these couriers in British 
Columbia, it is absolutely clear that they are not being treated 
fairly.  It is absolutely ludicrous to bid on a contract and then 
have to negotiate after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's responsibility to correct this situation 
and I would call upon the government to put it on its agenda. 
Something needs to be done.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the current time an exemption under the Canada Labour Code 
prevents rural route couriers from being deemed employees.  The 
NDP member has proposed that they be deemed employees, and 
therefore CUPE and a number of other unions would be in a 
struggle to unionize them for collective bargaining purposes. 
Clearly, I do not believe that is what they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there are differing opinions, but I 
believe what they really want is the ability to negotiate and 
have a very open and fair tendering process with sealed bids. 
That is what we should be focusing on.  Clearly, this bill does 
not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is that there are a number of other 
organizations within our mail delivery system which also bid.  I 
would submit that they are not being treated fairly either.  Some 
of them are urban expedite contractors, suburban contractors, 
highway regional service contractors and marine contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of organizations which are also facing 
similar conditions and are not being treated fairly by Canada 
Post, yet this private member's bill, an act to amend the Canada 
Post Corporation Act, only deals with one small aspect, the rural 
route mail couriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it has been recognized that there is a problem, I do 
not see this as a solution.  In fact it would probably make it 
much worse.  We would see a number of unions trying to decide who 
would control these employees, and I am not so sure that is what 
the employees want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the employees really want at the end of the day is an open, 
transparent tendering process with sealed bids so they can bid 
openly and fairly and receive fair compensation for the contracts 
they are awarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Free enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Free enterprise.  That is it in a 
nutshell, much as it is done in the private sector.  That is what 
should happen, but that is not what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening is that contracts are being bid on and then 
negotiations are being held after the fact.  I cannot imagine 
anything so ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I cannot speak for all members, the majority of us will 
be voting against this private member's bill.  In my discussions 
with members they have indicated that they have concerns with the 
bill.  Nevertheless, it identifies a problem that needs to be 
addressed.  The Government of Canada should instruct Canada Post 
to ensure that independent contractors are treated fairly, that 
there is an open and transparent tendering process, such as there 
is in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is it in a nutshell.  I cannot add much more.  Again, I 
call upon the government to address the situation to ensure that 
Canada Post has a tendering process, not only for rural route 
mail couriers but for all of the people in the other 
organizations, which is fair, open and transparent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand on behalf of my 
colleague from Winnipeg Centre who presented this very important 
private member's bill, Bill C-238, which would repeal section 
13(5) of the Canada Post Act which restricts contractors from 
being treated as employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre presented this 
bill was not only to represent the 5,000 people who do a superb 
job in delivering Canada Post's mail from coast to coast to coast 
in the very rural and very far-reaching areas of this country, it 
was also to correct a historical wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately these people have been restricted from obtaining 
any kind of furtherance in economic value by the restrictions 
which the Canada Post Act places upon them.  They are not, in any 
way, shape or form, considered under the Canada Labour Code. 
Rural route couriers form one of the major sectors which is 
excluded from the Canada Labour Code strictly for economic 
reasons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe at one time in our history those economic reasons may 
appear valid, but they are no longer valid.  I will read a 
subsection which asks why subsection 13(5) denies RRMCs, rural 
route mail couriers, their basic rights.  Andre Ouellet outlined 
in 1980 when he was postmaster general that there were largely 
financial reasons for including subsection 13(5) which prohibits 
collective bargaining.  He said that 60% of RRMCs worked fewer 
than four hours per day and if unionized would press for full 
time work.  He also said that costs would escalate.  That is 
absolute nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today most RRMCs work eight or more hours a day.  When they have 
a contract with Canada Post they are restricted from working 
anywhere else.  Part of the contract is that they can only do 
that and nothing else.  It restricts them in terms of their 
economic lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands and 
his party are not supporting this initiative.  If he truly cared 
about the 5,000 RRMCs across the country he would go to the back 
lobby and instruct his party that this is actually a very good 
initiative.  Perhaps he is afraid that these 5,000 people, heaven 
forbid, may want to organize themselves into a union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what we are pressing for.  We are saying that if 
those people desire to organize, if they choose to organize, 
which they already are doing right now in terms of a quasi-group, 
an association to press issues forward through all members of 
parliament, they should have the right to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a democracy.  The member for Saanich—Gulf Islands, 
whom I respect tremendously as a friend, should know that one of 
the key fundamentals of democracy is that workers have the right 
to organize.  Whether or not he agrees with union principles is 
not the question.  They should have the right to organize, and 
that is part of what this private member's bill will enable them 
to do if they so desire.  The key point is for them to bargain 
collectively with the employer, which in this case is Canada 
Post, a crown corporation of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post in past years has made a tremendous amount of money 
in profit.  A lot of it came from rural route mail couriers 
across the country.  Pretty soon when the contracts come up 
Canada Post will contact the current holders of contracts, for 
example in Jeddore and Sheet Harbour in my riding or in areas 
outside Prince Rupert, in Yukon and in other areas of northern 
Manitoba or wherever, to say that the contract bidding time has 
come up and it expects them to lower their bid in the event they 
wish to be successful in furthering the contract.  After working 
three, four or five years, depending on the length of the 
contract, they are being asked to work for less when inflationary 
pressures and everything else have hit them very hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you understand, Mr. Speaker, being from the great riding 
of Kingston and the Islands, that a large part of rural Canada 
is suffering under the weight of the lack of infrastructure, the 
lack of medical and educational facilities and the lack of 
business opportunities.  These people are out in the dead of 
winter.  Can we imagine delivering mail at 35 degrees below zero 
in northern Saskatchewan?  That is a tremendous task and they are 
doing it for far less than the minimum wage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we tell these people that for economic reasons they are not 
allowed to organize?  I say no.  The easiest thing the government 
could do, and perhaps it could sneak it into the budget today, is 
repeal subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post Act.  We would all be 
happier for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Liberal members come from rural ridings.  They must speak 
with these people on a daily basis, I am sure.  They understand 
this is a very good initiative and would put the government in a 
good light with 5,000 people.  We may even applaud the Liberals 
for their effort on this very rare occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is whether or not there are fairness and equity in 
today's government.  We have now passed into the new millennium. 
It is really unfortunate that as we turned the calendar we left 
5,000 people and their families behind.  It is an important 
initiative.  I encourage all members of the House to look into 
themselves to see if it is fair to discriminate against 5,000 
people who do yeoman's work every day out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people in rural Canada do not have access to the Internet. 
They do not have access to the technologies of today.  Their 
major link to government is through Canada Post, through the mail 
system.  The first people they see are those people whose 
basements have been transformed into a postal outlet. 
Or, the first person they see is the one at their mailboxes on 
rural roads who delivers the mail sometimes in very treacherous 
conditions.  To them they represent government and the best part 
of government, a warm body.  They actually get to speak to 
someone who is working for the government through the Canada Post 
Corporation.  The average person out there thinks of these people 
as employees of the government when in reality they are not. That 
is most unfortunate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should have been presented many years ago.  Thank 
goodness the member for Winnipeg Centre had the foresight and 
aptitude to understand this was a very serious issue and 
presented it for debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned before that their contracts with Canada Post 
prohibit them from doing work for other companies while 
performing their post office duties.  Canada Post controls the 
timeframes for sorting and delivering the mail, the order of 
delivery on routes, the number of returns to the post office, and 
the manner in which the mail is sorted.  Rural route mail 
couriers have to hire their own replacements, not because they 
are entrepreneurs who control their own work but because their 
contracts require they find replacements when they are sick or on 
vacation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post has total administrative control over the day to day 
work of the RRMCs.  Canada Post does not give them the mail and 
leave to them how they wish to deliver it.  Rather there is a 
whole set of rules that determine how RRMCs do their work and 
there is direct supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically what do RRMCs want?  They want subsection 13(5) of the 
Canada Post Corporation Act repealed so they can bargain 
collectively.  Letter carriers of Canada Post do the same work in 
other ways and they have collective bargaining rights.  Private 
sector workers who deliver parcels in rural areas also have 
collective bargaining rights as do rural route postal workers in 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this day and age of free trade, globalization, NAFTA, et 
cetera, why would the so-called great democracy below us, the 
United States, allow its rural route mail couriers in its many 
rural areas to have the ability to bargain collectively for their 
rights? Why is it that Canada excludes that?  The reason is 
subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post Act, which needs to be 
repealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at length about this issue but what we need to do 
is quite clear.  It would make the government look good, 
especially at budget time.  The Liberals could even use it as an 
election ploy.  I am sure they would love to use something to 
help them out after the recent HRDC fiasco, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleague from Winnipeg Centre and all members 
of the New Democratic Party federally and provincially across the 
country, we are proud to stand on behalf of over 5,000 rural 
route mail couriers so that subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post 
Act is repealed and these people are included in the Canada 
Labour Code and have collective bargaining rights for themselves 
and their families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with pleasure that I rise today to participate in the debate 
on Bill C-238, an act to amend the Canada Post Corporation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remind all members present of the incredible 
economic progress and turnaround that Canada Post has achieved in 
the years since its creation as a commercial crown corporation. I 
will not go into great detail on this point other than to say 
that since 1981 Canada Post has transformed itself into a 
profitable enterprise through a combination of innovation 
marketing, sound planning and good business practices.   However, 
above all, this remarkable performance is a tribute to the men 
and women of Canada Post who daily provide to Canadians a high 
quality and cost efficient postal service.  I know all members 
join with me in paying this tribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated earlier in the debate, Canada Post's primary mandate 
is to ensure that all Canadians receive reliable and affordable 
postal service.  To some this essential service is taken for 
granted.  It is sometimes easy to forget the challenges the sheer 
size of the nation presents to Canada Post in maintaining service 
on a daily basis yet remaining competitive with businesses that 
do not have to meet such an important and vital requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key to Canada Post's ability to provide a reliable and cost 
efficient mail service is its use of contractors.  Here is the 
crux of the matter and why I believe Bill C-238 to be 
fundamentally flawed.  The bill seeks to repeal subsection 13(5) 
of the Canada Post Corporation Act, thereby allowing that 
contractors who consider themselves to be dependent within the 
meaning of part I of the Canada Labour Code may be found to be 
employees for collective bargaining purposes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would involve or impact upon all contractors regardless of 
the nature of their work or contracted activity.  Put simply, to 
allow passage of the bill would significantly affect the 
corporation's ability to meet its objective and would mean 
serious increases in costs with no accompanying improvement in 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post simply cannot afford to take on thousands of new 
full time employees.  Such an unnecessary and unjustified action 
would wipe away years of hard work to build a profitable, 
competitive, world class business.  The author of the bill, in a 
misguided attempt to change the status of one type of contractor, 
the rural route contractor, has failed to comprehend the dire 
consequences and far-reaching implications of this proposed 
legislative change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural route contractors have had a long and proud relationship 
with Canada Post.  For decades now these people have delivered 
the mail in rural and in some cases remote areas of our country. 
They play an important part in Canada Post's mandate to deliver 
mail to all Canadians.  They are reliable, hardworking 
individuals who take pride in the valuable work they perform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases mail contractors reside on or near their 
designated routes and are therefore not only performing a vital 
service on behalf of Canada Post but also ensuring that their own 
neighbours receive mail in a reliable and efficient manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what has been overlooked by some is the essential fact 
that rural route contractors are not employees of Canada Post or 
a group of workers being denied fundamental rights.  They are 
valued contractors who have fundamentally different work 
relationships than those employed full time by the corporation. 
Let us examine very briefly the wording of subsection 13(5) which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding any provision of Part I of the Canada Labour 
Code, for the purposes of the application of that Part to the 
Corporation and to officers and employees of the Corporation, a 
mail contractor is deemed not to be a dependent contractor or an 
employee within the meaning of those terms in subsection 3(1) of 
that Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural route mail contractors are awarded their respective 
contracts through a competitive tender process.  This type of 
work is of a part time nature and individuals seek this work to 
supplement their income, not to obtain full or part time employee 
status with Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conditions are spelled out in the contract documentation. 
Let me make it very clear that rural route couriers agree that 
these terms are in full understanding of conditions governing 
this type of contracted work.  It is also not their primary 
employment or source of income.  Nor does it lead to some form of 
permanent employment status within the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind members that the Federal Court of Appeal ruled in 
1987 that rural route couriers were indeed contractors as defined 
in the Canada Post Corporation Act.  In addition, the federal 
court found that subsection 13(5) did not violate any equality 
rights as defined in our charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind the bill is an attempt to portray rural route contractors 
as being abused, underpaid and generally exploited by Canada 
Post.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Rural route 
contractors are treated and compensated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague has already mentioned the improvements made by 
Canada Post to its contract tendering process that will increase 
opportunities for more Canadians to do business with it, 
particularly in rural areas.  In addition, I believe the 
corporation should also be congratulated on a number of 
improvements it has made as a result of listening to rural route 
contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Measures that have been recently implemented are designed to 
improve their training, support and the early resolution of 
issues.  There is always room for improvement and any business 
that ignores this basic rule does so at its own peril.  I know 
that Canada Post is an organization that constantly strives for 
improvement in everything it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will not support the bill and I would encourage my 
fellow members to seriously consider the factors that have made 
Canada Post the world class organization it is.  It has proven 
its ability to meet its primary mandate and to successfully 
compete in a demanding and rapidly changing market.  Let us not 
place unnecessary hurdles such as Bill C-238 in front of those at 
Canada Post.  They have earned our support and it is our duty to 
give it by voting against the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strangely enough I find myself agreeing with Reformers in that 
many of the changes implemented over the last two years have been 
implemented as a result of their regular communication with the 
department.  I think that is the avenue they need to pursue to 
improve conditions as we have done in the last year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak to Bill C-238 put forward by the member for Winnipeg 
Centre.  This bill would delete section 13(5) from the Canada 
Post Corporation Act and require the Post Office to hire on as 
full time salaried employees all of the mail contractors whom it 
now does business with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first congratulate the NDP member for bringing attention 
to this issue.  As I understand it he is primarily concerned with 
the rural mail contractors and the treatment they receive in 
their relationships with Canada Post, although the measure he has 
proposed would have effect going far beyond just the rural mail 
couriers.  Even though we differ in our prescription for the 
problems faced by rural mail contractors, we can certainly agree 
that rural couriers have been subject to some of the most 
unprofessional business practices at the hands of the government 
owned monopoly. This needs to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been dealing with this issue as a party since before the 
last election.  My colleague the member for Tobique—Mactaquac 
has discussed this issue with representatives of the Canadian 
Union of Postal Workers, the Organization of Rural Route Mail 
Couriers and Canada Post Corporation. Many of my colleagues have 
also met with the rural route mail couriers in the past year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Canada Post became a crown corporation in 1981 by 
means of the Canada Post Corporation Act.  As such its labour 
practices were no longer governed by the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act but by the Canada Labour Code, which allows 
dependent contractors to unionize, something not provided for by 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act provided an 
exemption to section 3(1) of the Canada Labour Code which deems 
all of the Canada Post mail contractors, including rural route 
mail couriers, not to be dependent contractors. In 1981 under the 
guidance of our former postmaster and at that time Progressive 
Conservative postal critic John Fraser, our caucus voted to 
support section 13(5) for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, this provision continued the historical 
relationship that Canada Post has always had with its mail 
contractors.  Our national mail service has contracted for rural 
route delivery since before confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it was felt that changing that relationship could 
potentially increase the operating costs of the corporation 
substantially with no corresponding improvement in service levels 
to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Organization of Rural Route Mail Couriers, 
there are presently 7,000 rural mail contractors in Canada.  If 
we compare the value of the average contract with the cost of a 
salaried unionized Canada Post letter carrier, there is a 
difference of between $15,000 to $20,000.  That means to convert 
all 7,000 mail contractors to full time unionized post office 
employees would cost up to $140 million.  Where would the money 
come from to make this change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Post Office could raise stamp prices and the prices for 
other postal services and the customers would have to pay.  But 
Canada Post is limited to increasing stamp prices at less than 
the rate of inflation so most of the money would have to come 
from elsewhere.  That elsewhere of course would be the taxpayer. 
Canada Post would be pushed back into a deficit position and the 
difference would have to be made up by taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would Canadians get in exchange for shelling out more money 
for their postal service?  Better service?  Better or more 
frequent delivery?  No.  In exchange for the $140 million, 
Canadians would see no improvement in postal service.  This is 
not a change my party is prepared to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the nature of this change would have removed some of the 
flexibility for both parties to negotiate an arrangement 
particularly suited for each individual contractor.  For example, 
under the current arrangement contractors have the ability to 
subcontract while employees do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this arrangement kept Canada Post on a level footing 
with many private sector companies which also use private 
contractors for deliveries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of these reasons our party continues to support section 
13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act. That is why we cannot 
support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me however set our opposition to the specific measure 
proposed by the hon. member.  Anyone who has ever done business 
can tell us that more often than not, Canada Post is big, 
bureaucratic and bullying.  Its guiding principle seems to be 
squeezing out as much as it can from customers, suppliers and 
partners.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two examples come to mind: postal rental retail franchisees and 
the ad mail program for large volume customers.  In both 
instances, Canada Post arbitrarily introduced large changes that 
were poorly communicated and very costly to the people with whom 
it did business.  In both cases business partners were not 
consulted on changes but were instructed that they had to 
purchase new, expensive and confusing systems if they wanted to 
continue to do business with Canada Post.  In the former case 
commissions were simultaneously slashed, while in the latter case 
costs were unilaterally raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sounds a lot like how Canada Post treated rural mail 
contractors.  In many conversations with individual contractors, 
with representatives from the Organization of Rural Route Mail 
Couriers, CUPE and some Canada Post employees, we have heard many 
horror stories about the contracting practices of the post 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, at one point it was common practice that when a 
delivery contract was up for renewal, a Canada Post employee 
would phone up a contractor saying that it had received a bid 
from another source which was thousands of dollars less than what 
the contractor was currently being paid.  Because Canada Post 
operates a closed bidding system, there was no way for the 
contractor to verify the claim of the postal representative. The 
contractor would be faced with the difficult decision to undercut 
his or her own price by several thousands of dollars or lose the 
contract. These and other bad faith practices by the post office 
have led my party into discussions with Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of complaints from contractors and others acting on 
their behalf, the post office has introduced a series of new 
measures that I hope will alleviate a great number of the 
difficulties contractors have had in the past.  These include the 
following. Rural routes will be contracted individually. 
Contractors that in turn subcontract out their routes at a 
reduced price will be ineligible for renewal.  Rural contracts 
will be issued for five years with a five year renewal option 
based on satisfactory performance and tendering after 10 years. A 
negotiated adjustment will be included for the five year renewal 
option to ensure that market conditions such as inflation are 
considered. A performance component will be included in the 
contract renewal and awarding process to recognize the past 
performance of incumbent contractors.  The evaluation of tenders 
will be based on criteria such as experience, performance, 
reliability, image and cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, when contracts are up for bid, Canada Post will 
make contractors aware of the specifications of the routes they 
will be performing, such as the number of points of call, daily 
kilometres, number of stops for personal contact items and the 
amount of ad mail they can expect to deliver.  These numbers will 
be updated annually or more frequently if a significant change 
occurs.  Contractors will be compensated for these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The post office has also prepared a handbook to provide 
assistance and guidance with a reference and a phone directory of 
key individuals at Canada Post to call when a problem arises.  In 
addition, local supervisors and postmasters will be provided with 
an operator's handbook and supporting training material to assist 
them in working with contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post is currently in discussion with representatives of 
rural route mail couriers in order to finalize this new package. 
I am hopeful that both sides will be able to improve on the 
relationship they have had in the past and will be able to agree 
on a set of business practices they both can live with.  In the 
meantime we will continue to work with and listen to rural mail 
couriers to ensure that they are treated fairly and that Canada 
Post deals with problems that arise in a timely and equitable 
fashion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak in favour of Bill C-238 which has been 
presented to the House by the member for Winnipeg Centre.  In 
many ways it is a telling piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to the House, I talked about the new two 
solitudes in Canada.  Those solitudes are urban and rural Canada. 
Increasingly the government tends to cater toward urban Canada. 
People from the regions of the country, whether they are in my 
region in the east, Saskatchewan or the north, see that there are 
different standards and different rights for people in different 
parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation deals directly with a vital service to rural 
Canada, the delivery of mail to people in rural parts of the 
country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was shocked and did not know until I read this legislation 
that rural route mail carriers are denied fundamental rights that 
are guaranteed to many other Canadians particularly in urban 
centres. We have to ask why. We know why the Liberal government 
justified it almost 20 years ago when they were exempted.  But we 
have to ask why today are 5,000 people denied the right to 
collective bargaining? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a new millennium.  We heard and lived with the hype 
leading up to new year's eve about how this is a new century. 
Surely we do not have to repeat the same mistakes of the last 
century. Surely there should be the right to collective 
bargaining, the right for workers to come together and say that 
they collectively want to ensure that they have a better standard 
of living.  Surely we do not have to go back to 1920 or 1930. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those workers, as has already been stated, do some of the most 
difficult work. I know because I represent an area that has rural 
route mail service.  I can talk about the northern part of Cape 
Breton, Inverness and Victoria counties. The rural route mail 
carriers are vital especially to seniors. Seniors are the ones 
who wait for parcels from many of their children who have been 
called to the urban centres because that is where the work is. 
For those people the rural route mail carriers represent a vital 
link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that these 5,000 employees across the country are 
denied the same basic rights as their urban counterparts?  They 
do the same kind of work so it cannot be justified on that 
ground. What do they face because they do not have the same 
rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their employment can be terminated on 90 days notice.  Surely in 
this day and age 5,000 Canadian workers who are told that they 
have to submit bids in a lower tendering process, have the right 
to come together and say “We would like to organize so we can 
bargain with the employer and we will not be constantly under the 
gun or constantly having to downgrade our standard of living”. 
Today if they were to say they do not like the conditions, they 
could be terminated on 90 days notice. If I were one of those 
carriers that is one aspect I would seek to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no benefits.  Imagine that workers, who everyone 
assumes work for Canada Post but who are in fact independent 
contractors, are denied the same benefits that their urban 
counterparts have.  They are denied bereavement leave.  There was 
one postal worker whose parents were both rural carriers.  She 
had to use her bereavement leave to deliver her mother's route 
when her father died so that her mother could attend the funeral. 
In the year 2000 in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And we are going to deny these people the right to come together 
collectively, to organize, to change these kinds of things to get 
the kinds of benefits that most Canadians take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the tendering process.  They have to bid on their 
routes.  They also have to do all kinds of other work.  They are 
the ones who have to shovel out and clear away the area around 
the mail boxes.  There is no compensation for that.  They do all 
kinds of extra work and they get no benefit for it.  If they 
complain, the employer can say, “If you do not like it, here is 
your three months notice.  We will find somebody else in the 
rural community to deliver the mail”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might say that is the free market economy and that we 
should let it dominate.  I say that it is unfair to the rural 
people and to the rural economy.  Even if one person gets better 
pay in a rural economy there are spinoff factors.  It comes down 
to why rural communities are treated differently.  Why are rural 
workers not treated in the same way as urban workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the NDP arguing this.  Perhaps most telling is 
the Canada Labour Relations Board decision regarding this.  For 
those who do not know, the labour board is like a court.  The 
clarity bill, which will be coming before the House, was based on 
a ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada on the Quebec succession 
agreement.  The government has often taken rulings of the courts 
and incorporated them into legislation.  It says that the matter 
has been articulated and argued before the courts which have 
given some guidelines, so it will enact legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Labour Relations Board is no different.  It is not 
partisan, at least we hope it is not.  It gives us some rational 
guidelines to go by.  These rural route mail couriers brought 
their case to the Canada Labour Relations Board and it decided 
that there was a similar content in the two kinds of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre is seeking in his bill 
is to guarantee those 5,000 workers the same basic rights as 
other workers have in the country.  I cannot believe that members 
of the Liberal Party would oppose giving collective bargaining 
rights to people in the country.  I cannot imagine the Minister 
of Labour being able to look her colleagues in the face.  I know 
the Minister of Labour supports collective bargaining.  The test, 
I suppose, for the other members of her caucus is to see if they 
support the collective bargaining rights that have been fought 
for and are hard won by the workers in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a private member's bill and I do not know whether the 
Liberals will have to vote as a block. It will be interesting to 
see whether they grant one of the things that makes this country 
so different from perhaps other countries and that is the right 
of workers to collectively organize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague said, I cannot believe we would deny rural route 
mail couriers a right that American rural route mail couriers 
have.  I have never thought of the United States as a bastion of 
labour legislation and to allow America to be a guiding light is 
a shameful statement for this country.  For us to be in the 
shadows of America when it comes to granting rights to our 
workers is something I think the people in my riding are ashamed 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a private member's bill that will give members of 
parliament an opportunity to do the right thing.  I would ask 
them to do so and support the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before resuming debate, the Chair has 
a confession to make, having made a mistake.  The Chair 
recognized the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services for the second time in this debate, 
which of course is not allowed, and did not realize his blunder 
until after the parliamentary secretary had spoken.  I apologize 
to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a great honour to rise today and speak to Bill C-238. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to my colleague from the New 
Democratic Party on the opposite side speak about things 
American.  My mind flipped back to the last election when the NDP 
found it necessary to go the United States to get some of its 
work done in terms of the election.  I always find it interesting 
when members opposite, such as the hon. member, say one thing and 
yet the party, at least during the last election, does quite 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it is with great interest that I speak today 
about this very important bill.  At the outset, I want to express 
my great respect for the hardworking Canadian men and women who 
deliver our mail.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a substantial background in this subject as my father was 
a rural route mail courier for 35 years.  He did that with honour 
and in terms of doing the right thing for my family and for the 
community.  I am happy to contribute to the debate to improve the 
working conditions of these entrepreneurs who are rural route 
mail couriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the member for Winnipeg Centre has received 
representation from the Organization of Rural Route Mail 
Couriers, as most of us have over the past little while.  He has 
decided now to support them by tabling this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Bill C-238 would allow contractors to be considered 
as employees of Canada Post.  Ironically, I do not think the bill 
would benefit the very group it is trying to help.  I agree with 
the hon. member for Kelowna on this point, and I think there are 
others in the House who would agree with us as well, that it 
would in fact harm them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural route contractors continue to do this work, primarily 
because it gives them flexibility.  They do not have to punch a 
clock and they do not have to do exactly what people tell them to 
do.  More importantly, they can exercise their own initiatives 
and resourcefulness in this important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Winnipeg Centre knows, much of this work is of 
a part time nature.  During the last hour of debate the member 
himself stated that rural route couriers do this work to earn 
supplementary income for their families.  Repealing subsection 
13(5) of the Canada Post Corporation Act, as Bill C-238 suggests, 
would eliminate all this.  I would think this is not at all what 
we want to do here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I echo the comments from the member for Kelowna who said that 
Bill C-238 would take away the flexibility these people enjoy 
today, both on the rural route courier side and on the Canada 
Post side.  Clearly it would do away with that and do away with a 
way of life.  I do not think that is what parliament and 
Canadians ultimately want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the small and medium size business sector in Canada 
is growing very rapidly.  More and more Canadians are choosing 
this way of life because it offers them flexibility and 
opportunity.  The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre said that rural 
route contractors do not want these freedoms and would prefer to 
become employees of Canada Post instead, paying union dues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-238 would not only jeopardize the entrepreneurialism of 
the rural route contractors, it would also have a significant 
financial impact on Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Tobique—Mactaquac previously stated, 
changing Canada Post's contracting relationship with rural route 
contractors would potentially increase the operating costs of the 
corporation substantially with no corresponding improvement in 
service levels to the public.  That is important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not stand here today and pretend that I have not heard 
the concerns of rural route contractors.  I have and I think they 
are important to listen to.  It is important to understand and, 
as I said before, my father was one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news is that Canada Post is listening.  The corporation 
has taken concrete steps and measures to resolve their concerns. 
For example, during the first hour of debate on this bill, and 
again today, the common message that has been heard is that rural 
route contractors want a tendering process that is fair, open and 
transparent.  Canada Post has said that this is exactly what they 
can expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a recent appearance before the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources and Government Operations, the president of Canada 
Post, the Hon. André Ouellet, said that the rural route 
contractors will be treated with respect and their work will be 
valued and remunerated according to the contract they have signed 
with Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Ouellet also confirmed that he has had several meetings over 
the past few months with representatives of the contractors and 
the couriers.  As a result, Canada Post has introduced a number 
of initiatives to improve its relationship with this very 
important partner, especially in communities in rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives will provide rural route contractors with more 
information and greater support which they require to meet the 
needs and expectations of customers across this great country of 
ours.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly the best solution for rural route contractors, 
Canada Post and all Canadians.  The rural route contractors 
maintain the entrepreneurial freedom that they have traditionally 
enjoyed over time and Canadians in turn maintain a high quality, 
cost efficient and effective postal service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament, I am concerned that Canadians get the 
best service possible from their post office no matter where they 
live, and especially in rural Canada.  I am very happy that we 
have now put in place a moratorium on the closing of post offices 
because there were some in my area that were in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada Post has now introduced a number of changes to improve 
postal service in rural Canada.  Canada Post has implemented 96 
local areas to help improve the speed and reliability of mail 
outside of core urban areas.  Delivery standards in rural Canada 
are now the same as those in the urban communities.  That is good 
news for all Canadians.  As well, local staff in rural offices 
now have the flexibility to adopt community based hours to suit 
local needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government and Canada Post are collaborating to 
make government information on programs and services more 
available to rural Canada and all Canadians.  In this regard, 12 
Service Canada access centres have been established in rural post 
offices across Canada.  These are but a few examples of Canada 
Post's continuing efforts to improve the postal service for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I do not support Bill C-238, I agree with all hon. 
members who firmly believe that rural route mail contractors and 
carriers deserve to be treated fairly and with respect.  I hope 
that Canada Post continues to listen and to act on the concerns 
expressed by these very important entrepreneurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members not to support the bill.  I do not think it 
is in the best interest of Canadians.  We should proceed on that 
basis knowing that we will ultimately, as the government, do the 
right thing for not only rural Canadians but for all Canadians no 
matter where they live in this great country of ours. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I know there is not a lot of time left to debate this 
private member's bill but clearly Canada Post has to take a 
serious look at improving conditions for rural mail couriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two different sets of rules in Canada Post:  carriers 
who deliver mail in the city and the rural mail deliverers.  Most 
of them are working at minimum wage to deliver mail in rural 
Canada.  Whether it is through the mechanism that the member is 
talking about or something else, we have to redefine the 
relationship with Canada Post in terms of how it negotiates with 
these people who have a very important job in our society.  I 
feel they have been mistreated for a number of years by Canada 
Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do people in rural Canada have to deliver mail at minimum 
wage, use their own automobiles and compete neighbour against 
neighbour on a contract which they have had for years when the 
city mail carriers, those in the union, do not and do not work by 
the same set of rules? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something has to change.  We, as parliamentarians, have to make 
it very clear to Canada Post that it has to negotiate with these 
rural couriers in good faith.  Everyone of these people, no 
matter whether it is in my home province of New Brunswick or 
British Columbia, are working under the same set of rules. 
Basically there are no rules.  Canada Post makes them up as it 
goes along, much to the detriment of the very people who are 
delivering the mail in rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, they now have to take on two or three 
mail routes by themselves in one particular area simply to make 
ends meet and make it profitable.  It means that many Canadians 
are having their mail delivered later or not at all simply 
because we are forcing rural mail couriers to do more with less.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that we took a serious look at how Canada Post 
negotiates with these people, because it is patently unfair. 
There is no other group in society that we would allow to be 
treated in such a fashion, given the importance of the job they 
do.  I commend the member for Winnipeg Centre for bringing 
forward this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us would disagree as to whether it should be a union or 
something else, but I think that most of us would agree that 
something definitely has to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alice Boudreau represents the Organization of Rural Route Mail 
Couriers.  She has visited just about every rural member of 
parliament on both sides of the House.  She represents drivers 
from all across Canada.  When she appeared before us and laid out 
the situation which she and other drivers are faced with, we 
could not help but feel sorry for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying this in a derogatory or demeaning way, but if we 
look at the rural couriers, most of them are not driving new 
cars.  They are not living in million dollar houses.  The fact is 
that most of them, after all of their expenses, are working at 
minimum wage.   I have to explain the term minimum wage because 
obviously they bid for a contract.  They bid for the right to 
deliver mail.  They bid against other people in society.  In the 
real world there is nothing wrong with that.  Each one of us bids 
for a position in the House.  We put our reputations and our 
careers on the line.  At the end of the day the constituents 
determine whether it will be me or someone else representing them 
in the House of Commons.  That is true for every member of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is unfair for rural postal drivers because Canada 
Post, as I have mentioned before, does not negotiate in good 
faith.  It will take a look at the bids that come in and then go 
back to the rural drivers carrying the mail and tell them that 
someone has submitted a lower bid.  Canada Post says “We want to 
let you know that there is a bid which is lower than yours”. 
Individuals who have been carrying the mail for years are forced 
to underbid themselves simply to get their jobs back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can hon. members name one organization in the free world that 
negotiates in that fashion?  That is what Canada Post does.  That 
is what is driving rural mail contractors to say they need some 
kind of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who presented the bill says that we will have to take 
a look at a union of sorts.  I do not think a union is the key to 
solving the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Yes, we know it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  We can disagree.  I know that the 
member who interjected is a union representative.  That is fair. 
There is nothing wrong with that.  However, in greater society, 
no matter what corporation we are dealing with, not every person 
in the world is unionized.  None of us here is unionized.  Most 
of the companies in my home province of New Brunswick are 
non-unionized.  It is one of the most non-unionized provinces in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that unions are not the key to immediate success, 
clarification or resolving the problem.  The real key is for 
Canada Post to negotiate in good faith, recognizing that these 
people have a very important job to do.  It is a job on which all 
of us in the House depend.  We would not allow this to happen in 
the city of Ottawa.  We would not allow it to happen in downtown 
Vancouver.  It is basically the city mouse versus the country 
mouse.  In this case the country mouse is losing out simply 
because it has no protection under the rules which have been set 
for it by Canada Post.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed, from February 24, consideration of Bill C-13, 
an act to establish the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 
to repeal the Medical Research Council Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, as reported (with 
amendments) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No.1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this bill to 
establish a body, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 
has the virtue of bringing some very greatly desired investment 
into health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, after making drastic cuts in health research and 
transfers to the provinces, the federal government has chosen to 
reinject funds by creating these virtual institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we saw last week, the objective set out in the preamble for 
these institutes is not solely to co-ordinate research,  but also 
to centralize and integrate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the research centres in Quebec, which have often 
been supported by the Centre de recherche biomédicale, are 
losing their desired autonomy.  There is nothing in this bill 
that is the least bit reassuring.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the motion lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resuming debate, the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-13, which establishes 
the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. This bill is now at 
report stage, following the hearing of witnesses and clause by 
clause consideration by the Standing Committee on Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois supported the 
principle of the bill and voted in favour of it at second 
reading stage. First of all, I want to congratulate my 
colleague, the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve and health critic 
for the Bloc Quebecois, for working so hard on the health 
committee to try to convince the government majority that this 
bill needed amendments to make it acceptable to Quebecers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard my colleague from the New Democratic Party, the 
member for Winnipeg North Centre, talk to us about all the 
amendments she proposed to the government because she wanted to 
see some changes made to the bill. In many respects, she finds 
it just as unacceptable to Canadians. However, members of the 
government majority have shown no openness with regard to the 
amendments proposed by the opposition parties and no co-operation 
whatsoever. Therefore, my colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve 
had no choice but to bring forward his amendments here, in the 
House, at report stage, to give us at least an opportunity to 
talk about what is unacceptable in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 is important to us.  However, as it is worded, it 
concerns us.  In fact in its 52 clauses, it refers over 15 times 
to research into the health care system and health issues, which 
are without a shadow of a doubt provincial matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the amendments moved by the Bloc Quebecois make it clear 
that the bill focuses on health research and not on the 
potential expansion of mandates beyond the field of research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wants to make sure that it is the provinces 
making the decisions on the choices and principles underlying 
the health care networks and services to the public as is 
provided in the Constitution, which the Liberals claim they are 
defending and which they are blithely flouting with ever more 
obvious encroachment on provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government was not at war with Quebec, when it 
respected its partners in the Canadian federation, when it was 
not led by individuals with complexes who need to go behind 
Quebec's back to reassure themselves that they are powerful, 
when it was guided by the values of public good and community 
welfare rather than political visibility, it passed laws in this 
House creating federal agencies such as the Medical Research 
Council or the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council 
that respected provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore possible for the federal government to introduce 
bills without disregarding provincial jurisdictions, which also 
means that Bill C-13 could quite easily have been amended to 
reflect the distribution of jurisdictions at each level of 
government without watering content down.  The government's bill 
ignores the distribution of jurisdictions. 
This negates the very principle of what a federal government 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois introduced amendments to allow 
the establishment of these institutes while also respecting the 
distribution of jurisdictions. These amendments also seek to 
ensure that what is being promoted is indeed the communication 
of information among researchers, so as to improve health 
networks, rather than the implementation of rules defined 
without the provinces' input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-13, the government once again decided to invade a 
provincial jurisdiction and to legislate without having had the 
courtesy of inviting its partners in the federation to help 
develop this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this government claims to know better than all the other 
governments what needs to be done regarding biomedical research. 
Once again, as was the case with the millennium scholarships or 
the transitional job fund, the federal government is finding 
ways to spend our billions, which are not its money, as it 
pleases, primarily to gain more visibility and buy votes in the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, some will argue that the interim governing council that 
developed this bill included Quebecers, competent people, and I 
have no doubt that this was indeed the case. Through their 
experience and expertise, these people undoubtedly made a 
remarkable contribution while sitting on the interim governing 
council. However, they had no mandate to represent Quebec and, 
more importantly, these people's primary concern was not to be a 
watchdog for the Constitution and for the respective 
jurisdictions of the various levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that this government, which claims to be a champion 
of clarity, which wants to give lessons in democracy to the 
whole world and which boasts that Canada is the most 
decentralized federation in the world, is afraid of giving real 
autonomy to these research institutes? Is this government that 
afraid of true decentralization?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this arrogant, conceited, know-it-all government is 
refusing to listen to the opposition's call to reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not so much the creation of the institutes of health 
research that should put us on our guard but the fact that once 
the institutes come into being, even virtually, there will still 
be a serious risk that, with their federal mandate, they will 
conduct research into public health services without first 
consulting with the provinces, thus interfering directly in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is therefore proposing a series of amendments 
whose primary purpose is to emphasize the importance of 
respecting respective jurisdictions and to reaffirm that 
provincial jurisdiction takes precedence over federal 
jurisdiction when it comes to health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment in research and development is necessary and very 
much desired in hospital and university research circles.  In 
addition, it is important that Quebec receive its fair share of 
federal research and development grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, Quebec has been seriously neglected when it 
comes to research and development grants and it is high time 
that the federal government restored the balance by ensuring 
that additional funds are made available to researchers and 
universities so that they can pursue their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, it is known that Quebec receives only 14% of 
federal government research and development spending with 
respect to infrastructures.  However, it is well known that 
research grants are awarded on the basis of merit.  It is also 
important to note that, under the peer assessment system, 
approximately 30% of grants go to researchers in Quebec.  It 
must therefore be recognized that Quebec's researchers are good 
at what they do and that they excel, particularly in the fields 
of mental health, cancer, and genome and biotechnology research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should therefore come as no surprise that the Bloc Quebecois 
is in favour of increasing research and development budgets by 
creating virtual institutes and that it has supported this 
principle at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must respect the specific characteristics 
and strengths of researchers in the regions of Quebec in order 
to focus on their successes and their skills in the areas in 
which they excel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois says yes to the creation of a flexible and 
multidisciplinary structure to facilitate the organization of 
health research.  The Bloc Quebecois says yes to increased R and D 
funding in the health field.  The Bloc Quebecois says yes to all 
measures of such a nature as to provide more security to our 
researchers and to slow down the brain drain.  The Bloc 
Quebecois does not, however, say yes no matter what the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We set two preconditions: the government must put an end to its 
diversionary tactics and re-establish the transfer payments, and 
it must respect the jurisdiction of Quebec and of all the 
provinces with Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all accept, and understand, the urgency.  But care must be 
taken to ensure that democracy does not suffer once again.  We 
have had our fill of government urgency creating great upheaval 
in the entire process of this House and of the standing 
committees.  Our duty as parliamentarians forces me to remind 
hon. members that the Bloc Quebecois is not prepared to vote in 
favour of just any bill, even one that acknowledges that the 
researchers of Quebec need funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish to state that the Bloc Quebecois is offering 
its co-operation to the federal government in getting this bill 
amended so that it will really serve the development of health 
research, while respecting federal-provincial divisions in 
jurisdiction and impacting on the health of the people of Canada 
and of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, however, our amendments should be rejected, then 
unfortunately the Bloc Quebecois will have to vote against this 
bill on third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to take part in this important debate on Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to start by saying how very proud we are of our health 
care critic, the member for Winnipeg North Centre.  She has done 
a great job in representing our concerns and interests in the 
various stages of debate on the bill. I notice that she moved 
some amendments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read with interest the speech she made on February 24. She 
cited the fact that while we are in favour of Bill C-13 and the 
whole concept of the proposed medical health research institutes, 
we have some real reservations not only about the process and how 
this bill came about but about the government's lack of 
willingness to entertain a number of the issues we raised. We 
thought they would augment the bill and add to the whole concept 
of promoting Canada as a centre of excellence for medical 
research which surely must be the ultimate goal in any bill of 
this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many groups made representations on the bill when it was before 
the committee not the least of which was the Canada Labour 
Congress.  The Canada Labour Congress brought forward a very good 
point which we are disappointed the government did not 
automatically welcome and embrace.  The issue it wanted addressed 
was that the one thing really lacking from a worker's point of 
view is that there is no medical institute specializing in 
occupational health and safety.  One would think that in this day 
and age that would be automatic, an absolute given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are concerned about occupational safety and health, which 
surely the government purports to be, it is a very timely 
recommendation.  Part II of the Canada Labour Code is currently 
being debated and amended.  That part of the labour code deals 
with occupational safety and health. Why would the government not 
have welcomed the recommendation that an institute be created 
that is dedicated solely to eliminating workplace accidents and 
lost time, injuries et cetera? Other countries have such a thing. 
The United States is way in front of us in terms of its research 
capabilities on occupational safety and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government failed to respond to what we thought was a very 
creative and a very worthwhile recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member next 
to me, it is too bad. We consider it a lost opportunity if the 
government were really soliciting input from the general public 
on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other groups have welcomed the idea of dismantling the Medical 
Research Council of Canada and replacing it with the Canadian 
institutes of health research, the CIHR.  The Canadians for 
Health Research wrote a letter recently to inform us, and I will 
repeat this publicly for the House, of a meeting that they will 
be holding here on March 22 to celebrate the creation of the new 
Canadian institutes of health research and the dismantling of the 
Medical Research Council of Canada.  The letter from this 
organization reminds us that much of the country has been eagerly 
anticipating this development.  It also reminds us that this will 
further Canada's ability to be seen as a world leader in terms of 
medical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not any secret that Canada's health system is the envy of 
the world and arguably the best not for profit and publicly 
funded health system in all of the world.  The rest of the world 
watches Canada for examples of how to expand or improve their 
health care systems.  This is another reason that what we are 
doing today with this bill is very timely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative expands the role of the public health care 
system.  It is not just the delivery of medical services to 
people in need but the whole concept of medical research as a 
holistic approach to the well-being of all Canadians.  Obviously 
this is the direction in which we should be going in the Canadian 
medical system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should repeat here some of the amendments to the bill that the 
member for Winnipeg North Centre thought it necessary to 
introduce. The government should welcome these amendments. They 
were made in good faith.  We believe they help bring clarity to 
the bill and to improve some of its shortcomings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment was Motion No. 48 in which the member for 
Winnipeg North Centre recommended that Bill C-13 be amended to 
add the words “the members of the advisory boards shall not, 
directly or indirectly, as owner, shareholder, director, 
officer”—et cetera—“have any pecuniary or proprietary 
interest in any business which operates in the pharmaceutical or 
medical devices industries”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a point which really needed to be made.  I am very glad 
the member for Winnipeg North Centre made that point. 
Clearly it is a conflict of interest situation.  She saw that the 
bill was seriously flawed. It did not say anything to preclude 
the idea that a lobbyist for a pharmaceutical firm could end up 
sitting on the advisory board of one of the research 
organizations funded by the government.  We can see how this 
could be a disaster.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Pretty cozy relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Certainly it would be a disaster.  The 
publicly funded organization could be doing research that the 
pharmaceutical company wanted to have done.  Let us face it. 
That is a glaring oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is Bill C-91 all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  I would certainly hope that the 
government would see fit to at least put in a basic safeguard so 
that none of the advisory boards shall have appointed to them 
anyone who has a financial interest in a pharmaceutical company 
or a medical devices company.  It is common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues mentioned Bill C-91.  That nightmare 
surfaces again.  We all know how powerful the pharmaceutical 
lobby is already.  We certainly do not need it infiltrating the 
boards of our medical research institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Like it does with the Liberal caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  When the Liberals failed to deliver on 
Bill C-91, when they collapsed and succumbed to the powerful 
pharmaceutical lobby, it was the largest single cost to our 
health care system.  The costs of pharmaceutical drugs exploded 
and the generic drug companies were unable to make a substitute 
at maybe one-tenth of the cost.  Giving 20 years of patent 
protection to the pharmaceutical companies was hardly in the best 
interests of Canadians.  It is certainly coming back to haunt us 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud that the member for Winnipeg North Centre saw 
fit to add this safeguard for all Canadians.  We will not see 
that kind of conflict of interest on the boards of directors of 
any newly established medical research centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Motion No. 49 the member for Winnipeg North Centre also 
points out that the conflict of interest and post-employment code 
for public office holders should apply, with such modifications 
as circumstances require, to all the members of the advisory 
boards. It is a conflict of interest reference to make sure that 
the current post-employment code that exists for all public 
office holders shall also apply to these boards. In other words, 
not only should they not have a financial interest in the 
pharmaceutical company or some such thing, but there has to be a 
reasonable length of time to put them at arm's length distance 
from their former occupation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg North Centre is standing up for the 
interests of ordinary Canadians by ensuring that this kind of 
conflict will not take place in the newly established institutes 
of medical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Where do the Liberals stand on this? 
Where does the Reform Party stand on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we certainly hope that all 
the parties in the House can see the common sense in making sure 
that Canadians' interests are safeguarded in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 50 that the member for Winnipeg North Centre moved 
says that within three months after this act coming into force, 
the governing council shall make a bylaw to establish and put in 
place a code of ethics for the members of the advisory boards. In 
the newly struck advisory boards and the newly established 
institutes of medical research, we want a certain code of ethics 
put in place.  These are reasonable, basic measures we would 
expect all public figures to uphold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not expect any objections to any of these motions because 
they are obviously put in place in good faith, in good will, to 
look after and safeguard the interests of ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I will repeat what the member for Winnipeg North 
Centre said in her remarks on February 24.  We support this bill. 
We support the idea of the Canadian institutes for medical 
research.  We had some reservations concerning the structure of 
the advisory boards.  We are satisfied that those will be 
remedied with the adoption of the amendments put forward by the 
member for Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want Canada to be a centre of excellence for medical 
research.  The academics, universities and scientists in this 
country are poised, willing and ready to take their place at the 
forefront of this burgeoning new industry and the commercial 
possibilities of medical research.  We welcome the opportunity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard from most members regarding Bill C-13, a 
bill to establish the Canadian institutes of health research and 
to repeal the Medical Research Council Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from member after member on this side the 
frustration at the committee level concerning the bill.  Many of 
us, myself included, have put forward amendments.  I have put 
forward two dozen amendments.  The frustration comes from the 
fact that the government does not want to listen to the 
opposition to make this a better piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just spoke, the health critic for that party, 
alluded to the frustration.  It is legislation which we could all 
embrace.  We could support it.  What we are attempting to do as 
opposition members is to improve the legislation, but we get the 
sense from government members that they want the legislation now. 
They will not entertain amendments, unless they happen to be put 
forward by government members, over which they have absolute 
control.  The government's position is not to listen to the 
opposition, that the opposition should not tell the government 
what should be in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where this whole exercise falls flat.  None of us in the 
House wants to be seen as running in the face of the legislation 
because it is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are simply modelling what has been done in the United States 
and most European countries for the last 25 years.  We are about 
25 years behind the times in setting up these institutes for 
research.  We do not have a whole lot to be proud of.  We have a 
whole lot of ground that we have to gain if we want to be 
competitive in terms of medical research with the rest of the 
world, so let us get on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it goes back to the frustration of the Liberals not 
listening to what we are saying in terms of how we can strengthen 
the legislation.  Let me give the House an example.  This is the 
way we have always done things in this place, especially the 
Prime Minister.  We will go through the makeup of the institutes, 
how the board is created, who picks the people to sit on the 
board and who will determine what institutes we will have, 
because as we speak we do not know.  The president of the 
Canadian institutes of health research shall be appointed by the 
governor in council to hold office during pleasure for a term of 
not more than five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear the term governor in council it simply means that 
the Prime Minister of Canada will appoint the president of the 
council as he appoints senators.   We have heard just about 
everyone in the House from time to time rail on about the 
appointments of senators, how they happen and how they might be 
improved.  Here we go again.  The Prime Minister will determine 
who the president of the council will be.  Not only that, each of 
the 20 members on the governing council will again be appointed 
by the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government not consider rejigging that formula? 
It is very obvious the government wants absolute control as to 
how this will be set up, how it will run and who will be the 
boss.  At the end of the day it will be the Prime Minister of 
Canada determining the agenda for this council.  In my opinion 
and in the opinion of many members on this side of the House it 
will be he who will have absolute control.  That is why the 
government will not entertain any sense of change in how these 
councils will be set up, how the president is appointed or how 
they will conduct business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government has the opposition in a corner on 
this one, because just about every think tank, every university, 
every research institution in this country wants us to move on 
and get this thing on the road, as do we. 
The frustration, of course, comes from the fact that the 
government will not listen to anything which might slightly rejig 
the formula.

rail on about these types of appointments taking place in this 
country, whether he was talking about a board, a council or the 
Senate of Canada.  Only when he takes office does the tune 
change.  I do not think he is going to change in terms of how 
these institutes will work and how these appointments will be 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about arrogance.  The Minister of Health is criss-crossing

money, grants, as if this bill had already passed, knowing full 
well that it has not.  It is an insult to this Chamber, to this 
institution called parliament.  The Liberals are assuming this 
bill is going to be passed and they are assuming it is going to 
be passed post-haste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that something is wrong with the formula, and 
this is the place where it has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is good news for Canada, with the exception of who is 
calling the shots.  Unfortunately there is a political overtone 
to this bill which I do not like.  I think it is incumbent upon 
the Prime Minister and those who sit on his side of the House to 
say a word or two on this issue of appointments and how these 
institutes will be guided in the work they will do over the next 
number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are over 50 amendments to the bill.  The government has 
simply decided to railroad us, forget about the opposition, 
forget about anything that might improve this bill.  It simply 
wants to get the bill passed.  We are suggesting that we could 
pass a better bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the opportunity to listen to the opposition 
in the Chamber.  Many of the amendments were discussed at 
committee, but were voted down by members of the government. 
However, now we are in a bigger, wider forum where Canadians will 
have a chance to hear us debate the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the government take us seriously, take a 
look at the makeup of these institutes and consider some of the 
amendments that we have put forward in terms of the selection 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is reminiscent of the Liberal way of doing things.  The 
Liberals, with this legislation, have stolen page for page, 
clause by clause, from the very platform which this party ran on 
in 1997.  If we look at what Mr. Charest was talking about in his 
platform in 1997 we would find that the Liberals have basically 
modelled these institutes on what we were suggesting.  That is 
not new for the Liberals, is it?  They adopt the ideas of other 
parties, claim them for their own and back off only when they 
have to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get on with it and continue to engage in debate.  I would 
like the government to take seriously a number of our amendments 
before we give our approval to pass this legislation through the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-13, which we are debating this afternoon is important and 
significant.  It should be approved by all parties, but, the 
government being what it is, there are concealed flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 concerns the creation of institutes of health research 
in Canada. These institutes are to replace the existing medical 
research centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason it might be tempting to support this bill is the fact 
that the Department of Finance must substantially increase the 
amounts allocated to research.  However, the problem lies in the 
intrusion this government is preparing to make once more into an 
area of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can clearly recall, in 1978 when the current Prime Minister 
was the Minister of Finance, that he attempted an unprecedented 
intrusion into the provincial jurisdiction of municipal affairs. 
We in Quebec had just elected René Lévesque, and the federal 
government was trying to deal directly and by mutual agreement 
with the municipalities in Quebec and the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec municipal affairs minister at the time, Guy Tardif, 
had systematically blocked the federal government's attempt to 
deal directly with the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can see how tricky the Prime Minister was at the time, in 
1978.  To get around that, he sent a cheque for $85 directly to 
all Quebec taxpayers.  To annoy and ridicule the government of 
René Lévesque, he took another tack and gave each taxpayer $85. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, I was a member of the Parti Quebecois.  In our 
funding drive we collected not all of federal government cheques 
for $85 but a few of them.  People said to us “What the 
government is doing at the moment is so stupid, we will give the 
same amount, or $85, to the Parti Quebecois”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot endorse Bill C-13 as it stands.  My 
colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve has prepared a series of 
amendments in this regard, which we tabled in the House together 
on Thursday. 
We will try to talk members opposite into accepting them. We 
hope to see the majority of these amendments passed, because the 
bill would then reflect the spirit and the letter of the charter 
that is a part of the Constitution the Prime Minister himself 
patriated when he was Minister of Justice, without Quebec's 
agreement, following the “night of the long knives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we watch the little guy from Shawinigan, the member for 
Saint-Maurice, in action, we get suspicious. We are also 
suspicious about the amount that Quebec will receive out of the 
budget allocated to health research, to discover new treatment 
techniques. We are concerned because we wonder whether Quebec 
will get its fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally, Quebec has only been receiving 14% of the moneys 
allocated to research and development. The federal government's 
track record is not good. 
This is why we have serious concerns. We would like to see a 
framework where Quebec receives at least 24.2% or 24.3% of the 
budget earmarked for research and research centres located in 
Quebec benefit from these amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is very nice, but members are well aware that, 
unfortunately, Quebec has not been getting its fair share of 
federal investments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, all opposition members are proudly wearing a red heart on 
the left side. This is because today is budget day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has made deep cuts to provincial 
transfers. I remind this House that the Minister of Finance who, 
in a few hours, will be tabling his seventh straight budget, cut 
$1.7 billion in social transfers to Quebec for fiscal year 
1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister wants to create duplication and a structure that 
will interfere with provincial jurisdictions, he should be 
reminded that, this year, in Quebec alone, he made cuts 
totalling $850 million. 
That is close to $1 billion in the health sector alone.  Since 
1993, he has cut health transfer payments by $3.4 billion in 
Quebec alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I was listening to a conversation.  He seemed a bit 
disappointed that we are not giving our support for Bill C-13 so 
that it can be passed quickly.  We in the Bloc Quebecois are 
only too familiar with the Liberal Party and the agenda of the 
Prime Minister and there is no danger that we are going to give 
him our blessing and make it easy for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading the newspapers on the weekend.  What is going on 
at HRDC is scandalous. The Prime Minister said that only $2.59 
was unaccounted for.  The RCMP is investigating two cases right 
now and, in one alone, $100,000 is involved.  It is no longer 
$2.50.  In another case, close to $166,000 is unaccounted for. 
It has literally been lost track of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $166,000 was supposed to go to a relatively poor riding in 
East Montreal, Rosemont to be precise, the riding next door to 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, and the hon. member for Rosemont had 
signed the agreement with HRDC for a grant to create 45 jobs in 
Rosemont. I was going to say “transfer this money” but that is 
not quite it. It has disappeared.  The RCMP should conduct an 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, Saint-Maurice won out, supposedly because it was 
closer to the border with the United States.  But it is not—it is 
further away.  If the Eastern Townships had been considered, 
that would have been smart, because the Eastern Townships are 
very close to the U.S. border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we are looking at a government that is rotten at the 
core and the rot is starting to spread outwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I read the speech given in the House by the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health in support of 
Bill C-13.  In the not-so-distant past, I was a teacher and the 
president of our union was the man who is now the hon. member 
for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is terrible to see how someone can change in a dozen years. 
I do not know if it was the year he spent with Marcel Pépin and 
Ti-Louis Laberge in his cell in Orsainville that so altered him 
that he is now defending the very policies he once so vehemently 
opposed.  He even took his orders from Colonel Khadafi.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, this man rises in the House to speak about the virtues of 
Bill C-13. This just does not make any sense, and the mere fact 
that he is defending this bill today should make us suspicious. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I add 
my voice to those of the hon. member for Frontenac—Megantic and 
our health critic, the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, to say 
that after having supported the principle of Bill C-13 at second 
reading, the Bloc Quebecois now prefers to reserve judgment 
because of what the government intends to do about the 
amendments which were moved by the Bloc Quebecois to ensure that 
the Constitution is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this debate is about health, and even health care, which 
is a provincial jurisdiction, and since Quebec is particularly 
concerned about federal encroachments in this area, 
encroachments which this Liberal government has sought to 
multiply since 1993, the Bloc Quebecois will feel an obligation 
to express its dissent about this bill establishing the Canadian 
Institutes of Health Research, if the amendments it moved are 
not carried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc decided to take this position after a thorough 
examination of the bill, after having consulted the members of 
the community and having reached the conclusion that, again, 
this bill was a manifestation of this government's bad habit, a 
habit it could never get rid of, to use its spending power in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, this government might want to do the same today, when 
the Finance Minister tables his budget, since it has accumulated 
billions of dollars on the back of the poorest in our society 
and on the back of the provinces by drastically reducing social 
transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this government could well be tempted again today, in the 
area of health but also in education or social programs, to 
spend money it has accumulated that should be given back to 
provinces, and among them Quebec, which wants, with the means it 
should have at its disposal, to fulfil its responsibilities in 
areas which are under its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that the Bloc Quebecois does not support this 
budget increase for research and development. It does support 
this budget increase. It also salutes the efforts of 
researchers—and there are many researchers in Quebec who want to 
see an increase in research budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, health researchers in Quebec are among the most 
effective in Canada. They are the ones who succeed in obtaining 
the largest financial support, which proves that health research 
in Quebec is very dynamic and can rely on the support and the 
exceptional work of researchers in the major institutes that 
already exist in Quebec, in our major laboratories and also in 
our universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These researchers, who have helped in the drafting of this bill 
to obtain innovative tools to improve the sharing of health 
information and to support the development of advanced health 
technologies, must understand the Bill C-13 in its current 
form—and that is what the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve tried 
to explain to be very transparent with regard to the position 
the Bloc Quebecois is putting forward in the House today—could 
seriously encroach on provincial jurisdictions in the area of 
health.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond health research per se, the bill often refers to health 
related issues without ever recognizing the provinces' 
responsibility with regard to delivering health services to the 
public, which I think is worth mentioning in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the provinces' role is reduced to that of any other 
player. As in the case of any person or organization involved in 
the area of health, national mandates are given. In fact, the 
word national is being used more and more in the House. 
Everything the federal government does now is no longer federal 
but national. 
They want it to be national because they consider Canada a 
nation, whereas Quebec has always considered itself a nation and 
continues its efforts to make Quebec an open and pluralistic 
nation, one in which all citizens are equal and can play their 
part in building the Quebec nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another competing project, however, that of a Canadian 
nation, a nation that of course calls upon a national 
government, one which has a tendency to consider the provinces 
as municipalities—one of the first Prime Ministers of this 
country, John A. Macdonald, considered provinces to be big 
municipalities. 
This is unacceptable to the Bloc Quebecois, and our opposition 
is just one more instance in a long history of opposition by all 
the governments of Quebec, one after the other, which have 
constantly raised the importance of respecting the division of 
powers in the health field as in all areas that fall exclusively 
under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will come as no surprise that this is, once again, a reason 
for the Bloc Quebecois members to defend the interests of Quebec 
in this House, but it is also an opportunity to remind people of 
something: the alternative to an endlessly centralizing 
federalism, of which Bill C-13 is just one more example, is a 
project to make Quebec sovereign and able to be its own master 
over health and other areas, able to freely control its future, 
to create research institutes in the way that it wishes, and 
able to ensure that Quebec researchers can have access to what 
is required in order to carry out the innovative research they 
plan to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot, therefore, endorse this bill as 
presently worded, and it insists on stating in this House that 
the problem does not lie with the creation of institutes per se. 
Research and development might fall within the category of 
residual powers and thus, theoretically, under federal 
jurisdiction. 
In the end, after careful analysis and reading, the bill 
provides for a real possibility of direct infringement of 
provincial jurisdiction in public health services, infringement 
that will, as happens all too often, not involve proper 
consultation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may be permitted to remind this House that a few weeks ago, 
the start of this month, marked the first anniversary of the 
agreement, the framework agreement on social union, an 
anniversary that was not celebrated in Quebec, because the 
formula in this case too will permit the federal government—as 
the Minister of Health himself has said—to unjustly claim 
jurisdiction over health care and to impose its views on Quebec, 
even though Quebec opposes this bill's application to Quebecers 
and the agreement's application to it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is therefore proposing a series of amendments 
aimed primarily at underscoring the importance of respect for 
the division of powers and at reaffirming the primacy of 
provincial jurisdiction in the field of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would point out once again that in this House, 
despite claims of concern over health care, the government has 
unilaterally—it has the habit of doing things unilaterally—and 
irresponsibly stopped funding the health networks put in place 
in 1993 by its famous Canada health and social transfer program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is commendable that it is investing more in research, but it 
must not lose sight of the need to re-establish the transfer 
payments to the provinces.  The research institutes must not be 
a means for the federal government to meddle in areas of Quebec 
jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
addressing Bill C-13, I would like to first make a short 
digression. I know that you are very tolerant and that you will 
give me a few seconds to do that. You also probably know that if 
it were the hon. member sitting next to me who was rising, it 
might take a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my myself and my colleagues, I want to congratulate 
the hon. member for Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans 
for his very long and most interesting speech delivered on 
Thursday, from 5.15 p.m. to 10.15 p.m., to members, to Canadians 
who were watching on television, and to the legislative 
committee on Bill C-20. Our colleague deserves a good round of 
applause from all the members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> I will not repeat what the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve said jokingly, but he too must be commended 
for his exceptional work to improve a bill which could be a good 
piece of legislation for Canadians and Quebecers, for 
researchers in health and bioethics, etc. However, given the 
narrow-minded obstruction tactics used by members opposite, these 
efforts will unfortunately be useless if Liberal members do not 
show some openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic said that the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health should be able 
to inform his minister, since he is from Quebec and has a clear 
understanding of Quebec's concerns and freedoms, which he 
defended for a long time, even going to jail for a few months in 
the process. 
The Bloc Quebecois' message is aimed primarily at him.  I have 
also listened to the speeches of the opposition parties.  Not 
just the Bloc Quebecois' message but the opposition speeches in 
general are aimed at him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of party, Reform, Conservative, or New Democratic, we 
are all agreed that the bill is fine in principle.  It is only 
normal that more money be invested in research and development. 
However, for reasons that differ for each party, the bill as it 
now stands is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Rimouski—Mitis said earlier, the Bloc Quebecois 
agrees with the principle of creating institutes of health 
research.  The Bloc Quebecois also agrees that research and 
development budgets should be increased. 
But the Bloc Quebecois does not agree with the bill in its 
present form for the reasons stated over and over again by all 
parties, more specifically by the Bloc Quebecois, because, among 
other things, of the blatant intrusion into provincial 
jurisdiction.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing a number of amendments, as are all the 
opposition parties, designed primarily to ensure that 
jurisdictions are respected, not to change the core purpose of 
the bill, which is to provide assistance to research and 
development and to increase research and development grants, but 
to respect the Canadian Constitution and the division of powers 
between the federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from the bill.  As it now stands, it refers to an 
interest in health. 
“Health” is vague, and we know that the wording of a bill 
absolutely must be very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the main thrust of our amendments is to change the 
expression “an interest in health” to “an interest in research”, 
because the purpose of the bill is to establish research 
institutes. When someone knocks at the door and says “trust 
me”—my colleagues have already been very eloquent on this—it is 
hard to trust someone who does not just put a foot in the door 
but pushes in all the way, both feet, both hands and so on, into 
areas of jurisdiction reserved for the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an absolute duty to delineate a clear definition of what 
a research institute is and what its objective is. 
Its objective, as set out in Bill C-13 introduced by the Liberals 
and analyzed by all the parties, is too vague.  We want this 
research institute to really deal with research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to invest money in this research 
institute, it might need reminding of our major concerns about 
finances.  Before reinjecting money into research, which is, as 
I said, something with which we are totally in agreement, the 
government needs to be reminded of its poor financial record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the fiscal year 1999-2000, which is about to end, it is 
estimated that Quebec alone had a shortfall of close to 
$1.7 billion under the Canadian social transfer. 
This shortfall for the year 1999-2000—and I am not talking about 
all of Canada, only Quebec—amounts to $850 million per year in the 
health sector alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can imagine how much easier negotiating with Quebec nurses 
would have been if this $850 million had been available to the 
Quebec government, if the provincial government had not been 
deprived of that money by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, imagine how helpful it would have been to have an 
additional $850 million for health when so many people had the 
flu and emergency rooms were overcrowded in Quebec, and also 
elsewhere in Canada. It is important to remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back not just to the last year, but since this 
government took office in 1993, we see that Quebec's health 
sector has not suffered a shortfall of $850 million, but of 
$3.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what enabled Jean Charest, the Quebec Liberal Party 
leader, to say “Who is responsible for the problems in the 
health sector? It is not Lucien Bouchard, it is not Mike Harris, 
it is the current Prime Minister, the Minister of Health and the 
Minister of Finance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement was not made by a mean separatist. It was made by 
Jean Charest during the leaders' debate, adding, in reference to 
this $3.4 billion in cuts to health over a seven year period, 
that, as far as he was concerned, the main responsibility lies 
with the people across the Ottawa River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As concerns the first group of amendments presented here, I 
believe the bill must refer especially, as I said, to health 
research and not to the health care system and services to the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current minister, in an open letter today to <I>La Presse,</I> 
expresses his considerable concern about becoming directly 
involved in home care and in public health care.  However, 
throughout the bill, reference is made not only simply to health 
research but more generally to health.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the amendments introduced by the Bloc Quebecois serve to make 
it clear that the bill applies to health research and not to the 
potential expansion of mandates beyond such research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are intended to make sure that the decisions related to the 
choice and principle underlying the health networks and services 
to the public are exclusively under the aegis of the provinces 
and within appropriate jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that there was the bill establishing the medical research 
council, which the research institutes will replace, or, in the 
field of education, the bill establishing the Canadian council 
on social sciences and the humanities, we can see that the 
distribution of jurisdictions may be respected without watering 
down Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one wants the wheel to be reinvented.  What we are saying is 
that there are two councils with jurisdiction in this area. 
Therefore, we are asking the government to honour and implement 
what has already been done.  The government's bill is ignoring 
the distribution of powers.  It negates the federal principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government wants to administer everything and 
we see how badly it administers money allocated to Human 
Resources Development Canada, we can see that the Bloc 
Quebecois' amendments must be accepted so that the provinces, in 
their individual jurisdictions, may administer until the moment 
we have full jurisdiction over all our powers in Quebec.

one of the many benefits to Canadians from the current fiscal

</I></B></P><P align=left>The public accounts from 1995 to 1998 now show the following: 
while the finance minister was busy slashing funds for hospital 
beds, he was increasing funding for hotel beds in the Prime 
Minister's riding; while health care spending was going down, 
spending on grants and contributions was going up.  However, the 
budget speeches of the finance minister never revealed that.  The 
real spending priorities were very different than what he talked 
about in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister allow the finance minister to say one 
thing and do another?  Will that—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when we went through a difficult period, it was to 
reduce the deficit from $42 billion to, what it hopefully will be 
this afternoon, the fourth year in a row that we will have a 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period of time unemployment was at 11.5%.  We had to 
keep programs operational in order to reduce unemployment.  We 
have been successful because unemployment went from 11.5% down to 
6.8%, the lowest in 25 years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every budget the government has produced has increased 
spending.  No doubt today it will be the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human resources minister is responsible for wasting millions 
of the increased spending given to that department.  If that 
minister is going to remain in charge of even a dollar from this 
budget, it would be one dollar too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Canadians give the government more money when it 
wastes the money they give it in the first place? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian people are aware of what the government has 
managed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we started, I talked about the unemployment level.  I 
talked about the deficit that we had to cure.  We had an 11% 
interest rate.  It went down to 6%.  Since we formed government, 
1.9 million jobs have been created.  Those are the reasons the 
Canadian people are still confident in this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that the next HRDC—

$6,000 were found not to have been justified. That is what I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1998 the Prime Minister bragged in the House that 
nobody had asked him to appear before the APEC inquiry.  In 
November he said “I want the commission to ask all the questions 
of anybody whom it wants to interview”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that Commissioner Hughes has invited him to appear, will the 
Prime Minister let the inquiry do its work?  Will the Prime 
Minister stop stonewalling and finally come clean with Canadians 
about his role at the APEC summit and accept the commissioner's 
invitation to appear before the commission? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  First, 
Mr. Speaker, the judge said  “I simply cannot see that the 
voluminous evidence to date points to or suggests that the Prime 
Minister may have given improper orders or direction to RCMP 
members respecting security at the APEC conference”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he does not need me and as he has all the facts, he asked if 
I wanted to go there.  I looked at that possibility.  Only two 
prime ministers have been before an inquiry:  Sir John A. 
Macdonald more than 100 years ago and Prime Minister Trudeau in 
camera on national security.  The precedents are very clear and I 
do not want to create a precedent that might cause problems for 
my successors. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr.

Hughes commission.  The same Prime Minister said in November that 
the government was willing to help the commission as much as it 
wants because it had nothing to hide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister really has nothing to hide, and if he 
refuses to appear before the Hughes commission, will he at least 
agree to appear before the foreign affairs committee of the House

he talked about wasting money.  What he is saying is that it is a 
waste of money to support Canadians with disabilities.  What he 
is saying is that it is waste of money to help Canadian youth who 
have not been able to find that very important first job.  What 
he is saying is that it is a waste of money to help Canadians who

waste, fraud and abuse of tax dollars from Ottawa.  An audit says 
that at least $1 billion was shockingly mismanaged by the

in the Prime Minister's riding.  The minister's explanation is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  During question period you ruled out 
of order a question put forward by the member for Calgary 
Northeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was in two parts.  The first was about the 
correlation between the grants given in certain ridings and 
political donations and the correlation between the amount of 
grants given in the HRD department.   I had asked a similar 
question earlier in question period which was not ruled out of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask, Mr. Speaker, if you would review the blues.  I know you 
have to rule in the middle of question period, but it does seem 
to me that the question really is about grants and the 
inappropriate use of grants in a minister's department, which is 
within her departmental responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I always seek advice from the House and I 
will review the blues if the hon. member wants me to do so.  If 
it is necessary, I will get back to the House.

when we are trying to get ready for question period every day we 
go by Beauchesne's as to what is parliamentary language and what 
is not and by the new M and M standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can appreciate that you try to referee this whole thing while 
it is going on, but at the same time, Mr. Speaker, if that kind 
of spending and giving of government grants does not fall under 
the administration of government then we do not have a clue what 
does.  We need to know that before— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  As I said, I will review the 
blues.  I am sure hon. members do put a lot of time, thought and 
energy both into the questions and into preparation for the 
answer. I have to make a call up here, as the hon. opposition 
House leader has said.  I will review the blues and if it is 
necessary I will get back to the House.

<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I move that 
the First Report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, 
presented on Wednesday, December 15, 1999, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it is important to debate this motion because it deals 
with children and with all the measures that should be taken by 
the government on their behalf. It also deals with child poverty 
in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was mandated to deal with child poverty and youth 
at risk and reviewed the issue of children in Canada. During the 
last decade, the Liberal government neglected its 
responsibilities in this regard. The past 10 years can be summed 
up as a missed opportunity. The report of this committee is a 
perfect example, because it never mentions any of the various 
changes that should have been included in the government 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee submitted three reports. 
Members of the opposition, including the members of the Bloc, 
tabled a minority report, because those three reports do not 
fully explore the issue and do not explain all the elements that 
cause poverty and the lack of nurturing of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 14, 1999, the Bloc Quebecois presented a minority 
report on the government's policies on children.  Throughout the 
report proposed by the Liberal Party, it was clear that the 
federal government wanted to take the lead in a area not under 
its jurisdiction, according to the constitution.  It should 
avoid a repetition of past mistakes and it should would with the 
provinces and provide fair financial support to them, as they 
really need it.  This is the first conclusion that the Bloc 
reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several personalities from Quebec and Canada want the social 
transfer reinstated at $18 billion and want to see an end to the 
cuts made since 1993.  As of today, cuts to the social transfer 
stand at $21 billion. Last week, the Association des médecins 
requested that the social transfer be given back to provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have less money.  They must meet some urgent needs 
but do not have the money required to respond to people and to 
parents.  When we speak about the problems of children, we must 
say that it is the parents' responsibility to guide their 
children on to adult life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first report, it was obvious that the Liberals wanted to 
invade some provincial jurisdictions. We also see that there is 
a tendency towards program homogenisation. 
Homogenisation means no flexibility to adapt the programs to 
different realities in different provinces and to the 
willingness of different provinces to help the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now on a tour to look at poverty, and community groups, 
which are very close to the children and to families with urgent 
needs, often tell us that there is not one solution but several 
solutions and there should not be only one measure but several 
measures. The across the board programs of the Canadian 
government are seldom applicable to our communities. 
Every federal approach was harmful in terms of synergy and 
logical integration of government action.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we noted was that the report tabled in December 
1999 put the emphasis on a national action plan or an integrated 
federal policy, with no room for flexibility for the provinces. 
An integrated social policy must come from the provinces, not 
from Ottawa, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa is there to financially support certain policies, not to 
implement programs that often interfere with provincial 
programs. The integration of a federal program with those of the 
provinces is a complex accounting operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report on children and youth at risk said that existing 
financing channels were deficient. We wanted to use other 
financing channels. We could also see that, often, the federal 
government announces policies for children that will be 
applicable only in two or three years, or just before an 
election, or according to some part of the Liberal government's 
political strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to fight effectively against poverty and help our 
children better, I believe we must have a long term strategy 
instead of a fragmented one that is dependant upon the good will 
of the government. We have seen this in the past and we are 
seeing it again with the scandal at HRDC, which shows how poor 
the government's performance is. 
It is a performance characterized by a lack of transparency, 
where the taxpayers' money is being used for completely partisan 
projects and not to help communities, parents and children have 
access to a better quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back to the Canada health and social transfer 
because I think it is of the utmost importance for provinces, to 
help them meet children's needs adequately. What does the Canada 
health and social transfer do? It helps provinces better meet 
the needs of families in education, health services and income 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec in particular, we know that a march will be organized 
in October 2000, where the people will ask the Government of 
Quebec to take social and political measures that will be more 
humane, better focused on the problem of poverty. 
To help those families, those parents, the federal government 
must first fulfil its responsibilities under the Canada social 
transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present situation does not make sense. Since 1993, there has 
been $21 billion in cuts. This is a lot of money. I will give an 
idea of what could be done with $21 billion. It could be used to 
hire 3,000 physicians, 5,000 teachers, 5,800 nurses. It would 
also allow to increase each and every income security cheque by 
$500. This is how it would affect the everyday life of each 
citizen. They would get better support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I read a newspaper article about the shortage of 
assistants, counsellors and psychologists in schools. The only 
way to access those resources is to provide better and more 
stable support from the Canada social transfer, which finances 
education, health and income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the committee dealing with the issue of children and youth at 
risk, it did not seem to bother them in the least. There was no 
call for the government to restore the Canada social transfer, 
to provide better support and help to children and families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect that was completely ignored as a means of better 
supporting children was the issue of the restrictions applying 
to unemployment insurance. The access issue was not raised in 
committee, despite the fact that a huge number of families are 
subject to such restrictions and that six out of every ten 
persons are currently ineligible for employment insurance 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand correctly, employment insurance should allow 
fathers and mothers to obtain money that is owed to them, money 
that could help them to feed their children and help them to 
have a better life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this was ignored by the committee. 
The Standing Committee on Human Resources Development rejected 
out of hand any study of this new reform on the quality of life 
in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee never raised the issue of social housing either. 
We know that a child living in poverty is also a member of a 
family that has to spend between 30 and 50% of its meagre income 
on housing. It is clear then that the committee on children and 
youth at risk does not really deal with the various measures the 
government should put forward to really help children and youth 
at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a concerned about the advice the Liberal government will 
receive from the committee. I know that the government often 
brags about the new national child benefit, which, by the way, 
is a good measure. However, I believe that the government will 
have to implement a whole series of measures to support children 
and not just one single measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, we have been in a major social deficit. What is 
going on now is totally absurd; society as a whole has been 
crippled by the federal government cuts. Families, especially 
poor families, are the ones who are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I can say, following the tour I did on the issue of 
poverty—I had brought with me a working paper on the federal 
investment, or disinvestment, in social policies in terms of 
financing in conjunction with the provinces—is how much that had 
a negative impact in the communities. They told me that now they 
understand the impact the federal government is having on the 
increase in child poverty. That impact can be seen every day. 
Therefore it is totally unacceptable that, in the committee, no 
figure has been put on measures so that we can have a real 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, maybe the intentions were good. Every member of the 
House had signed a resolution saying that child poverty would 
have decreased within ten years. What happened? We had a sad 
anniversary on November 24, 1999. 
That is not very long ago, just before the Christmas season. It 
was a sad anniversary because it was announced that there were 
1.5 million children living in poverty in Canada, an increase of 
500,000. This is the result of ten years of social 
disinvestment. Ten years that, under the Liberal administration, 
have been catastrophic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the committee on children and youth at risk, there might be a 
concern, which is to have and create new programs and duplicate 
what is already being done in the provinces. There is no vision 
of what some provinces have already put in place. There is no 
figure put on that strategy, and that is dangerous. Ten years 
from now, will we find ourselves with a problem that we will 
deplore as members of parliament?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it unacceptable that a committee given the mandate to 
study children at risk did not show a willingness to remedy the 
cuts in social programs or put an end to this vicious 
centralization. In fact, we heard in committee how centralizing 
the government party was. According to some federalists, this is 
not what federalism is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of being of assistance to the provinces, helping them 
with their initiatives, what is being done with regard to $5-a-day 
day care? Not a word, but the government is pocketing $70 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is time the government understood that Ottawa's 
action hampers Quebec's initiatives. It hampers local 
communities' initiatives. Sometimes we hear in the corridors 
that it is unconscionable that one might even think about 
establishing new programs. Do you know what some ministers tell 
us? They say “Communities are asking us to get involved. We want 
to get involved”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell them there is a difference between involvement and 
investment. To invest is to give back to the provinces the money 
they are entitled to. To invest is to respect the provinces' 
areas of jurisdiction. To invest is to decentralize and allow 
the provinces to better help communities and understand what 
they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the federal government would like to go over the heads of 
the provinces, it is obvious. 
I understand why the Quebec government wants to lump several 
initiatives into one family policy, namely to better help 
children. It needs room to manoeuvre in its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government really wants to, the Quebec government 
will be better able to help children and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I move that the debate be now adjourned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, I must inform the hon. member

</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, I put in an application for an emergency debate 
regarding three Canadian children who are being held by the state 
of California.  They are facing a possible hearing for adoption 
which is illegal and a violation of international protocol.  They 
ought to be returned to Canadian authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was not able to make my application on Friday because of 
procedural obstacles, I am seeking the unanimous consent of the 
House to have that application heard today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent for the 
hon. member to present his application for an emergency debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in that case, I would seek a

</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 52 states that I must bring the matter up after 
Routine Proceedings but I was not allowed to do that on Friday. 
Since I was not allowed to do that, it stands to reason that my 
application would carry over to the next sitting day.  This is 
common sense because all our rules in the House follow that 
logic.  When votes are deferred they are held over to the next 
sitting day, even if it is months later, and so are motions. 
There is no reason why an application for an emergency debate 
should not be dealt with in the same way instead of being 
arbitrarily deleted.  It cannot just disappear into thin air. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  With great respect to the hon. 
member, they can disappear into thin air.  Applications for 
emergency debate are by their nature for emergencies.  What may 
be an emergency on Friday may not be an emergency on Monday. 
Those applications traditionally have had to be resubmitted.  If 
a member wishes to make the application a second time, another 
request for such an application must be made to the table and 
delivered on a timely basis in writing in order to comply with 
the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member is frustrated by the fact that we have

However, I have one other matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seem to be the victim of a procedural quagmire.  This is 
unrelated, but when I introduced my private member's bill, Bill 
C-436, the Speaker said that it would be read a second time on

day numerous times and it is not listed in the order of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the members comments on the subcommittee report of the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development on the Status 
of Persons with Disabilities, she raised the question of EI 
benefits and particularly made a point that six out of ten 
persons are restricted from qualifying for benefits or do not 
receive benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to me that this includes a large number of people who 
in fact do not technically qualify under the provisions of the EI 
Act.  I wonder if the member would qualify for the House, of 
these six out of ten people who do not get benefits under the EI 
program, how many of those persons do not even qualify for 
benefits? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government tightened 
the eligibility criteria. The problem is that these criteria are 
very difficult to meet. To be eligible, more hours of work are 
required. This is the first thing we noticed. Given the 
$26 billion surplus it has accumulated in the EI fund and what it 
has done to tighten the eligibility criteria, the government has 
nothing to brag about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at where the money came from. It was taken from the 
support that could previously be given to parents to help them 
raise their children. I cannot understand why the government 
member would ask me this question. 
He knows very well that six people out of ten are not entitled 
to employment insurance benefits because the criteria have been 
greatly tightened and it is now very difficult to qualify. 
Indeed, I wonder why it is called employment insurance, because 
it is no longer an insurance, according to workers who have lost 
their jobs, since no assistance is available after losing one's 
job until another one is found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague and several other members have proposed a series of 
changes to be made to the department. For example, the 
Employment Insurance Act could be improved by eliminating the 
two week waiting period before becoming eligible to EI benefits. 
The so-called black hole of spring could be remedied.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are no longer able to accumulate the number of hours 
required to get EI benefits until they start a new job. This is 
particularly true for seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues represents the Gaspé region, where seasonal 
workers in the fishing industry have a hard time qualifying for 
employment insurance until they can start their seasonal jobs 
again. This is also the case with forest workers in the riding 
of Matapédia—Matane, who are confronted to the same kind of 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been very vigilant with respect to the relaxing of 
eligibility criteria. 
It is also very difficult to qualify for parental insurance, 
particularly for women who work part time. They are required to 
accumulate inordinate hours of work to be eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois were calling for a reduction in the 
number of hours worked to qualify for parental leave, asking 
that it be reduced to 300 hours. We wanted to reduce the 
eligibility requirement from the present 700 hours to 300 hours. 
Too many people are excluded under the present criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a problem with employment insurance, and with the 
POWA program as well. We all know that this program does not do 
anything for the workers over 55 years of age because of a lack 
of funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all saw how, over the years, this government has reduced the 
workers' share. 
It is no wonder that people are getting poorer by the day. It 
comes from the restraints on social policies and the lack of 
support from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the remarks of a minister opposite, saying “When the 
provincial governments are forced to cut back and to turn down 
requests of citizens, we will show Canadians that, with our 
social safety net, we in the federal government are able to meet 
their urgent needs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can brag about health care programs and programs for the 
homeless, but we all know that it amounts to a drop in the 
bucket compared to the money taken from the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude by saying that I am expecting questions 
from colleagues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
heard a little sigh of exasperation, as if I were using up too 
much time of the House. Please bear with me, because this was an 
excellent speech. I am sure all the members of the House will 
want to thank this noble-hearted woman and pay a glowing tribute 
to our colleague from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seldom seen in Parliament a woman so totally dedicated 
to the cause of the poor. We know there is no stopping the hon. 
member for Québec once she has started off in a direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask her a question in three parts. Since the 
hon. member for Québec is a practical woman, who has always 
sought concrete solutions to the problem of poverty, drawing her 
inspiration from the judicious advise of my friend, the hon. 
member for Chambly, I will ask her the following questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can she tell us how a commissioner of poverty—since this is an 
issue that she is taking to heart—could make a difference? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, could she tell us how greater involvement from the banks, 
through community reinvestment legislation, could make a 
difference for the poor? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that I know she has worked on this issue, how could making 
social condition a prohibited ground of discrimination—not sexual 
orientation, but social condition—make a difference if it were 
included in the Canadian Human Rights Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that she take her time, answer the questions one by 
one and think hard. We will be happy to listen to her.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think I would need your 
permission to go on for another 20 minutes to answer these three 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a poverty commissioner is a valid request and a 
desirable measure. We know that in 1989, all members in this 
House unanimously expressed the desire to see a reduction in 
child poverty. Unfortunately, the number of children in poverty 
went up instead of down. Right now, we hear about the scandal 
with the way grants are distributed and the programs approved at 
the Department of Human Resources Development and it raises 
questions about government management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking for, for better effectiveness in the 
application of programs and in their impact on communities, is 
for a poverty commissioner. He could keep track of successive 
governments—right now we have a Liberal government but there 
could be another government—to know how the big bureaucratic 
machine implements the measures adopted by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that some measures taken by the government do not have 
the desired impact on society. We need only look at the scandal 
at the Department of Human Resources Development. However, the 
same party was at the heart of another scandal in 1984. At that 
time, there was an R and D tax credit for companies. In the end, 
many billions went because of money given to numbered companies. 
Companies were disappearing, but some of them had never done any 
research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A real poverty commissioner could track all the policies of the 
federal government on poverty. This afternoon, we will hear a 
budget speech. There will probably be applause. But we should 
track every measure the government will implement this afternoon 
to see if this speech will really contribute to reducing 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, every member of the Bloc Quebecois is wearing a heart at 
the request of associations in our constituencies, which want 
the Canada health and social transfer to be restored to the 
provinces, the unemployedto get— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry but I must interrupt the hon. 
member, since her time has expired. The hon. member for 
Mississauga South. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure on this budget day to comment on the report of the 
Sub-committee on Children and Youth at Risk of the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of 
Persons with Disabilities.  I am particularly pleased to discuss 
this report because of its impact on families and children.  The 
report has laid out some excellent observations for members of 
the committee and for all members of parliament to consider and I 
would like to note four of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the public policy framework the committee suggests that to 
address the situation facing children and youth at risk 
governments must make a firm five-year fiscal commitment to 
develop an integrated public policy framework for families and 
children.  We have certainly commenced on that road and the 
recommendation that we continue with a comprehensive five-year 
fiscal program for families and children is very appropriate and 
is supported by all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of income and services there is strong agreement 
that there should be two simultaneous tracks to deal with 
families and children, one which focuses on income support for 
families and one which focuses on services for families and 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also pointed out the need to make some 
modifications to the income tax system.  Members will know that 
this is an area in which I have had substantial activity.  Some 
of my private member's bills and motions have dealt with things 
like the Canada child tax benefit, the child care expense 
deduction and the caregiver credit.  Motion No. 30, which passed 
in this place in the last parliament, would provide a caregiver 
benefit to those who provide care in the home to preschool 
children, the chronically ill, the aged and the disabled.  I 
think these are important areas for us to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth area that I would like to note is that the committee 
felt an immediate $1.5 billion improvement to the national child 
benefit was important and should be extended to low income 
families, including those on social assistance. 
As part of the work I have done with regard to families, 
particularly those who are on social assistance, it is very 
obvious to all that it is very difficult financially for 
Canadians who are on welfare to make the transition to the 
workforce. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits which people on social assistance and welfare 
receive are often not available to those who leave welfare to go 
into the paid labour force.  We can take medical or dental 
expenses as an example.  There are certainly a number of social 
assistance features which are not available.  That was one of the 
reasons the national child benefit, which is part of the overall 
program of the Canada child tax benefit system, was introduced. 
It was introduced in conjunction with the provinces, and the 
understanding clearly was that the provinces were in a position 
to decide whether they were going to reduce the transfers to 
people on the overall child tax benefit and the national child 
benefit for those who were on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of the national child benefit program was to help 
people to make the transition from welfare and social assistance 
to the paid labour force.  I raise that point for discussion with 
the House.  It is important that we understand that where 
unemployment is very high and the prospect of new jobs in the 
near term for people on welfare and social assistance is much 
lower in some provinces, as a result, in two cases, the provinces 
decided they would not offset the transfer from the federal 
government against the welfare payments and in fact give the 
additional amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are provincial decisions.  Those were part of the 
negotiations of the federal government with the provinces to 
ensure that the right things happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Bloc Quebecois raised a couple of issues 
which bear some comment.  First, she commented with regard to the 
CHST, the Canada health and social transfer.  She basically 
claimed that the cuts in the CHST have to be restored.  The 
member will well know that the Prime Minister outlined for the 
House several times last week that today the combination of cash 
and tax point transfers to the provinces is greater than it was 
in 1993.  That is an important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have to understand that the federal government has 
given the authority to the provinces to collect taxes.  As their 
economies grow, the amount of tax revenue which they collect on 
that growing economy also means that the provinces will get 
additional revenues.  The combination of cash transfers and tax 
points is the important element. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about social housing and homelessness. 
She will well know that this is not a simple problem.  One aspect 
of this has to do with children.  Of the homeless recognized in 
the Anne Golden report in Toronto, 28% of the homeless were 
youth.  Of those, 70% had experienced physical or sexual abuse 
while they were in the family home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that social housing and 
homelessness are separate issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will have the floor when we 
take up this debate again, whenever that is, and he will have 14 
minutes.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout our country's history each generation has undertaken 
the great task of building Canada.  Today, at the dawn of a new 
century, we are fortunate indeed to live in a land of promise, in 
a world of change and in a time of opportunity.  Are there 
problems?  Yes, there are and there is much to be done.  That 
being said, we are in a better position today to chart our own 
course than we have been in many a decade.

declining.  Canada's foreign debt burden is declining.  Consumer

important, after a number of difficult years these positive 
economic indicators are now beginning to be reflected in the 
lives of Canadians.

a pace unmatched by any other G-7 country. 
As a result our unemployment rate now stands at 6.8%, its lowest 
level in nearly a quarter of a century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early and mid-1990s Canadians saw their real after tax 
income shrink.  Three years ago that trend began to turn around. 
Based on the information that is just out today, disposable 
incomes are now some 4% higher than they were in 1996 and, of 
even greater moment, private sector forecasters project that 
incomes will rise much more significantly in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly good news.  However, while the progress of 
recent years is a record on which Canadians can be proud to 
stand, it is not a record on which we are prepared to rest. 
Canadians do not want to dwell on the past.  They want to focus 
on the future, and indeed that is the message of this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 we established a plan to eliminate the deficit, turn our 
economy around and create new jobs.  That plan has worked.  Now, 
two months into the year 2000, we must take Canada further.  We 
must create a greater prosperity and see to it that the benefits 
of that prosperity are shared widely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our challenge now is to build on our new-found strength. 
Canadians know that this is the time to act.  They know that 
globalization and the rush of technology will not wait for us. 
Nor will these forces pause for us to prepare.  The challenges 
are here and the opportunities are now. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In last fall's fiscal update, we asked ourselves three 
fundamental questions: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, what will it take to secure our position as a leader in 
the new economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, how can we provide every Canadian with an equal 
opportunity to succeed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And third, how can we ensure the best quality of life for all 
Canadians, not simply a fortunate few? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget, we outline our response to those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we will continue to provide sound fiscal management. 
There will be no slipping, no sliding: the days of deficit are 
gone and they are not coming back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will lower taxes to promote economic growth and to 
leave more money where it belongs—in the pockets of Canadians. 
As we said last November, Canadians are entitled to keep more of 
the money they earn. After all, they worked for it. It's theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, in order to ensure equality of opportunity, we will 
invest in providing Canadians with the skills and knowledge they 
need to get the jobs they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And fourth, together we will build an economy based on 
innovation. For that, ultimately, is the only means by which a 
modern nation can control its future. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These four elements speak to our economic framework, but our 
plan must do more than that.  It must reflect not only the value 
of our economy but also the values of our society.  The success 
that we have achieved as a nation has come not only from strong 
growth but from an abiding commitment to strong values:  caring, 
compassion and insistence that there be an equitable sharing of 
the benefits of economic growth.  These are the bedrock of our 
nation and they must be the cornerstone of our plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason the first announcement of the first budget of 
the 21st century is that we will increase funding for 
post-secondary education and health care. 
These are the highest priorities of Canadians and they are ours.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already acted three times to strengthen the cash 
transfers to the provinces through the Canadian health and social 
transfer.  Indeed last year for health care alone we made the 
single largest investment in this government's history.  At that 
time we also said we would do more as resources permit, and we 
will.  Today we are making good on that commitment.  We are 
announcing the transfer of a further $2.5 billion to the 
provinces to use over four years for post-secondary education and 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, to meet pressing needs in our universities, our 
colleges and our hospitals, the provinces will have the 
flexibility to draw upon this new cash sooner should they choose 
to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already acted three times to strengthen the cash 
transfers to the provinces through the Canada Health and Social 
Transfer (CHST). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are announcing the transfer of a further $2.5 billion 
to the provinces to use over four years for post-secondary 
education and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, to meet pressing needs in our universities, 
colleges and hospitals, the provinces will have the flexibility 
to draw upon this new cash sooner—should they choose to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this and last year's budgets, the cash component 
of the CHST will rise from the 1998-1999 level of $12.5 billion 
to $15.5 billion next year—an increase of almost 25% over just 
two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the total annual support provided through the CHST—tax 
points and cash—will reach close to $31 billion next year—an 
all-time high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had guaranteed the provinces stable and growing funding for 
health care and post-secondary education.  Today, that is what we 
are continuing to do.  Nor is that the end of the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments to the provinces will be $500 million 
higher this year than projected in last year's budget. 
As a result, equalization transfers as well are now at an 
all-time high. This means more money for less prosperous 
provinces for health care, education and other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, let me now turn to our plan for building a stronger 
economy.  Prior to the fall update, we consulted with a number 
of economists from Canada's major chartered banks and four major 
forecasting firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This invited a national debate on our longer-term objectives—a 
debate based on a series of projections about the size of the 
budget surplus for each of the next five years.  These 
projections were sound. But we also know, especially for the 
later years, that they are just that—projections. They are bets 
on the future, not money in the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, while we must always set longer-term objectives, we 
will continue to make decisions only on a rolling two-year basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also continue to build additional prudence into our 
planning and to set aside a $3-billion Contingency Reserve to 
protect against unforeseen events.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no doubt, this government will not repeat the 
mistakes of others and spend money we might not have, or raise 
expectations we cannot meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor will we abandon the balanced approach we have adopted from 
the beginning—an approach which recognizes that debt reduction, 
tax relief and spending on health, post-secondary education and 
other key priorities are not competing claims, but complementary 
components of a fair and effective plan. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to the debt.  Canada has not just eliminated its 
deficit.  We are one of the few countries that is now reducing 
the absolute amount of its debt and we will continue to do so. 
Indeed over the past two years we have paid down the debt by more 
than $6 billion resulting in interest savings of more than $300 
million a year each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, market debt, the debt issued in financial markets has 
fallen even further.  By the end of this fiscal year we will have 
reduced our market debt by close to $20 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, Canada's debt to GDP ratio, which measures the 
amount of the debt against the size of the economy, has improved 
markedly; the lower the ratio the more manageable the debt.  In 
1995 Canada's debt ratio was 71%. Today it has dropped by 10 
percentage points and it should fall below 50% by the year 2004. 
Beyond this the downward track must continue. We are still a long 
way from the 25% ratio Canada enjoyed in the late 1960s, the last 
time our books were in the black. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic growth has played an important role in Canada's falling 
debt ratio.  So has controlling government spending.  We have 
previously pointed out that federal government spending as a 
percentage of our gross domestic product is at its lowest level 
in over 50 years.  The fact is that even after taking into 
account the measures to be outlined in this budget, program 
spending next year will be $4 billion lower than it was when we 
took office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no doubt, we will control spending.  For instance, 
beginning with the time we balanced the books and looking ahead 
to the year 2001-02, growth in program spending is projected to 
be in line with inflation plus population growth, the standard 
that is used by most economic commentators.  Having said that, 
the standard of living that we enjoy as a country does not come 
free. For instance, fully two-thirds of all of the new spending 
measures since we eliminated the deficit have been in the areas 
of health care, post-secondary education and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore there are other fields where the government must 
take action, areas where we have fundamental responsibilities at 
home and essential obligations abroad. The crisis faced by farm 
families in communities across the country is real and better 
short and long term solutions are required.  The RCMP faces new 
challenges in the area of organized crime and international 
terrorism.  The demands upon our military whose men and women 
contribute so much at home and abroad are increasing. Within our 
borders we must strengthen our immigration system. Beyond our 
borders we have an obligation to help the poorest of the world's 
poor. In each of these areas we are providing additional funding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn from the responsibilities of the present to the 
opportunities of the future.  Let us address the new economy.  At 
this the beginning of the 21st century, we have a unique chance 
to take hold of our destiny.  The basic question we have to 
answer is what are the choices that we must make today that in 
five, ten or twenty years time will be seen as having made a 
critical difference in making Canada the land of opportunity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Powered by the information revolution and a cascade of new 
technologies, distance is disappearing, borders are collapsing 
and the world once divided is now connected as never before. 
Microprocessors and microchips, satellites, fibre optics and the 
Internet are changing the way we live.  They are changing the way 
we work.  They are changing the way we communicate.  The result 
is the most significant economic transformation of our time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the strength of a nation is measured not by the weapons it 
wields, but by the patents it produces; not by the territory it 
controls, but by the ideas it advances; not only by the wealth of 
its resources, but by the resourcefulness of its people.  In such 
a world, successful nations will only be those that foster a 
culture of innovation.  There will be those that create new 
knowledge and bring the product of that knowledge quickly to 
market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal as a nation must be to lead the way.  Our goal must be 
to inspire a spirit of entrepreneurship, one that asks our people 
to reach higher, to look farther, and one that encourages us to 
see the world as our market, but Canada as the place to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a country we are well placed, far better than most, to seize 
the opportunities of the 21st century.  But there is nothing 
inevitable about our progress.  If we are to capitalize on the 
opportunities of the new economy, then both the private and the 
public sectors have their roles to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector must change its concept of risk.  It must 
improve access to capital.  It must give greater priority to 
start up companies.  It must exploit the full potential of new 
technologies, like the Internet, to capture markets in every 
corner of the globe.  Government in turn must reduce the 
regulatory burden.  It must help fill the gaps in an economy that 
is increasingly moving from brick to click. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must government do?  It must equip Canadians to succeed. 
That means an education system second to none; basic research, 
the raw material of the new economy; secure social programs that 
recognize that real progress is made by reaching for the top, not 
racing to the bottom; and a tax system that is both fair and 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to talk about a more innovative economy, we must begin 
with people.  Skills and knowledge join the ambitions of the 
individual with the potential of the country.  They are the 
meeting place between social and economic policy, the best means 
available to us to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. 
That is why in 1998 we introduced the Canadian opportunities 
strategy, a multi-part plan to expand access to knowledge and to 
skills.  Last year built upon that foundation and today we build 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as we have already discussed, this budget increases 
support to the provinces for post-secondary education by 
increasing the cash available through the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will follow through on the commitment made in the 
Speech from the Throne to create new 21st century chairs for 
research excellence.  These will be new research positions in 
Canadian universities designed to attract the best researchers 
from around the world and to retain the best from across Canada. 
Half of these positions will be directed to Canada's leading 
scientists and half to the very best of the next generation of 
young Canadian researchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October the Prime Minister said: “This investment will make 
Canada a leader in the knowledge based economy and will truly 
brand Canada as a country that values excellence and is committed 
to success”.  This initiative will help Canadian universities 
not only to meet the opportunities and the standards that have 
been set by others today, but to set new standards that others 
will have to meet tomorrow. 
To this end, this budget provides $900 million of funding over 
five years for 2,000 new research chairs.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, as Canadians, especially young Canadians, turn more and 
more to the Internet as a source of information, it is important 
that they see their own reflection, that they hear their own 
stories.  Therefore, in this budget we are providing the 
necessary funding to enhance the presence of Canadian cultural 
material on the Internet in both official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, scholarships are an important part of expanding access 
to higher learning.  Therefore, in order to ensure that more 
students receive their full value, we are increasing the tax 
exemption of scholarships and bursaries from its current level of 
$500 to $3,000. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research and development is the foundation for new products and 
processes. It is what smart companies always do. It is what smart 
countries must do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply, we must ensure that within our borders we have a 
research capacity that is constantly pushing forward the 
frontiers of human knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 budget, this government created the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation (CFI). 
To date, it has awarded $450 million to help post-secondary 
institutions, research hospitals and not-for-profit organizations 
to modernize their laboratories, their equipment and their 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost half of its funding has been directed at health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFI is one of the cornerstones of our plan to support the 
new economy but if we do not act now, its funding will run out 
within two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in order to enable it to extend its awards into the 
year 2005, this budget provides $900 million to the CFI, raising 
the Government's total investment to $1.9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because health research holds such potential to contribute not 
only to the quantity of our knowledge, but also to the quality of 
our lives, last year's budget announced the creation of the 
Canadian institutes for health research, an initiative that will 
transform the way research is done in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we take another important step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understanding how genes function opens the door to substantial 
progress in advancing the treatment of cancer and other 
life-threatening diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gene research will save the lives of many. It will enhance the 
lives of still more. It will surely form the basis for many 
advances in biotechnology, which many believe will be as 
important in the new century as computer technology was in the 
last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, we are announcing today that we will commit 
$160 million to create the Genome Canada project—with five 
centres across the country, providing laboratory facilities for 
researchers from universities, government and the private 
sector. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is one of the world's leaders in the field of 
biotechnology. However, we recognize that biotechnology, for all 
its potential, also raises concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know that we understand and can manage its 
risks, that health, environmental and ethical limits will be 
identified and respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this budget will provide funding over the next three 
years to ensure that as we receive the benefits of 
biotechnology, we also have the ability to ensure its safety. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadians of all ages, protecting the environment is not an 
option, it is something we simply must do.  It is a fundamental 
value beyond debate, beyond discussion.  For this reason, this 
budget provides additional resources to further clean up the 
Great Lakes, to ensure environmental enforcement, to protect 
species at risk, to reduce organic pollutants in the north and to 
provide development assistance to deal with greenhouse gas 
emissions in developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we are announcing today that in order to preserve 
national habitats and species we are cutting by half the capital 
gains tax arising from the donation of ecologically sensitive 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 we, along with the other orders of government, NGOs and 
the private sector, launched the process required to develop the 
national climate change strategy.  These consultations are 
concluding and the strategy should be unveiled by the end of the 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, within the context of a budget seeking to prepare our 
economy for the 21st century, there are a number of things that 
we can and must do now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unequivocal fact is that climate change, indeed the entire 
environmental spectrum, will provide challenges, but for an 
innovative economy it presents many more opportunities.  Those 
nations which demonstrate how to truly integrate environmental 
and economic concerns will forge new tools.  They will develop 
new technologies that others will have to adopt.  Tremendous 
rewards await those nations that get there first and for those 
that do it best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the importance of natural resources to our country, 
because of the severity of our climate, leadership in this area 
of the new economy is not a matter of choice for Canada.  Quite 
simply, we must apply the same innovative thinking, the same 
spirit of enterprise, the same technological ingenuity to 
protecting and enhancing our environment as we have in becoming 
world leaders in the field of telecommunications, transportation 
and so many others.  Technology is key, make no mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to successfully tackle climate change, to cut costs 
and boost productivity and to transform ourselves into the world 
leader in the fields of clean energy, then we have to employ 
every bit of the skill and knowledge that we possess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, this budget takes a number of targeted actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are announcing today the creation of a sustainable 
development technology fund.  This fund will foster innovation by 
helping companies develop new technologies and bring them to 
market in areas such as clean burning coal and new fuel cell 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we are announcing that we will create the Canadian 
foundation for climate and atmospheric sciences, a network of 
institutes that will link researchers from across the country in 
order to further our understanding of the impact of climate 
change and air pollution on human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the government is beginning to change its procurement 
policy to move as much as possible to more environmentally 
friendly energy stimulating market demand for green power. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT59"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT59"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and la 
Coalition pour la renouvellement des infrastructures du Québec 
have worked on excellent proposals in the area of green 
infrastructure.  These allow us to extend the hand of friendship 
to those in the front lines of a fight for a cleaner environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these proposals is a green municipal enabling fund to 
help communities assess where their environmental needs are 
greatest.  The second is a revolving fund leveraging private 
sector investment in areas such as waste management and water 
conservation at the municipal level.  This budget gives effect to 
both proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as we move to more fully integrate economic and 
environmental policy, we must come to grips with the fact that 
the current means of measuring progress are inadequate. Therefore 
we are announcing today that the national round table on the 
environment and the economy and Environment Canada, in 
collaboration with Statistics Canada, will be provided funding 
over the next three years to develop a set of indicators to 
measure environmental performance in conjunction with economic 
performance.  In the years ahead these environmental indicators 
could well have a greater impact on public policy than any other 
single measure we might introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all these measures are taken together, this budget will 
invest $700 million in environmental technologies and practices. 
We are making this investment because protection of the 
environment is a fundamental value of our country, but let us 
understand as well it is also good economic policy.  It is a key 
element of our plan to build a more innovative economy.  Make no 
mistake, far from being a cost that we cannot afford, 
environmental protection is an opportunity we cannot forgo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect of our plan that is of critical 
importance.  To succeed in the new economy we must ensure that it 
takes root in every part of our country.  This perspective was at 
the heart of “Catching Tomorrow's Wave”, a report that was 
prepared by our Atlantic caucus.  Let me just say that we have 
heard them loud and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A similar point has been made by other members of our caucus in 
a very different context.  They point out that while we must 
ensure that all provinces participate in the benefits of the new 
economy, even within provinces there are major differences 
between urban and rural communities.  The concerns of rural 
Canadians are those shared by all Canadians:  quality health 
care, the best education for their children, a good job.  The 
difference is that in the case of rural Canada, a hospital 
closing, the school setback or the loss of a major employer 
threatens the very life of the community.  Therefore, we must 
expand economic development in smaller communities right across 
the country, north and south, east and west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also must recognize that in the years ahead all orders of 
government have to come together as never before to broaden 
opportunities right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As only one example of the kinds of things we must do, last week 
we said that in addition to the moneys that were previously 
announced to meet farm needs across the country, that we would 
commit a further $240 million for farm families on the prairies. 
This, combined with an additional $160 million from the concerned 
provinces, provides an immediate relief package of $400 million. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also enhance opportunities across Canada by strengthening 
the basic physical infrastructure which underpins so much of the 
economic activity of both rural and urban Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is urban transit, a grain road on the prairies or the 
highways of our country, the capacity to move people and goods 
safely and efficiently is key to an innovative and productive 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Affordable housing and green infrastructure are also essential 
elements of a modern society. They are critical to meeting the 
21st century needs of our municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To these ends, the government has announced that we will work 
with other orders of government and, where applicable, the 
private sector to reach agreement on a plan to improve 
provincial and municipal infrastructure in cities and rural 
communities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope to have an agreement by the end of the year. For its 
part, the federal government is prepared to commit $450 million 
over the next two years and $550 million in each of the 
following four years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having spoken about what it will take to succeed in the world of 
tomorrow, let me now turn to the authors of that future:  our 
children.  Let there be no doubt that assisting families is not 
only the smart thing to do, it is the right thing to do.  An 
important key to our children's success is the strength of the 
communities in which they live. That is why the federal and 
provincial governments agreed to develop a national children's 
agenda, to expand the capacity of governments, voluntary 
organizations and our communities to provide the services and the 
support upon which so many of our families and their children 
rely.  This agenda is critical and it simply must be advanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the next step, the Prime Minister invited all governments to 
reach agreement by December of this year on an action plan for 
early childhood development.  Our objective is simple.  Whether 
it be further services or income support, all orders of 
government must be prepared to do more for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same respect, in the Speech from the Throne the 
government committed itself to improving support for children by 
extending maternity and parental benefits under the employment 
insurance program from the current six months to one year. This 
budget honours that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this occasion to congratulate my colleague, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development, for her tremendous 
effort.  These initiatives focus on the needs of children.  They 
deal with the services and the programs their families require. 
However, let there be no doubt that one of the best things we can 
do is to leave parents with more money at the end of each month 
to invest in their children's well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was with this very much in mind that the government sought to 
design its tax reduction plan.  The principles underlying that 
package are as follows. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, while tax reduction must benefit all Canadians, it must 
primarily benefit those who need it the most:  middle and low 
income earners, especially families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, broad based tax reductions should focus initially on 
personal income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, our business tax system must be internationally 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, broad based tax reductions should not be financed with 
borrowed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997, 1998 and 1999 budgets we lowered the average 
personal tax burden of Canadians by 10%.  That is over $16 
billion.  Today, with surpluses projected for the coming years, 
the time has come to do more.  For this reason we are setting out 
a five-year tax plan so that individuals, families, small 
businesses and others will know for certain that their taxes will 
fall this year, next year and in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan we are presenting today provides real and significant 
tax relief.  It is anchored in two fundamental structural 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Canadians know that taxes cannot start to come down in 
earnest until they stop going up with inflation.  Inflation 
should not force lower income Canadians on to the tax rolls and 
others into higher tax brackets.  Nor should inflation erode the 
real value of the Canada child tax benefit and the goods and 
services tax credit.  Nor should it erode the real value of the 
age credit for Canadian seniors, nor the income level at which 
old age security begins to be reduced.  Therefore, we will make 
the most important change to the Canadian tax system in more than 
a decade.  We will restore full indexation to the personal income 
tax system immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it has been over 12 years since the actual tax rates of 
Canadians have come down.  In practical terms this has hit middle 
income Canadians the hardest because the federal tax rate jumps 
by 9 points, from 17% to 26%, as soon as someone's income reaches 
$30,000.  Therefore, over the next five years we will lower the 
middle tax rate from 26% to 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most importantly, we are announcing that two-thirds of that 
reduction, down to 24%, will go into effect on July 1st of this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reindexing the tax system and lowering tax rates will provide a 
significant benefit for all Canadians, but as well we will go 
further.  Over the next five years we will increase the amounts 
Canadians can receive tax free to at least $8,000 and we will 
raise the income levels at which middle and upper tax rates begin 
to apply to at least $35,000 and $70,000 respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, while these amounts provide significant relief, 
they are only the start.  In future budgets when we can do more, 
we will. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will make the most important change to the Canadian tax 
system in more than a decade. We will restore full indexation to 
the personal income tax system and we will do so immediately.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These amounts will provide significant relief but they are only 
the start. In future budgets, when we can do more, we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These structural changes mean substantial tax relief for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For families, we are doing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hardly need to remind this House that the cost of raising 
children is a significant expense. 
Ask any parent about the price of new shoes, or snowsuits. Ask 
any parent whose child plays sports or takes music lessons. Ask 
any parent trying to save for their child's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Canada child tax benefit, the CCTB, is to help 
with these costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 2000 the maximum payment for a family's first child will 
rise to $1,975, a level at which it was to remain in 2001 and 
subsequent years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of raising children is substantial.  Therefore, we are 
announcing today that the Canada child tax benefit, which is to 
be increased this July, will be further increased next July to 
$2,265 and to $2,400 over the next five years.  Amounts for each 
additional child will keep pace with these increases.  Most 
significantly, nine out of ten Canadian children will benefit 
from these improvements. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, the Canada child tax benefit is of greatest 
value to lower income Canadians. The measures we are introducing 
today will add to that benefit while extending it more fully for 
middle-income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a single mother earning $25,000, with one child, 
will see her benefits increase by 22% by 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A typical family with two children, earning $60,000, will 
receive $200 in additional benefits in 2001. By the fifth year, 
their benefit will more than double—from $733 to $1,541.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenges of raising a family are compounded when a child 
has a disability.  In some of these cases full time home care by 
a parent is necessary.  Therefore, we will assist these families 
by increasing the disability tax credit by up to $500 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, for families with disabled children we will 
increase the maximum annual child care expense deduction from 
$7,000 to $10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also introduce a number of other tax measures to further 
assist persons with disabilities.  We will make permanent the 
opportunities fund, a pilot project to assist persons with 
disabilities prepare for, obtain and keep employment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government inherited three major legacies in the area of 
income tax which had been introduced to help reduce the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 we eliminated the 3% surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget restores indexation of the personal income tax 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are also committing to eliminate the last of these 
legacies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective this July we will eliminate the surtax for 
middle-income Canadians on earnings up to $85,000. Over the next 
five years we will eliminate it altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994 employment insurance rates have been reduced each and 
every year from $3.07 to $2.40. In the future, these rates will 
keep coming down to the point where they cover just the costs of 
the EI program itself. For planning purposes, we have assumed 
that they will fall to $2.00 in 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adequate incomes in retirement are a critical requirement for 
any society. Diversification of registered retirement savings 
plans and registered pension plans, in turn, is an important 
part of ensuring that income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, we will increase the foreign content allowed in 
retirement plans to 30%, beginning with a 5-percentage-point rise 
in the year 2000, followed by another 5-point rise in 2001. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sustain the growth which underpins our economy we need a 
corporate tax system that is internationally competitive.  At the 
moment a number of Canadian industries enjoy competitive tax 
rates of about 21%.  But there are others, where much of the new 
job creation is occurring, such as high tech services, which 
shoulder tax rates that are much higher, yet they are up against 
companies operating around the world that pay lower taxes in 
their home countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to unleash the creative energies of our economy, if we 
are to encourage innovation and expand job creation, then these 
tax rates must be brought down to allow our companies to compete 
vigorously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we are announcing that over the next five years we 
will lower the rate for these higher taxed industries from 28% to 
21%, putting all sectors of the Canadian economy on an 
internationally competitive footing.  As a first step, the rate 
will drop on January 1, 2001 to 27%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about the importance of innovation in developing 
a modern economy.  Just as we are making investments to that end, 
we must also introduce tax measures that encourage 
entrepreneurship and risk taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget proposes action on three fronts.  First, we will 
reduce the taxation of capital gains by lowering their inclusion 
rate from three-quarters to two-thirds, effective immediately. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT64"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT64"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1700
<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will allow up to $100,000 in stock options granted 
annually to be exercised with the tax being paid only when the 
shares are actually sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a key factor contributing to the difficulty of raising 
capital by new start-ups is the fact that individuals who sell 
existing investments and reinvest in others must pay tax on any 
realized capital gains.  Therefore we will allow a $500,000 tax 
free rollover for qualifying investments, thereby increasing the 
amount these investors can put into new ventures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this budget proposes a measure which specifically 
benefits small but growing businesses, a major engine of both 
innovation and job growth in our economy.  Small business has 
told us that the most important steps we can take to assist them 
would be to lower personal income taxes, provide for rollovers, 
remove the 5% surtax and reduce the tax on capital gains.  This 
budget does all of these.  It also, however, includes one further 
measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the corporate rate rises dramatically from 
12% to 28% once non-manufacturing small businesses reach $200,000 
in income.  We are announcing today that the reduction in the 
corporate rate to 21%, which is being phased in for large 
businesses will fully apply to all small business on income 
between $200,000 and $300,000 effective January 1, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five year tax plan, both personal and corporate, which we 
have outlined today is far reaching in terms of the structural 
direction it outlines.  It is substantial in terms of the size of 
the tax relief it permits.  This budget provides a minimum of $58 
billion in cumulative tax relief for Canadians over the next five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget cuts personal income taxes by an average of 15% and 
for many much more than that.  For low and middle income 
Canadians, for instance, taxes will fall by some 18% on average 
and for families with children by an average of 21%.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you some specific examples of how this budget will 
benefit Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, indexation will help lower income Canadians most. Indeed, 
they will receive almost 40% of the tax reduction it affords. 
They will receive more than $500 million by the fifth year in 
additional GST credits. They will automatically receive increases 
in child tax benefits and the seniors credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, two seniors with a family income of $30,000 will see 
their net federal taxes fall by 45% by 2004. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a one earner family of four earning $40,000 will see its 
net federal taxes reduced by 17% next year and by 48% by 2004. 
That is a savings of more than $1,600. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A one earner family of four with income up to $32,000 will 
receive more in benefits than they will pay in federal taxes.  As 
a result they will pay no net federal tax next year and by 2004 
this family will be able to earn up to $35,000 a year and still 
pay no net federal tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A single parent earning $30,000 with one child will see his or 
her net federal benefits increase from $32 to over $1,000 by the 
year 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A two earner family with two children and an income of $40,000 
will see their net taxes cut almost in half next year, and they 
will pay no net federal tax by 2004.  This represents a savings 
of $1,244. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, a two earner family with two children and $60,000 in 
income will see their taxes cut by almost 9% next year and by 27% 
by 2004.  That is a savings of more than $1,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One further point, at the beginning of this presentation I said 
that while we would set out five year objectives we would make 
our decisions based on a rolling two year time horizon.  This is 
particularly important when hearing these examples because it 
means that as substantial as they are the tax cuts outlined in 
this budget reflect the least, not the most that we will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, what is not even reflected in these examples is that the 
15% average tax cut on which all of those examples were based 
does not take into account the 22% average tax relief when this 
budget is combined with its most recent predecessors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just say that in subsequent budgets, as resources permit, 
we will do more.  That is how we eliminated the deficit and that 
is how we will reduce taxes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a budget with many elements but a single theme: creating 
better lives for Canadians in a rapidly changing world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a budget that makes innovation the driving force of our 
economy.  It puts more money into post-secondary education and 
health care. It acts to preserve our environment and to capture 
the opportunities it affords.  It speaks to our values by 
recognizing the importance of children. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget restores indexation to the Canadian tax system.  It 
cuts federal tax rates for the first time in more than 12 years. 
It supports job growth by making Canadian business more 
internationally competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a budget that says you can cut taxes and invest in 
tomorrow at the same time.  It is a budget that sets its sights 
firmly on the future and charts the course to take us there.  It 
is a budget that recognizes that while we cannot imagine the 
world our children will live to see, our responsibility to their 
future is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must lay the foundation on which they will stand.  We must 
preserve the values on which they will build.  May it be said of 
us that we in our time laid that foundation and preserved those 
values.  May we embrace the future with confidence, the 
confidence of a people who knows that for all of our achievements 
as a nation, for all of the greatness of our history, the best of 
Canada is yet to come.

Speaker, in about three minutes I will formally move adjournment 
of the budget debate until tomorrow.  Before doing so I want to 
thank the finance minister for his presentation, a presentation 
which is more remarkable not for what it contains but for what it 
fails to disclose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely astounding that this budget statement 
contains no reference whatsoever to the $1 billion boondoggle at 
human resources development.  It does not answer the question of 
taxpayers as to why we should give the government more money to 
spend when it wastes what we already give it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the vice-president of a large public company had a $1 billion 
boondoggle in one of its divisions and even failed to mention it 
in the annual statement to the shareholders, the stock of that 
company would be driven through the floor, heads would roll and 
the vice-president of finance would end up in a federal 
institution, and I do not mean the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years after the official opposition called for eliminating 
bracket creep the government has finally agreed to do so, and we 
commend it for doing so.  While the budget loudly proclaims a 
number of other so-called tax breaks, it buries and obscures 
every provision in the government's financial plan for tax 
increases like the prescheduled increases in CPP premiums that 
take about $38 billion out of the $58 billion profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it from me to cast a shadow over this day.  Let our 
Liberal friends retire to the captain's table as the Liberal 
<I>Titanic</I> sails into the night.  Let them eat, drink and be 
merry and celebrate while they may the illusions of this budget 
while the band plays <I>Amazing Grace</I>, and then let us 
reassemble tomorrow to commence the budget debate where the 
omissions, the half-truths and the illusions of this budget will 
be exposed in the clear light of day.
