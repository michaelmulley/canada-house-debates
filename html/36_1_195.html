<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-55, an act respecting advertising services 
supplied by foreign periodical publishers, be read the third time 
and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, only a few moments ago in this House we 
prayed for guidance in our deliberations.  There is probably no 
better place where that guidance should be applied than in the 
government's law on magazine publications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a critical decision for future generations and the vote 
which we will undertake in a couple of days will really chart a 
path for the future of the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to carry out our responsibility to the Canadian public, 
the Government of Canada introduced a law on advertising 
services provided by foreign periodical publishers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What members of the House will be voting on is not about bound 
sheets of papers.  It is not about a business interest.  It is 
about the capacity of future generations of Canadians to have a 
chance to tell their stories. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be voting on an important expression of our culture and 
how we define ourselves as Canadians going proudly into the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would have us believe that our magazines, our music, our 
films, our books are just about making money.  They are wrong. 
They are about culture.  Magazines, books, movies are vehicles 
for transmitting the intangibles that are the essence of a 
civilization:  ideas, values, perspectives and the ability to see 
and celebrate our own experience and the experience of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear.  Bill C-55 is not about building walls 
around Canada.  Bill C-55 is not about keeping out the ideas and 
the expressions of other nations.  Bill C-55 does not in any way 
limit access to American magazines or the access that Canadians 
have to reading those magazines.  What is at issue is not 
newsstand space for foreign magazines.  What is at issue is 
ensuring that Canadians continue to have access to stories that 
reflect their country and that they continue to have access to a 
genuine Canadian lifeline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will allow future generations to have a choice. 
This is about choices, including Canadian choices, a choice of 
reading articles that reflect our culture and who we are. 
Canadians not only have the right to protect our cultural 
identity, we have the duty to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these past months some have alleged that we have not played 
by the rules.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In 
August of last year Canada complied completely with all aspects 
of the World Trade Organization ruling on Canadian periodicals. 
We acted to repeal Tariff Code 9958.  We moved to amend the 
Excise Tax Act.  We altered the administration of the postal 
subsidy and we lowered the postal rate for foreign magazines. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 complies with the letter and the spirit of all our 
international obligations, our Canadian rights, and, more 
importantly still, our commitments to the future of our own 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is a well considered measure intended to meet a very 
difficult challenge.  It focuses on a very specific commercial 
activity.  It contains absolutely up to date provisions on the 
application of the law.  In fact, over 100 laws contain similar 
provisions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A measure of the balance of Bill C-55 is reflected in the fact 
that it has received the support of four of the five parties in 
the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleague Suzanne Tremblay, who gave a lot of 
consideration to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. minister knows she is to refer to 
other members by their riding and not by their surname.  I know 
she will comply with standing orders in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Rimouski—Mitis 
could not be here today, but I know she has given the matter 
careful consideration.  I simply wanted to add her voice to that 
of all the other political parties, the New Democratic Party, 
the Progressive Conservative Party, the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What counts is that, when we look at the policies of all the 
governments since Confederation, establishing structures to 
protect our culture is not a partisan thing. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive governments have understood the delicate balance 
needed to build a nation.  Conservative governments and Liberal 
governments, supported by members of the opposition, have 
historically and continue to understand that as a nation we 
reserve the right to protect our culture.  That has been well 
understood by parties which recognize that when we share the 
world's longest undefended border with the most powerful nation 
in the world, when most of us live only 100 kilometres from that 
border, when most of us share the love of the movies and 
magazines that come across that border, the challenges those 
things represent for our children must be balanced in law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian child will spend more time watching 
television than they do in a classroom, an average of 23 hours a 
week.  Part of the role of government is to make sure that when 
they are watching television, when they are reading books, when 
they are perusing magazines, when they are experiencing films, 
they have choices that include the choices of their own country. 
That is what this legislation is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has played by the rules.  We ensure that the legislation 
protects the interests of all magazines that are currently 
publishing legally in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over again we have shown our willingness to listen. 
Over and over again we have demonstrated friendship with our 
American neighbours, but we maintain respect for our cultural 
sovereignty.  The approach we have taken to this bill is fair. 
Canadians appreciate and understand fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost all political parties have expressed support for this 
bill because they understand that for us to survive as a nation 
we need to have national leadership in areas of cultural 
diversity and cultural respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The support of those who work in the community, in every single 
magazine organization across the country, those who are at the 
front end of delivering Canadian content, support and understand 
why we have taken these measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 100 years successive governments of different 
political stripes have ensured that policies are in place to 
respect diversity of expression.  We need Canadian ideas, 
Canadian information and a Canadian point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These policies have been balanced to create a market for 
American cultural products that is the most open market in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government spends an enormous amount of time on this matter. 
I think in this House alone we have had more than 50 people who 
have risen to speak to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We considered the legal, the cultural and the trade aspects of 
the issue.  We weighed a host of possibilities.  We thought long 
and hard about the cost of taking action and the greater cost of 
doing nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What cabinet approved was a viable solution to meet the needs of 
Canadians to defend our culture and to meet the desire of 
Canadians to respect international law and to fulfil our 
international trade obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those opposite who are wringing their hands, saying “Do 
something else”, where are the options that they can provide? 
In reality, do something else means do nothing.  Quite frankly, 
doing nothing is not an option and has never been an option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive governments of different political stripes have 
always acted when Canada's cultural identity is at stake.  Our 
cultural wealth and diversity is not an accident of the 
marketplace.  It is not simply an issue of consumers.  It is the 
result of a deliberate commitment to provide a healthy public 
space for our own voices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a larger purpose.  Culture is a reflection of our 
society.  It is our window to the world.  It is also a reflection 
of our soul and the way we see ourselves as citizens of the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians value our cultural sovereignty and will not allow any 
other country to tell us what legislation we can or cannot pass. 
That would be abdicating our rights as a sovereign nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are those critics who say “This is no big deal. 
There really is no risk”.  Imagine if the roles were reversed. 
What if over 80% of the magazines on American newsstands were 
Canadian?  What if Canada said “That is not good enough.  We 
want it all”.  They would scream blue murder from Waikiki to 
Wall Street to Washington.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has a huge cultural presence in our lives. 
That is a fact.  No matter how challenging, Canadians will 
continue to carve out our space for the diversity of Canadian 
stories and the reflection of our culture.  That too is a fact of 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To use an analogy that I think the Americans will understand, 
let us reflect on Borg in <I>Star Trek</I> trying to turn everyone 
in the universe into one grand mass, one huge brain, one 
completely dominant culture.  The Borg says “Resistance is 
futile.  You will be assimilated”.  I am here to tell members 
that resistance is not futile and that Canadian cultural 
diversity will not be assimilated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are those who say we are just against American 
culture.  That is plain ridiculous.  We fully appreciate the many 
wonders of American culture.  We watch TV shows.  We go to 
Hollywood movies.  We read American magazines.  All we want to 
ensure is that there is room for Canadian voices in Canada and 
around the new globalized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is okay for Canada.  It is okay for the United States.  We 
expect the United States to act in its own interest, but it is 
equally okay for us to act in our interest. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back to an important point.  Canada is, and 
continues to be, the world's most open country when it comes to 
foreign cultures.  Some people are concerned that the government 
wants to ban American magazines.  That is not the case.  We 
simply wish to stop the American practice of dumping and 
siphoning off Canadian advertising revenues. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One party opposite raises the issue of free speech.  I agree. 
The legislation is about free speech and freedom of expression. 
It is about Canadians having the choice to speak to each other 
through Canadian periodicals.  It is about ensuring a magazine 
industry which allows for freedom of Canadian expression.  It is 
about making sure that hundreds of scholarly magazines, religious 
magazines, farm magazines and economic magazines do not 
disappear.  It is about ensuring the survival of magazines full 
of Canadian commentary, editorial slants and letters to the 
editor.  In short, Canadian content. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain justice loving Canadians have said that Bill C-55 could 
do enormous harm to Canadian advertisers.  The truth is that 
Canadian advertisers will continue to do business in an 
environment that is almost the same.  In this regard, the bill 
changes nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain Canadians who are not opposed to the bill in principle 
are worried about its possible repercussions and cost.  They 
feel that we should not step in to help the Canadian periodical 
industry for fear of raising American ire against too many other 
Canadian industries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to repeat it in English because I think a member opposite 
made reference to it.  Some people say we should do nothing 
because the stakes we are facing in other industries, and in 
particular the steel industry, are higher.  To do nothing would 
be to lie down to the schoolyard bully.  To do nothing would set 
the stage for a regime where no international laws are respected. 
To do nothing would say that might means right.  To do something 
firms the right of the steel industry, the right of the plastics 
industry, the right of the agricultural industry to play by fair 
international rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we understand and respect is fairness.  We believe in the 
final analysis that our American friends will also respect that 
fairness. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

really put the message in a way that I think everyone will 
understand and appreciate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my 
windows to be stuffed.  I want the culture of all the lands to be 
blown about my house as freely as possible.  But I refuse to be 
blown off my feet by any. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That message came from Mahatma Ghandi.  That message is as 
relevant in the House today as it ever was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is about ensuring that in the world of nations 
there is space for every nation and there is room for every 
nation.  That is what the legislation will guarantee and protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There are a number of questions we in opposition would like to 
ask the minister relative to Canadian job losses and U.S. 
sanctions.  I seek unanimous consent of the House to ask the 
minister questions for 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent that 
there be a period of questions for 10 minutes following the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will use up my 40 minutes.  I am very pleased to speak to the 
bill today.  The bill is not about Canadian sovereignty.  We 
already know that we are a sovereign nation.  The bill is about 
putting Canadian jobs at risk.  If I had the opportunity to ask 
the minister, the question I would ask is whether she could 
assure the country that thousands of Canadians will not lose 
their jobs if the U.S. retaliates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform opposes Bill C-55, unlike all other parties in the House. 
I have waited patiently for five days to speak to this bill. 
Time allocation was invoked this past Monday.  It is ironic that 
even though the amendment by the minister was not debated we 
still voted on that amendment on Tuesday.  I guess that is the 
way things work in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me address the issue of time allocation before I make 
some comments on the minister's amendment which we should have 
debated in the House this past Tuesday.  For the 49th time the 
government invoked time allocation.  It is becoming a habit of 
the Liberal government.  I remind members of the government what 
they used to say about time allocation or closure.  I will quote 
a few of the members from <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1989 the member for Ottawa West was quoted in the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> as saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government had shown it has no respect for the public 
process, no respect for parliament and no respect for the 
opinions of the public. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current House leader thought differently of time allocation 
when he was in opposition.  He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I am shocked.... Perhaps I should not be shocked.... This 
government has used closure on dozens and dozens of occasions. 
This is just terrible.  This time we are talking about a major 
piece of legislation.... Shame on those Tories across the way. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was in the November 16, 1992 edition of <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last quotation in reference to closure was by the current 
Minister of Foreign Affairs in an article in the April 1, 1993 
edition of Toronto <I>Star</I> in which he said that it: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—displays the utter disdain with which this government treats 
the Canadian people. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak to the amendment which the House did not have the 
opportunity to debate.  Reform does not support the amendment to 
Bill C-55 put forth by the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  This 
amendment is redundant.  What does the amendment change?  It 
changes absolutely nothing so it was unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions taken by the government are contradictory if we 
examine them closely.  On the one hand the Liberal government is 
calling for time allocation and trying to fast track the bill. At 
the same time it is putting forth an amendment to slow down the 
process at the implementation stage.  Talk about mixed messaging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government really want?  Are members opposite not 
convinced about the bill?  Does the government not have any faith 
in Bill C-55?  What does the government want in reference to Bill 
C-55?  Does it mean the government wants to leave it on the shelf 
after it passes both houses?  If that is the case why is it 
invoking time allocation and fast tracking it through?  It is 
indeed a strange and unusual way to pass legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By fast tracking Bill C-55 the government is sending a strong 
message to the United States that it is ready to risk a real 
trade war.  Will the third reading have any effect on today's 
negotiations to avoid a trade war?  I hope the government knows 
what it is getting into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peter Foster in the March 10 edition of the <I>Financial Post</I> 
gave a very accurate account of what is currently happening.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really going on at the political level is a gigantic game 
of chicken.  Politicians are merely revving their engines and 
trying to look as determined as possible while facing each other 
from opposite ends of the trade drag strip. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will be the real causalities if the U.S. retaliates?  The 
real casualties will be the working people of this country, real 
Canadians, real Canadian jobs: jobs in Hamilton, jobs in 
Montreal, jobs in Toronto, jobs in Windsor and jobs in other 
parts of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is not willing to put thousands of jobs of Canadians at 
risk.  Therefore the Reform Party is the only opposition party 
that opposes Bill C-55.  As members have heard from the minister, 
the government is trying to wrap itself around Canadian culture, 
Canadian sovereignty and the Canadian flag in defence of Bill 
C-55.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a sovereign country.  Bill C-55 is not about 
protecting Canadian culture.  If we examine Bill C-55 closely, it 
is really about putting Canadian jobs at risk and putting 
Canadians out of work.  We have already heard that retaliation 
may amount to $1 billion to $4 billion.  How many jobs will that 
be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 had a terrible beginning.  The publishers were 
consulted by the government but the other half of the industry, 
the advertisers, was not. From the very beginning the industry 
was divided and it continues to be divided to this very day. 
Publishers support Bill C-55 and the advertisers oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should take Bill C-55 back to the drawing board. 
It is poorly put together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another glitch we discovered this past week is the impact Bill 
C-55 will have on other ethnic split-runs in Canada which the 
ministry knew nothing about.  It was too busy concentrating on 
American split-runs.  The department does not know how many 
international split-runs are currently operating in Canada.  This 
bill is so broad that it may affect numerous magazines already in 
circulation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that very note, I want to clarify some things that were said 
in Monday's question period.  I pointed out to the heritage 
minister that her magazine bill, Bill C-55, would shut down the 
Chinese language <I>World Journal</I> and <I>Ming Pao</I> 
magazines.  In her response, the heritage minister claimed that 
both magazines would be grandfathered and therefore unaffected by 
Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grandfathering clause, clause 21 of Bill C-55 requires that 
a publisher “lawfully supplied such advertising services during 
the year before the day on which this act is introduced in the 
House of Commons”.   The real question is did <I>World 
Journal</I> and <I>Ming Pao</I> magazines lawfully supply 
advertising for the Canadian market?  The fact is they did not 
lawfully supply advertising for the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the February recess the heritage committee travelled 
throughout the country listening to Canadians on the subject of 
culture.  We tried to answer the question of what is Canadian 
culture. I was present at a meeting in Montreal. An interesting 
discussion took place between two well-known Canadians, Robert 
Pilon and Pierre-Marc Johnson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Johnson stated that the history of Canada has shown that we 
can compete. Satellites of today are opening doors to everyone in 
the free world.  Globalization will impact on everyone.  There is 
no way of isolating oneself to this changing world. Mr. Johnson 
went on to state that he was all for openness and that “we as 
Canadians need the same openness in other countries. We need both 
work and trade openness in cultural goods.  We need cultural 
products from the rest of the world.  We need to move from 
defence to offence”.  What does that really mean?  In other 
words, let us promote our culture around the world instead of 
trying to protect our culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heritage minister needs to heed the advice of the defence 
minister.  In a speech delivered January 27, 1997 the defence 
minister said, “Perhaps in a new digital world, policies of 
cultural promotion make more sense than traditional policies of 
protection”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the concluding paragraph from an article 
entitled “Advertising Canada's Culture:  Why the New Policy on 
Magazines Is Not Up to the Task” from the C.D. Howe Institute: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada should vigorously defend its right to promote its culture 
through subsidies, tax breaks, and sensible content requirements 
and definitions aimed at ensuring the continued availability to 
Canadians of products from their own culture, and, in general, a 
fair competitive environment for domestic cultural productions 
that are demonstrably of special value to Canadians. 
Canada should also insist that government policy be able to treat 
magazines containing Canadian stories aimed at Canadians 
differently in certain respects from those produced for a foreign 
audience.  But by clinging to measures that increasingly restrict 
access to information, that threaten Canada's commercial 
interests, and that possibly accelerate, rather than prevent, 
cultural assimilation, the federal government instead risks taking 
Canada down a path toward poorer cultural and economic health, 
and is diminishing the chances of arriving at a negotiated agreement 
with other countries on the proper line to draw between free trade and 
culture.

legislation would damage his steel company.  Steel exports to the 
U.S. account for 10% of Dofasco's sales, according to the letter. 
Mayberry is also concerned sales to the U.S. based car 
manufacturers, which also have production in Canada, could be

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the Minister for International Trade: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in exciting times.  Around the world, trade barriers are 
falling down, opportunities are opening up and the possibilities 
for Canadians to create better lives for themselves and for their 
children are greater than at any time in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology is collapsing distances, and there is an ever-smaller 
distinction between international and domestic markets.  We are 
able both to buy from and sell into markets that had previously 
been closed to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a trading nation such as ours, these developments are to be 
welcomed.  They provide Canadians with rewards for their labour, 
markets for their products and hope for their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we have benefited from liberalized trade because our 
economy is so dependent upon trade.  In fact, we depend more upon 
trade for our prosperity than any other G-7 country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty per cent of our GDP and one in three Canadian jobs depend 
upon our ability to sell our goods and services abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1992 and 1996, our exports grew roughly four times 
faster than our GDP.  Due in no small measure to this 
performance, the Canadian economy created more than 1 million new 
jobs—450,000 last year alone.  The connection between our trade 
figures and our employment figures could not be clearer. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a relationship between trade and job creation according 
to the international trade minister.  I continue from his speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that we need to stress.  Trade is not an 
abstraction.  It produces real jobs for real people and is not 
just happening on the international stage—it is happening 
locally, in our communities and in our neighbourhoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of earlier rounds of trade talks, we have opened our 
economy and enhanced our opportunities. And, as country that 
depends so heavily upon trade and investment, we have benefited 
from more open markets. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made one more key point: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real challenge in trade policy, therefore, is not 
protectionism versus liberalization—closing or opening our 
borders—but to recognize our interconnectedness and learn to 
manage our national differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada stands today as a trading powerhouse at a time when the 
world is embracing freer trade as never before.  We are in the 
right place at the right time, and our future has never been 
brighter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By experiencing firsthand the benefits of trading abroad, many 
of the concerns about liberalization are put into perspective. 
And far from seeing trade liberalization as something to be 
feared, Canadians have come to see it as something to be 
embraced. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that our international trade minister understands 
trade, what an open door policy is all about, what promotion is 
about rather than protection.  Like most Canadians, he knows our 
economy is based on trade.  That is what Bill C-55 is about. It 
makes no sense.  It takes a protectionist approach.  I cannot 
understand why the trade minister has defended Bill C-55 in 
public. Defending Bill C-55 contradicts his position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a meeting I asked the international trade minister if his 
department had done a risk assessment on this bill.  Of course I 
did not get an answer.  Knowing what he does I find it hard to 
believe this government would not do a risk analysis to consider 
the potential outcome if the Americans retaliate.  In essence 
Bill C-55 is not about culture protection. It is anti-free trade 
and it puts Canadian jobs at risk.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to examine some of the myths we have heard from 
across the way about Bill C-55.  The first myth I would like to 
dispel is that Canadian magazines do not want subsidies. The fact 
is the Canadian magazine industry receives a postal subsidy of 
almost $50 million annually, a significant portion of which goes 
to Rogers and Télémédia, the dominant Canadian periodical 
publishers. Another fact is that Canadian magazines effectively 
offer their advertisers a taxpayer funded 45% discount through 
section 19 of the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Myth number two is that U.S. magazines crowd out Canadian 
periodicals. Often heard is the statistic that foreign magazines 
capture 80% of the news stand space.  This figure reflects the 
fact that English language Canadian magazines do not rely on news 
stand sales to generate revenue.  Of the top 28 Canadian based English 
language magazines, only 5% are distributed through news 
stand sales, 59% are distributed through controlled circulation, 
with the remaining 36% being sold through subscriptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third myth is that Bill C-55 is needed to protect the 
Canadian magazine industry.  The fact is that a study 
commissioned by the federal government revealed that small 
Canadian niche magazines are not vulnerable to competition in a 
deregulated industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fact is that Canada's two dominant periodical 
publishers, Rogers and Télémédia, are large, immensely profitable 
corporations as evidenced by both their financial statements and 
their massive Bill C-55 lobbying effort and ad campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the magazine publishing arm of Rogers, a $2.6 billion 
conglomerate, generated operating profits worth 10.4% of revenue 
while Télémédia, for the nine month operating period May 31, 
1997, had operating profits of 11.7% of revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth myth is without Bill C-55 a flood of U.S. split-run 
magazines will swamp the Canadian market.  The fact is that since 
October 1998 Canada has had no law prohibiting split-run 
magazines.  Yet not a single split-run magazine has entered the 
Canadian market during that time, at least the ones the 
government knows about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth myth is that split-run magazines will discount 
advertising rates to scoop up advertisers who would otherwise be 
forced to use Canadian magazines.  The fact is Bill C-55 permits 
<I>Time</I> Canada, a U.S. split-run magazine, to operate in 
Canada. Far from scooping Canadian advertising revenues, 
<I>Time</I> Canada charges higher advertising rates and carries 
fewer advertisements than its major Canadian competitor 
<I>Maclean's</I>. A comparison of <I>Time</I> Canada and 
<I>Maclean's</I> reveals that many companies place the same 
advertisements in both magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another fact is that magazine advertising as a percentage of 
total advertising has declined from 11% to 6% over the last 30 
years.  These advertising revenues have not been scooped by 
split-run magazines.  Rather, advertisers have switched to other 
media because of a lack of appropriate Canadian periodicals to 
reach their targeted market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a study commissioned by the Canadian government concluded, 
the major reason for the underdeveloped state of magazines in 
Canada is lack of available advertisers, titles and little or no 
Canadian title coverage for many editorial segments.  The 
advertising community will avoid recommending the magazine medium 
if lack of advertisers and available titles prevents proper 
execution of plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last myth is that Bill C-55 complies with international 
trade rules.  It is a fact that it does not comply with trade 
rules.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is not just about advertising.  It is about magazines. 
Bill C-55 discriminates against foreign magazines, contrary to 
previous World Trade Organization rulings.  It is as simple as 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is why are these publishing giants crying poor 
while spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to push Bill C-55 
through parliament instead of exploring viable alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the two trades are heading closer and 
closer on a collision course.  I have been told that negotiations 
are occurring as we speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this in perspective, I want to read two letters for the 
record to illustrate how serious this matter is and to show that 
Bill C-55 may launch Canada into a trade war with the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first letter comes from the United States Senate committee 
on finance dated February 5 and written to Charlene Barshefsky, 
the United States trade representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second comes from the committee of ways and means of the 
House of Representatives dated February 9 and written to the 
Canadian ambassador to the United States, Raymond Chrétien. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if reading the letters now is a good thing considering 
we are almost at 11 o'clock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will have six minutes 
if we interrupt at this point in his speech, which the Chair is 
prepared to do.  Perhaps we will call it 11 o'clock and start 
with Statements by Members.  The hon. member can resume his

9, maybe it will convince the Leader of the Opposition to get a 
new haircut; No. 8, seeing Reformers fighting amongst themselves; 
No. 7, more page 1 stories about missed phone calls between the 
Leader of the Opposition and Joe Clark; No. 6, the sight of the 
official opposition admitting it can never hope to form a 
government; No. 5, Reformers begging separatists to join; No. 4, 
more watering down of Reform blue book principles; No. 3, a 
wedding proposal and a wedding date, and the Tory bride says no 
to both; No. 2, we Liberals love seeing Reformers living 
alternative lifestyles; finally, the No. 1 reason Liberals love 
the united alternative is that its preordained failure will 
guarantee a third consecutive Liberal majority government.

seven years ago in Courtenay, B.C., six year old Dawn Shaw was 
brutally raped and murdered.  Her 15 year old killer, Jason 
Gamache, was a repeat sex offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not even the RCMP were aware of Jason's history of child sexual 
assault because the Young Offenders Act forbade professionals 
treating a young offender from discussing the case in public.  He 
was prohibited access to children, but because of the YOA nobody 
knew about his record.  He lived next door to a school and was 
babysitting Dawn Shaw the night he killed her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new legislation, the public must be made aware of repeat 
sexual offenders like Jason Gamache if we are to protect our 
children.  We must ensure that the new YOA is drafted to protect 
our children, to punish the offenders and to make public the 
names of the offenders and the details of the offences.  The new 
YOA, as presently drafted, does not address these points.

receiving opportunities for rehabilitation.

in one single day Alberta did what the federal Liberals have 
refused to do for the last six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In yesterday's budget Alberta cut taxes deeply and raised health 
care to record levels.  The federal Liberals have done the 
opposite in the House.  Their taxes are at a record high and they 
have beaten our health care system into submission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the junior finance minister's excuse?  Why can the rest

that Alberta has? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member must have been dreaming about the new 
reformatory party he wants to create when the budget was read. If 
he had paid attention to it, he would have realized that the 
government is committed to bringing in over $16 billion in tax 
relief for Canadians over the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should be getting up today and praising us for this, as well 
as for the fact that unemployment remains at the lowest rate this 
month in the past nine years.  It is the eighth consecutive month 
of employment growth.  Why does he not get up and recognize that? 
That is something important for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be judicious, okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the smartest things about the Alberta budget yesterday 
was that it removed any tax discrimination against stay at home 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so embarrassing for the Liberals is that in order to 
give families this fairness Alberta had to break away from the 
federal tax system altogether.  It has set up a completely 
separate, discrimination free tax rate of only 11%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the junior finance minister over there, now that Alberta 
has spelled it out for them, remove all discrimination from the 
federal income tax system too? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in spite of 
difficult fiscal circumstances we have recognized the need to 
support families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why in the last budget there was $213 for a single 
earner family in the child tax benefit.  This is why we have 
increased the child tax benefit by $2 billion, to a total now of 
$7 billion to support families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move ahead with further tax cuts it is important to 
recognize whether we will have across the board tax cuts or 
whether we will target our tax cuts to particular family 
situations or a combination of both.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is interesting over here.  Alberta is dealing with a 
surplus, the same as the federal government, and yet Alberta 
comes up with the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what it has done.  Alberta ended anti-family tax 
discrimination.  It lowered taxes for everyone.  It moved to a 
simple single tax rate of 11%.  It outlawed bracket creep taxes 
and it increased health care spending at the same time.  That is 
the modern, smart way to run a government in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the junior finance minister's view of stay at home 
parents is stuck in the 1970s, but why is his tax system stuck in

the Deputy Prime Minister offers doom and gloom about Alberta. It 
is Alberta that is taking action instead of lip service when it 
comes to substantive tax relief.  In one day it provided tax 
relief for everyone.  In one day it ended tax discrimination 
against stay at home parents and in one day it reduced its tax 
system to a much simpler system, and it did this while it 
increased health care spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal excuse today for not cutting its punishing

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

have seen from the Reform Party three different proposals within 
one week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They range in cost from $4.5 billion a year to $56 billion per 
year, and not one of its proposals does what it purports to seek, 
that is tax equality among one and two earner families with 
children at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we cannot afford to make tax policy on the fly. This 
is why we have referred it to the finance committee for sober and 
reasoned consideration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party believes in tax relief for everyone and 
Alberta proved that can be done in a single day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this government that is stubborn and that refuses to 
provide that substantive kind of tax relief.  It continues to 
pick on stay at home parents with kids.  It continues to pick on 
low income families.  Eight hundred thousand Albertans will not 
be paying provincial tax yet the federal government will continue 
to wring taxes out of those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The working poor are left alone by the Alberta tax man.  Why

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the finance critic for the Reform Party in his questions 
yesterday showed that the Reform Party's priority was tax relief 
for billionaires.  Our priority is tax relief for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has not dealt with the report in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> which states that “in the Alberta budget says any 
tax relief is conditional upon achieving certain economic goals 
and that if they are not achieved, then there is no tax relief 
and any changes are put off to the next century”.  I dare the 
member to answer that question.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday's changes to the Young Offenders Act were

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
controversial Cobequid Pass toll highway in Nova Scotia has 
undergone another change.  Now the financing has been sold to an 
American company controlled by a Japanese bank.  As we know, over 
$27 million in federal government money went into the Cobequid 
highway, one of the Atlantic toll roads that use federal funds to 
turn tidy private profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government now admit that our national highways policy 
is to put roads into private hands and send the profits offshore? 
What a disgrace.  Canadians want to know what the government is 
going to do about it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that 
we have a definite position regarding toll highways.  It has 
already been clearly announced in the House that as far as the 
government is concerned, for any highway designated as part of 
the Trans-Canada Highway, if tolls are to be considered, it must 
be in conjunction with the Minister of Transport.  The final 
decision regarding that would be made by the Minister of 
Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highways are within the jurisdiction of the provincial 
governments, but whenever moneys go from the federal coffers to 
the provincial coffers for that purpose, that is for the building 
of the Trans-Canada Highway—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Cumberland—Colchester asked an extremely important 
question on the coast guard.  What the minister did not answer 
was that the only thing that kept the coast guard's budget from 
being cut sooner in 1998 was the crash of Swissair flight 111. If 
this tragedy had not occurred, the coast guard boats would have 
been laid up much earlier in the fall of 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is safety.  Is it the Minister of Transport's 
intent to ignore the safety of our fishermen and boaters in the 
same way the minister of defence ignored the safety of our 
pilots?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

made it very clear in the House many times that there will be no 
compromising of safety with regard to the coast guard. Whether it 
is the Swissair disaster or any other disaster, the coast guard 
is there to protect the safety of people and seagoing vessels. 
We will do that, absolutely.

makes common sense.  On February 8 the Minister for International 
Trade launched the consultations.  The Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food has had consultations with agriculture 
groups.  In a few weeks the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members will agree that this furthers the 
marginalization of this House with respect to any sort of 
meaningful interaction between elected members in opposition and 
ministers of the crown.  I am very concerned that this ongoing 
trend which is being perpetrated by this government continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this particular communique, the minister 
announced that “The Council will be composed of senior officials 
from the main stakeholder organizations, including the House of 
Commons, the Senate, the Library of Parliament” and the other 
organizations which are mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate is represented quite ably by the hon. Sharon 
Carstairs.  I have absolutely no objection to her participation. 
I am sure she will do an excellent job representing the interests 
of the senators.  Yet there is no elected member on this council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no member of the House on Commons on this body and I 
would respectfully suggest that that is a breach of the 
privileges of members of this House.  There is not one elected 
official.  This should be of concern to every member of this 
House.  A retired table officer representing elected officers is 
an affront to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not say this to belittle in any way the appointments that 
have been made.  In fact these particular individuals are very 
able, very honourable and long serving members of this Chamber. 
However, I would again respectfully suggest to the hon. Chair 
that it is not acceptable to members of the House that we not be 
permitted to have an elected official on this council. It is 
simply not acceptable that there not be a member of this House to 
at least offset the presence of a member of the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is yet another botched attempt by the minister.  It 
reflects again, quite accurately, the poor relations which exist 
between the public service and members of this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to move a motion to refer the matter 
of the minister's actions to the committee, if you find that 
there is a prima facie case, and there is no mandate from this 
House and no one has the right to represent that they may act for 
members of this House without specific authority from this House. 
To do so, I suggest, would be contemptible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not up to the minister to determine who represents this 
House.  This may be an appropriate matter to take to the Board of 
Internal Economy.  We have had difficulties with respect to this 
entire matter in the past.  This ongoing trend of communiques to 
the press prior to announcements being made in this House, I 
suggest, is similarly very much an affront to the dignity and the 
privileges that members of this House should come to expect from 
the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, with the greatest of respect to the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who raises this question of 
privilege and in the absence of the minister, I wonder if you 
might reserve the decision until he has had an opportunity to 
give his side of the story, if that might be of interest to the 
Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House and particularly the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough that no marginalization was 
intended by this incident nor by any others previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the question of the dignity and privileges of 
the House, I think the hon. member who is an officer of the House 
on the government side, the hon. Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, has a record which stands well.  He is well 
recognized for his respect of the House and all its membership. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am quite prepared to deal with 
the matter immediately.  The hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has raised two issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he has alleged some kind of grievance that the minister 
made an announcement outside the House which, in the view of the 
hon. member, ought to have been made in the House.  While many 
members might express some sympathy with the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough on that point, I do not think it 
constitutes a breach of the privileges of members of this House 
in any way.  Indeed it has been a common practice for many, many 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can recall sitting in the gallery in the sixties, hearing 
members making exactly the same complaint.  While that is about 
35 years ago, I do not think there has been any change.  If 
anything, there are more announcements made outside the House 
today than there were then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  That's wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member says it is wrong and 
we can shed crocodile tears about it, but I am afraid that on 
that point he does not have a question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second point the member raised as to the 
representation of the House on this group—and I noticed he 
referred to it as an advisory committee—it does not appear that 
it is a group, by its name anyway, which has any power of 
decision in respect of the premises of this place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, as the government House leader has pointed out so 
ably from his seat, he is advising the minister.  In the 
circumstances, since it is an advisory committee, I do not see 
how the privileges of any hon. member are impinged upon by the 
appointment of such an advisory committee, no matter what its 
membership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I do not feel that the hon. member has raised a 
question of privilege that I can entertain at this time and I 
decline to treat it as such.  If he wishes to raise the matter, I 
know he can go to the Procedure and House Affairs Committee and I 
am sure that the patient chairman of that committee will hear him 
out.

act respecting advertising services supplied by foreign 
periodical publishers, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is most unfortunate that this government has brought closure 
to this debate.  As we know, there are many members in the House 
who would like to speak on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is really the only party that is standing up for working 
Canadians and for working Canadians who may end up losing their 
jobs, because we know that Bill C-55 is about putting Canadian 
jobs at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previously I had indicated that I would read into the record two 
letters, one of which was received from the United States Senate. 
However, there is no time for that, so I will read a couple of 
paragraphs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter was sent to Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade 
representative, from the United States Senate and was signed by 
William Roth, Jr., the chairman, and Senator Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, the ranking Democrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of the Canadian government's action is twofold. First, 
if enacted, Bill C-55 would plainly violate the letter and the 
spirit of the GATT 1994 and the WTO agreement on dispute 
settlement.  The proposed legislation would put U.S. publishers 
at a distinct commercial disadvantage—a disadvantage that U.S. 
publishers had a right to expect would be eliminated by virtue of 
our WTO rights and the Appellate Body's ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it would undermine what many of us viewed, at the time 
we considered legislation implementing the Uruguay Round 
agreements, to be the linchpin of the WTO system.  It would be 
ironic if Canada, which has been a leader in promoting a 
rules-based international trading system, the creation of the 
WTO, and the current dispute settlement model, were to undermine 
the benefits of that system for the United States, Canada and 
other WTO members by blaming the Appellate Body's ruling in this 
instance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the last paragraph of a letter sent by 
Charles Rangel, ranking Democrat, and Bill Archer, chairman of 
the committee on ways and means of the House of 
Representatives, to our Canadian ambassador to the United States, 
Mr. Raymond Chrétien. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ambassador Barshefsky and her staff have indicated that if the 
Government of Canada presses for passage of this bill, the United 
States will retaliate by withdrawing NAFTA trade concessions. 
While we hope and expect that this issue can be resolved without 
resorting to such measures, we are committed to ensuring that 
U.S. publishers have fair access to the Canadian market, just as 
Canada's publishers do in the U.S. market.  Therefore, we 
strongly oppose C-55 and will support Ambassador Barshefsky's 
intention to withdraw trade benefits if the bill is enacted. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the banana case in Europe should be an eye-opener for 
this government.  There is a protectionist mood brewing in 
Washington these days which makes it difficult for the president 
to get the fast tracked authority he needs for the next round of 
WTO negotiations for the free trade agreement of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of this country should know that the last time 
tariffs were raised during a deflationary period was in the 
1930s, prior to the Great Depression.  At that time the 
Smoot-Hawley Act raised tariffs to over 40% on imported 
industrial goods, adding to already high agricultural tariffs. 
One nation after another retaliated by raising their own trade 
barriers.  Under the impact of higher tariffs, competitive 
devaluation and heavy-handed financial controls throughout the 
world, the flow of international trade shrank drastically in 1931 
and 1932.  We all know what happened.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We also learned today that the deputy ministers of Canadian 
Heritage and International Trade are meeting with their 
counterparts in Washington to stave off retaliation.  Why are the 
deputy ministers of Finance and Industry not involved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is really serious about the proposals under 
discussion it should have sent those officials as well.  If the 
government is serious, the involvement of the departments of 
Finance and Industry are essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the United States' trade representative has at her 
disposal a powerful weapon for retaliation.  That weapon is 
section 301 of the U.S. trade act.  Under this section, the U.S. 
trade representative can announce a detailed list of areas for 
trade retaliation with a 30-day period for comment.  She can do 
this when a trading partner presses forward with what she deems 
unfair trade practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last paragraph indicates that if Bill C-55 is voted on in 
this House and passed this upcoming Monday, the U.S. trade 
representative could announce that list on March 15 and 
retaliation could take effect no later than April 15, which is 
just over a month away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. trade representative also has options under the 
Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, as well as appeal to the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in this government will be responsible and accountable if 
trade retaliations do occur, with billions of dollars involved

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today at third reading of Bill C-55, an act 
respecting advertising services supplied by foreign periodical 
publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to restrict access to Canada's 
advertising market to Canadian magazines.  The bill would 
prevent access to the Canadian advertising market by foreign 
publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out, however, that this is not in any 
way an attempt to prohibit the sale of foreign magazines in 
Canada. Through Bill C-55, the Canadian government is seeking to 
protect a cultural sector, in this case, magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tassé commission on magazines and Heritage Canada studies 
have shown that the arrival of split run magazines on the 
Canadian market would substantially reduce the advertising 
revenues of Canadian magazines and thus imperil this cultural 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact on the Quebec market of allowing foreign magazines to 
supply advertising services would not be as great.  The 
behaviour of Quebeckers in this sector is similar to their 
behaviour when it comes to television, which is to show a 
preference for what Quebec produces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true, however, that certain major magazines in Quebec are 
produced by corporations with large interests in the anglophone 
sector and that francophone magazines could therefore be hurt 
indirectly by any weakening of the anglophone market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have reacted to the federal government's 
announcement that it intends to introduce a bill to limit the 
advertising market to Canadian publishers only by announcing 
their intention to retaliate with $1 billion worth of measures 
against the textile, steel and plastics industries, among 
others.  This is of considerable concern to the companies in 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that total advertising sales of Canadian 
magazines for 1994-95 were $521 million, of which $385 million 
was for English language periodicals and $94 million for French 
language periodicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the Americans are greatly overestimating their potential 
losses if the measure proposed today were found to be illegal by 
the WTO and were maintained by Canada, or if it were to become a 
cultural protection measure under NAFTA, which would entitle the 
United States to impose compensatory measures if Canada decided 
to maintain it after such a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since some of our industries do fear U.S. reprisals, it would be 
worthwhile determining exactly what mechanisms govern the 
international trading rules.  This is all the more important 
because there are new developments in this area daily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, a trade dispute is going on between the 
Americans and the European Union in connection with bananas. 
What is pitting the one against the other involves aspects which 
might cast some light for us on this periodicals issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. laid a complaint before the World Trade Organization 
claiming that the European Union was giving its former colonies 
a preferential tariff in the banana market, contrary to the WTO 
agreements. 
The WTO decided for the U.S. in this matter, so the European 
Union re-examined its measures in order to bring them into line 
with the international trade rules.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States reaction to implementation of the European 
measure was to impose reprisals against Europe under section 301 
of the Trade Act, which allows the Americans to impose trade 
sanctions on behalf of companies whose business has suffered a 
negative impact from any such measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Community is appealing the very existence of this 
section 301 before the WTO and, according to reports, Canada 
will be taking the side of Europe before the international 
tribunal.  It will, therefore, be highly informative to see how 
the WTO interprets section 301 of the American Trade Act. 
It will also be interesting to see how the WTO dispute 
settlement panel will rule on the dispute over bananas between 
the United States and Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada too passed a measure, Bill C-103, to protect its 
periodical sector, and the WTO considered it illegal. Canada 
complied with the decision of the international panel by 
withdrawing the legislation.  Bill C-55 is, in the opinion of 
government experts, legislation that will protect this sector 
and comply with international trade rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, everything must be done to avoid trade wars that 
benefit no one.  The Bloc congratulates the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage's initiative in proposing this amendment, which 
provides that the bill will come into force under an order in 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislative provision demonstrates the good faith of the 
federal government in its negotiations with its American 
colleagues, and the Bloc Quebecois strongly hopes that American 
trade representatives seize the olive branch tendered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill because it is 
part of the legislative and regulatory framework necessary to 
protect cultural diversity.  Although the measure involves 
trade, its effect is to protect a cultural sector, that of 
magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its statement in support of the bill, the Association of 
Canadian Broadcasters expressed very clearly its concern that, 
if Canada were to lose the battle on this issue, of little 
financial consequence to the Americans, the defeat would mean 
the beginning of the end of Canadian and Quebec measures to 
promote culture. 
It would be the first of a series of measures that would bring 
the Americans to use their human and financial resources to 
dismantle Canadian rules on content, on property and on direct 
and indirect support by the state to the cultural sector. These 
rules are deemed by the Americans to be harmful to their 
entertainment industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many observers believe that if Americans are targeting the 
Canadian magazine sector, it is because their real objective is 
a different one. This is very obvious. They are acting in this 
fashion primarily to alleviate the concerns of their voters, who 
are worried about their very unfavourable trade balance. Many 
Americans also think that the United States is the loser in the 
free trade agreement signed first with Canada and then with 
Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, let us not forget that the American entertainment 
industry has never accepted the cultural exemption included in 
the free trade agreement and then in NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that audiovisual exports rank second in the United 
States, and that Hollywood producers are major contributors to 
the election fund of the Democratic Party, it is easy to see why 
American trade policy officials are condemning Canadian cultural 
policies so strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Americans may also be targeting the upcoming negotiations of the 
World Trade Organization, which are scheduled to begin in 
November, in Seattle. 
They want France in particular to understand that there is no 
question of another stunt like the one it almost pulled off 
during negotiation of the WTO services accord when, because of 
its insistence that there be a clause in the accord to exclude 
audiovisual products, negotiations ended without culture being 
included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Charlene Barshevsky, the U.S. trade secretary, told 
Congress in January that the United States' goal with respect to 
international trade with Canada is access for American magazines 
to the Canadian advertising market and to other entertainment 
media or industries on the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans want to see the entertainment sector included in 
the WTO millennium accords negotiated next fall.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 allows them to get their message across to the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they already occupy a large part of the world's culture 
and communications sector.  The following is taken from the 
report of the cultural industries sectoral advisory group on 
international trade: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, foreign competition dominates the Canadian cultural 
market.  Foreign businesses and products account for 45% of book 
sales in Canada; 81% of English language consumer magazines on 
newsstands and over 63% of magazine circulation revenue; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—79% of the retail sales of tapes, CDs, concerts, merchandise and 
sheet music; 85% of the revenues from film distribution in 
Canada; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about $165 million.  I continue: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—between 94% and 97% of screen time in Canadian theatres; in 
fact, it is here that the situation is worst, for Hollywood 
studios have always treated Canada as though it were part of the 
American market. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people like the former Minister for International Trade 
have claimed that, in view of a major expansion in cultural 
exports from Canada, protectionism is no longer in order and we 
should go ahead and open our borders and review our cultural 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, as the working group on cultural industries of the foreign 
affairs department has remarked, and rightly so: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a culture is to prosper, it needs a distribution network and 
an investment infrastructure. It should also provide a 
stimulating environment for creators and artists. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Robert Pilon, the vice-president for public affairs of the 
Association québécoise du disque, du spectacle et de la vidéo, 
put it more simply at the meeting held in Montreal a few days 
ago on the Canadian cultural policy “In any economics 101 
course, you learn that, before you can export, you have to be 
able to produce”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this creative capacity that needs to be protected and 
nurtured in Quebec and in Canada. That does not mean we should 
refrain from making major investments in the means that the 
cultural industries in Quebec and Canada need to get a larger 
share of world markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if we give in now to American pressures, we run the risk of 
becoming more vulnerable, with the direct consequence that all 
industries in Quebec and Canada, cultural or otherwise, will be 
more fragile. We would be left to wonder what the next target 
would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where culture and communications are concerned, Quebec and 
Canada hold similar views.  Both states are of the opinion that 
every effort must be made to ensure total freedom for their 
cultural policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pity, however, that in Canada imposing a Canadian 
identity and culture takes precedence over defending the 
cultural interests of Quebec and of Canada.  Thus the federal 
government boasts about its lead role in promoting the concept 
of cultural diversity in the world, yet is unable to recognize 
the culture of Quebec and to give it pride of place beside that 
of Canada, both domestically and in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of the Canadian government bringing all of its human and 
financial resources to bear on the importance of including a 
cultural exemption clause in upcoming international trade 
agreements, thus acknowledging Quebec, which shares its views on 
this, as a valuable ally in this battle which is far from over, 
it chose not to allow it to take part in last June's meeting of 
ministers of culture in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following is what Lise Bissonnette, former editorial writer 
for <I>Le Devoir</I>, had to say on July 3, 1998 about the attitude of 
the Minister of Heritage: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reduce Quebec to cultural silence while pretending, in empty 
resolutions in the House of Commons, and in the opportunistic 
Calgary declaration, that its “culture” lends it a unique 
character, is to be afraid of one's own shadow— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allocating special status to Quebec would not even have created 
a precedent, because it has been acknowledged as a 
“participating government” for some fifteen years within 
international francophone organizations, with the agreement of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is understandable that France would decline to be represented 
in Ottawa, when Iceland was given the recognition denied to 
Quebec.  There are limits to how ridiculous things can be 
allowed to get.  If the international network of states is to 
take concrete form, and move beyond mere empty words, the 
concept of cultures must be based on reality, not on unrealities 
such as these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The credibility of the Canadian government is weakened by its 
irrational fear of Quebec, and major changes in strategy are 
called for, if it is to have the credibility to play a lead 
role.

members opposite that I have been talking about Bill C-55 for a 
while.  I am providing facts to permit an understanding of the 
government's attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 3, 1998, Michel C. Auger of the <I>Journal de Montréal</I>, not 
known as a sovereignist, commented in these terms on Ottawa's 
attitude to Quebec in the meeting organized last summer by the 
federal government, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was nothing to prevent Quebec from having the status at 
this conference of participating government similar to the 
arrangement at the francophone community summits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Canada's position would be strengthened by the presence 
of Quebec, if only to show pointedly that Canada is not afraid 
of cultural diversity internally or externally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as usual in Ottawa, they are incapable of seeing beyond 
the end of the flag.  By appearing just slightly more open, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage would have struck a vigorous blow 
for federalism.  Because, if there is one thing at the heart of 
the sovereignist project, it is the right to cultural diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So when globalization questions a number of the classic 
arguments in favour of sovereignty, there is one argument that 
takes on added importance and that is the right to defend one's 
culture and one's right to difference internationally. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, in this same vein, like to quote Bernard Descôteaux, 
the new head of the <I>Devoir</I>, who said this morning, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the presence of Quebec at meetings where cultural diversity 
is addressed should be a given. This is an issue that has Quebec 
truly concerned and rightly so. It has some viewpoints to offer 
and an experience to share in what is constitutionally a 
provincial area of jurisdiction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This speaks volumes. Quebec and Canada have reached agreements 
on crucial issues like immigration, manpower, housing, and, just 
yesterday, the justice minister recognized Quebec's uniqueness 
in the way it deals with young offenders. Why is the federal 
government so intent in ignoring Quebec's culture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, Quebec's demands in the areas of culture and communications 
date further back that its demands about manpower and were made 
by every Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, Daniel Johnson stated that Quebec should make its own 
decisions regarding culture. This statement was reiterated by 
Jean-Jacques Bertrand three years later. In 1971, Robert Bourassa 
asked for a reallocation of powers in the area of culture. In 
1991, the Allaire Report released by the Quebec Liberal Party 
recommended that culture, communications and language should be 
exclusively under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I remind my colleagues opposite that I am only 
quoting from federalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, the Bélanger-Campeau report asked that Quebec be given, 
and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—exclusive jurisdiction and responsibility over its social, 
economic and cultural development and in the area of language. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to recognize Quebec's culture, by passing it off as 
a mere regional culture within the Canada mosaic, by 
light-heartedly mixing the cultural policy with propaganda, the 
heritage minister and the federal government are giving 
sovereignists a winning condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By stating that only independent nations have the right to 
attend international events like the one that was held in 
France, the Prime Minister is providing sovereignists with 
another winning condition. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The matter of relevance has been raised once already. I am 
listening to a volley of separatist mythical propaganda as 
opposed to items relevant to the debate.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am listening carefully to 
the speech of the hon. member for Longueuil. I am sure she is 
about to make a link with Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> Madam Speaker, you will see the link 
very soon. I am getting there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wants to become a leader in the promotion 
of cultural diversity in the world. In order to establish its 
own credibility, as Mrs. Bissonnette pointed out, it must 
officially recognize the Quebec culture and give it the 
necessary means to thrive all over the world. The fact is that 
the Quebec culture already manages to do that, in spite of all 
the trip ups of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I stress the importance of continuing the fight at the 
international level to promote cultural diversity. The work has 
not even begun yet. The next round of international negotiations 
is to start in November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, neither in the budget nor in the government's statements 
did I hear about the urgent need to act or did I see the 
budgeting of any major initiative to promote cultural diversity 
and to make sure that the respect of such diversity will become 
a precondition in the millennium negotiations that will begin in 
November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with a statement made in Paris by Agnès Maltais, 
the Quebec Minister of Culture and Communications, on March 10: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent book, a French philosopher wrote that, in the 
context of globalization, it is in the interest of every country 
to listen to the nations that have always had to live with the 
profound and disturbing feeling of their own precariousness. 
Indeed, there is now a risk of overall levelling throughout the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, all peoples will ultimately feel what francophones in 
America have been feeling for so long. 
This is what led Alain Finkielkraut to use this eloquent line: 
We are all Quebeckers. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today again to address Bill C-55 at third 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the government, the New Democratic Party commitment to 
preserving our culture in the face of American aggression is 
solid.  We support this bill.  We support Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not happy with the reported government attempts, 
including its last minute amendment, to delay the proclamation of 
this bill.  We are suspicious that the government will negotiate 
our culture away behind closed doors, much as the Mulroney 
Conservatives did in the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want stronger cultural protection under NAFTA, under the FTA, 
under the WTO and under every trade agreement that Canada is 
party to.  These are not my thoughts alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important for us to understand the feelings of 
Canadians around this bill and about their opinions relating to 
the protection of cultural from Canadian foreign trade deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last week of February the standing committee on heritage 
toured Canada to seek input from interested Canadians on cultural 
policy and on such issues as Bill C-55.  I think it is fitting 
for me to include some of these comments in this presentation. 
Anne Manuel from St. John's on February 22 said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I'm not sure if everyone is familiar with this [bill]. Basically 
what it is to do, if everything works as planned, is prevent 
split-run magazines. Currently there are magazines like <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> coming out of the United States that have set 
sizes for their advertising so that when they send the magazine 
into Canada, all they do is approach an advertiser and say, hey, 
we've got a half-page ad here, let's slip that Canadian ad right 
in there.  They've already paid for the material to the freelance 
writer.  They've already paid the managing editors and the 
editors to make sure the article looks perfect, and the 
photographer to make sure the photo looks perfect.  They've 
already done all of that, so all the bills are paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they approach Canadian advertisers and they say, well, 
let's slip that Canadian ad in there and make Canadians think 
that this is a Canadian magazine”. That's cheating, and that's 
not helping culture in Canada. That's the sort of thing that 
really does need federal support desperately. We need the federal 
government to jump in and say that the foreign publishers 
advertising services act is a good thing. That's where I really 
support it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Andrew Terris of Halifax is the chair of the Nova Scotia 
Cultural Network. 
I think he said it best of many of the presenters who expressed 
concern over the enormous foreign control of our cultural 
industries: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here's what we don't control: 70% of the music on Canadian radio 
stations is foreign; 60% of all English language television 
programming is foreign; 70% of the Canadian book market is 
imported.  We don't control 83% of the news stand market for 
magazines; 84% of the retail sales of sound recordings; 95% of 
feature films screened in Canadian theatres; 86% of prime 
time English language drama on Canadian television; and 75% of 
prime time drama on French language television.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His final comment was that we are an occupied country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the Americans would never accept these kinds of 
numbers in their market.  It is imperative that the government of 
this country take a very strong stand on these issues.  These 
have implications in terms of funding for culture, technology, 
issues of trade liberalization, globalization, demographics and 
the role of the federal government.  This is the central issue in 
terms of cultural policy in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Halifax we heard from Mr. James Lorimer of the Formac 
Publishing Company.  He made some important observations 
regarding book and magazine publishing.  He noted that Canadians 
are constantly being pushed to the edge by American products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In book publishing there has been this slow, sort of stealthy 
retreat from a tough policy that was actually put in place by the 
Conservative government when Marcel Masse was the minister of 
communications.  By far the biggest book publishing company in 
Canada is owned by Bertelsmann.  The federal government has just 
allowed this to go ahead in the face of a policy that is supposed 
to prevent indirect takeovers, to stand in the way of indirect 
takeovers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lorimer continues to say that on the magazine side, we can 
see what the Americans are doing with respect to Bill C-55.  They 
are again trying to keep that space open for themselves.  They 
are trying to hold back Canadian publishing in the magazine 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness after witness spoke to us in profound and moving ways on 
the importance of having direct government action to protect 
culture and heritage in the changing world of global deal making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Montreal Mr. Peter Sandmark from the Independent Cinema and 
Video Alliance said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had one comment because I haven't heard mentioned the 
multilateral agreement on investment.  Now if that were signed, 
these co-production treaties that require foreign crews to hire 
Canadian technicians and so on would be illegal if I understand 
correctly the interpretation of it, and therefore foreign 
productions could come in here and would not have to hire any 
Canadians and could take advantage of tax credits because they 
would have to be treated like nationals, same thing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same meeting Mr. Robert Pilon, vice-president for public 
affairs for the Quebec Alliance for the Record, Performance and 
Video Industries, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada gives in on this [magazine issue] today, we will all 
suffer.  If the Americans get a victory on this issue tomorrow 
they will be attacking our support for the film sector, and the 
day after that they will be challenging us on books and our 
Canadian content on the radio. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are individuals, business people, artists and all are 
concerned Canadians.  Their message to me was not to negotiate 
behind closed doors.  They want the federal government to protect 
and promote Canadian culture and heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Pilon had it right, magazines are the line in the sand.  We 
let it slip and we will all do it at our own peril. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is a glimmer of hope, just a glimmer, that the 
Liberals will for once follow their words with some actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are serious about protecting culture they should 
proclaim this bill.  If they want to protect our Canadian 
industries they should go to the WTO table and do it there. They 
should go back to our NAFTA partners and get the retaliation 
sections of the cultural carve-out removed.  They should work 
with the other countries in favour of cultural exemptions, like 
the Europeans, and take on the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our artists are good at taking on the world.  I hope our 
government will follow the example.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-55, the 
foreign publishers advertising services act.  It is important for 
Canada that we protect our publishing industry especially in 
light of the things that are happening in the industry now with 
global communications and especially the Internet.  Pressure will 
be enormous on all countries to protect their cultures especially 
from the United States which is the leader in the Internet 
revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that the Canadian magazine industry needs to be 
enhanced and encouraged.  On the other hand, we are a trading 
nation.  If we restrict other countries from trading in Canada 
under the terms of our trade agreements then we must expect the 
retaliation which is now threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fundamental difference in the way the Americans look 
at this situation and the way we in Canada look at it.  In the 
U.S. this is just a business deal.  It is just part of doing 
business.  In Canada it is a cultural issue.  Unfortunately our 
trade agreements are trade, not cultural.  There is a great 
debate now in Canada on whether the Americans can retaliate 
against many of our industries.  I am not at all convinced that 
they cannot retaliate against us under the terms and conditions 
of our trade agreements which we did sign and should comply with. 
My support for this bill will depend on the assurance of the 
minister that our industries will be protected.  So far I am not 
at all convinced of that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding we have steel plants, plastics plants, forestry 
industries and textile factories, all targeted industries.  A 
trade war is not appealing to me or the people of my riding which 
is an area of high unemployment where it is tough to generate new 
jobs and create employment.  Even though the government has 
assured us there are protections under the terms and conditions 
of the agreements, the delays in action by the government send a 
completely different signal to me and certainly shakes my 
confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that we should have a negotiated settlement prior to the 
implementation of this bill so we can avoid any of these trade 
wars that have been discussed.  Canada has responded to other 
complaints from the Americans and we have had to adjust our trade 
tariff codes, our postal rates, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no argument about Canadian culture that it must be 
protected, but if we sign trade agreements we must comply with 
those terms.  In this case interpretations differ depending on 
who we listen to.  While we must stand up for Canadian culture we 
must again face the terms and conditions of our agreements. To 
Americans this is a business deal, to Canadians it is a cultural 
sovereignty issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stood here today and called the Americans bullies. 
I take exception to that.  I do not think they are bullies.  I 
think they are using the tools entrenched in the agreement that 
we agreed to at the time we signed it. agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1997 the World Trade Organization said Canada was 
wrong.  It told us to change our excise tax and tariffs. Canada 
was given until October 1998 to get our policy in line with the 
general agreement on services or face retaliation. We are not 
always right and in this case we were wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the government introduced the original Bill C-103 which 
did not pass the test.  Now we are trying it again with Bill C-55 
and there is controversy over whether it will be subjected to the 
same retaliation and action by the U.S.  The U.S. ambassador has 
threatened a billion dollars in trade retaliation in textiles, 
steel, plastics and wood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assurances by the minister are not very convincing.  While 
she says Canada is safe in this issue, she has already announced 
a delay in the implementation of the bill in her statements and 
her officials are marching off to Washington to renegotiate this 
deal in advance.  That makes me very nervous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister was quoted in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> as 
saying: “We think we can justify it in front of the World Trade 
Organization”. That does not instil much confidence in me.  When 
he says “we think we can justify it” I think maybe our jobs in 
steel, textiles, forestry and plastics are safe. It hits home in 
Cumberland—Colchester because all those industries are 
represented in my riding and are major employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cherubini Steel is a brand new company but is projected to 
deliver 90% of its products to the United States.  Will it ever 
get started if this happens?  Stanfield's clothing, a brand name 
known all over the world, has been in business for 100 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many mills have a tradition of shipping their wood products to 
the United States.  Poly Cello Plastics, Ropak Can-Am and 
Canadian Polymer, all industries in the plastics business, would 
ship many of their products to the United States. Does the Prime 
Minister's statement “we think we can justify it” give them 
confidence?  I do not think so.  I would not want my job 
depending on the statement “we think we can justify it”.  It is 
just not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives have been consistent in support of the 
Canadian magazine industry.  We even supported it at second 
reading of this bill.  But my vote will depend on the confidence 
in the minister, the resulting actions in the next few days and 
the results of those negotiations in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that does not instil a whole lot of 
confidence in me.  An article in today's <I>National Post</I> 
which says that top bureaucrats were dispatched to D.C. to avert 
a trade war.  We have not even passed the bill and we are trying 
to avert a trade war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another statement by the minister of international trade is “We 
are willing to entertain various options that both protect our 
mission statement but also address the American concerns.  I 
think we should be doing this”.  This does not instil confidence 
in me. It certainly does not instil confidence in industries in 
the targeted areas or their employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not playing games here.  This is a billion dollars worth 
of business.  By saying we think we can justify it in front of 
the World Trade Organization is just not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, my support for this bill will ultimately depend on the 
confidence and the assurances of the minister and the Prime 
Minister.  So far, neither of them has given me the confidence to 
vote yes on this bill.  I am not saying that I will vote no, but 
so far there has been nothing to convince me to vote yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resent the attitude of the government.  The insinuation is 
that anybody who questions or opposes this is not a supporter of 
the Canadian magazine industry or is not a supporter of Canadian 
culture.  That is not true. We are talking about a bill.  We are 
not talking about an industry.  If we vote against the bill, we 
are not voting against an industry.  We are not voting against 
Canadian culture.  We are voting against a bill which we think 
was drafted improperly and will result in retaliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the government is apprehensive about its 
position on this just by its actions and concerns.  Based on 
previous rulings against Canada in the World Trade Organization, 
comments by the Prime Minister that we think we can justify it 
are not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding any actions by the minister of heritage, again Madam 
Speaker, I ask you, would you want your job depending on someone 
saying “we think we can justify it”? 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with a lot of interest to 
the member across the way.  He said that he wanted to hear 
something that would convince him, that he is not sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago, the standing committee on agriculture went to 
Washington.  We met with Congress and the Senate.  We discussed 
with them what we perceive Canada's position is going to be with 
the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite says that he wants to be convinced.  I want 
him to think this way.  Right now with the Americans running 
advertisements through split-run magazines, what they are doing 
is testing the waters before we go to these trade negotiations. 
What we are doing right now with Bill C-55 is showing the 
Americans that Canada is not a pushover.  That would be a good 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is a reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The things that make me nervous on the other hand are that the 
Prime Minister did not come out and say, “We can defend this in 
front of the World Trade Organization.  We are right on this.  We 
can stand firm”.  He said, “We think we can justify it in front 
of the WTO”. That does not instil confidence in me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not instil confidence in me that today two top 
bureaucrats were dispatched to Washington to avert a trade war. 
Two deputy ministers, an almost unheard of precedent, are there 
now trying to divert an action by the U.S. that has not even been 
started yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether this has ever happened before. It 
certainly does not do a thing to instil confidence in me.  In my 
riding of Cumberland—Colchester, we cannot afford to play games 
with jobs in the steel industry, the forestry industry, the 
plastics industry and the textiles industry. We cannot afford to 
be testing it and saying we think we can justify it.  It just is 
not good enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, following on the vein of that question and the answer 
from the member for Cumberland—Colchester, has he given serious 
thought to the way in which the WTO is presently working? Has he 
seen the way in which the Americans are operating with respect to 
the banana case and the way in which they are treating the 
Europeans in picking off one industry after another as a way of 
advancing their trade interests in a way that does not make the 
international trade system work very well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not think that in these circumstances we as Canadians 
have to stand up and say this is an important cultural issue for 
us, this is an important dimension of what we are trying to do 
and tell our American friends, “You would not put up with 
dumping things in your jurisdiction”.  This is a form of dumping 
magazines into Canada. We are saying to them, “What we are 
asking for here, putting it in trade terms, is nothing more than 
a decent level playing field.  You talk that way all the time. 
You ask for a level playing field. Give us a level playing 
field”.  That is what we are saying, yet they do not seem to 
want to do it in these trade negotiations.  They always want to 
have the upper hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that George Will, one of those big correspondents in 
the United States, said that free trade is something that ranks 
somewhere between Christianity and jogging, as something much 
talked about and very little practised.  That is the way the 
Americans approach this. They do not believe in free trade when 
it is coming into their markets; they believe in free trade when 
it is coming into our markets or other markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important issue for Canada.  I know the member 
understands that.  I would urge him to consider that we should 
not be put off by the Americans in this respect.  I think we will 
have allies in Europe now because of the banana war.  We will 
have other allies who recognize that this type of hardball tactic 
that is presently being resorted to will not make the WTO work 
and in fact will help destroy it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member give some consideration to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, the Americans are using 
the tools entrenched in the agreements that we all agreed to.  If 
we are wrong, we are wrong and we have been proven wrong before. 
I am not saying we are wrong, but I question that we are right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was encouraged this morning by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage who spoke on this issue.  She acknowledged that this was 
a cultural issue involved with a business agreement.  If I 
remember correctly she said that they were trying to organize a 
group of countries to start dealing with cultural issues and 
establish cultural agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem here.  We have a cultural issue in a 
business agreement, in a business arrangement.  We do not have a 
cultural agreement.  If we want a cultural agreement, we should 
negotiate one.  The minister acknowledged and admitted this 
morning that we have not done that and we do not have one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, we should remember that this is a business 
agreement and we all have to live up to the terms and conditions 
of the agreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, following up on that, I noticed that during his 
intervention the hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale was 
trying to turn things around by suggesting that the Americans in 
retaliating in the so-called banana war against the Europeans are 
somehow putting the WTO at risk. I suggest what is putting the 
WTO at great risk is countries which do not adhere to rulings of 
the WTO, countries that go completely contrary to the thrust of a 
ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as the sovereign nation of Canada enter into trade agreements 
and a dispute arises.  Then the dispute is taken to the WTO for a 
ruling, as it was in this particular case. The WTO ruled on it 
and now we try to do an end run around the ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening with the case of bananas in Europe and 
with the magazine issue here which is before the House again in 
Bill C-55. I suggest that what is really putting the World Trade 
Organization at risk is countries that do not adhere to the 
rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member comment further on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that if we go into agreements which give us 
benefits, and certainly these agreements have given us great 
benefits, we sign the agreements. 
We agree to adhere to the terms and conditions of the agreements. 
We cannot be sore losers if it is proven that we have 
contravened the agreements.  This happened in the previous ruling 
on this very issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not questioning the importance of the magazine industry in 
Canada or the importance of the cultural issue aspect of this, 
but we have signed an agreement.  We have agreed to the terms and 
conditions.  We would hold them to the terms and conditions of an 
agreement and we do it every day in tribunals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really concerns me is the obvious apprehension on the 
government side that it has developed a bill that is going to 
cause a lot of retaliation.  We can see it in the government's 
words and actions. When the government said it was going to delay 
the implementation of the bill, when it said it was sending 
deputy ministers to the U.S. to avert a trade war, this screamed 
to me that we have a problem. Jobs in Cumberland—Colchester are 
at risk. The government had better make sure that it is right and 
that we are complying with the terms and conditions and that 
retaliation will not happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester.  He made a number of comments with respect 
to confidence and levels of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the minister this morning speak very eloquently in terms 
of her position and the government's position with respect to 
this bill.  From my perspective and I think the perspective of 
many members in this House, it underscored the fact that there is 
a high degree of confidence and we can proceed in this manner in 
a way that is meaningful and fitting for all Canadians.  That is 
important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree that there are times when we need, 
from a cultural perspective, to ensure that our cultural 
interests are defended and ensured?  Does the member also agree 
that in this case the Americans, with bullying tactics, are 
trying to undermine that cultural perspective? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would hope that the 
government of my country would use the tools entrenched in the 
agreement to seek the best possible terms under any agreement we 
signed. I take exception to the word bullying, or the attitude of 
bullying.  I do not agree that the Americans are bullying.  I 
think they are using the terms and conditions and if they cannot 
use them, they will be proven wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our minister and our Prime Minister are not showing confidence 
in their own positions.  Again I refer to the story this morning 
about two top bureaucrats being dispatched to Washington to avert 
a trade war over a bill we have not yet voted on.  The minister 
is already acknowledging and admitting we are in trouble on this 
issue.  She has also previously announced that she will delay the 
implementation of the bill even if it is passed.  Why would the 
government be doing this?  Why would the minister be delaying and 
running scared if we were not in jeopardy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I see there are only another two minutes or so to speak 
on this matter. I am sorry I do not have the opportunity to speak 
for a longer period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me pick up on the thread of what is being discussed about 
the trade war aspect of this bill.  We have to bear in mind that 
these are very serious issues being raised in respect of trade 
matters.  This government has a very proactive policy in respect 
of the trade aspects of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that last year the minister herself called a 
meeting of culture ministers from around the world.  They met 
here precisely to discuss this issue, diversity in international 
trade and how we can keep our cultural diversity in an 
interdependent world. I think the member will agree with me that 
this is extremely important as we go into this increasingly 
integrated world. That is why we have done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are trying to collaborate with other like-minded 
states in this area.  That is why the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade will be having hearings 
across the country to determine what the interests of Canadians 
are as we go into these negotiations. The hon. member could sit 
in on some of the committee discussions to hear from our cultural 
communities who are telling us we need a stronger stance in 
international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that the rules are not what we would like them to 
be.  We have to go into these WTO negotiations recognizing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met with members of the cultural communities in my riding 
and across the country.  They are saying that the Government of 
Canada is doing the right thing with Bill C-55.  We recognize it 
is necessary to protect our magazines if we are going to have 
informed political discussion in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were nothing but American magazines being read in this 
country we would not have either of those measures to protect 
Canadian citizens because we would not be able to discuss them in 
the intelligent, in-depth way in which we should have the 
opportunity.  That is why we are in favour of this bill.

<A NAME="LINK196">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 10 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-393, an act to amend the Competition Act, 1998 (negative 
option marketing), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill 
C-393, an act to amend the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton who introduced the bill has 
done Canadian consumers a great service in putting it forward. 
This legislation would amend the Competition Act to restrict the 
practice of negative option marketing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all familiar with the irritation of opening telephone and 
cable bills or other statements and seeing that we have been 
charged for a service we did not ask for, we do not need and we 
do not want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask about what is going on we are given the impression 
that we are at fault.  We are told we should have read the notice 
and should have sent in a form saying no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how negative option marketing works.  Negative option 
marketing is a sales strategy by which consumers are required to 
expressly refuse a product or service to avoid receiving and 
paying for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it another way, if there is no action to refuse the 
service the recipient has bought it.  I am sure there are 
examples where negative option marketing works well and for the 
benefit and convenience of both the customer and the supplier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are book and record clubs where the customer understands 
and is happy to receive the monthly selection unless the reply 
card is sent.  The key to successful negative option arrangements 
is making sure the consumer is well informed, has accurate 
information and is not taken by surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This points to why so many Canadians find negative option 
marketing offensive.  When they enter into an agreement with a 
service provider for a particular package of services they do not 
expect that the company would assume it can charge without their 
consent.  They are surprised to learn that companies think it is 
okay to keep switching and adding services and raising the 
charges until the customer says stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option marketing reverses the customer-seller 
relationship. 
It imposes on the customer the requirement to react to avoid the 
sale.  It can take advantage of those of us who with busy lives 
may find ourselves less vigilant with our financial affairs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT41"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT41"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1320
<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example can be made with day to day banking.  Many of us like 
to convenience of paying our bill by automatic debit. We do not 
always take the time to go through the statements at the end of 
the month.  Weeks later when we do notice the charges have crept 
up there is a good chance that we will let it go.  After all, it 
is only a few dollars.  It is not worth the hassle. That is how 
negative option marketing can take advantage of the average 
Canadian.  Intentionally or not, it can also take advantage of 
vulnerable consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's initiative allows the House to debate this issue. 
He should be applauded for this.  As part of this debate I would 
like to suggest a few improvements to Bill C-393 that the member 
may wish to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first propose that the bill focus on sectors of clear and 
exclusive federal jurisdiction.  This would mean making negative 
option marketing a reviewable matter with applications with 
specified regulated industries.  The bill would then be broad 
enough to encompass the major players while minimizing the 
potential for a perception of overlap with provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, in its current form Bill C-393 contemplates making 
negative action marketing a criminal offence.  Members may recall 
that in September of last year the House approved Bill C-20, an 
act which also amended the Competition Act.  One of the 
innovations of that was the creation of a civil court process to 
allow the Competition Bureau to deal more expeditiously with 
cases involving misleading advertising and deceptive marketing 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's position is that negative option marketing 
rather than being subject to criminal law and processes should be 
a matter reviewable by the civil courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may recall that in the 35th parliament the same hon. 
member sponsored Bill C-216, an act to amend the Broadcast 
Act. That bill was amended on third reading in the Senate to 
respond to concerns of its possible effects on the viability of 
French language broadcasting services.  We will want to ensure 
that Bill C-393 is crafted so as to anticipate and resolve these 
types of concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is notification.  The bill contains provisions 
requiring companies to send their customers a notice at least 
once a month for three consecutive months before they can charge 
for a new service.  In the current form it appears that these 
provisions would require a company to complete the triple 
notification process and prevent it from charging for the service 
for three months, even if the customer had agreed to it and 
signed up for the service right away.  I think this is an issue 
we may wish to review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses several of the consumer issues raised in the 
context of a much broader review of the financial sector.  As 
drafted, the bill has the potential for conflict with the 
existing provisions of the Bank Act that deal with services 
charges and notice requirements.  We will undoubtedly address 
these issues further as debate continues on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 is a worthwhile initiative that merits debate in the 
House.  It applies to certain federally regulated enterprises, 
notably those subject to the Broadcast Act, the 
Telecommunications Act and the Bank Act.  It has the potential to 
touch each Canadian consumer who subscribes to cable TV, uses a 
telephone or has a bank account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to collaborating with the hon. member on his 
private member's bill.  We want to demonstrate our support to 
consumers and give a positive response to the many Canadians who 
find negative option marketing offensive and unreasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the financial sector, the task force on the 
future of the Canadian financial services sector produced a 
report that made consumer issues a major preoccupation of its 124 
recommendations released to the Minister of Finance in September 
of last year.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons finance committee and the Senate banking 
committee have studied the report and also conducted public 
hearings.  The two committees supported many of the consumer 
measures contained in the report and provided some additional 
recommendations. The government is currently reviewing the advice 
of these three bodies and will be setting out its response as 
soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses several of the consumer issues raised in the 
context of a much broader review of the financial sector.  As 
drafted, the bill has the potential of conflict with existing 
provisions of the Bank Act dealing with service charges and 
notice requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the bill proceeds through the House and through committee at 
various stages we should consider how best to resolve the 
conflicts between the bill's provisions and the existing consumer 
protection provisions contained in the Bank Act as we debate this 
bill in the House to make sure we have responded to the hon. 
member for bringing this bill forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I compliment the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton for 
taking the courageous step in dealing with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue that many of us in the House have had to deal 
with among our constituents.  Our constituents have been very mad 
and angry that they have had to be subjected to this bullying by 
certain companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw to the attention of the House the issue of the cable 
companies and the banks that tried through the back door to force 
individuals, members of the public, to purchase goods and 
services they were not interested in purchasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton so eloquently mentions, 
the adoption of Bill C-393 will mean that if a person does not 
respond it means no purchase.  I repeat, if a person does not 
respond to what a company is trying to sell it means no purchase, 
contrary to the situation we have now where consumers are simply 
not protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this has never been dealt with before is 
absolutely tragic.  Given the actions by some large companies, 
cable companies, telephone companies and banks in recent memory, 
it is all the more important that this issue be dealt with as 
soon as possible and that Bill C-393 gets expeditious passage 
through the House of Commons for all the consumers who are not 
protected by this consumer bullying that has potentially been 
taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option billing means that if something is offered to a 
person and they do not respond, they have bought it.  Many people 
do not know this.  Sometimes they see their bill and all of a 
sudden they are paying for things they never asked for.  That is 
the reason negative option billing has to be outlawed.  That is 
why our colleague from Sarnia—Lambton has put forth this 
extremely important bill that should get expeditious passage 
through the House of Commons and into law as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the Minister of Industry will look at this bill very 
carefully and give it his full support not only in the House but 
in public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option billing is also known by other names such as 
tied selling, automatic renewal contract, all euphemisms for the 
same thing.  One can argue that tied selling actually violates 
the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 52 of the Competition Act says that anyone who promotes 
a product or business interest through representation to the 
public that is false or misleading in any material respect is 
guilty of an offence punishable by fine or imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 52(4) specifically states that the general impression 
conveyed by a representation, not just the literal meaning, shall 
be taken into account in determining whether the representation 
is false or misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Bill C-393 falls within the realm of the laws we 
have today.  That is why it is a reasonable law to be supported 
and passed by the House expeditiously. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 also would not apply to companies across the country. 
It would apply specifically to federally regulated businesses, 
such as banks, cable companies and telephone companies, companies 
that have been engaging in or trying to engage in negative option 
billing for quite some time.  I will give some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Toronto Dominion Bank employed a negative option 
technique to deprive bank customers of their privacy.  The 
National Bank has reportedly used a similar scheme to sell 
travellers' health insurance to existing customers by debiting 
their accounts $9.95 a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the action that was taken by the cable companies. 
They told their customers that if they did not hear from them 
over a certain period of time they were going to be forced to pay 
for certain services.  That was completely outrageous and should 
never have been tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 addresses this important issue of the protection of 
consumers across the country.  Industry should not be afraid of 
this.  It should actually be applauding it because it would 
improve competition.  Without Bill C-393, negative option billing 
allows companies, particularly large companies, to bully their 
customers.  Power is centralized in the hands of those companies. 
In other words, negative option billing enables the large 
companies to have greater power over their smaller counterparts. 
That is not competition.  That is called monopolization.  And in 
this country monopolization is outlawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 has a number of benefits.  It would liberalize trade 
in this country.  It would provide protection for small 
businesses, not unfairly.  It would level the playing field 
between small and large businesses.  Above all else, it would 
protect the public from being bullied by large companies that 
seek to add profits to their coffers by virtue of trying to force 
their customers, through surreptitious means, to purchase goods 
which they are not interested in purchasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would like to compliment the member for Sarnia—Lambton 
for his leadership on this issue.  He is going to get a lot of 
support from this House.  I am sure the Minister of Industry is 
going to applaud this member for his leadership and work with him 
to make sure this bill becomes a reality in the very near future 
for Canadians everywhere.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-393, an act to amend the 
Competition Act, 1998 (negative option marketing). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is aimed at prohibiting negative option marketing, 
which means billing consumers for products or services without 
their express consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this bill proposes to amend the Competition Act to 
prohibit such marketing practices by banks, trust companies, 
credit unions as well as telecommunications and broadcasting 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should this bill be adopted, anyone who commits an offence under 
the act would be subject to a fine of up to a maximum of 
$100,000. The director of the Competition Bureau would be 
required to submit an annual report on this issue. Moreover, the 
governor in council may, by regulation, exempt any service that 
needs to be exempted to remain competitive, for example, French 
language broadcasting services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize the fact that Bill C-393 is the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton's third attempt to prohibit negative option 
billing by cable companies. However, Bill C-393 differs from the 
two previous attempts in that it goes beyond cable companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to give a brief overview of the history 
surrounding the introduction of Bill C-393. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, the CRTC authorized six new English language and two 
new French language broadcasting services.  In 1995, cable 
companies in English Canada withdrew certain broadcasting 
services from the basic service and created an enlarged package 
consisting of the services previously included with the basic 
service and the new services they were offering, which had been 
authorized by the CRTC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers reacted strongly to this disruption of their package. 
Their reaction was described as a revolt at the time.  They did 
not appreciate the changes, nor did they appreciate the fact 
that they had to pay more for services they already had and that 
they had to pay for new services they did not want.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They also did not appreciate having to make known their wish not 
to subscribe to this new service, or find themselves subscribing 
by default. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the member for Sarnia—Lambton introduced Bill C-216, the 
purpose of which was to amend the Broadcasting Act so as to 
prohibit negative option billing in the broadcasting sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind members that the Bloc Quebecois was in agreement 
with the bill in principle, but that we were still opposed for 
the following three reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Bill C-216 represented interference in commercial 
relations between businesses and consumers, a field of 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill was impossible to enforce, there being no 
technology for providing television on demand.  In addition, 
Bill C-216 would have required the explicit consent of all 
subscribers for a new channel to be broadcast, which, to all 
intents and purposes, would have prevented new channels from 
starting up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill had a particularly unfortunate effect in Quebec, 
where negative option billing is needed to ensure the widest 
possible distribution of a broadcasting service, failing which 
the service would be too expensive or would never get off the 
ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, Bill C-216 died on the Order Paper when the 1997 
general election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a new parliament reconvened, the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton tried again and introduced Bill C-288 on November 
25, 1997. Its goal was similar to that of Bill C-216, and its 
content was almost identical. Unfortunately for him, the bill 
was not a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And now we have Bill C-393, which was introduced on April 23, 
1998, and is before the House. It also deals with negative 
option marketing. But, as I said before, it is different from 
the two previous bills in that it deals with much more than 
cable television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports of the hon. member's proposal in 
theory. Let me remind the House that the Quebec government has 
passed a law banning negative option billing in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Bloc Quebecois will oppose Bill C-393 for the three 
following reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the bill encroaches on Quebec jurisdiction in 
matters of trade and contracts. As a matter of fact, the 
Constitution provides that matters of contract, local trade and 
consumer protection are under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason we will vote against this bill is that the 
CRTC already has the authority to ban negative option billing, 
if it thinks it is in the public interest to use its authority 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill because it 
will help to reduce the authority of the CRTC and give the 
Competition Bureau powers that could undermine Canadian 
broadcasting policy, reduce consumer choice, increase rates and 
put an end to the development of French broadcasting services 
throughout Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that consumers in Quebec made their position 
about Bill C-216 known to the Senate committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I firmly believe that more than ever French speaking 
viewers need the protection the CRTC can give them. Members have 
to understand that Bill C-393 could prohibit every other 
marketing method except pay per view television and could 
particularly involve such limited distribution that no new 
French language service would ever get off the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could deprive us of any new French channel. But even worse, 
as my hon. colleague from Mercier put it, the French language 
media must be allowed to live, not just to merely survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these good reasons, we will vote against this bill. 
Still, I want to commend the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton for 
his perseverance, and he can be assured that the Bloc Quebecois 
will also persevere in its opposition to his bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to offer my support for Bill C-393 proposed by the member 
for Sarnia—Lambton.  Negative option billing represents some of 
the worst corporate behaviour imaginable.  By saying that implied 
consent should allow a company to change the general contractual 
agreement between a company and an individual we are chucking out 
a thousand years of common law, the part that says a deal is a 
deal.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option billing negates one of the fundamental concepts 
which I have always fought for as a writer and as a legislator, 
which is that we should always safeguard the public's ability to 
exercise informed consent when dealing with the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to add that this practice has already been dealt with 
by the NDP government in British Columbia which amended its 
consumer legislation to ban negative option billing in that 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current bill proposes to amend not the Broadcasting Act, but 
rather the Competition Act to ensure that negative option billing 
is prohibited in all sectors under federal jurisdiction, not just 
those regulated by the CRTC.  Banning negative option billing is 
a way of telling the providers of those federally regulated 
services that they should never see the public as a pool of cash 
to be dipped into whenever they need to boost profit margins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business should provide a service and if the public wants that 
service and they can afford it, they can agree to buy it.  If a 
business wants to charge customers for a service it has to ask 
them first, ask them nicely and make the sale by convincing them 
that they need it or want it.  It cannot change the rules in the 
middle of the game without permission.  It is just not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly we are dealing with this as a result of the other place 
which sent back a bill just before the last election.  As we 
know, elections are of no concern to the other place.  The fact 
that this took place is a good example of why we need to abolish 
the other place.  The House of Commons said that negative option 
billing should be banned.  The Senate blocked our will. 
Canadians suffer.  The cycle has to go and I believe the other 
place does too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I well remember the public outrage in the winter of 1995 when 
the cable companies introduced new specialty channels and 
restructured their cable package lineups.  I was offended that it 
was suggested by the companies that they needed this 
anti-consumer practice to support culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian creators produce good work and people want it, so they 
agree to buy it.  Shame on the cable companies for trying to hide 
behind artists while fleecing the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC allowed the practice in 1995 and this shows how out of 
touch the CRTC has been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support regulation and protection for Canadian culture in the 
broadcast and telecommunications industries by the CRTC.  I 
support regulation and protection for Canadian culture in 
broadcasting and telecommunications, but it is evident that the 
CRTC abandoned its role as a protector of citizens, the 
consumers, when it allowed the cable companies to gouge Canadians 
through negative option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This failure also hurt the cable industry.  When the new 
channels were introduced in 1995 it was into a much more hostile 
environment than the channel originators probably deserved simply 
because people were so appalled at the negative option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see the measure before us in this parliament and 
pleased that the member has seen fit to include other federally 
regulated industries in its scope.  I agree with the hon. member 
that we are also seeing the phone companies and some of the banks 
testing the waters with these kinds of marketing schemes and it 
needs to stop now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that most federally regulated industries are 
granted certain privileges to conduct business in a protected way 
in this country and they provide essential services to the 
economy and the people of Canada.  In return for this privilege, 
which often means they are guaranteed certain levels of profit as 
well, they have a higher duty to conduct their business in an 
ethical way.  In some cases, the cable industry for example, the 
profits are high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that with the change in focus to the Competition Act we 
will see the Department of Industry start taking a role in 
protecting consumers in Canada, not protecting corporate Canada. 
When I say this I am referring to recent failures of the 
department and the minister to protect cultural interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the loss of domestic control of large sections of the 
publishing industry, a trend apparently encouraged by cabinet. We 
have also seen unprecedented amounts of corporate concentration 
in television and other media, all with the applause of Industry 
Canada.  I hope the passage of this bill will encourage a change 
in the overall implementation of the Competition Act so as to 
protect Canadian citizens and not just Conrad Black, Izzy Asper 
and members of the Business Council on National Issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go on record as supporting the previous concerns 
expressed by the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre 
concerning the Competition Act.  He expressed his longstanding 
criticism of the act's ability to deal with pricing in the retail 
gas market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the changing nature of the international economy and the 
simultaneous trends of increased mergers and acquisitions, but 
also the growing number of small businesses, we need a much more 
active competition policy in this country to ensure that the 
marketplace works well for consumers and for small business 
owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday my leader and I attended a press conference with 
members of the small business community in Nova Scotia.  They 
raised very grave concerns about the impact of Sobey's assuming 
control of 75% of the food wholesale market on the east coast. 
The takeover of Oshawa Group by Sobey's controlled Empire Ltd. 
would mean that small family restaurants and corner stores will 
become price takers from one food wholesaler.  That will hurt 
them and it will hurt consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a competition issue and it is a consumer issue.  I think 
it is time we made a comprehensive examination of the whole area. 
As the member from Regina has said, we do not have one-tenth the 
amount of competition legislation they have in the United States. 
I am not saying necessarily that more is better but what we have 
now obviously is not enough.  And it is not working for anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to where I started this afternoon, I just wanted to 
indicate my support for the principle in the member's bill.  I 
hope it receives wide support from the House once again, and is 
not again stalled by the unelected Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in today's debate on Bill C-393, an act to amend 
the Competition Act, 1998, with respect to negative option 
billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option marketing is a deplorable practice, and we 
should all support the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton in his 
efforts to end this practice. In the case of broadcast services 
distribution, this practice gave rise to two attempts to amend 
the Broadcasting Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of amendments in the other House, it was established 
that negative option marketing should not be allowed, except to 
facilitate the achievement of the broadcasting policy objectives 
set out in the Broadcasting Act. We do not find the same 
provisions and safeguards in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that the member for Sarnia—Lambton introduced this 
bill amending the Competition Act in order to extend its 
application to banking and telecommunication services. However, 
there is a risk. Introducing in the Competition Act new 
regulatory rules that would also apply to broadcasting services 
may result in conflicts with the Broadcasting Act, as passed by 
Parliament in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Broadcasting Act provides, and I quote “that the Canadian 
broadcasting system constitutes a single system and that the 
objectives of the broadcasting policy can best be achieved by 
providing for the regulation and supervision of the Canadian 
broadcasting system by a single independent public authority”, 
namely the CRTC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any attempt to deal with a same matter in two different acts 
with very different objectives can only lead to confusion and 
court actions. The bottom line is that consumers are those who 
might have to pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Broadcasting Act provides, and I quote “The Canadian 
broadcasting system should serve to safeguard, enrich and 
strengthen cultural, political, social and economic fabric of 
Canada”. Bill C-393 deals only with commercial and economic 
aspects without any consideration for other cultural, political 
and social aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of negative option marketing is no longer used by 
the cable companies.  People will recall the fuss raised in the 
English language market.  Consumers simply will not accept this 
practice, and the cable television industry, which is faced with 
increasing competition from satellites and wireless systems, 
simply cannot use this any longer without major loss of 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill as it stands would prohibit marketing 
practices that have been used successfully to introduce a broad 
range of new French language services to the French language 
market. Without this flexibility, no new French language service 
could see the light of day, given the small size of the market.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This experience with the French language market demonstrates two 
things.  First that, when properly used, the marketing practices 
required for the introduction of new services are supported by 
consumers.  Second, the Broadcast Act states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>English and French language broadcasting, while sharing common 
aspects, operate under different conditions and may have 
different requirements. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 introduces a new regulatory power of the governor in 
council in order to remove certain services from its application 
for competitive reasons. 
There are concerns that this new power will not be easily 
reconciled with the CRTC's licensing powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, since the CRTC's licensing decisions can already be 
appealed to the governor in council, the latter could find 
himself in the position of having to deal with a single issue 
under two different acts with very different objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make sure we do not create a legislative dead end that 
would delay or even prevent the introduction of new broadcasting 
services that Canadians have a right to expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is the recent CRTC decision to grant a licence 
to a new aboriginal service called The Aboriginal Peoples 
Television Network. 
Should Bill C-393 come into effect, I am afraid it might 
jeopardize the introduction of this service by all cable 
companies in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marketing of broadcasting services is an issue that must be 
dealt with under the Broadcasting Act. This legislation provides 
all the power and flexibility required to maintain a balance 
between its objectives and consumer needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill's previous versions only dealt with discretionary 
broadcasting services. The current version no longer makes that 
distinction and could in fact prevent the CRTC from requiring 
the distribution of broadcasting services under the terms and 
conditions that it deems appropriate. Incidentally, this 
provision was the one used by the CRTC to require the 
distribution of a new aboriginal service, The Aboriginal Peoples 
Television Network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the various arguments put forth so far regarding 
this bill. I agree that we must find a deterrent to the all the 
practices that were described. However, having read the bill, I 
come to the conclusion that, in some cases, it does not address 
these concerns. For example, I do not see how it could prevent 
the banks from using the negative option or a tacit reply from 
its clients to provide personal information to a third party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in other cases, I feel that the bill targets practices 
that it was not meant to target. I am not sure that the 
intention was to prevent the compulsory distribution of an 
aboriginal service. Yet, this could well be the end result.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to Bill C-393, an act to amend the 
Competition Act with respect to the prohibition of negative 
option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recognize the work of the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton on this issue.  I know he has worked tirelessly 
in the interests of consumers.  I respect any member of this 
House who is prepared to champion an issue despite pressures from 
within his or her own caucus to be a quiet and dutiful 
backbencher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is designed to prohibit the practice by federally 
regulated businesses such as banks, cable companies and telephone 
companies of implied consent billing.  It would restore the 
traditional buyer-seller relationship that relies on the 
consumers' explicit consent before they can be billed for a 
product or service and would prohibit default billing of 
consumers who do not absolutely decline a product or service. In 
other words, it would put an end to what has been called negative 
option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that this bill has broad support among consumers 
frustrated by negative option billing.  In particular, there is 
frustration with cable providers that bill automatically for a 
new program unless the consumer expressly rejects the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer groups have cited senior citizens as examples of people 
who are often unaware that they have the choice of opting out of 
the new service and are consequently billed for a program they do 
not want and cannot afford.  This is a source of frustration not 
simply because of the financial costs but because it is deemed to 
be a violation of an age-old relationship between buyers and 
sellers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that consumers are looking for protection from 
negative option billing.  The questions are simply:  How do we 
provide this protection?  Should it come in the form of Bill 
C-393, or can this be achieved through market based reforms?  I 
think a balance must be struck.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 had its origins as Bill C-288 which would have 
amended the Broadcasting Act to restrict negative option billing 
by cable companies.  These companies can currently act with 
relative impunity as they are federally regulated regional 
monopolies that are free from the normal constraints of a 
competitive market. This new version of the bill is broader and 
instead amends competition laws that apply to all federally 
regulated industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton to use the 
Competition Act as a means by which to prohibit negative option 
billing instead of making changes to the legislation that deals 
directly with the perpetrators of this practice is troubling for 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition laws can profoundly restrict economic freedom and 
market efficiency.  The general move toward strengthening these 
laws should be approached with caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill should not be seen as a mechanism by which to restrict 
attempts made by companies wishing to expand their market share. 
We must not allow our competition laws to grow steadily more 
intrusive.  We must act vigilantly to create competition through 
deregulation of our industries in the interest of every Canadian 
consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original purpose of this draft legislation in the form of 
Bill C-288 was to amend the Broadcasting Act.  This dealt much 
more directly with the source of the problem and would be the 
preferable course by which to protect consumers against negative 
option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option billing is a practice common to federally 
regulated industries because they enjoy market protection such 
that they restrict or limit the consumers' ability to seek 
alternative providers of a product or service.  Therefore the 
deregulation of federally legislated industries should be the 
first step to eliminating negative option billing and other 
practices that do not properly serve consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party recognizes the important role of government in 
creating an economic environment with fair and transparent rules 
that protect both consumers and businesses.  Bill C-393 is a 
band-aid solution made necessary by policies that assume 
Canadians will watch anything if it is Canadian, but viewership 
dictates something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the CRTC's pursuing policies which in effect force 
Canadians to view Canadian productions on cable, viewership for 
Canadian programs remains about the same.  I challenge Canadian 
producers to offer programming that Canadians and people around 
the world will want to view.

by the member for Sarnia—Lambton to prohibit negative option 
billing in the cable sector.  However, Bill C-393 differs from

broadcasting services and only two French language ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, Canada's anglophone cable companies withdrew certain

receive it by default otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the member for Sarnia—Lambton introduced Bill C-216, 
which was to amend the Broadcasting Act to prohibit negative 
option billing by cable companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Bloc Quebecois agreed with the bill in principle, 
it was opposed to it for the following reasons: Bill C-216 
represented interference in commercial relations between 
businesses and consumers, a field of provincial jurisdiction; 
the bill was impossible to enforce, there being no technology 
for providing television on demand; the member's bill would have 
required the explicit consent of all subscribers for a new 
channel to be broadcast, which, to all intents and purposes, 
prevented new channels from starting up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill had a particularly unfortunate effect in Quebec, where 
negative option billing is needed to ensure the widest possible 
distribution of a broadcasting service, failing which the 
service would be too expensive or would never get off the 
ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate amended the bill in order to protect the francophone 
market.  The bill died on the order paper when the 1997 general 
election was called.

went at it again, this time with Bill C-288.  The purpose of this 
bill was essentially the same as that of Bill C-216 and its 
objectives were almost identical.  At the time, the bill was not 
made votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 23, 1998, the member for Sarnia—Lambton stubbornly, and 
I mean this as a compliment, introduced Bill C-393, another bill 
on negative option billing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 53.1(4) deals with offences and punishment. Fines 
range from $0 to $100,000. This section also provides that 
officers and directors of a corporation are considered party to 
and guilty of the offence and liable to the punishment provided 
for the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 gives the Attorney General of Canada the authority to 
institute prosecutions. It requires the director of the 
Competition Bureau to report annually concerning the number of 
complaints received from the public, a description of the 
complaints and proceedings undertaken under the Act. The report 
must be tabled in both Houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4 gives the governor in council the authority to make 
regulations for carrying out section 53, therefore allowing the 
governor in council to exempt enterprises that would otherwise 
come under the act, to allow them to remain competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of the bill provides for consequential amendments to 
harmonize the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that, under the Constitution, contracts, 
local trade and consumer protection are areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. I must stress this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 93 of the Canadian Constitution, which gives the 
provinces authority over matters related to property and civil 
law, contracts, local trade and consumer protection issues come 
under provincial jurisdiction. 
These powers enabled the introduction in the Civil Code of 
Quebec of a provision on contract formulation, attached in part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The powers given to provinces by the Constitution Act enabled 
the Government of Quebec to pass the Consumers Protection Act, 
which prohibits negative option marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by recalling the position of the Bloc Quebecois. 
As I said earlier, our party agrees with the hon. member in 
theory and points out that the Government of Quebec introduced 
provisions prohibiting negative option marketing within the 
boundaries of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Bloc Quebecois still opposes Bill C-393 as it opposed 
Bill C-216 and C-288, for the following reasons: this bill 
intrudes into provincial jurisdiction over trade— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Unfortunately, I must 
interrupt the hon. member, as his time is up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-393.  I congratulate 
the member for Sarnia—Lambton for his dedication to the issue of 
consumer rights and for his perseverance in bringing the 
legislation before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has made substantial changes to the way we conduct 
Private Members' Business.  It is fair to say that it was the 
passion and commitment of backbench MPs, such as the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton displayed, that inspired parliament to make those 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many MPs, my constituents have often expressed frustration 
at unfair marketing practices that require them to expressly 
decline new services in order to avoid being charged for them. It 
is also important to remember that people who pay for services 
they do not want are often the ones who can least afford it, such 
as the elderly, young people, recent immigrants and those still 
learning English or French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill regulates federal institutions, but I will show how 
insidious negative billing can be.  For example, I have two 
daughters in university who are both charged full fees that 
include extra health care of $250 a year.  Unless they line up at 
a specific time on a specific day in a specific location and 
prove they have extended health care through our family, they are 
automatically charged that money.  If they line up they get the 
money back.  Since many of the students are on student loans, 
federal government money is being sucked up by the universities 
on negative billing.  That gets me very excited and that is why I 
am in favour of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some minority groups and business people have also come forward 
to argue in favour of negative option marketing.  They offer good 
reason to allow some form of limited negative option selling to 
continue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1410"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT51"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT51"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1410

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These considerations deserve to be looked at closely, but this 
debate also offers the opportunity to consider whether negative 
option selling is the best method for achieving very laudable 
cultural objectives.  If consumers feel manipulated by negative 
option practices, this can create resentment toward the cultural 
product the practice is intended to benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is also clear that current negative option practices 
are generally unfair to consumers.  As legislators we have to do 
a better job of protecting those interests.  Bill C-393 is a very 
good step in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option billing relies on the legal concept of implied 
consent.  By not responding the consumer is deemed to have given 
his or her consent.  Some might argue that consumer pressure is 
enough to end negative option practices.  However, as Bill C-393 
recognizes, most negative option selling occurs in industries 
where there is little or no competition.  Indeed unfair negative 
option selling is much less likely to occur in competitive 
markets because of the threat of losing customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see us all have a pair of shoes arrive from 
Eaton's, for example, and then be billed a month later because we 
did not send the shoes back and see how long that practice would 
last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 deals specifically with federally regulated 
businesses such as banks, cable and telephone companies.  Those 
that argue “let the market do its work” are ignoring a central 
fact of Canadian life.  In banking, local telephone service and 
cable television distribution, consumers are faced with limited 
choices.  Companies in these sectors do not always have to 
consider consumer pressure because their customers have very few 
options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the furor in 1995, which has been recognized by 
other speakers, over the negative option billing by Canadian 
cable companies.  This elicited more phone calls into my 
constituency office than any other issue has ever affected my 
riding.  Thousands of consumers were outraged.  Cable companies 
backed off at the time.  Yet only a few short years later there 
were reports that they were doing it again, using negative option 
billing in regional markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one on this side of the House wants the federal government to 
exercise undue influence over the marketplace, but we have to ask 
ourselves whether negative option billing further concentrates 
market share with the dominant players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be time for the legislation.  Computer technology has 
made it much easier for businesses such as the banks to quickly 
and easily offer new services and change existing ones.  Industry 
Canada's office of consumer affairs pointed out in the 1996 
discussion paper that negative option marketing had the potential 
to be an important tool in the financial services sector.  To 
quote the report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a negative perspective these new technologies could allow 
industry to profit by slipping new charges and services past 
unsuspecting customers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the report also pointed out: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—responsible service providers operating in competitive markets 
can enable financial institutions to offer better service more 
easily and with greater efficiency. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also gives examples where negative option marketing 
has worked reasonably well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 takes these issues into consideration.  It recognizes 
that there may be situations where a consumer would benefit from 
a negative option billing arrangement.  However, for this to be 
the case, consumers must be able to make informed decisions and 
express consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 proposes certain steps for a negative option 
marketing practice to be legal.  The bill has received the 
support of the Consumers' Association of Canada, the Public 
Interest Advocacy Centre and the Insurance Brokers Association of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that these measures enjoy widespread public 
support.  Consumers feel vulnerable to negative option tactics. 
When this method of selling is used inappropriately it catches 
them off guard.  They are accustomed to business relationships 
where no response means no purchase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They believe they are safe in the understanding that unless they 
give their consent no one can take money from their account or 
add a charge to their monthly bill.  As I have said, negative 
option selling is sometimes used responsibly, but in cases where 
it is used inappropriately consumers are being taken advantage 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By not responding to a solicitation the consumer is deemed to 
have given his or her consent.  How can the sender be sure that 
their customer received the solicitation?  What if the person is 
away from home?  What if the solicitation simply does not make it 
into the customer's hands?  If it does make it into their hands, 
how is the consumer approached?  Is the negative option included 
with other information?  Is the offer made at the beginning of 
the document or at the end?  Is it clear for everyone who reads 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all good questions.  The debate over Bill C-393 offers 
parliament and the federal government a useful opportunity to 
explore them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the controversy over negative option billing in the cable 
industry little has been done to protect consumers from the 
misuse of this marketing practice.  On that occasion and on other 
occasions consumers have spoken.

reply card just to keep their own money.  My daughters do not 
want to have to line up in the cold to get their money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times when the practice is used appropriately for 
worthwhile reasons.  Let us deal with the misuse of negative 
option marketing so that consumers can make informed choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If consumer resistance is not effective in stopping the misuse 
of this practice, it is up to the members of this House to act in 
their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 offers us an opportunity.  The member for 
Sarnia—Lambton should be commended for bringing this issue 
before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on this important initiative on the part of 
the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is to be congratulated for bringing to the attention of the 
House a marketing practice many Canadians find offensive and for 
giving the House the opportunity to express our concern and 
support for the rights of Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many if not most Canadians dislike aggressive marketing tactics. 
We dislike pushy sales techniques.  It makes us uncomfortable to 
have to hang up the phone on a telemarketer or to slam the door 
in a salesman's face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aggressive sales tactics often succeed precisely because they 
exploit our better nature. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marketing practice dealt with in Bill C-393, negative option 
marketing, may be a little bit more subtle than the tanned 
salesman who shows up at your door, but it is just as aggressive 
and intrusive. Negative option marketing means that a company 
will send the consumer an offer saying that he must refuse it, 
otherwise it will consider that he has accepted the offer. It 
will then send him a bill or, if he are already a customer, add 
the extra costs to his monthly bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally many Canadians find this sales strategy more than a 
little annoying.  There they are sitting at home quietly minding 
their own business and they are not safely out of reach of 
businesses pushing products and services they do not need, do not 
want and maybe cannot afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Canadians be required to be eternally vigilant 
against unsolicited sales? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are negative option billing arrangements that satisfy both 
the consumer and the business, for example in certain book or 
record clubs, but generally these are contractual agreements in 
which the rights and obligations of both parties are clearly set 
out and where the consumer has all the information and knows 
what to expect. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this discussion finds support and solutions from the 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on 
the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.20 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday next 
at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
