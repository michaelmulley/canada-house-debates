	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present the
					 official opposition's motion on some of the steps necessary to create a
					 continental security perimeter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance supports the concept of a
					 security perimeter. We have talked about it at length. It has also been
					 proposed by others and by the U.S. ambassador to Canada, Mr. Paul Cellucci.
					 Those of us who have proposed this have done so for several reasons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, we believe the perimeter concept is
					 the best way to ensure the safety and security of Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it would help ensure the safety and security of
					 our friends and neighbours in the United States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it would help ensure that the vital flow of
					 trade between Canada and the United States, which is some $1.3 billion per day
					 every day of the year, continues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, by enhancing our ability to protect ourselves
					 and our economic arrangements we enhance our own sovereignty. We become less
					 subject to those who would abuse our openness and generosity and we
					 increasingly become masters of our own destiny, truly maîtres chez
					 nous.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent weeks we have proposed that a
					 federal-provincial summit be held to study the feasibility of this security
					 perimeter. The Liberal government in its arrogance has, of course, reminded us
					 that in its vision of Canada, which is out of touch with reality, the provinces
					 have no place in decision making on this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as far as public safety and security are
					 concerned, Quebec and Ontario have their own police services. As far as
					 immigration is concerned, Quebec and Alberta have a say. Rather than always
					 perceiving provincial involvement as a threat, the Liberal government would be
					 better off seeing it for what it is: an essential input from which everyone
					 stands to benefit. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A North American security perimeter would mean
					 harmonizing our borders and immigration policies with our neighbours, sharing
					 common standards.</p>


	<A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perimeter involves harmonizing customs and
					 immigration policies among Canada, the United States and perhaps Mexico to
					 ensure that there are common and regular standards on our external frontier so
					 that we do not have to slow down internal trade and we do not have to
					 excessively infringe upon the rights of our own citizens domestically.
					 Harmonizing does not mean giving up our controls. As a matter of fact, it would
					 mean increasing control of our own territory and entering into an arrangement
					 where we would be certain that our neighbours at the same time would be
					 monitoring their borders with proper controls also.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may involve certain things, for example, creating
					 a common list of countries that we regard as safe countries. I will talk
					 further about that in a moment. It may involve joint customs inspections at
					 airports, both in North America and abroad. It may involve border stations
					 where the United States and Canadian agents work more closely together. At a
					 very minimum, any effective security perimeter will have to involve measures
					 like the ones we propose in our motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada customs officers and immigration officers will
					 have to be designated as full peace officers with the power to detain and
					 arrest suspected criminals and terrorists. This will require that they have
					 enhanced training and enhanced equipment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, customs officers in particular have requested
					 that they be removed from the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. That agency is
					 at root a tax collection agency. These customs officers should be placed in a
					 designated law enforcement agency, perhaps an enhanced border control, that
					 would fall under a law enforcement oriented department, such as the solicitor
					 general.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we will need to have a firmer policy at the border
					 so that surprise arrivals, who spontaneously claim refugee status at airports
					 or at border crossings without proper documents such as passports or identity
					 cards, should be detained, and not as the minister says “for a while” or “while
					 certain checks are done” but until their identity is established and it can be
					 determined that they do not present a health or security risk to
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are a number of countries, including the
					 United States and the member countries of the European Union, which are in
					 compliance with article 33 of the Geneva convention on refugees. That means
					 that these countries, like Canada, which are free and democratic and which are
					 civilized and have an established history of protecting the human rights and
					 interests of all people in their countries, are called safe countries according
					 to that Geneva convention because they do not persecute, threaten or torture
					 people for religious, political or other reasons. No persons in these countries
					 deemed safe, such as Canada, could legitimately claim that they would be
					 tortured or persecuted because of religious, political or other
					 reasons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People arriving from countries deemed as safe should
					 not be accepted as refugee claimants. Persons arriving from these countries,
					 countries like Canada, Sweden and Holland, who try to claim refugee status
					 saying that they would be tortured back in the country from which they came
					 should be put on the next plane or bus and sent back to the safe country from
					 which they came.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the motion presented by the Canadian Alliance
					 today particularly addresses providing our customs officers with enhanced
					 training, ensuring that those who turn up at our airports without identity
					 papers are detained until they are identified and we are sure that they do not
					 represent a threat to our security, no longer accepting refugees from the
					 United States or member states of the European Union, and if such people turn
					 up at our borders claiming refugee status, deporting them
					 immediately.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To most members of the general public, these would
					 sound like basic and common sense proposals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our customs and immigration officers should have the
					 tools and training they need to do their job. Canada should not accept refugees
					 from first world safe nations or those who are trying to identify themselves as
					 such.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure in the debate today we will hear members of
					 the government claim that these are radical policies, Draconian or un-Canadian.
					 This is the inevitable Liberal reaction to any ideas which originate from the
					 Canadian Alliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the German philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, who
					 once said that all truth goes through three stages: first, it is ridiculed;
					 then it is violently opposed; and then if it is truth, it is accepted as
					 self-evident. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has been the pattern of so many of the policies
					 presented by Canadian Alliance members and members before us on this side over
					 the years. When we talked about reducing and getting rid of deficit and debt,
					 we were called extreme; it was violently opposed; and then it was accepted by
					 the Liberals. So many of our policies followed this pattern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that some speakers on the government
					 side today will express a mixture of ridicule and violent opposition to our
					 proposals. However, I have no doubt that in a few months, the Prime Minister
					 will agree to a very similar list of the proposals that we are presenting
					 today. He will do that in a press conference, probably with President Bush,
					 likely claiming that these were obvious ideas which he had supported all along.
					 Watch for that to happen. This has been the pattern of the federal Liberal
					 government since the beginning of the response to the terrorist attacks of
					 September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as September 15, I and others spoke to the
					 House about two great imperatives in the response to these terrorist attacks. I
					 said that Canada would need, as our British and American allies already had,
					 comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation. I said that Canada should not
					 hesitate to fulfill our obligation under article 5 of the NATO treaty to
					 provide military assistance to our friend and ally, the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, the government response was that these steps
					 were an unnecessary overreaction and that there was no need to adopt such
					 extreme measures. However, barely five weeks later, the government has now
					 tabled anti-terrorism legislation that has many of the very suggestions of the
					 Canadian Alliance in a motion that the Canadian Alliance tabled and the
					 government voted against on September 18. Thankfully, the government has
					 finally committed to military support in the U.S. military intervention in
					 Afghanistan; it was deemed not to be an overreaction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that whatever the government talking
					 points tell members to say today, and however the whip tells Liberal MPs to
					 vote this evening, in a short period of time, in either the second round of
					 anti-terrorism legislation or at a Canada-U.S. or Canada-U.S.-Mexico summit, we
					 will see the government proudly introducing measures along the lines we are
					 suggesting today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the government members who will reply to
					 the opposition supply day motion today to be very careful in what they say
					 about our proposals and to remember the words that Prime Minister Trudeau wrote
					 on his question period briefing book: “May my words today be soft and tender
					 for I may have to eat them tomorrow.”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of the motion is on providing a safe and
					 secure border for Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has gone to extreme and far reaching
					 attempts in proposing to reach into the lives of Canadians with criminal
					 justice legislation. Bill C-36 will provide for new and unprecedented powers,
					 like the right to make preventive arrests, the ability to shut down websites
					 for content that it may deem to be hateful and the ability to permanently lock
					 access to information on national security or diplomatic grounds without even
					 offering the possibility of review to the information commissioner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these new powers may well be necessary, and the
					 government will argue for that. We will listen, we will take part and we will
					 support where we feel that is necessary. Some may, indeed, be overdue additions
					 to the new law enforcement arsenal that is required. However, there are some
					 matters in Bill C-36 which will raise valid concerns about civil
					 liberties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one question that keeps coming back to my mind is:
					 Why has the government been so hasty to introduce legislation which will
					 infringe, perhaps justifiably, on the rights of Canadian citizens domestically,
					 but it has done almost nothing to prevent the arrival of potential terrorists
					 here from abroad? I do not understand this contradiction.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canada presented a solid frontier at the border and
					 terrorists and criminals knew they had little chance of making it in, then
					 there would be no need for some of the powers the government is bringing in
					 under Bill C-36. We need wiretap powers because over 50 international terrorist
					 groups are known to operate in Canada. With very few exceptions, almost every
					 one of the suspected terrorists originated from another country. If these
					 groups had been prevented from establishing themselves here in the first place,
					 we would have no need to provide new sweeping wiretap powers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant Philippe Lapierre of the RCMP's national
					 security and intelligence section, the counterterrorism unit, spoke at the
					 international conference on money laundering in Montreal last week. He pointed
					 out that terrorist groups operating in Canada follow a common modus operandi. I
					 am being careful to say that he was talking about terrorist groups and
					 potential terrorists. That is who we are talking about, not all refugee
					 claimants. We will be very upset if we get accused of that again today. We are
					 talking about suspected terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the distinguished member of the RCMP
					 said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> Some people are sent here with a
						  mission and some people come here on their own and are recruited. But once
						  here, they all have the same MO (modus operandi).</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that first they would claim refugee status,
					 allowing the claimant to remain in Canada while their case worked its way
					 through the system, which as we all know can take years. Then they would apply
					 for benefits in Canada, welfare and health cards that provided an income stream
					 while they got established. Next they would link with other criminals and
					 terrorists to commit petty theft, economic fraud and other supposedly invisible
					 crime. Then they would launder the money through legitimate businesses which
					 then could be used to finance terrorist operations in Canada or
					 abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern is common and the RCMP have seen it at work
					 in different cities with different terrorist groups across Canada. Again I
					 repeat it is not all refugee claimants. It is different terrorist groups across
					 Canada. If we can break the cycle, we can do much to break the influence of
					 terrorist groups in Canada. That is why I believe we can win this war if we
					 fight it properly. The place we have to start is with tougher enforcement at
					 the Canadian border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reference to Bill C-36, the Minister of Justice has
					 said that its sweeping powers are necessary because we have to stop terrorists
					 before they get on planes in Canada. She went on to say that when they got on
					 planes intending to commit hijackings and killings, it was too late. We agree
					 with that. The best way to ensure that terrorists do not get on our planes on
					 our soil is not to allow them off the planes arriving in Canada in the first
					 place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me focus on one area of this debate which I believe
					 will prove to be contentious. I have said in the House on several occasions
					 that I believe people who arrive in Canada and spontaneously claim refugee
					 status without proper identification or under suspicious circumstances, and I
					 am not talking about all refugees, should be detained until their identities
					 can be confirmed and until they have passed security clearance to ensure that
					 they do not pose a danger to Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister of immigration, who is not known for using
					 words which are soft and tender, said that this proposal of ours, which most
					 Canadians would call common sense, was in fact “one of the dark moments in
					 Canadian history”. She also said that it was nothing less than a proposal for
					 penal colonies in Canada. We have never suggested such a thing and that is a
					 departure from rational debate for her to even suggest that. Unfortunately,
					 this reaction is only too typical of this minister who resorts to fearmongering
					 and name calling in too many situations only to hide the weakness of her own
					 logic and inaction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When children are in schoolyards and their schoolmates
					 call them names, they react with the chant: “Sticks and stones may break my
					 bones, but names will never hurt me”. Unfortunately, in politics name calling
					 can hurt. The Canadian Alliance knows only too well that a common and
					 underhanded strategy of the government is to name call when it is losing the
					 debate or when its reason is lacking. We also know that name calling can hurt
					 because unfortunately it is easier to report than the substantive argument that
					 triggered the irrational insult.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though we know that names can hurt us, we also
					 know that the sticks and stones of an exploding building or a falling
					 skyscraper can do more than break bones. It can cause death and destruction. We
					 will run the risk of being politically hurt, through this reported but
					 irrational name calling, and press on to propose the things that we know will
					 make our nation a stronger and more peaceful land than it is already
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister assures us that Canada can and does detain
					 any people that immigration officers deem to be a security risk. Therefore,
					 there is no need to detain the thousands per year who show up here without
					 proper documentation. In saying this she contradicts her own department's
					 admonitions about the very limited conditions under which they can resort to
					 detention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's detention policies state clearly that
					 detention is considered only as a last resort and that even people with
					 criminal records are not necessarily to be detained unless there is substantial
					 reason to believe that they will reoffend while in Canada. I am sorry but when
					 it comes to predicting criminal behaviour or who might reoffend the government
					 has a hopeless record. It needs to have laws which detain those who might be a
					 menace to our security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine a 25 year old man arriving in Canada from a
					 country in the Middle East or North Africa where there are active terrorist
					 groups, which have been named by CSIS, the United States and British
					 governments and which are not declared to be safe under article 33 of the
					 Geneva convention. The person says he wants to claim refugee status, that he
					 does not have a passport because he used false documents to get to Canada and
					 that he destroyed the documents on the plane. If there is no evidence to tie
					 such a person to specific criminal activities, it would be hard under the
					 current refugee detention guidelines for this person to be detained. It is
					 unacceptable. We must have the power in place to detain such
					 individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between now and the time in which legislation will
					 finally come in, how many people with terrorist or criminal intent will walk
					 away from our border points when they could have and should have been
					 detained?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I respect the Liberal MPs who in 1998 recommended in a
					 committee the very same things we talked about today. I ask them to consider
					 the integrity of their loyalties. I understand the politics of following what a
					 cabinet minister wants, but this is about more than the aspirations of a future
					 cabinet minister or the fear of the whip. It is about doing the right thing. It
					 is about something that could be a matter of life and death. It is about the
					 only too real possibilities of what shameless and evil terrorists might
					 do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, when Liberals recommended the very things that
					 we are asking for today, there was not much North American evidence of just how
					 evil terrorists could be. Today, in a devastated crater in New York City, there
					 are at least 6,000 reasons to motivate us all. I encourage all MPs to vote
					 tonight on the side of what is right and just; on the side of peace, protection
					 and freedom.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, there is a deeper root to this problem. It
					 is, I believe, the federal Liberal notion that all people are basically good
					 and that there are no mean and nasty people out there. The Liberals believe
					 that in Canada we have to somehow reinforce this notion by making sure, for
					 instance, that we do not have customs officers who would have to perhaps wear
					 sidearms, that we do not put air marshals on airplanes, and that we do not make
					 an assumption that maybe somebody who is arriving here without documentation
					 could be a nasty or evil person. That shatters the Liberal philosophical view
					 of what the world should look like.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are evil people in the world. We are now
					 hearing that there are actually people in Canada who are part of terrorist
					 organizations that do not mind the thought of slaughtering innocent
					 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war on terrorism is not like a game of baseball.
					 When individuals who are possibly on the run arrive in Canada without
					 documentation they should not be accorded a tie when it comes to making a
					 decision about them. The umpire should decide, when looking at the one who is
					 on the run, that if the matter is unsure the tie goes and the umpire rules on
					 the side of safety and security of our citizens, on the side of protection, not
					 on the side of assuming that no person would want to do an illegal or an evil
					 act. Illegal and evil acts are part of the mindset of some people. We must
					 protect ourselves from that.</p>

					 look at people in general as being good people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we are not naive and we have put in place these
					 kinds of measures with respect to security in Canada, not only with customs and
					 immigration but also with respect to CSIS and the RCMP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I just came from the justice committee of
					 which I am a member. We listened to Commissioner Zaccardelli and Mr. Elcock
					 talk about the kinds of measures being taken in this all important area. It is
					 now a different world as a result of what took place on September 11. As a
					 result we need to take extraordinary measures. That is exactly part of what
					 Bill C-36 says.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we as a government, in a balanced
					 and fair approach, with a measured response and with the kinds of responses

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to ask the Leader of the Opposition,

					 as he and his party are doing? Does he think there is anything to be gained by
					 pitting people against people, group against group, province against province,
					 as he often does? I would be interested in hearing his response, because what
					 he always does, it seems to me, is try to stir up fear when really what we
					 should be doing is taking a calming approach and making sure that we approach
					 this problem with dignity and with the kind of steady response that I believe
					 the government has given. I would be interested in his response.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the member has just suggested is that the United

					 is not a matter of fearmongering when we say “Hey, pal, we are going to detain
					 you until it can be determined that you are not a security risk”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not fearmongering. This is not stirring up fear

	Mr. Speaker, in the last few weeks the minister has
					 been telling us how we detain people who could be any type of risk to or
					 problem for our society. Of course I have been taking the minister at face
					 value on this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Thursday, with the member for West
					 Vancouver--Sunshine Coast, I visited the immigration facilities at the
					 Vancouver International Airport. To my shock and horror I discovered that
					 never, ever, is a person put back on an airplane and sent back to his or her
					 destination when he or she arrives and claims refugee status with no documents.
					 Nobody is ever detained unless it is so obvious that there is an international
					 warrant for their arrest. Virtually everybody is released into society with no
					 medical check and without fingerprints being checked, because that takes 10
					 months and then they are only checked in Canada any way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered that the minister has obviously never been
					 on a tour because she does not know what is actually happening at the border.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Leader of the Opposition whether he is
					 aware that this is happening at the borders, that virtually every single person
					 who enters and claims refugee status is immediately released. Yet when we had
					 boatloads of Chinese claimants arrive here and detained them and processed them
					 in detention, more than 90% were rejected. Has the Leader of the Opposition
					 been aware of what is actually happening at our borders?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am aware of what has been happening at
					 the borders. I am also aware of the good work done by the member who has just
					 raised the issue and other members who have been aware of this problem for
					 years. Yet when we bring it forward we are consistently charged with motives
					 and with things other than our own genuine concern for the safety and security
					 of our citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say in all sincerity that I was shocked when the
					 other day the minister fired on a policy that simply says if people have
					 arrived here having torn up their documents, having flushed them down the
					 toilet on the plane and hidden their identity, we would do as other safe
					 countries are doing and detain them. We would detain them not just until we get
					 their fingerprints, as the minister will try to say, not just for a little
					 while, but until it is established that they are not a security risk. That is
					 all we would do: detain them. What we get thrown back at us is that we want to
					 establish penal colonies. If we were to put this policy in place, our
					 unfortunate reputation of being a magnet for people who want to come here under
					 questionable circumstances would be set back and people would not be getting on
					 the planes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, there is a tragic irony when
					 Liberals accuse us of wanting to do things like establish penal colonies. Does
					 the minister mean the same kind of penal colonies that the Liberal government
					 established in World War II to intern Japanese people in this country? Is that
					 the kind of penal colony she is talking about, the kind the Liberals put in
					 place? Or, in regard to refusing to allow certain people to come in, is she
					 talking about the Liberal government policies that during the second world war
					 turned away a boatload of Jewish people who had all their documents in order?
					 Is that what she is talking about? If she wants to get into certain types of
					 historical remembrances, to jar her sensitivities we can do that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are asking for is common sense and common
					 decency for the common people of our country. That is all we are asking
					 for.</p>

					 examine it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would invite the Leader of the Opposition to comment

					 Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member
					 for Waterloo--Wellington.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by getting right to the point. The
					 opposition motion is, I believe, a simplistic reaction to a very complex set of
					 issues and concerns. It looks for a quick fix where a range of efforts and
					 instruments are both required and in fact already at work. The motion is
					 uninformed, ill-considered and, in my view, impractical. Therefore, in short,
					 it should be rejected by the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First let me be clear about the facts. The current
					 Immigration Act already contains some of the toughest provisions to deny
					 admission or deport terrorists and they are used frequently. Bill C-11, the new
					 immigration and refugee protection act, would make a series of improvements
					 that would allow us to intensify our fight against those who would threaten
					 Canada's security. It clearly spells out a range for grounds for
					 inadmissibility in a comprehensive code that would replace the current act's 50
					 different grounds scattered in 4 different lists. The new bill, called Bill
					 C-11, contains comprehensive measures that would further strengthen national
					 security, which is of course a priority not only for the government but for my
					 department.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new immigration and refugee protection act would
					 add new grounds of inadmissibility. It would strengthen the authority to arrest
					 criminals and individuals who present a threat to security. It would eliminate
					 appeal rights in these cases and streamline the removal process for persons who
					 are security threats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-11 would provide our immigration officers with a
					 set of up to date tools, the tools they need to bar entry to those who pose a
					 threat to national security or engage in acts of terrorism or are part of a
					 terrorist organization. Bill C-11 would bar entry to those who have committed
					 human rights violations such as war crimes or crimes against humanity. It would
					 also bar entry to those who have been convicted for serious criminality in or
					 outside Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have told us what they want in immigration
					 and refugee legislation. Let me say that we have listened and we have acted.
					 The training on these new provisions and their subsequent application is
					 already taking place. It is underway, as we anticipate the bill will be passed,
					 hopefully soon, in the Senate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be clear about Canada's relationship to
					 immigration. Immigration is an important face of Canada's future, just as it
					 has been in the past. Immigrants will help us to sustain our standard of living
					 and replenish our labour market as the baby boomers begin to retire.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider for a moment some of the demographics.
					 In just 10 years immigration will be the only source of labour market growth.
					 In just 20 years Canada's only source of population growth will be from
					 immigration. Of this there is no doubt. Canada needs immigrants for our future
					 growth and prosperity if we are to compete in a global economy and continue to
					 grow and prosper. Yes, have no doubt about this, but we do and will crack down
					 on criminals and security threats. We will do everything in our power to fight
					 and defeat the scourge of terrorism, but we cannot and we will not turn Canada
					 into a fortress. Our economy, our society, and our way of life are too
					 important to us to sacrifice them in this way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of my mandate as Minister of Citizenship and
					 Immigration, in partnership with the Department of Foreign Affairs and
					 International Trade, the RCMP, CSIS, the customs agency, the Department of
					 Justice and the solicitor general, is to help maintain the safety of Canadian
					 society. Canadians are of course naturally disturbed and worried and feeling
					 insecure and fearful because of last month's activities. They should know, and
					 I think do know, that their government has acted and was right to have taken
					 the action it has. They were concerned that criminals might be slipping into
					 the country. They were concerned that the safety and security of Canada's
					 borders might be compromised. That is why I announced my department's recent
					 four-pronged strategy as part of the government's anti-terrorism
					 plan.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My department's share of the emergency fund would
					 amount to almost $50 million. That is a considerable sum for my department. It
					 would strengthen the department's ability to move quickly on such key measures
					 as the new maple leaf card, a permanent resident card for new immigrants that
					 will be fraud resistant, tamper resistant and secure. The first step has
					 already been initiated in intensified security screening of all refugee
					 claimants, enhanced detention and increased deportation activity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My department and its partners are working together to
					 protect Canada's borders. We are working with the United States to protect our
					 common border to ensure security and the important flow of trade between our
					 two countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is only one among the countries which find
					 themselves facing the new and emerging terrorist threat to freedom and justice.
					 As clearly illustrated by the terrible attacks on the United States last month,
					 our terrorist opponents are highly motivated, highly skilled, funded networks
					 of fanatics with access to intelligence and technology. Its members can change
					 identity and location to elude authorities. They often use expertly forged
					 documents. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be aware when we act emotionally or out of fear
					 that above all we must guard against turning our fears against our own best
					 interests. It is in our interest to continue to welcome immigrants, those who
					 have helped build this country and who will be needed in the future to help us
					 continue to grow and prosper. It is in our interest to welcome genuine
					 refugees. Canada is proud of its humanitarian tradition. We despair about some
					 of the dark moments of our history and do not want to make those mistakes
					 again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While no country is immune to the dangers, perhaps no
					 two countries work more closely on the common goal of ensuring the safety of
					 their citizens than Canada and the United States. The Government of Canada
					 reacted and responded immediately to the horrendous acts of September 11.
					 Immigration officers have increased their vigilance and tightened border
					 controls. Our officers have been on high alert and are conducting intensified
					 security screening of all arrivals on both sides of the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We work together more closely than any two countries in
					 the world. That is why we will not unilaterally declare the United States to
					 be, in the vernacular terminology of the Geneva convention, a safe third
					 country. That has special meaning. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition motion assumes we would do so without
					 the consent of our American partners. It assumes we would begin sending back to
					 the U.S. large numbers of refugee claimants who come to us through the United
					 States. That is simplistic. Such arrangements rely on negotiated bilateral
					 treaties. We are open to such discussions as we are open to discussions about a
					 range of instruments and procedures to help make our system more compatible and
					 efficient.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is my esteemed colleague determined to cast a pall
					 over the country's good reputation? I am here today to assure him and all
					 Canadians that there is every reason to speak confidently about Canada's role
					 in the battle against terrorism. Canada is a world leader in detection and
					 deportation. If we take the example of perpetrators of modern day war crimes
					 and crimes against humanity, Canada has long voiced its strategy in this
					 regard. My colleagues from around the world come to Canada to ask for our
					 advice and look at what we do and how we do it. Canadians should be
					 proud.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put the challenge in context. Over 110 million
					 people enter Canada each year. Despite these numbers our enforcement officers
					 have produced tremendous results. I am proud of the effort of the people who
					 have been working in my department on this important initiative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our enforcement officers reported 65,000 people, 7,300
					 of whom were serious criminals, in the year 2000 alone. We have increased
					 resources for overseas interdiction. We have one of the best immigration
					 control officers networks anywhere in the world. It is a model. Our officers
					 are placed at airports around the world and they train airline staff. They are
					 doing an outstanding job.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, we just heard how well the system works so
					 I will cite the example of the case of Nabil Al-Marabh. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Al-Marabh had been ordered deported. He was facing
					 criminal charges in the United States. He was arrested trying to enter the
					 United States carrying forged Canadian passports and, unbelievably, was
					 detained for all of two weeks by the Immigration and Refugee Board of our
					 country. It now turns out he may have been one of the organizers and
					 masterminds of the September 11 atrocity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is simple and I am not talking about
					 immigration policy. Would the new legislation and the minister have the ability
					 to detain suspicious refugee claimants who arrive here without documents or
					 with questionable documents until they are cleared and proven not to be
					 security risks? Simplistic, yes, it is very simplistic. Canadians want to know
					 they will be safe and secure.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, existing immigration law gives authority
					 to immigration officers to detain individuals if they are suspicious, if they
					 do not know who the individual is, if they are concerned they will not show up
					 for hearings, or if they have any evidence whatsoever to suggest the person
					 poses a threat to national security. That is also contained in the new
					 legislation. It would go a step further by stating clearly that if someone is
					 undocumented and uncooperative it is grounds for detention. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We detain whenever we have concern and when we have
					 evidence to sustain the detention. In Canada we must have evidence to be able
					 to detain someone and take away their liberties. That is one of the important
					 features of the Immigration Act. It gives my officers the authority to do that
					 and they do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would caution the Leader of the Opposition not to act
					 as judge and jury on individual cases and not to do or say anything that might
					 prejudice the outcome of an important investigation or trial. We want justice
					 to be served by bringing people who are guilty to justice.</p>

					 these questions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government does not resort to the quick fix
					 approach, why did it jump to buy an illegal medication for the anthrax problem
					 when there was a legal medication available? The government jumped to purchase

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member of parliament for North Vancouver said that

					 immigrants, refugee claimants, visitors or students.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, 110 million people come to Canada each year
					 and they are checked by our immigration officers and customs officials. If our
					 customs officers have a concern that someone poses a threat, if they do not

					 to the Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, this is an important debate. It is well
					 worth the consideration of the House in terms of what we as a government have
					 done in the last while in terms of Bill C-11 and other measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years the countries of North America have
					 discussed and worked together on initiatives born of a common desire to make
					 our continent more prosperous and competitive on a global scale. Sadly the
					 current initiative to fortify our respective borders is born of terror and
					 bloodshed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Canada's hope that all nations of the continent
					 will do what they can individually to respond to the needs of the collective.
					 Bill C-11, it goes without saying, is a major move forward for Canada in
					 upholding the enforcement of our borders. It is a good bill and it is worthy of
					 support. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in the House we are considering a motion that
					 requests that the government work more diligently to secure our borders. The
					 government has responded to that demand by bringing forward Bill C-11 and
					 making it an utmost priority, and rightfully so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before us requests increased powers of
					 detention for customs and immigration officials. I find it passing strange that
					 a short five months ago the Canadian Alliance immigration critic tabled a
					 motion in the House to amend Bill C-11 at report stage. Motion No. 5 would have
					 watered down the definition of security threat to determine who is admissible
					 to Canada. The motion was supported by all members of the Alliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it strange that one thing was said then and
					 quite another is said now. Our definition of Bill C-11 includes activities
					 outside Canada and indirect threats. The Canadian Alliance motion included only
					 direct and active threats. The Alliance went further. It tabled a motion at
					 committee stage to restore certain appeal rights through the immigration appeal
					 division for serious criminals and threats to Canadian security. Bill C-11 has
					 removed these to allow for quicker removals from Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure what that is called. The word flip-flop
					 comes to mind. The ability to detain and arrest at the border suspected
					 terrorists or individuals who do not provide proper paperwork for
					 identification is already in place. Bill C-11 works to increase the
					 capabilities of our frontline officers by giving them early access to security
					 screening processes and enhanced exclusionary mechanisms to remove undesirables
					 from the process. The people who handle refugee cases now have more tools with
					 which to work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Immigration Act currently allows customs
					 and immigration officers and officials to detain anyone they determine to be a
					 security risk to Canadians. Bill C-11 provides a means to strengthen the
					 ability of officials to bar entry to Canada of potential terrorists whether
					 they commit terrorist acts in Canada or in other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 12 the minister of immigration announced a
					 five part security strategy as part of Canada's anti-terrorism plan. As part of
					 that plan the government is strengthening immigration measures in light of the
					 terrorist attacks that took place on September 11. The minister has announced
					 that we are increasing detention capability and hiring up to 100 new staff to
					 enforce upgraded security at ports of entry. As a further sign that the
					 government is committed to this initiative, and rightfully so, cabinet approved
					 funding of $4 million to cover these needs in the coming months. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of detention has been a delicate one indeed.
					 The government is attempting through Bill C-11 to find the proper and
					 acceptable balance between protecting the citizens of Canada and maintaining an
					 even-handed approach with those legitimately attempting to gain entry into
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs and immigration officers are fully trained to
					 perform their duties effectively. They are aware of their duty to uphold the
					 values of fairness, openness and protection that Canadians across this great
					 country of ours hold dear. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course of the 100 million people who come to Canada
					 each year not all are seeking to get in illegally by way of refugee status.
					 However it must be noted that in the 2000-01 timetable for which data is
					 available over 8,700 individuals were detained for a total of 136,000
					 days.</p>


	<A NAME="T1100"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1100"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1100)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tremendous success for the officials
					 patrolling our borders. On any given average day the number of individuals in
					 detention under the auspices of the Immigration Act ranges from 400 to 800
					 people. That is a significant number when looked at over the long term. I am
					 saying to the House and the Canadian people that the system in place works
					 efficiently and effectively in most of the cases most of the time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration officials do not work alone. Canada has
					 nurtured working relationships with CSIS, the RCMP and foreign immigration and
					 law enforcement agencies such as those in the United States, Great Britain and
					 the European Union to prevent criminals and people who are considered to be a
					 security risk from entering Canada. We have worked closely with our partners
					 not only within Canada but internationally as well. These networks of
					 information are crucial to maintaining our level of security and
					 safety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations security council recently passed a
					 binding resolution regarding elimination of terrorist financing. Two paragraphs
					 contained therein demanded that the United States tighten its refugee
					 regulations. Canada will continue to welcome refugees and will adhere to the
					 resolution passed by the United Nations. Canada has commenced work in this
					 regard with Bill C-11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have implemented a screening process for all
					 refugees that is stringent yet fair. We have made it clear to all who appear at
					 our country's doorstep that no individual involved in terrorist acts will be
					 welcomed here. Furthermore, they will be ineligible to make a refugee claim in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was mentioned on an earlier occasion, the
					 Immigration Act currently allows for interdictions abroad. Canadian officials
					 overseas work closely with the transportation industry to examine and evaluate
					 the paperwork of immigrants and visitors coming to our country. Embarkation is
					 denied when necessary and when required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past two years Citizenship and Immigration
					 Canada increased the number of control officers from 31 to 48. This network of
					 immigration control officers abroad in the last year alone intercepted 6,000
					 improperly documented travellers that were attempting to fly into Canada. Over
					 the last six years approximately 33,000 people attempted to enter Canada
					 fraudulently and they were detected and stopped before they departed their
					 country of origin. The interdiction program is successful and the department
					 can be very proud it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are trying times not only in Canada but around
					 the world in terms of what took place on September 11. However we had foresight
					 with respect to Bill C-11. The minister in her wisdom brought forward a very
					 good bill which we as a government supported. It has proceeded through
					 committee and ultimately through the House. It was fortuitous for us to do that
					 in keeping with the values of Canada, in keeping with what we needed to do by
					 way of security measures at our borders and with respect to people coming into
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not allow people who are terrorists, who
					 harbour terrorists or who want to wreak havoc on Canadian soil to get in.
					 However, what we will do is be fair and evenhanded to genuine people of refugee
					 status who want to come to Canada. We will support them in the way that Canada
					 has always supported them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day we will keep building a country
					 of significance where values are built on common sharing, caring, compassion
					 and tolerance. That is our Canada, the Canada that seeks to enhance the very
					 fundamental core of those Canadian values that are so dear to people across
					 this great country of ours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we will ensure that we are safe and
					 secure not only in our communities and neighbourhoods but in the country as a
					 whole. That is what Canadians and parliamentarians want. We as a government
					 will ensure that while on the one hand we will be fair and evenhanded and
					 ensure that the charter is respected as it should be, on the other hand we will
					 also bring forward the security measures required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-11 does that. It does it in a way that is in
					 keeping with those great Canadian values. I am very proud that the government
					 brought that legislation forward with the foresight that was
					 required.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that a few years ago 2,200 blank
					 visa forms were stolen and 788 computer files were altered in our immigration
					 computer system called CAIPS in our Hong Kong foreign mission. Foreign missions

					 do not know. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the parliamentary secretary tell the House what
					 his government has done to curtail corruption in our foreign missions which are
					 our first line of defence? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been shown that some locally hired employees in
					 those missions are engaged in corruption and fraud. Some time ago I lodged a
					 complaint with the ministry and the RCMP. A special squad of the RCMP went to

					 and three in Islamabad based on information I had provided. However I have
					 never heard anything from the government side of the House on what the

	Mr. Speaker, what I can say in response to the member
					 opposite is that the government will take whatever measures are necessary to
					 correct situations as they exist. When there are problems abroad or within
					 Canada we move very quickly to ensure that the proper authorities are notified
					 and that the corrective measures are taken.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we perfect all the time? No, we are not. We are
					 like any other country in this regard. If the Americans had been perfect in
					 their screening of terrorists the 19 people who landed in Florida and did the
					 kinds of things that they ultimately did would have been caught very quickly.
					 That did not happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason it did not happen is that up to this point
					 we have been taking the kind of security measures that have been required based
					 on world effort. What we need to do now is make sure that we have more security
					 based on the kinds of things that have happened. The Americans have learned
					 that lesson the hard way. We in Canada are doing the kinds of things that are
					 required, not only with immigration and with customs but also with CSIS and the
					 RCMP. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has changed and Canada's priorities have also
					 shifted as a result. I do not understand why the opposition is always pointing
					 out the negative, always chipping away at the people who do great work on
					 behalf of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the opposition not help us and work with us on
					 this instead of fearmongering all the time and always putting up the most
					 outrageous and negative cases? Why does it not say that it will help us, that
					 it will work with us, and that it will stand up for Canada?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone recognizes that because it is generating real
					 anxiety in all spheres of society, the current international situation is ripe
					 for extreme reactions. These are never productive and rarely do anxiety, anger
					 and panic help us think straight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As parliaments reflect on effective and realistic ways
					 to fight terrorism, it is important not to lose sight of the values that
					 underpin our democratic society. I will therefore be studying the opposition
					 motion with the values of justice, freedom and compassion in mind, taking into
					 consideration the international conventions that Canada has ratified, including
					 the UN convention relating to the status of refugees, the torture convention
					 and the convention on the rights of the child.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like first off, if I may, to comment on the
					 preamble to the motion. It refers to the continental perimeter initiative. The
					 Bloc Quebecois has expressed its opinion of this perimeter. We believe such a
					 perimeter should exist only in conjunction with the three primary signatories
					 to NAFTA, namely, Mexico, the United States and Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that the aim of this motion is primarily
					 Canadian and American security and the assurance of continued trade relations.
					 However, I saw no reference in the motion to this last objective. We must
					 therefore face the fact that the motion is off the mark. While the events of
					 September 11 raised the issue of security, can we allow the security measures
					 to apply just to refugees, as if they were the guilty parties?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to paragraph (a). It reads, and I
					 quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>provide both Immigration officers and Customs officers enhanced
						  training—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibilities of these officials are important
					 and we support their being given training that will enable them to do their day
					 to day work properly, upholding the law and treating individuals with respect.
					 This is a worthy objective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2000, the Auditor General of Canada made the
					 following comments “Training is a key element in providing customs staff with
					 the knowledge and skills to speed the entry of travellers and manage risk”.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked customs to “ensure that the training needs of
					 all employees are assessed on a regular basis, training plans are developed
					 annually and appropriate training is provided in a timely manner”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered it important as well that “training for
					 term and student employees take into account their skills, experience and the
					 job requirements”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he recommended that “training records be complete
					 and be used to assess whether employees have received the training they
					 need”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, we will support the first part of paragraph
					 (a).</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have some concerns about the second part of
					 the motion which reads, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(a) provide both Immigration officers and Customs
						  officers...full peace officer status to allow them to detain and arrest
						  suspected criminals or terrorists at the border;</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the current status of these two groups of
					 public servants? Subsection 110(1) of the Immigration Act reads as
					 follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>110.(1) An immigration officer has

						  person. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, how do we define full peace officer
					 status?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Customs Act, it provides the following in
					 subsection 98(1):</p>


	<p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs Act also provides that the customs officer
					 has the right to seize goods. Moreover, some agents are designated as having
					 peace officer status for the enforcement of certain provisions of the criminal
					 code, such as those on arrest without warrant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2 of the criminal code defines a peace officer
					 as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, immigration agents are deemed to be
					 peace officers when they enforce the provisions of the Immigration Act, while
					 customs officers are also deemed to be peace officers and they have all the
					 necessary powers to enforce those of the act for which they are
					 responsible.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we have just finished debating a bill to amend
					 the Customs Act, Bill S-23, which was debated at report stage in the House of
					 Commons last Friday, it is hard to see why the Canadian Alliance did not take
					 the opportunity then to present the amendments to the bill that it thought were
					 necessary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, both immigration and customs officers
					 have the necessary powers to enforce the provisions of the legislation,
					 particularly since the Immigration Act also provides that, in certain specific
					 circumstances, an immigration officer may detain an individual.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty probably lies in the word “full” peace
					 officer status. Perhaps this will become clear later in the debate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only am I uncertain what “full” peace officer
					 status means, but I am hardly reassured when I read that they should be allowed
					 “to detain and arrest suspected criminals or terrorists at the
					 border”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a suspicion? <i>Le Petit Robert</i> defines it
					 as conjecture by which blameful intentions are assigned to someone. It seems to
					 me that the present situation may cause us to be more suspicious and that the
					 very broad wording in the motion is hard to square with the 1986 Landry
					 decision, which defined the notion of “reasonable grounds”. Furthermore, the
					 1999 edition of the criminal code provides, and I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In order to arrest a person without a
						  warrant, a police officer must have reasonable and probable grounds to believe
						  that the person has committed an indictable offence. This subjective belief on
						  the part of the police officer must also be justifiable from an objective point
						  of view.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see how far apart the criminal code, the
					 existing legislation and the Alliance motion are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (b) of the Alliance motion proposes that
					 customs officers be moved into a law enforcement agency. This in itself is not
					 without interest, although it raises a number of questions concerning
					 conditions of work, the administration of customs duties, and
					 budgets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it is probably interesting to quote what
					 the national president of the Customs and Excise Union said in his recent
					 appearance before the Standing Committee on Finance regarding Bill
					 S-23:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I believe this was proposed under the
						  Conservative government, some six or seven years ago [--]</small></td>

<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>—perhaps longer—I forget now. At that time the Customs Excise
						  Union fully supported that concept for customs officers. We do see customs
						  officers as being a group of individuals that is becoming more and more
						  oriented towards enforcement. In fact, the approval of Bill C-18 in 1998 has
						  made that even clearer—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Denis Desautels, who was auditor general at the
					 time, he stated that the role of customs offices “has evolved ...to one of
					 facilitating the entry of travellers and goods, while protecting Canadian
					 society”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to what strike me as the two most worrisome
					 paragraphs, (c) and (d). Their objectives seem very clear to me. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stipulates that any refugee claimant without
					 proper documentation is potentially dangerous. The second is equally
					 disconcerting, because it radically limits the reception of refugees, even if
					 this represents a break with the Canadian tradition of compassion and
					 openness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph (c) reads as follows: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(c) detain all spontaneous refugee claimants appearing
						  without proper documentation until their identities are confirmed and they have
						  cleared proper health and security checks.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are opposed to automatic detention of refugee
					 claimants without papers. </p>


	<A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1125)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is a simple one. What reasonable person can
					 believe that a refugee without documents represents such a risk to Canada's
					 security that he or she must be imprisoned? I do not think so. Nor am I the
					 only one, because it would make no sense for anyone who had any ill intentions
					 toward Canada or any other state not to have official identity documents, or at
					 least ones that looked authentic. Why not three or four different passports? We
					 have already seen that. Why would anyone run the risk of an investigation? If I
					 wanted to do some evil deed, I would come across as innocent as possible. That
					 is elementary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not think that this measure will in any way
					 improve Canada's security coefficient. What it will succeed in doing is to
					 treat the innocent unfairly, and we will thus be failing our duties under the
					 charter of rights and freedoms, which is a source of Canadian pride.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that our present procedure meets Canada's needs
					 and requires no changes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now an immigration officer uses the following
					 procedure. He asks for the claimant's identification and the claimant states
					 his true identity. The immigration officer then questions the claimant to
					 determine whether he can provide identity papers. The claimant has to complete
					 a form in which he provides information as to his identity. Finally, the
					 immigration officer can detain the individual if he is unable to establish his
					 identity to the officer's satisfaction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the immigration officer find that the claimant
					 is not properly answering the questions put to him, appears confused or refuses
					 to answer certain questions, the officer may detain him for a period of seven
					 days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly the Canadian Council for Refugees notes
					 that it is exceedingly rare for a person seeking asylum to be detained for not
					 having identity papers or for having forged ones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With paragraph (c) of the motion, we move to an extreme
					 that is unacceptable. We oppose the systematic detention of persons claiming
					 refugee status, since the practice is contrary to the charter of rights and
					 freedoms, which applies to every citizen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on quickly to the last point, the request
					 to establish a list of third countries. Once this list is drawn up, Canada will
					 no long accept refugee claimants who have come through a third
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty per cent of those claiming refugee status arrive
					 in Canada from the United States. Forty per cent is a lot. What I understand
					 from this is that we do not want any more refugees. I oppose this, especially
					 since applications for refugee status in the States are given much more
					 restrictive treatment than they are here in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we consciously, as a parliament, going to destroy
					 what has been a port of peace and life for many who have suffered through wars
					 and undemocratic regimes? We need only think of the millions of Afghans who are
					 trying desperately to leave their country. Can we say “No, we will allow only
					 those who arrive via Vancouver or Montreal or St. John's,
					 Newfoundland”?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also oppose this fourth paragraph strongly. I call
					 on all parliamentarians who recognize the importance of compassion, justice and
					 respect for the fundamental values of our society to oppose the Alliance
					 motion.</p>

					 Centre, NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the
					 debate and to put a viewpoint on the record on behalf of the New Democratic
					 Party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure it will come as no surprise to the authors of
					 the motion before us today, the members of the Alliance Party, that New
					 Democrats will oppose the motion. I am sure that causes no revelations for the
					 members beside me. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However they may be somewhat surprised when I say that
					 I and my party welcome the debate. It gives us an opportunity to clear the air,
					 to deal with some very contentious issues in Canada today and to move toward a
					 more responsible, effective solution to the very difficult circumstances we are
					 facing today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us begin by agreeing on one thing: We all deplore,
					 with every breath we can muster, the heinous events of September 11. There is
					 no question about that. I want members to keep that in mind as we discuss
					 options, alternatives and solutions for dealing with this very difficult
					 situation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one in the House who is not prepared to
					 stand and condemn with every ounce of energy the heinous acts of the terrorists
					 who struck in the United States on September 11. Every one of us here are
					 grappling with solutions to prevent the spread of terrorism and to bring those
					 terrorists to justice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before us today suggests that Canada must
					 look at its own immigration and refugee policies as part of that solution. That
					 is not a point of contention for us. We are all prepared to look at Canada's
					 policies on every front, whether we are talking about immigration policy,
					 airline security, cross-border crossings or our own ability to respond to
					 bioterrorism. On each and every aspect of terrorism we have an obligation and a
					 responsibility to assess the situation, to determine if Canada's policies are
					 effective in that regard and to make suggestions based on any flaws or
					 weaknesses in those areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done that on numerous occasions. We have been
					 vigilant since September 17 about proposing solutions and making
					 suggestions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, we proposed a motion to deal with the
					 uprising of incidents of racism and intolerance in our society as a result of
					 the terrorist acts. We made suggestions in the House repeatedly over enhanced
					 resources and supports for being prepared in the event of a bioterrorist act.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I am prepared, on behalf of my colleagues, to
					 make some suggestions with respect to immigration and refugee policy. I want to
					 be clear that the most important item for us to deal with today is to avoid
					 feeding any mythology around Canadian immigration and refugee policy. Our
					 responsibility today is not to feed this notion that Canada is a safe haven for
					 terrorists. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting for a minute any malicious intent
					 on the part of the Alliance but I certainly have serious grievances with its
					 recommendations. I am here to suggest that since September 11 there have been a
					 number of commentaries, opinions and statements made that do feed the notion
					 that Canada somehow is a safe haven for terrorists. The implication touches us
					 even more given the feelings people have that terrorists are refugees and
					 refugees are terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot allow that kind of talk to go on. We must
					 address the fears and concerns of Canadians without feeding hysteria. We must
					 be responsible in our response to the events of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only have to turn to some of the newspaper articles,
					 however few and far between they have been with respect to this issue, to make
					 the case and help ensure that the House puts all this in
					 perspective.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may not agree with everything the author of the
					 article wrote but I can say he identifies a very serious issue and that is, if
					 we make generalizations based on the events of September 11 and make wide,
					 sweeping generalizations about our policies, we will have done no great service
					 to combat terrorism. We will have done what so many have cautioned against,
					 which is we will have stooped to the level of the terrorists themselves and
					 sacrificed our fundamental principles of peace, security and
					 freedom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Foreign Affairs himself made exactly
					 that kind of statement. He said on one occasion recently that if a battle
					 against terrorism must be waged, we must be sure we do not undermine our
					 principles of an open society founded on democracy. If we do that we will have
					 given terrorists, and I am paraphrasing, a victory. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one commentary that was in the paper. I also
					 want to read from an article by Hugh Winsor in the <i> Globe and Mail</i> on
					 October 15. I do not always agree with this commentator but he made a very
					 important observation:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use that kind of wisdom to bring caution to the
					 debate and urge that we do not destroy the fundamentals and values that hold
					 the country together, the glue of Canadian unity, in the interests of looking
					 for easy solutions and quick targets. That is what the motion does
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the generalization that Canada is a safe
					 haven for terrorists, I remind members what the RCMP commissioner told the
					 immigration committee just last Thursday. In response to a question I raised
					 about these broad, sweeping generalizations, he said that even the word haven
					 is a terrible word to use because it implies that we somehow support or nurture
					 terrorists to stay in the country. That certainly is not the case. He went on
					 to talk about how Canada is no different from other countries that are dealing
					 with the same kind of threat and is no different in terms of precautions we
					 take on the security front.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important for the House to remember the
					 makeup of the country and the traditions we hold so near and dear. We went
					 through this in great detail during the debate on Bill C-11. The debate on that
					 bill was very heated. We were struggling to find the balance between respecting
					 our open door policy and humanitarian traditions with the need to ensure that
					 proper security measures were taken to prevent people who had malicious intents
					 and agendas to get into Canada. We struggled very hard to balance those
					 interests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my vantage point I am not completely happy with
					 Bill C-11. I do not think we achieved that balance, but I can say that the
					 debate was thoughtful and should enlighten us today in our discussions. One of
					 the conclusions we on all sides of the House made during that debate was that
					 Canada's legacy and history is about diversity.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said time and time again that it is not just about
					 the number of people who have come here from so many places, it is about how we
					 deal with one another in the context of being a mosaic. Our tradition and our
					 values have shown the way. Canada is a model for the world in terms of respect
					 for differences, for not imposing one view or one way of thinking or one way of
					 life on our immigrants and the people who make up this country. Our way is one
					 of easy going acceptance, generosity, tolerance and respect for differences. We
					 do not impose some uniform identity on the immigrants who come to
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those sentiments are as important today as they were
					 when we were debating Bill C-11 last spring. We have new circumstances to deal
					 with. We have to make adjustments and review policies, but we do not sacrifice
					 our fundamental understanding of this country and how we have come to grow
					 together as a multicultural nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11 in many ways we have started to show
					 suspicion about one another. We have started to question on the basis of racial
					 makeup. We have started to look behind us and see trouble in the shadows. We
					 have started to create a climate of fear when we should be doing the opposite.
					 I urge members to put this all in perspective and to come up with solutions
					 that actually work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion deals so much with the issue of refugees.
					 One of the themes of the Alliance Party these days seems to be to point fingers
					 at Canada's policies on refugees and to suggest that we have bad policies and
					 bad programs and that we need to put a moratorium on refugees coming into
					 Canada. That is what part of the motion actually does when it talks about
					 detaining all refugees who come into Canada. In effect it is quite a major
					 difference from the practices and traditions we have today and is not
					 necessarily one that would ensure greater security for Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context I want to put on the record some of the
					 concerns of the organizations that work on a day to day basis with refugees.
					 These organizations care deeply about the flight of the millions of refugees
					 around the world. They know that Canada has a responsibility, an obligation and
					 an interest in ensuring that we offer a safe haven for people fleeing
					 persecution on the basis of political, religious or economic
					 reasons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 14 the Canadian Council for Refugees
					 issued a statement. This is part of it:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In the wake of the horrific terrorist
						  attacks this week in the United States, the Canadian Council for Refugees
						  offers its condolences to the victims and their families. As an organization
						  committed to the protection of human rights, the Canadian Council for Refugees
						  condemns these attacks on civilian lives and urges Canadians, as well as
						  immigrant and refugee communities, to speak out against violence and
						  intolerance in our society.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a very important statement for all of us to
					 hear and understand. I hope members in the Alliance Party also heard and
					 understood the meaning of that statement. All Canadians from whatever walk of
					 life condemn the terrorist attacks and now look for solutions that work to make
					 sure that we rid this globe of terrorism so we can live in peace, freedom and
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before us today denies the responsibility we
					 have in terms of refugees. It denies some of the experiences that organizations
					 such as churches, non-profit organizations and volunteer groups have with
					 respect to creating a home for refugees and newcomers and integrating them into
					 our society. It denies the sentiment expressed by the people who run Romero
					 House in Toronto when they said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>When Canadians meet refugees and hear
						  their stories, they are usually impressed by their courage, resourcefulness and
						  enduring capacity for joy. Refugees are brave people who have escaped to Canada
						  from traumatic and often horrific situations in their homelands. They have
						  experienced, or been in danger of, torture, arbitrary detention and death.
						  Although many of them have escaped with little more than the clothes on their
						  backs, they do not come empty handed. They bring to our country the gifts of
						  courage, hope and strength. </small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that in the debate on this very
					 important issue.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have concerns with all four aspects of the motion
					 before us today, beginning with the preamble and the suggestion that we need to
					 establish a North American fortress, that we need to have perimeter security.
					 The motion is premised on this notion. All of us need to question the validity
					 of this so-called continental perimeter initiative. We should question it as a
					 concept and assess it from the point of view of loss to Canada of our
					 sovereignty, loss of our ability to make decisions pertaining to our own
					 foreign affairs policy and our economic policy and hence every aspect of our
					 day to day lives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very concerned with the parts of the motion that
					 deal specifically with detention of refugees. I have already touched on that.
					 The Alliance Party is not taking into account the fact that the American policy
					 of detention has not necessarily been successful. It has not necessarily
					 achieved the kind of results which I think the members of the Alliance are
					 hoping to achieve with this motion. It has not been helpful and it has been
					 hurtful in many other ways. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance members have not taken into account that
					 many refugees come to Canada without proper documentation precisely because of
					 the kind of country and government they are fleeing. In particular, people from
					 Somalia and Afghanistan do not have documents because the dictatorial,
					 repressive regimes they are fleeing from would not allow for those documents to
					 be processed and to try to obtain those documents would be even more harmful in
					 terms of their future well-being. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very concerned about the suggestion that we need
					 to change the role and responsibilities of immigration officers and customs
					 officers in order to make the country more secure and deal with cross-border
					 issues. As has been noted already in the debate, those two provisions miss the
					 critical issue at hand here. There is an issue that has to be addressed and I
					 look to members on the government benches to ensure that this is heeded.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is one of resources. During the hearings on
					 Bill C-11 and now during the Senate hearings on Bill C-11, during this debate,
					 and since the events of September 11 time and time again we have heard about
					 the lack of resources in terms of immigration officials and customs agents.
					 Going back to the serious cuts of 1993, I think the Alliance probably supported
					 those kinds of cuts back then in the interests of smaller government. The
					 number of immigration officers was slashed from 7,000 to 4,000. Similarly the
					 customs and excise union has reported how at least 1,200 new customs officers
					 are needed to do the job. Let us assess the situation for what it really is and
					 deal with the root cause of the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important to acknowledge difficulties with
					 the fourth part of the motion which calls for a list of safe third countries,
					 including the United States and member states of the European Union, from which
					 Canada will no longer accept refugee claimants. For the record, it has to be
					 said that that is a very serious recommendation that would have all kinds of
					 ramifications for Canada's role in the United Nations and for ensuring that we
					 live up to the convention on refugees. I hope to have a chance to deal with
					 this during questions and comments. It is a very negative suggestion and would
					 not have any basis in terms of being a good solution. It would take us in the
					 opposite direction of our responsibilities with respect to the international
					 convention on refugees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as we pursue the debate and look at solutions,
					 let us look at some other options. Let us look at the immigrant investor
					 program where people can actually buy their way into the country and not face
					 the same kind of scrutiny as people seeking to be united with their families or
					 people coming to work in Canada. That is a serious shortcoming. There are many
					 solutions and issues that need to be addressed and we can do that here today. I
					 do not think the answer is found in the Alliance motion. I look forward to
					 ongoing discussion.</p>

					 why does she then go on to undermine her own sentiments with
					 qualifiers?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She says that she is prepared to look at what we are
					 pointing out but then says that she will not even support the modest
					 suggestions in our motion today. She says that we have to worry about
					 mythology. The FBI says that it evaluates us as a safe haven.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her denials and the controls that she puts on us for
					 political correctness do not change the reality of who is here in our country
					 already. The essence of what she is saying is that others are weak so it is
					 okay for us to be weak. She is so concerned about admissions, but the central
					 issue is that change begins with the recognition that a problem exists, admit
					 it and then we can appropriately act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member or her party have one concrete measure
					 to suggest that will make us safer in this country or is the member basically
					 saying that everything is okay, just watch out for any hint of being an
					 alarmist and then just hang on and hope for the best? What is her party's
					 solution to the direct threat to our society at home while we have soldiers
					 abroad right now in an effort to defend her capacity to stand in the House and

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. I tried to
					 address some of that in my speech and I am glad of the opportunity to
					 elaborate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are opposed to the specific recommendations put
					 forward by the Alliance today as solutions that do not get to the root of the
					 problem and can do more harm than good. They may be easy fixes but not
					 necessarily effective. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made some suggestions for things that can be
					 done and I will elaborate on those. I think we absolutely do need to ensure
					 that resources and staffing levels are adequate to enforce the existing
					 legislation. We need to ensure prompt action on any security related orders. I
					 think that issue has been identified. The need for additional resources in
					 Canada, at the borders and overseas, has to be addressed by the government. The
					 resources that were cut out of the system because of the preoccupation with the
					 deficit and balanced budgets back in 1993, an agenda supported and fueled by
					 members of the Alliance, have caused some of the problems we are facing today.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we need to review the whole immigrant investor
					 program which has been a controversial element of Canada's immigration program
					 since 1986 when it was implemented as a way of providing risk capital. This
					 program has been criticized. I do not know why we are not talking about it
					 these days. That program has been criticized for having little control over
					 questionable financial arrangements, money laundering, the involvement of
					 organized crime and funds from illegitimate business activities. We need to
					 look at those kinds of programs to see if some tightening up of such programs
					 can ensure better security in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that less than half of 1% of people
					 coming into this country are refugees, let us be realistic in terms of what we
					 are dealing with and why people are coming here and not throw the baby out with
					 the bath water. We know that 99.9% of people coming into this country either as
					 refugees, to be reunited with families or as independent entrepreneurs, are
					 good citizens. We do get some bad apples but do we destroy our system? Do we
					 throw out our values in order to deal with those bad apples? Or, do we get to
					 the root of the problem and deal with it in terms of the necessary resources,
					 the co-ordination of security arrangements and programs that allow for people
					 to buy their way into this country as opposed to getting here on the basis of
					 their talents, their contributions, their need to be reunited with families or
					 their need to seek refuge from unsafe environments?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am halfway between the questioner and
					 the speaker here today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that Canada is a safe haven any more
					 than is the United States. However we do have some serious problems. I just
					 wonder if the member could address what was raised by the auditor general's
					 report. The report simply states that of approximately 31,200 claimants who
					 were denied refugee status between 1993 and 1997 or were not accepted to
					 Canada, only 22% have confirmed their departure from Canada. That would
					 indicate that 78% of those refugee claimants who were denied access to Canada
					 have somehow found their way into Canadian society and are now hidden away
					 disappearing in our society. That means 78% are successful. If someone comes to
					 Canada as an unacceptable refugee, they still have a 78% chance of staying in
					 Canada even though it is illegal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member could address that concern. Does
					 she agree that there should be some increased effort placed on that
					 problem?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in my speech and in an
					 answer to a subsequent question, there is an issue here that needs to be
					 addressed, not by moving toward a system of detection, detainment and
					 deportation but to a system of openness and humanitarian principles. If people
					 are not legitimate refugees we need the resources and procedures in place to
					 ensure those people are not allowed to stay in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do have a problem and it is a resource problem.
					 However I want to put that problem in perspective and clarify what I was trying
					 to say earlier. Refugees account for about one-tenth of 1% of immigration and
					 tourist traffic, yet this seems to be the focal point for all suggestions and
					 recommendations and the centerpiece of any recommendations coming from the
					 Alliance or any action coming from the Liberal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must look at where we can actually make a
					 difference. I do not believe that by denying our responsibilities and our
					 traditions for being a welcoming nation, to encourage immigration that is so
					 desperately needed in this country, we are doing any great service. I want to
					 point out that if it were not for refugees and immigrants coming to a province
					 like Manitoba, our population growth would be at zero percent or in the
					 negative.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are grateful for the talents and the contributions
					 that refugees and immigrants make to that province and to the country. We know
					 we must do more in that regard but we can do it without causing fear and
					 hysteria by addressing some of the root causes of those who get into this
					 country with malicious intentions and who may be terrorists in
					 disguise.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to clarify something the member
					 brought up earlier about the Canadian Alliance attitude to refugees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been very well established in our policy
					 position for many years that we support the idea of Canada bringing its
					 refugees from the established refugee camps which are run by the United Nations
					 around the world. There are literally millions of people there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the hon. member knows that there are
					 millions of pre-screened refugee claimants in United Nations' camps waiting for
					 a safe haven. Why then would we just accept queue jumpers who arrive here with
					 no documents? If we are going to be tolerant and open our arms to genuine
					 refugees, we should be taking genuine refugees and rejecting those who want to
					 jump the queue and just get here by choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, she mentioned refugees from Somalia and
					 Afghanistan. Does she know they had to change their planes in either Amsterdam,
					 Heathrow or Frankfurt? Surely that makes them choose Canada. They are not
					 looking for a refugee haven. They are looking to come to Canada as
					 immigrants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, does the member know that up to 50% of all the
					 arrests on any night in downtown Vancouver are refugee claimants?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I cannot accept what the member is saying
					 about our system as a whole. It would be absolutely unfair and unfounded to
					 suggest that refugees coming into this country are queue jumpers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a process in place. It is not always perfect
					 but to suggest that people fleeing from Somalia and Afghanistan are really not
					 looking for protection as much as they are looking to settle in Canada and have
					 chosen Canada, does not address the reality of the situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People often see Canada as the end of the line in terms
					 of protection and in being able to settle somewhere. Nothing in the motion
					 addresses that issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totally agree with the member when he talks about the
					 world's refugee problem. We know there are about 39 million people looking for
					 refugee protection somewhere. Canada plays only a small role in creating a home
					 for those refugees. We should do more and we cannot do it by generalizing and
					 implying motives that are not true and not based on fact.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to indicate that I will be
					 dividing my time with the member for Dauphin--Swan River.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to speak on the motion today. We have
					 mixed feelings on it one way or another. I would like to go through those mixed
					 feelings in different directions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion makes an assumption that is not accurate.
					 The motion says “That, as part of a continental perimeter initiative...”. The
					 government has not accepted that concept and has not agreed to a continental
					 perimeter initiative. By making these proposals as part of a continental
					 perimeter initiative, which has not happened, has not been agreed to and in
					 fact has been discouraged by the government, it makes the whole debate
					 pointless.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go through the issues and the proposal as raised
					 by the official opposition and discuss the issues one at a time. I think a
					 continental perimeter is inevitable. Because of our close association with the
					 United States and Mexico, it is only a matter of time before a perimeter is
					 established. Certainly officials in the United States, the ambassador, several
					 senators, the president and the vice-president, have said that they will have a
					 security system for the United States and that their preferred system is a
					 perimeter system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president of Mexico has stated very clearly that if
					 there is a perimeter system for the United States that Mexico wants to be in on
					 it. If Mexico and the United States are in on a perimeter security system, then
					 Canada will have no choice. It is the wise choice in any case. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many provincial premiers have come out strongly in
					 favour of a perimeter security system for North America as have several state
					 governors and state governments. It is almost not plausible that there would be
					 a North American perimeter system that included the United States and Mexico
					 but not Canada. Eighty percent to eighty-five percent of our trade is with the
					 United States. For Canada to be locked out of that secure border would be
					 impractical for our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's approach seems to be resisting the
					 philosophy of a security perimeter but that is out of step with reality, with
					 our trading practices, with our relationship with the other two countries in
					 North America and it is certainly out of step with Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs at committee
					 whether he was in favour of the perimeter security and would he support it. His
					 reaction was that when he hears the words perimeter security he feels it is a
					 front for some other terminology or some other concept that he was not clear
					 on. He was uncomfortable with the concept of perimeter security. The minister
					 did not elaborate on why he was not comfortable or on the details. He only
					 indicated that he was uncomfortable, which I would think would be an indication
					 that the government at this moment in time is not in favour of a perimeter
					 security system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leader of the official opposition said, it is
					 only a matter of time that the government will probably change its mind and
					 come around to that. I agree that will happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, where 80% to 85% of our foreign trade is
					 with the United States, it is absolutely critical that we protect that trading
					 relationship. It is naive not to expect the United States to impose some
					 restrictions on trade if we are not in its circle of perimeter security. Since
					 September 11 much of our trade has been brought to a crawl. The industries in
					 Canada that need just in time delivery of parts, services and goods have been
					 penalized and hurt. They have had to layoff people and their businesses have
					 been damaged because of the substantial delays. This is only a precursor to
					 what would happen if the United States established a perimeter security system
					 around its country and we were not on the inside of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has focused on the Canadian weakness.
					 I do not think that is accurate. It has focused on our weakness as a safe haven
					 for terrorists. I do not accept that position. We all know that most of the
					 terrorists on September 11 were actually residents of the United States,
					 trained in the United States or lived in the United States. It appears that its
					 systems are no more secure than our systems. However that does not change the
					 fact that we both have to tighten up our security systems, our immigration
					 regulations and our enforcement.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite amazing that the auditor general indicated
					 in a report in 1997 that of 31,000 claimants that were denied refugee status
					 between 1993 and 1997 and not accepted into Canada, only 22% were confirmed as
					 having left. This indicates that 78% of these illegal and denied immigrants to
					 Canada are still here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the auditor general, if people in
					 Afghanistan or any other country look at the possibility of coming to Canada,
					 once they are in, even if they are denied immigrant status and are asked to
					 leave, chances are only one in four they will ever leave. That is kind of a
					 scary concept. It is important that we address it in the strongest possible
					 fashion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition coalition supports the concept of the
					 perimeter security proposal for many reasons. It just makes sense from a safety
					 point of view to ensure the safety of our citizens, our economy and our
					 culture. This is a broad motion which very extensively affects many aspects of
					 our society and our regulations. We do not agree with many aspects of it,
					 although we do agree with the concept of the perimeter security
					 system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not agree that customs officers should become
					 armed police officers. We do not believe that they should be armed. We do not
					 think it is necessary. We do not think it is appropriate that customs officers
					 should be police officers in the same way as we do not think police officers
					 should be customs officers. We would oppose that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would oppose the proposal to remove customs officers
					 from the collection of taxes and duties. Who would provide this service? If
					 customs officers do not collect customs duties, who will? Why would we do this?
					 How would this be set up? Would every border crossing have a customs officer,
					 an immigration officer and a police officer as well? It is very confusing and
					 it seems extremely cumbersome for us in the opposition coalition that every
					 border entry would have this triple series of officials.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do not believe that customs officers should be
					 law enforcement officers. It does not make sense. We do not see any reason for
					 it. We think they should have the power to retain people at the border,
					 question them, certify their documentation and take the appropriate steps at
					 that time, but we do not agree with making them police officers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I come back to the auditor general's report which
					 says that Canada's lax approach to immigrants costs the federal government and
					 the provinces hundreds of millions of dollars a year in enforcement, in trying
					 to find some of the immigrants that came to Canada, were denied access and then
					 disappeared into the woodwork and into our society. This is a very expensive
					 situation which can be rectified if it is dealt with at the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If immigrants do not have the proper documentation when
					 they come to Canada, if they do not have the proper qualifications to come to
					 Canada, they should be stopped there rather than automatically allowed into
					 society and impossible to find later. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with the concept of the list of safe
					 countries. That has been debated for years and there has been no agreement on
					 how to implement it. All countries have to agree, and there is no agreement on
					 it. Even though we agree with the concept we do not think it can be done.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with the concept of the perimeter security
					 system and that Canada is very much a part of it. Although Canada was not the
					 target on September 11 we were severely impacted. Dozens of Canadians lost
					 their lives in that terrible act of terrorism. Transportation in Canada
					 literally came to a standstill. Business and investment were curtailed. They
					 are still curtailed and are suffering right now because of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security costs must be enormous. There have been
					 additional security costs on the Hill. We can all see the extra police, the
					 extra inspections and everything that is going on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is very much a part of this situation and must
					 be very much a part of the reaction to it. We must be part of the establishment
					 of a security system to protect our people. We must be in on the ground floor.
					 We must be in early. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear the government state right now
					 that we will be a part of the perimeter security system as proposed by the
					 United States, but we want to be a part of the planning. We want to be in on
					 the ground floor. We want to protect our sovereignty. We want to protect our
					 people. We want to make sure that Canadians are as safe as possible and that
					 our industry is protected.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise as coalition
					 immigration critic to take part in the debate on the supply day motion put
					 forth by the Canadian Alliance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11 the world certainly has changed and
					 national security is on everyone's mind. We are all aware of the threats to our
					 freedom by terrorist organizations of the world. At the same time Canada must
					 be cognizant that Canada is a land of immigrants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at our history, Canada was built by
					 immigrants. At this time we must not be pointing figures at legitimate refugees
					 and immigrants, including myself who immigrated to this country before the
					 events of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition's position is that Canada needs to keep
					 its door open to genuine immigrants and refugees. Our present and future
					 standard of living depends on immigration. We attract the best in the world and
					 we must continue to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the current fear of terrorism we must not
					 repeat the dark side of Canada's history. Let us take a reality check. Over 99%
					 of the annual movement of up to 40 million people between the United States and
					 Canada is by legal people. The vast majority of those who come into Canada use
					 the legal means. In fact terrorists can enter this country as visitors,
					 students, refugees or legitimate immigrants. We need to tighten up our front
					 end screening to detect those who would wish to do us harm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As coalition critic my job is to point out the holes in
					 the system. Let me take time to respond to the specifics of the supply day
					 motion. This motion is much like an omnibus bill. It covers too much. In
					 principle the coalition supports the motion, but we have concerns about the way
					 it was put together. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address some of our concerns. In the preamble
					 the continental perimeter denotes a North American border, not a Canadian one.
					 While the notion of a secure North American border is a good one, Canada cannot
					 be expected to look after American borders. Nor can Americans be expected to
					 look after Canadian borders. Agreements can and should be made on who looks
					 after what and what jurisdiction we can share and co-operate on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A continental perimeter does not by default ensure the
					 safety of Canada's borders. Improved staffing levels, better training and
					 better enforcement of existing laws will. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Criminal Code of Canada a Canada customs
					 officer has the authority to be a peace officer already by definition. In fact
					 the criminal code states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(d) an
						  officer or a person having the powers of a customs or excise officer when
						  performing any duty in the administration of the Customs Act or Excise
						  Act.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the 1992 Immigration Act, section 113
					 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Duties of Peace Officers to execute
						  orders--Every peace officer and every person in immediate charge or control of
						  an immigration station shall, when so directed by the Deputy Minister, an
						  adjudicator, a senior immigration officer or an immigration officer, receive
						  and execute any written warrant or order issued or made under this Act or the
						  regulations for the arrest, detention or removal from Canada of any
						  persons.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that immigration officers and customs officers
					 should receive better training in identifying suspicious persons. There seems
					 to be an attempt to arm immigration and customs officers with sidearms. While
					 customs officers at borders should have sidearms, immigration officers at ports
					 of entry should not. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If immigration officers simply use the enforcement
					 tools at their disposal they have every ability to detain and even refuse entry
					 to anyone who is thought to be a risk to the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will comment on part (b) of the motion. This is a
					 clear indication of seeking a sidearm for a border official. We do not disagree
					 with this. However this would in fact make customs officers at the borders
					 police officers. This would eliminate a number of positions across Canada in
					 favour police enforcement. </p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have such a situation with park wardens who
					 have effectively been replaced by RCMP because the wardens wanted
					 sidearms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with part (c) of the motion. All asylum
					 claimants should be held until their identities can be discovered and they are
					 determined not to be a risk to Canadians. Proper security and health checks
					 should be done to ensure the safety of citizens welcoming newcomers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with part (d). The safe third country concept
					 has been used in immigration legislation since 1992. While the term and
					 definition have been used to keep refugees and asylum claimants who have
					 already been recognized as convention refugees from other countries from
					 applying for refugee status here, there is no such thing as a list of safe
					 third countries from which we might accept refugees or deport refugees to await
					 identity discovery.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 a Sri Lankan national was refused refugee
					 status as the claimant was found to already have refugee status in Germany. In
					 1998 a Liberian citizen was refused conventional refugee status since the
					 person already had such status in Sierra Leone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the broader sense of the legislation that is not
					 being applied. A list of countries from which asylum seekers could come to
					 claim such status or be detained while waiting for the outcome of such an
					 application has never been compiled. It is believed that the reason for this is
					 largely due to a lack of agreement on who decides which nations are considered
					 to be safe. The safe third country concept does not guarantee the detection and
					 apprehension of potential terrorists. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general made some very enlightening
					 discoveries in his December 1997 report on the Immigration Refugee Board. Since
					 1993 over 99% of all claims were judged to be eligible by CIC officials. The
					 claimants were then given the necessary documentation for filing a claim with
					 the IRB and allowed to enter Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today there is still a 30,000 case backlog. With the
					 passing of Bill C-11 all claims in the system that are not finalized will be
					 nullified. All other claims will have to be started over again regardless of
					 the stage of review. That will only create more backlog.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was noted that over 90% of those denied refugee
					 status remain in Canada, according to the auditor general. These problems have
					 not gone away. They pose a real risk to Canada's security. The government has
					 to account for how the IRB operates, recognizing and acknowledging that the IRB
					 is a patronage vehicle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried over the last year to convince the
					 immigration minister to set up front end screening of refugee claimants. I will
					 close by making a few more comments on front end screening. I have indicated
					 that the RCMP, CSIS and CIC need more staff.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can board a domestic or international flight
					 without identification and in some cases travel documents. The fact that people
					 arrive in Canada without such documentation should be grounds for immediate
					 detention. The minister alluded to over 8,000 persons who were detained for an
					 average of 16 days in the year 2000. What she forgot to say was that she
					 personally okayed 3,989 otherwise inadmissible individuals, most hardened
					 criminals, entering and remaining in Canada for a period of time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3,989 people were obviously security risks to
					 Canada since without a permit from the minister they could not have entered
					 Canada. With no entry or exit data kept on persons coming and leaving Canada,
					 it is impossible to tell whether those who are ordered out actually
					 leave.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These basic requests arise from government employees on
					 the line and are reasonably modest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11, two changes have occurred that have
					 put increased demand on our national leadership in politics and in business.
					 First, is our declaration to respond to terrorism. Second, is the economic
					 recession. The Liberals have left us unprepared for both. The Liberals cannot
					 manage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the economic front, while there is a vital need to
					 increase spending on national security, federal revenues are starting to
					 shrink. The opportunity for the wise choice of reducing taxes and debt to
					 competitive levels, while our economy was being lifted along by a buoyant U.S.
					 economy, has passed us by. It can be said, in view of today's motion before the
					 House, that the Canadian Alliance was right and the Liberals were
					 wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is also mean-spirited and dishonest when
					 it claims that we are anti-immigrant or hard-hearted about genuine refugees,
					 for we want an orderly and safe immigration and refugee system that operates
					 with the highest possible level of integrity and reliability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government announced up to $250 million, generally
					 for security matters, some of which might help immigration screening.
					 However,100 immigration officer positions is only a start, not a solution.
					 Resources must be utilized in the areas of increased staff deployment and
					 training, enhanced security and background checks and aggressive deportation of
					 failed refugee claimants and others. The immigration system likely needs 500
					 additional employees in its system around the world to meet our national
					 security needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the citizenship and immigration minister,
					 staff in her department at the lower levels, who have to carry out the system
					 on the line, talked to me of their utter frustration and even disdain of the
					 public relations game played by the minister since the September 11 attack.
					 There is system-wide snickering from immigration officers when the minister
					 oversells the improvements from Bill C-11 or the benefits of the maple leaf
					 card. Although necessary, it is only one of the many holes that must be plugged
					 if Canada has any hope of exercising basic sovereignty of its borders and
					 protecting its people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of persons who attempt to swamp our
					 protections enter Canada illegally by using passports of countries which do not
					 require a Canadian visitor visa or they use someone else's passport who has
					 obtained a visa. The passports are photo substituted and the person freely
					 boards a plane to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capacity creates its own demand and the ability to get
					 through with low risk invites repeated testing of the system. Smugglers enjoy
					 their lucrative business without a care of being caught as they receive only an
					 insignificant punishment if ever prosecuted. The government does not have the
					 political will to make people smuggling unprofitable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the trump card played by thousands of
					 people who declare themselves refugee claimants upon landing or a few days
					 later after having disposed of their legitimate looking documents and having
					 been carefully coached by their handlers as they arrive with a request for
					 legal aid, welfare and the medical plan. Most refugee claimants are released
					 into the community without Canada having knowledge about who they really are
					 and what their backgrounds are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to detain all surprise arrivals for whom we
					 have any concern. It should be reverse onus and the burden should be on the
					 claimants to demonstrate that they are indeed refugees and not something else,
					 if they are using that particular category. The evidence for such a need is the
					 high percentage who disappear once they are released into the
					 community.</p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that most persons who arrive uninvited at
					 our borders are not true refugees. They are those who do not wish to apply
					 through the proper channels because they know they will not qualify due to a
					 past they want to cover up or they are in groups that we as a nation have said
					 we will not take, which is the policy assumption of the point-merit system of
					 immigration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may be fleeing prosecution and not persecution.
					 Some use the refugee claim as a ruse to enter Canada to cross into the U.S.A.
					 Most true refugees do not even have the means to get to Canada in that
					 way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect to the societal costs of the consequences,
					 it is likely more cost efficient and a lot safer to first detain all refugee
					 claimants. If all questionable people were routinely placed in holding centres
					 pending necessary investigations and hearings, they would receive housing,
					 meals, health monitoring and care. Their stories and the international
					 reputation would be deterrents to the pressures on the system, just like the
					 deportation of the British Columbia boat people which took the pressure off
					 that type of activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If detained, claimants could not go on to another
					 province if denied and under another identity begin a second and third refugee
					 claim, as we have seen. Criminal checks could be completed while the person is
					 in custody, if the government ever got serious about access to databases from
					 all available countries rather than just within our own lists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of one immigration officer says it for many.
					 He said recently:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

						  frustration of seeing the fraud being perpetrated on the naive taxpayers of
						  this country and which I was impotent to prevent. I have never been more
						  certain of my decision to leave this department as I have since September 11.
						  You have absolutely no idea of the extent of fraud within the Department of
						  Citizenship and Immigration. Immigration officers must be able to do their jobs
						  with confidence and without political influence or interference. A plastic card
						  will not eliminate the fraud-- I'm sure someone is already working on
						  reproducing it. I could easily write a book on this subject. I am certain that
						  99% of front line immigration officers echo my sentiments, but of course are
						  not permitted to speak their minds and tell the truth.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a nation of immigrants and has always been
					 enriched by new arrivals to our shores. A Canadian Alliance government would
					 facilitate the current levels of immigration and make improvements to the
					 security, fairness and integrity of the system. The system must meet the high
					 expectations of average Canadians and enhance the welfare of new arrivals. We
					 must ensure Canadian sovereignty on the borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate that Canada is a society built by
					 successive waves of immigration from all sectors of the globe. We need to
					 create a positive immigration policy that is merit based. Administration should
					 take into account primarily Canada' s economic needs. We must introduce greater
					 security and reliability into the system, including enforcement of sponsorship
					 obligations. The federal government must work more co-operatively with the
					 provinces on national policy and settlement costs. We must also affirm the
					 independence of immigration administration from multiculturalism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-citizens of Canada who are convicted of an
					 indictable crime or who are known to engage in serious criminal activity must
					 be deported quickly. By more careful screening of the criminal element, we can
					 protect the integrity and security of immigrants and enhance community crime
					 prevention. Canada should no longer be called a safe haven for international
					 operatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We affirm Canada's international humanitarian
					 obligation to receive its fair share of genuine refugees. Refugee status must
					 be determined expeditiously under the rule of law and beyond political
					 interference. To ensure fairness, we should deport failed refugee claimants and
					 illegal entrants quickly, and prosecute those who organize and profit from
					 abuse of the system. To accomplish those reasonable administrative goals, we
					 must reallocate resources to reduce the thousands within Canada who are without
					 legal status or who are on the deportation list.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need to review the extra ministerial permit
					 category by seeking to provide transparency and public accountability within
					 the context of the Privacy Act to eliminate government vote buying, patronage
					 and cronyism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accomplish anything less is to fail our nation and
					 breaks faith with our young people, for their hope in a bright and prosperous
					 future.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the House to
					 participate in this very important debate. The motion put forward by my party
					 is of critical importance to our country, our economy and our physical
					 safety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate over the need for a continental security
					 perimeter has been taking place from the grain elevators to the boardrooms, but
					 sadly, it has not been taking place in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud that again today it is the opposition that
					 is addressing another issue of utmost concern to Canadians. We have heard a lot
					 about a continental security perimeter, but it has yet to be clearly
					 defined.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my remarks today, I would like to take this
					 opportunity to define our concept of a continental perimeter, address the role
					 Canada customs plays in it and conclude with my personal perspective on a
					 Canada we are living in post-September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government opposite does not like to define things.
					 It likes to spin and manipulate the policies of others without ever committing
					 itself. Look at the 1988 debate over free trade. The Prime Minister, along with
					 his comrade Maude Barlow, travelled the country, striking fear in Canadians
					 that we would lose our sovereignty over free trade. It has been over 12 years
					 now and we are not the 51st state of the United States. In fact, we are
					 stronger than ever. So let us put to rest right now the hyperbole over national
					 sovereignty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free trade agreement and NAFTA involved harmonizing
					 Canada's tariff and duty regulations with its North American neighbours. Our
					 nation has prospered as a result of our proximity to trade with the U.S.
					 Eighty-seven per cent of our trade crosses into the U.S. Untold jobs and
					 livelihoods are contingent upon strong, uninhibited trade with the U.S. and
					 Mexico.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next logical phase in NAFTA is to protect the
					 trading relationship by harmonizing our security regimes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A continental security perimeter is a fancy name for
					 knowing who is in our country. To keep the flow of goods, people and capital
					 across our internal borders, we must be more vigilant at screening and tracking
					 those entering North America. A perimeter does not surrender any of Canada's
					 independence to the United States nor does it remove our decision making
					 ability. We can have a made in Canada solution to the continental security
					 perimeter, it just takes initiative and vision. Hopefully the government
					 opposite will someday demonstrate these virtues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are at a crossroads of what has been and what
					 will become. The course of action taken by us in this place will have a
					 tremendous impact on future generations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the U.S. announced that it may require the
					 registration of all those entering and exiting its borders. This will have a
					 disastrous effect on our trade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few weeks, the Liberals have finally
					 responded to terrorism. However, the response thus far has been inadequate.
					 They have responded like Liberals always do, with money and band-aids. Throw
					 money at the problem and the symptoms will go away for a while, but the problem
					 will continue to fester. Money may buy votes, but money alone will not protect
					 Canada, its citizens or the economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue minister has announced more money and the
					 hiring of customs officers. This is a very small step in addressing the deficit
					 that existed prior to September 11. The customs union is calling for 1,200 new
					 officers; it is getting 130. These new officers will be unable to adequately
					 protect our border because they will lack the legislative tools to do their
					 job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-23, which is passing through the House, was
					 touted as a new vision for Canada's borders. While the official opposition
					 agreed with the initiatives for liberalizing trade, we were shocked by its lack
					 of security measures. The revenue minister bragged that Bill S-23 was a product
					 of a year and a half of consultation but he did not say with whom. He bragged
					 about the dual mandate of trade and security, but actions speak louder than
					 words. His actions have dictated that there is no dual mandate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 18 months of consultations on Canada's
					 borders and not one security expert or organization was consulted by the
					 minister. The only groups consulted were related to trade and tourism. Where is
					 the dual mandate? Where is the balance?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that CCRA is a department focused on
					 streamlining accounting systems and collecting revenues. It is not focused on
					 security. The logical question is: Why are our border guards, Canada's first
					 line of defence, managed by bean counters?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem like a logical person, Mr. Speaker. If you see
					 a crime in progress, would you call the police or your accountant? You would
					 call the police. Why? Because they have the training, knowledge and tools to
					 protect society and enforce laws.</p>


	<A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our customs officers do a tremendous job, especially
					 when one looks at the number of statutes they are charged with enforcing, their
					 limited resources and their inability to protect themselves from the potential
					 dangers inherent in border protection. We believe that Canada and our customs
					 officers would be better served by moving Canada customs out of the tax
					 collection agency and into a law enforcement department such as the solicitor
					 general's. Just as customs now enforces the statutes of several departments, it
					 would continue to enact the national revenue policies of trade
					 liberalization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can have it both ways. We can have strong borders
					 and strong trade with the U.S. In fact, a continental security perimeter would
					 facilitate the freer flow of trade for we could be more certain that what is
					 flowing across the border is legitimate trade. I believe it is worth
					 protecting. I believe my arguments here today are balanced, logical and
					 practical. I ask members to look around this room. This is the home of our
					 democracy. Is it not worth protecting?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the views opposite, it is not fearmongering
					 to audit our ability to protect what we hold most dear. In the interest of
					 public safety, it is responsible to question our security and equally
					 responsible to admit inadequacies where they exist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Liberals we have seen an erosion of the value
					 of Canadian citizenship. As someone who came to this country as a refugee, I
					 cherish my Canadian citizenship. To be Canadian and free was not my birthright
					 and so I do not take it for granted. Members of my family, like the vast
					 majority of refugees, are thankful every day for what we have here in Canada
					 and as a result they are hardworking contributors to this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the refugees in Canada, are calling for a more
					 stringent refugee determination process. Greater scrutiny is in Canada's best
					 interests and the best interests of legitimate refugees, for if people have
					 nothing to hide they have nothing to fear from the system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our livelihoods, our citizenship and our freedoms are
					 worth fighting for and protecting. The refugee determination system is an
					 insult to Canada and it is an insult to those seeking refuge. As a result of
					 the inept IRB process, those refugees who are granted asylum continue to have
					 their motives for being in Canada questioned long after their claims are
					 settled. Why? Because those political appointees charged with the
					 responsibility of refugee determination lack qualifications and lack a clear
					 definition of refugee. The UN has a definition but Canada does not follow
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from New Westminster has already addressed
					 the immigration component of perimeter security. I feel compelled to speak out
					 on behalf of refugees to address the Liberal policy that is a disservice to
					 those who choose to live in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immigration minister labels anyone who criticizes
					 this government's immigration policies as anti-immigrant. It is time for the
					 Prime Minister to call off the dogs. The system is broken and it desperately
					 needs fixing. If he does not fix it, Canada's economy will suffer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on the Prime Minister to follow through on the
					 agreement with President Fox of Mexico and hold a summit on a North American
					 security perimeter.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to my colleague, the
					 member for Edmonton--Strathcona. He was the industry critic for our party and
					 knows the concerns that Canadians have in terms of any possible restriction in
					 access to our U.S. neighbour's market. Considering that some 33% of Canada's
					 GDP is generated from our exports to the United States, he will also know how
					 vulnerable we would be if that border were to close or to be restricted. Some
					 of his comments did address that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if he could tell us more about the nature of
					 Canadian and U.S. business, the integration that has happened in a number of
					 sectors in the last several years which means essentially that there is $1.5
					 billion worth of business across that border every day. Every day trucks are
					 delivering products on a just in time delivery basis. This means that the
					 product out of a steel mill in Hamilton that is going to a plant 20 miles down
					 the road is being stamped into fenders that afternoon. That is just in time
					 delivery. Could he tell us how susceptible we are to losing that market share
					 in the United States if we do not address this security concern the Americans
					 have and develop a new border protocol?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my hon. colleague
					 from Peace River for his question. It is clear that we do have a problem in the
					 country and that we do have something to fear, especially when it comes to what
					 the U.S. might do in reaction to what is happening at our borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in the <i>National Post</i>, I believe, as well
					 as in the Washington <i>Post</i>, there was an article about the revival of
					 section 110 in the U.S. This would stop trade from Canada to the U.S. by
					 implementing a number of provisions that since 1996 have been held off by our
					 Canadian trade negotiators. We said we would make changes to our border
					 security to allow the free flow of trade to the U.S. but would increase
					 security so that the U.S. would not have anything to worry about on our side of
					 the bargain about keeping security tight at the border. In fact we have failed
					 on that measure and because of that the U.S. is now entertaining invoking
					 section 110 which, as my colleague has identified, would especially affect just
					 in time manufacturing. It is literally true that producers here will make a
					 product, put it on a truck to the U.S. and later that afternoon it will be
					 turned into some other viable product. With what the U.S. is planning, those
					 products will be stopped at the border and held sometimes for hours if not
					 days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could protect our industry, our jobs and everything
					 in the country that we are so proud of if we were to make the minor changes at
					 the border that I spoke about in my speech and that many of my colleagues are
					 speaking about today: improving security measures so that they can have that
					 dual mandate of expediting trade but still be responsible when it comes to
					 protecting security. They are minor changes like giving the border agents the
					 proper tools to do their jobs, whether it is firearms, the ability to detain
					 potential criminals coming through the border or whatever it might be to have
					 them do their job, not just on the revenue side but especially on the first
					 line of defence side. That would give the U.S. the security it wants to see. It
					 would see that we are taking our responsibility seriously. That would allow our
					 trade to continue to flow. As I said, the effects on our economy could be
					 disastrous if that border starts to close.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I was interested in my colleague's
					 comments, but I cannot help but recall the numerous times over the past number
					 of years that the Canadian Alliance, as the Reform Party, criticized the public
					 service in Canada. It criticized the government for spending dollars on public
					 service employees, supported the government cuts and actually pushed for
					 greater cuts to the public service, which directly affected the numbers of
					 customs and immigration officers at the border who are doing exactly what he is
					 talking about. His party really is the root of the problem. That is the root of
					 the problem: When people call for these cuts they have to accept that the
					 employees will not be able to provide the service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear his position on whether he thinks
					 his party made a serious mistake in saying to make deeper cuts to the public
					 service, the employees are really not doing anything, they are just a bunch of
					 highly paid public servants and they should not be there. That is what the
					 Reform Party said for a number of years.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, unlike my hon. colleague from the NDP who
					 calls for spending in every facet of Canadians' lives, in every level of the
					 bureaucracy, and for outrageous levels of spending, this party has called for
					 prioritization, especially when it comes to the important areas that we as
					 Canadians feel government should put money into. We have called for that type
					 of money to be spent, especially in the area of the solicitor general and in
					 giving CSIS and the RCMP the tools to do their jobs. We have continuously
					 called for stronger tools for border guards. The hon. member is completely
					 mistaken when she makes these accusations that we have not taken the security
					 of this country responsibly.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I too will be sharing my time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American public and particularly the politicians
					 must wonder what is in our water. A senator in the United States stood up at a
					 press conference and held up a study that she purported proved that the
					 Canadian border was a sieve and that our country was a haven for terrorists.
					 When she was asked where she obtained her information and how she could justify
					 her statements, she said “I got the information from Canadian press reports”.
					 This is remarkable. They read the newspapers and hear people in this country
					 making these allegations, so they say that if we in this country are saying it,
					 it must be true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it incredible that we have an official
					 opposition that would actually make statements which would undermine the
					 ability of this country to negotiate a fair and reasonable response to the
					 tragedies that have befallen our complete world as that relates to trade
					 between Canada and the United States. We know that 87% of our exports go south
					 of the border. We also know that 25% of theirs come north. If American
					 authorities are seeing and hearing Canadian authorities say that the sky is
					 falling and we are a haven for terrorists and we are this and we are that,
					 would it not seem reasonable that they would be loath to enter into new
					 arrangements and new agreements?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winston Churchill said that the first casualty of war
					 is the truth. Never before have I seen it be more obvious. Let us take a look
					 at what the motion calls for. It says that immigration officers and customs
					 officers should be granted “full peace officer status” with the ability to
					 arrest and detain criminals and terrorists. Would it come as a shock to the
					 author of this motion that this is the fact today? Our people have the status
					 of peace officers. They have the ability to arrest and detain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not matter that this is the current situation.
					 What matters is that there is an opportunity being seized upon by the official
					 opposition to somehow fearmonger and, in its members' minds, enhance its
					 political status within the Canadian system and within the country. I suggest
					 that it is not going to work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, they know full well, or they should know, that
					 previous critics from the Canadian Alliance and its predecessor, the Reform
					 Party, refused to attend trips with the minister of immigration to actually
					 investigate, on the ground at our foreign posts and in our embassies, what goes
					 on. Their reason for refusing was that they insisted on being given the
					 opportunity to attend every meeting the minister went to. When we went to
					 Kenya, we did not have the critic from the official opposition with us because
					 he wanted to attend a meeting that the minister was having with the president
					 of that country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a member of parliament in support of the
					 government. I would not be so presumptuous as to insist that unless I am
					 allowed to attend a meeting between a member of cabinet and the president of
					 another country I will not go. It seems to me that is a bit of a cop-out. In
					 not going, that critic failed to see what was there, and this has happened in
					 Moscow, the Ukraine, London, Africa, the Middle East and the Far East, all over
					 the world. They do not want to know because it takes away from the ability to
					 stand up in the House, as members shamefully have done, and make wild
					 accusations that the foreign service is subject to bribery.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard statements made by members of the official
					 opposition that visas are given out in return for favours and bribes. To make
					 those kinds of allegations with no evidence whatsoever, except to have the
					 opportunity to hear from someone like Diane Francis writing in the <i>National
					 Post</i> with the most extraordinary accusations based on fantasy, is not
					 becoming of a member of parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point in this resolution is that our people
					 already have that authority. It goes on to say that we should detain all
					 spontaneous refugees. I would like to talk about that. A spontaneous refugee as
					 defined by the official opposition is someone who shows up on our shores
					 uninvited. Is it not astounding that a refugee would actually arrive somewhere
					 uninvited? Let us imagine that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have millions of refugees in campsites. I have been
					 there. The critic once again refused to go to the desert in Africa to meet the
					 refugees and to talk to them about their plight and how they lost their
					 families, homes and infrastructure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do members opposite think the people in the Sudan have
					 the opportunity to go to a government office and apply for a passport? The
					 Sudan does not have such an infrastructure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that we have people who show up here
					 without ID. In many cases they leave their homes in the middle of the night
					 with the police coming in the front door. That is not an exaggeration. I have
					 met and talked with them. I know it happens because I have seen it with my own
					 eyes. They leave in the middle of the night with their children and the shirts
					 on their backs. They do not have time to stop and ask where is their driver's
					 licence, if they have one to begin with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an international tragedy that was in existence
					 before September 11. It is a tragedy to see refugee camps with hundreds of
					 thousands of people, insufficient water and no infrastructure, not knowing what
					 to do and wanting to go home, might I add. That is what they truly want to do.
					 They want to go home.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we hear? The opposition wants us to detain
					 everybody who comes here uninvited. What happens now if people show up who do
					 not have proper ID? We interview them at length. We determine whether or not
					 their story is true. We fingerprint and photograph them. We check them through
					 international security services and computer links. We attempt to find out who
					 they are and what they are doing here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not get satisfaction on those points, they are
					 detained. It happens now. Does that matter to members of the official
					 opposition? Would they rather perpetrate a fraud upon the public in this
					 country that somehow or other we are simply releasing people willy-nilly into
					 the community, even if it is not true?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accusations that were in the media about 50 Afghani
					 and Pakistani refugees arriving here less than 10 days ago and being released
					 into the community without any security checks whatsoever were absolutely
					 false. Does it matter, though, that they were false, or does it only matter
					 that it was in the paper so it must be true? The opposition then has the
					 ability to propagate that information even further.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge Canadians to remain calm and to recognize that
					 the politics of hatred and fear being propagated by the official opposition is
					 not the Canadian way. We need to be secure in our borders. We need to keep
					 trade flowing between Canada and the United States. Telling the international
					 community that we have all these problems when in fact we do not is the most
					 irresponsible and reprehensible action that anyone can take, yet alone a member
					 of this place.</p>

					 believe he does, that refugees must purchase an airline ticket to get to
					 Canada? They cannot just walk across a border. If they are coming from Somalia
					 where the average income per year is maybe less than $60 U.S. and they have to
					 buy an airline ticket for $600 U.S., the first question we want to ask is:
					 Where did they get the money? If it was not theirs, who paid for it and
					 why?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot get into Canada without some sort of
					 documentation to get on the plane. He talks about not being able to apply for a
					 passport and that is fine, but they change planes at Heathrow, Amsterdam or
					 Frankfurt. If they are genuine refugees should they not be claiming refugee
					 status there? If they get back on the plane with their $600 U.S. ticket they
					 are choosing Canada as a destination and we need to be suspicious of
					 that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I made note of a statement made by the

					 arrive in Canada and claim refugee status are not refugees. He is the
					 opposition critic in the citizenship and immigration committee. That is so
					 wrong that it is laughable. The approval rate by the refugee board is 57% of

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish our society was a neat little box like the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do the security checks and the interviews. We find
					 out who the people are, where they are from and what they are doing. If they
					 pose a security risk or if there is any doubt that they may not show up for a
					 hearing, they are detained. What more do these people want? Do they want a
					 penal colony? That is not Canada.</p>

					 I am the longest serving member of the citizenship and immigration

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have people who apply for visitor visas and come to
					 Canada. When that visa expires they disappear. Am I happy about that? No, I am
					 not, but they are not criminals. Many of them are working in the housing
					 industry and in the construction trades. They are also not necessarily
					 refugees. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have people in Canada and in the United States who
					 are living here without the proper status. Yes, we should try to correct that
					 and Bill C-11 goes a long way toward allowing us to do that. This is a bill

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the issue of a secure border is a very
					 major issue for all Canadians. It should not only be secure but also perceived
					 to be secure. We trade mostly manufactured goods with our southern partner in
					 the United States. The products that cross that border amount to $1.5 billion a
					 day. We need a seamless border which allows goods to travel back and forth with
					 no problem at all. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A manufacturing corporation which has a large engine
					 plant in Windsor made a statement last week to show how important the seamless
					 flow of goods and merchandise is across the border. It said that when an engine
					 leaves the engine plant in Windsor it is important that no blockage at the
					 border occur because in two hours they expect under the delivery system that
					 they operate on the engine to be in a truck going off the assembly line in
					 Detroit. That is the kind of just in time delivery system that is required if
					 our Canadian industry is to be compatible and operating with our American
					 partners. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear that our borders are significant to
					 all trade. We cannot avoid to bottleneck everything at the border. How do we
					 strike that balance between security and business opportunities to make certain
					 that everyone survives and survives reasonably well?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that we look at our system of
					 immigration and refugees and state things that are accurate. When I look at
					 some of the facts pertaining to our border, they are not what I hear every day.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and the United States share some 8,800
					 kilometres of border. In Canada we employ more inspectors and people at the
					 border than our U.S. counterparts. Canada has 350 citizenship and immigration
					 inspectors and 2,400 customs inspectors while the United States at the same
					 time has approximately 1,500 in total. The number of people who work at
					 Canada's borders are nearly double those in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many statements have been made by politicians in Canada
					 and in the United States that Canada is a haven for terrorism. That is
					 absolutely not true. Let us look at terrorism and what happened tragically on
					 September 11. Canadians did not go into the United States and create that
					 danger. However we have to look very carefully at border operations between
					 Canada and the United States. Certainly some changes need to occur.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior bureaucrats in the United States have commented
					 that most of the western border crossings do not operate on a 24 hour basis.
					 They were talking about North Dakota. Three out of fifteen border crossings
					 operate on a 24 hour a day system. That means the other 12 only operate from 9
					 until 5. The only thing that stops anybody from crossing the border is a red
					 cone in the middle of the road. That is not the protection we expect between
					 Canada and the United States.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our border has been very open. It has not required
					 security. The U.S., with 2,000 and some people at the border, did not see
					 Canada as a problem before September 11. The U.S. has eight times as many
					 people at the Mexican border than at the Canadian border. That means it saw a
					 major problem between Mexico and the United States but did not see the same
					 problem between Canada and the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find difficulty with some of the irresponsible
					 comments that have been made at this point in time. There has been a lot of
					 irresponsible finger pointing and rhetoric that does nothing to enhance our
					 opportunities in Canada or our business opportunities abroad. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find difficulty with the suggestion that we do not
					 make sure that when immigrants or refugees land in Canada they are brought into
					 an inspection area, fingerprinted, questioned and checked. If for any reason a
					 person coming into Canada shows evidence, as the former speaker has said, of
					 being a danger to the country, a terrorist threat or someone who might not
					 appear at future hearings, the person is detained. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not just open the borders and allow anyone to
					 come in. Health and criminal checks are done on every person who makes an
					 application. People cannot just fly in, go abroad or do whatever they wish.
					 That is not the case. However this is the message I hear from various people,
					 and it is a pretty unfair message. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my area where crossing the border is so important
					 car traffic has been down by 60% since September 11. In southwestern Ontario
					 small restaurants and businesses that depend on cross-border traffic, tool and
					 dye companies and our whole tourist and manufacturing sectors are finding these
					 times very difficult. Plants are laying people off and having brief shutdowns.
					 The backups at the borders are as long as two hours in some cases. At other
					 times traffic flows through relatively easily.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an American thinking about coming over to Windsor
					 for supper knows there will be a potential two hour backup at the border and
					 another hour backup going home, he will not use the Canadian facilities. Our
					 business is suffering dramatically as a result.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians must be reassured that the country is safe. I
					 give the commissioner of the RCMP a tremendous amount of credit. When he met
					 with the immigration committee last week and with the Senate briefly, his
					 number one message was that Canada is the safest country in the world.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We make certain that people coming into Canada are
					 checked carefully. Our sharing of information with officers around the world,
					 be it Europeans, Americans or anyone else, is extremely good. Through CSIS and
					 the RCMP we have access to all kinds of records of people from every nation of
					 the world so that we can check carefully.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are well known for training people and making sure
					 the immigration and RCMP officers at our borders are highly trained and
					 skilled. That does not mean we have a perfect system. However we are putting a
					 great deal of money into improving it through the terrorist bill.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have heard some of the Liberals today
					 stand on the other side of the House to give us their talking points as though
					 there were almost no problems with the immigration system. I served with some
					 of them on the citizenship and immigration committee. At that time, thankfully,
					 they were willing to acknowledge there were problems and put out some reports,
					 but they have not measured up in terms of reporting back mechanisms.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will propose a scenario and ask my Liberal friend
					 across the way a question. The government and the minister have the power to
					 detain people. Liberal members have been talking about fingerprinting and
					 everything else in some of their speeches, and I am sure it is on all their
					 talking points. However if people arrive at one of our airports who have burned
					 or destroyed their documentation, all they are asked for is their name. That is
					 all that happens. If they give their name that is good enough. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the people at our airports do not want to deal
					 with all the paperwork and problems and whatnot, they pass it on. All they do
					 is take down the person's name and hope that at some point whoever it is will
					 show up at an appropriate time before an appropriate body.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out to everyone listening today and to my
					 Liberal friends across the way that despite the fact the Liberal government has
					 the power to detain it does not. This makes it easier for our people at
					 airports who do not have the proper staff, manpower or resources because the
					 government has not given them what they need. As a result people arriving in
					 Canada can give a fictitious name and walk free. Is that not true?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have a real problem with the question
					 and the way it was put forward, not because it is not an important issue for
					 Canadians but because of the insinuations it makes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague stated that immigration officers do not
					 want to be bothered. Quite frankly, that is anything but true. I have met with
					 people on the immigration board. I have met with immigration officers, many of
					 whom are neighbours and friends of people across the country. They are there to
					 protect our borders. No one in the House should make a blanket statement that
					 immigration officers do not do their job. That is ridiculously wrong. They
					 should be ashamed of themselves for doing that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberals detain people. There is absolutely no
					 question. The hon. member for Dauphin--Swan River, the critic for the
					 opposition party, appeared before the committee working on Bill C-11 to talk
					 about the bill. He tried to weaken the bill the Liberals put on the floor of
					 the House in June. These were his words:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly Alliance members cannot stand today and

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the
					 member for Surrey North. I am pleased to be the next to speak because I can
					 clarify something that was said by the member who just spoke. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visited the Vancouver airport immigration processing
					 centre last Thursday with the member for West Vancouver--Sunshine Coast. The
					 hon. member for Chatham--Kent Essex needs to visit an immigration centre to
					 find out what actually happens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the member says the people who get off planes are
					 fingerprinted he is correct. They are. However does he know that it takes 10
					 months to get the fingerprint results back? Does he know that it is only for
					 fingerprint records in Canada and nowhere else in the world? A person can turn
					 up and give any name such as Joe Smith. CSIS will check only that name in its
					 records. The fingerprints take 10 months to check and they are only for Canada.
					 Can the hon. member not see that a criminal can walk into Canada
					 instantly?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no medical checks. The member can verify this
					 any place where there is an immigration port. The refugee claimant is given a
					 package of documents, asked to report at a certain time to a certain place, and
					 given an application for a medical check. However there are no medical checks
					 at the airport before the person is released.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for detention, yes, technically it is true that
					 people can be detained. However last week when we were in Vancouver there were
					 only five people detained and awaiting deportation. They were all international
					 criminals with lengthy international warrants for their arrest who had been
					 identified. For people who are detained because they are uncooperative, the
					 maximum amount of time is two to three days in the Richmond lock-up and then
					 they are released. As soon as they give any name at all they are given the
					 refugee package and dispensed out the door.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I challenge the hon. member or any other person on that
					 side who has been brainwashed with their talking points to go to any port of
					 entry in the country and prove me wrong, because that is what
					 happens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in this place knows it is ridiculous to
					 suggest there could be refugee claimants from Amsterdam in Holland, Heathrow in
					 the U.K. or Frankfurt in Germany. That would be ridiculous. These countries do
					 not produce refugees. However for Canada they do. We accept refugees from
					 Heathrow, Amsterdam and Frankfurt every day of the week. These are people who
					 get on planes in countries where they need to change planes. They change planes
					 at Frankfurt, Heathrow or Amsterdam. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UN charter on refugees allows refugees to claim
					 safety in the first safe country they get to. I challenge anyone on that side
					 of the House to tell me how people can be refugees if they change planes at
					 Heathrow, Amsterdam or Frankfurt and choose to come to Canada. Did they not
					 forgo their opportunity to claim refugee status in the first safe country they
					 reached?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to refugee producing countries I cannot
					 think of many. The only one from which there is a non-stop flight to Canada is
					 Cuba. There might be others; I could be corrected on this point. However
					 everyone else must change planes somewhere, and that somewhere is always a safe
					 country. When people get on a plane with a $600 U.S. ticket, I want to know
					 where they purchased it, who gave them the money and if they came from Somalia
					 or Afghanistan. I want to know how they got the ticket.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. takes the attitude that if people arrive with
					 no documents it is a pretty good indication of the type of character they are.
					 It indicates that they trying to hide something. They do not get admitted. They
					 get shipped out right away. Anyone who has no documents does not get into the
					 United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other respects the United States is as weak as us.
					 It detains people for a short time. It has in the past, as we have, released
					 these people for medical examinations and so on. It needs to tighten up its
					 rules as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member who just spoke said it is wrong to say
					 Canada is a haven for terrorists. However CSIS has told us there are more than
					 300 people with terrorist links in the country right now. Can Liberal members
					 deny this? CSIS has identified them for us. In addition, 50 or more
					 organizations with terrorists links are raising money.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were no problem why is it the new bill the
					 government has put on the table includes provisions to take away the charitable
					 status of these terrorist organizations? I wonder how many Canadian people know
					 that terrorist organizations at the moment can legally set up a charity in
					 Canada under the umbrella that they are informing people, that it is an
					 information service about terrorism, and all the while they are happily raising
					 money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Finance attended a fundraising dinner
					 that CSIS warned him could be a fundraising dinner for terrorists, the Tamil
					 tigers. There is a lot to answer for on that side of the House. They can wax
					 eloquent on their talking points all day and quote their brainwashed
					 programming from upstairs but it does not alter what is happening at our border
					 crossings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the NDP member who stood up earlier whether she
					 was aware that on any particular night in downtown Vancouver 50% of the arrests
					 made by police are refugee claimants. Surely that is an indication there is a
					 problem. If that is occurring at every major centre across the country, we have
					 a huge problem on our hands, and that is the amount of resources being consumed
					 because we were careless at the borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we had several boatloads of Chinese migrants
					 arrive here last summer, the immigration minister finally showed some courage
					 and detained those people while we processed their claims, considerably faster
					 than average I might add. What did we do? We rejected more than 90% of those
					 people. More than 90% were found to be cheats, queue jumpers or non-refugees.
					 They were opportunists trying to come in through the back door when they should
					 have been coming through the normal immigration process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Thursday immigration officials told us that for
					 every 63 people arriving at the airport claiming refugee status, 200 people
					 claim refugee status at a downtown immigration office in Vancouver, that is 200
					 people who have slipped through with forged documents, visitor visas or some
					 other way with the intention of claiming refugee status, getting on our social
					 welfare programs, obtaining free dental care, a free apartment to live in and
					 12 years of appeals before their refugee status is ruled on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My riding has probably one of the largest refugee
					 claiming populations in the country. It has been estimated that up to 50% of
					 the people in the Iranian community are refugee claimants. I have had genuine
					 Iranian immigrants call my office identifying some of these people by name and
					 asking me why we let them in. They give me names of certain Iranian individuals
					 who are criminals and wanted for bank robbery or other crimes in Iran. I always
					 report the names to immigration Canada but it never has any record of those
					 names because these criminals do not use their own names when they come to
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that anyone coming to our border and making
					 a refugee claim when they changed planes in Amsterdam, Frankfurt or Heathrow is
					 a queue jumper because there are millions of genuine refugees in United
					 Nations' camps around the world waiting for us to help them. We should be
					 sending a strong message throughout the world that we want to help genuine
					 refugees and we will take the maximum number we possibly can within our
					 economic constraints, but they will all come prescreened from United Nations'
					 refugee camps. If people want to get into Canada they must go there. They
					 should not bother trying to queue jump into this country because it is not
					 right and we will not tolerate it. The other side loves to talk about tolerance
					 and that Canada is a wonderfully tolerant country, but we will not tolerate
					 queue jumpers, cheats, criminals or anyone else who is taking advantage of our

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to actually compliment the government for
					 stationing immigration officers in places like Heathrow, Amsterdam and
					 Frankfurt because they do a great job prescreening and assisting the airlines
					 in tracking false documentation, but they are spread too thin. The airlines
					 have told me that they have one of these people on hand who can be called if
					 necessary but it is not for every flight and every passenger. There are still
					 plenty of people sneaking through. </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for giving me
					 the opportunity to expand on this topic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an immigrant. When I applied in 1977 to come to
					 this country I was turned down the first time. Some may say that was good but
					 the fact is that I was turned down the first time and I think that was very
					 wise. The first step is to make sure that the people who decide at a party on a
					 Saturday night that they want to go to Canada need to be weeded out right away.
					 I applied again wondering why I did not get in the first time? It took two
					 years for my family to get approval to come here. It was 1979 before we came
					 and we felt we had earned our right to come here. We went through the process
					 and did it properly. We did not try to queue jump.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have a similar process for refugees. As I
					 mentioned and as the member knows, there are many refugees waiting in United
					 Nations' camps around the world. I believe those refugees have every right to
					 expect prompt attention to their plight. For every person we accept at our
					 border and use resources and processing time on, it is one or more people who
					 we cannot use resources and processing time on from those United Nations' camps
					 where they have already been proven to be refugees. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that anybody who comes to this country via
					 Heathrow, Amsterdam or Frankfurt is probably not a refugee and is jumping ahead
					 of the proper process, which is to be recognized as a refugee first. That is
					 what is happening at United Nations' camps. We should send the message that
					 nobody is coming to this country pretending to be a refugee when they more
					 properly should come through the correct channels and get in the queue along
					 with all those people who have been waiting patiently for years in refugee
					 camps.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my colleague from North Vancouver gave an
					 interesting speech. I know he has a very busy constituency office dealing with
					 immigration matters. In my constituency office in Grand Prairie, immigration
					 takes up the biggest part of our workload. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada accepts about 250,000 to 300,000 immigrants
					 yearly. We are all immigrants or descendants of immigrants and we know we need
					 to have immigration in order to continue to have the level of population we
					 need for the economy to grow. I do not think that is in question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My office is sometimes involved in immigration cases
					 where it takes up to three years for people, who are going through the process
					 legitimately, to come into Canada. I have met with a lot of people who would
					 make outstanding citizens. Does my colleague not experience the same kind of
					 situation where people who are trying to come in through the legitimate process
					 are waiting longer because we are facing a huge problem with refugees coming
					 into this country illegally and thereby inflating the numbers which hurts
					 legitimate applicants?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is absolutely correct. Our immigration department
					 has a huge amount of refugee claims which no doubt take resources away from
					 genuine immigrants. I have had refugee claimants call me up to say that their

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would be amazed if they saw some of the files
					 that I see from people asking for assistance. Incidentally, I never act as an
					 advocate for someone trying to get into the country but my office will
					 definitely check the file to make sure it is on track. I had a refugee claimant
					 upset that he was being rejected because he had been back to Iran, the country
					 from which he was claiming refugee status. I asked him how he could be a
					 refugee if he went back? He said “how else am I supposed to look after my
					 business?” There is the problem.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak on my
					 party's supply motion. In light of September 11, each one of the four points
					 outlined in the motion is of the highest importance to all Canadians and our
					 allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my submission to the House today, I intend to
					 address each point in the motion. It is obvious to Canadians and our neighbours
					 that the time has come to do more than just consider a continental perimeter
					 initiative. We need to take decisive action to ensure the security of our
					 country and to protect our vital trading relationships.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's motion calls on the government to take four
					 steps that the Canadian Alliance believes will go a long way toward ensuring
					 that our country can make a significant contribution to the fight against
					 terrorism on the home front as well as maintaining the healthy trading
					 relationship we currently enjoy with the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area that today's motion explores is not only
					 to provide both immigration and customs officers with the training that is
					 required but to also give them full officer status to allow them to detain and
					 arrest suspected criminals at all points of entry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious to most Canadians and to our American
					 neighbours that the current safeguards on our front lines are substandard. I
					 want to be very clear. This is not the fault of the hard working men and women
					 who staff our borders. It is the government which refuses to give them the
					 tools and training necessary to do the job properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been informed that at Pearson International
					 Airport during peak arrival times in the primary customs inspection area, up to
					 25% of the staff are university students with little more than two weeks worth
					 of training. The students are left with minimal supervision to make decisions
					 as to who can enter the country and who must go on to secondary
					 inspection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incredible to me that in the wake of the events
					 of September 11 and the claims of the government to have beefed up security,
					 the students are still out there as our first line of defence. Even more
					 shocking, I have learned that at some of our land border crossings there are
					 students doing secondary customs inspection. This has to stop. If Canada
					 expects the U.S. to take any of our border security measures seriously, we
					 require qualified and highly trained people on our front lines and they must be
					 given the powers they need to do the job. This is the type of initiative that
					 would go a long way to better securing our borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the issue of giving our front line
					 officers the powers and tools to detain and arrest suspected criminals and
					 terrorists. I will go back to the Pearson airport example. I have learned that
					 if customs officers wants to detain or arrest a suspected criminal or
					 terrorist, they may have to wait anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour for
					 police to respond to the call. A lot can happen in half an hour without the
					 proper equipment or powers to do the job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only are we putting Canadians at risk with the
					 current practices, we are seriously jeopardizing the safety of our front line
					 workers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next logical step is to examine our more remote
					 border crossings. How long is the response time of police at those locations?
					 It is an unenviable position in which the government places its front line
					 border staff. More to the point, Canadian security is put to risk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear by the actions of the government that our
					 front line customs officers are to be little more than duty and tax collectors.
					 It would seem that the government, as evidenced by its inaction, is more
					 interested in collecting the health minister's $10 duty on a carton of
					 cigarettes than it is in identifying or arresting terrorists or serious
					 criminals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second point of today's motion.
					 If the government is to take seriously the threat of terrorists and criminals
					 breaching our borders and using Canada as a staging ground for their nefarious
					 activities, we need to move the customs officers out of the tax collection
					 agency and into law enforcement agencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that as long as the front line
					 of defence at our borders is under the supervision of Revenue Canada then the
					 emphasis will always be on tax collection and not security. Certainly I think
					 the government would find that its customs officers would overwhelmingly
					 support this type of move.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next problem the government has failed to address
					 properly is the practice of releasing spontaneous refugee claimants who appear
					 without proper documentation before their identities are confirmed and before
					 they have cleared proper health and security checks. All too often refugee
					 claimants are released on the same day they arrive in Canada on a promise to
					 appear before the Immigration and Refugee Board.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours of questioning is clearly not enough to
					 determine possible security threats and it certainly does not allow for proper
					 health examinations. The truth of the matter is that it can takes weeks or
					 months with the current resource shortfalls to properly determine the true
					 identities of refugee claimants who arrive on our doorstep without
					 documentation. Again it is a resource and training problem</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody is suggesting that we hold refugee claimants in
					 detention for extended periods of time. What we are saying is that if the
					 government were to commit the proper resources and determination methods, we
					 could accept legitimate refugee claimants faster and protect Canadians and our
					 U.S. neighbours from the unwanted dangerous elements.</p>


	<A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are saying that if the government were to commit the
					 proper resources and determination methods, we could accept legitimate refugee
					 claimants faster and protect Canadians and our U.S. neighbours from the
					 unwanted dangerous elements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detention in this context is not inhumane. Detention
					 upon entering a country, without any proof of identity or in some cases
					 fabricated identities, should be expected. Most genuine refugee claimants would
					 see this simply as one minor setback on the way to establishing a new life in
					 Canada. If the claimant desires to be released from detention, the process does
					 not have to be complicated, as many people making refugee claims in Canada come
					 from a safe third country. At any time during their detention, the refugee
					 claimant would be free to go back to that safe third country and make their
					 claim from there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a real acceptance rate of nearly 60% of all
					 refugee claims, Canada has become the asylum shoppers destination of choice.
					 Canada's refugee system would be completely different if the government were to
					 act on current laws and prescribe certain countries as safe third countries.
					 This would drastically reduce the number of spontaneous refugee claimants in
					 Canada and would go a long way toward increasing this country's
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of asylum seekers enter Canada through the
					 United States. If Canada were to enter into an agreement with the United States
					 alone, we could reduce the burden on our refugee determination system by more
					 than one half. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, if we were to enter agreements with the
					 European Union countries, we would also see a drastic reduction in the number
					 of spontaneous refugee claims in Canada, thereby sending a message to the world
					 that asylum shoppers need not put Canada on their list. That in turn would free
					 up the resources to really help the most needy refugees and to do more work
					 overseas by easing the pressure in the refugee camps. We could then offer truly
					 destitute people the chance at a new life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many EU countries have already implemented the safe
					 third country concept. It is long past time that Canada get on board and act on
					 laws that are already on the books. It is not necessary for Canada to give up
					 its sovereignty to accomplish the goal of a continental security perimeter. We
					 simply need to look at what we can do to strengthen our current practices to
					 ensure the safety and security of Canada and our U.S. neighbours. It is not a
					 lot of ask.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage all members of the House to vote in favour
					 of today's motion because I believe that the steps which it encourages the
					 government to take would make great headway in easing the legitimate fears and
					 concerns of Canadians and Americans alike.</p>

					 by the Canadian Alliance leader. The motion states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That, as part of a continental
						  perimeter initiative to secure Canada's borders and protect the security of
						  Canadians and our neighbours, and to protect our trading relationships, this
						  House calls on the government to: </small></td>

</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(a) provide both Immigration officers and Customs
						  officers enhanced training and full peace officer status to allow them to
						  detain and arrest suspected criminals or terrorists at the border--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously immigration officers have long been peace
					 officers, meaning they have authority to arrest and detain persons who are
					 inadmissible to Canada. This obviously includes persons they suspect of being
					 criminals or who already belong to terrorist organizations in other
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now the existing legislation, as well as proposed
					 Bill C-11, contain provisions for protecting our borders. It is completely
					 wrong to suggest that we do not have such provisions. We do. Our officers have
					 all the means at their disposal to protect the Canadian public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion raises another point I wish to address. It
					 states that the government should:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(c) detain all spontaneous refugee claimants appearing
						  without proper documentation until their identities are confirmed and they have
						  cleared proper health and security checks--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again I would mention that our immigration
					 officers conduct an investigation as soon as an application for refugee status
					 has been received. I wish to give an idea of the figures. Some 600 to 800
					 persons are detained every day by immigration officers. It is wrong to say that
					 they are not doing their job. On the contrary, I think they are doing it rather
					 well in the circumstances.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying the system is completely perfect. As we
					 know, it obviously has its shortcomings but hundreds of thousands of people
					 have been processed over the years. It is therefore not impossible that errors
					 may occur or that someone may slip through.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, however, there are certainly safeguards.
					 Last year alone over 8,500 persons were detained by the authorities for a full
					 verification of their origins and their past, as to whether they had ever been
					 charged with a crime and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, as the minister already mentioned this
					 morning, we already have in place a great number of mechanisms to protect our
					 borders. Contrary to what has been said, I do not think a continental perimeter
					 is required. I believe the Government of Canada has considerable experience in
					 the field of immigration. I have visited some of our offices abroad. It may be
					 true that on occasion there was a lack of resources. I do not doubt it. Our
					 immigration officers work very hard. On the whole, I was impressed by both the
					 quantity and quality of the work they accomplish. It is not insignificant. They
					 work very well. This is a fact that we need to mention more often.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mean to impute motives to the members from the
					 Canadian Alliance, but it is unfortunate that the words “terrorist” and
					 “criminal” come up too often when they speak in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the facts--which is important--we see
					 that Canadians on the whole very rarely use this kind of language.</p>


	<A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11, it is all that people are talking
					 about. We often forget the contributions that immigrants have made to our
					 country. I would like to highlight a few facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if we look at people's files, very few
					 immigrants have criminal records or have been in trouble with the law. It is
					 very important to acknowledge this, and it is a fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, once immigrants settle, on the whole, very few
					 of them require employment insurance benefits. It is important to note that
					 these people contribute to our country, they do not abuse the system as some in
					 this House have implied.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we often hear stories to the effect that
					 immigrants abuse the system in another way, with welfare. Obviously, when some
					 immigrants arrive, before settling in the community, they need help. We have a
					 very sophisticated system. Some may believe that it is being abused on a daily
					 basis, but this is not the case. There is a social infrastructure in place to
					 help people get settled. I believe that it is one of the great achievements of
					 our Christian society, if I may use the term.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing we have seen with immigrants over the
					 years is that, in their first five years, the average immigrant will earn less
					 than the Canadian average. After their fifth year of working in Canada, in
					 excess of 50% of them earn more than the Canadian average. Once again, this
					 gives some idea of the effort they put into contributing to this country, and
					 not only for themselves and their families. This gives some idea, when over 50%
					 of them earn more than the Canadian average.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect people are neglecting to
					 mention here. The educational level of most immigrants to Canada is higher than
					 the Canadian average. Many are technicians or professionals. In Damascus, I had
					 the opportunity to sit in on an interview with a man who had been working in
					 Syria for four or five years and was seeking to immigrate. It took him about a
					 year and a half. He had a doctorate in biochemistry, a great asset for our
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I find that these facts are being forgotten.
					 Too often we have been hearing “immigrant”, “terrorist” and “criminal” used in
					 the same sentence. I do not find this acceptable, when the facts demonstrate
					 the opposite. This needs some thought. As everyone keeps saying, we in this
					 country are all the children or grandchildren of immigrants. We need to think
					 about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point I must mention. We have heard
					 in the past four or five weeks that some members of the U.S. House of
					 Representatives have been pointing fingers at Canada, saying that our
					 immigration policies were not efficient, that many people were getting around
					 the system. I do not know where they have been getting their information, but
					 they are completely wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give a few important statistics: 40% of
					 people who make refugee claims at the Canadian border are coming from the
					 United States. They are on American territory and come to the Canadian border
					 to make a refugee claim. Are we the ones responsible if they have got into the
					 U.S. and then come to our border to make a refugee claim? How is this a flaw in
					 our system? It is theirs that is flawed.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention some of the comments I have
					 heard made by Alliance members in the past weeks. I bring to their attention
					 that quite often in a lot of their speeches they use the word “immigrants” and
					 in the same sentence they bring out the fact that there are criminals and
					 terrorists. That is a little exaggerated on their part and they should be very
					 conscious of it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have achieved in this country has been a
					 tremendous advantage to most Canadians. In the past weeks many Canadians have
					 expressed their profound belief that Canada is a peaceful and highly respected
					 country throughout the world. They know there are problems in other parts of
					 the world and as Canadians they feel that maybe the root causes should be
					 attacked. More than ever we have to show restraint in what we do in Canada. It
					 would be very wise for us to realize that some of the things we do are going to
					 have profound repercussions not only here but abroad and for those who want to
					 come to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope we can keep in mind that we have a tremendous
					 advantage by living in this country. Many people want to come to Canada.
					 However we cannot start making them feel as if we suspect everyone who wants to
					 come to this country and that we want to have investigations. We do not want
					 them to feel that way. We want them to feel welcome here. If in speeches they
					 hear the word “immigrant” is followed every time by “criminal” or “terrorist”,
					 that is highly unacceptable.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, when Bill C-11 was examined in committee,
					 the Canadian Alliance member for

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I found the comments of the hon. member
					 rather interesting. It seems to me that the hon. member forgot to read the
					 motion currently being debated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waxed long and eloquently upon the benefits of
					 immigrants coming to the country, which I certainly would endorse. Many people,
					 I dare say most of us, have ancestors who were immigrants to Canada. We are
					 very proud and thankful that we are able to live and make a living here. Many
					 people have contributed many things to the country. The hon. member absolutely
					 is correct about that, but that is not what we are debating today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are debating the possibility, in fact the
					 desirability, of creating a defence mechanism whereby government officials
					 would be empowered to arrest suspected criminals or terrorists at the border.
					 Spontaneous refugee claimants appearing at the border without documentation
					 would be detained until we could find out whether they were legitimate
					 refugees. Finally, there would be a list of safe countries from which we would
					 not accept refugees. That is what we are debating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a question of whether we should or should
					 not have immigrants come to the country. Of course we want immigrants. We want
					 to be compassionate toward refugees who are suffering and who are in danger of
					 being persecuted for whatever reasons, whether they be religious or political.
					 We want to be compassionate and encourage immigrants but the issue is what the
					 best possible mechanism would be to make sure that people who are suspected of
					 being terrorists or who are known to be terrorists are kept out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all want safe communities. We want to feel free from
					 having our possessions stolen. We do not want our friends or associates
					 murdered. We want peace. We want quiet. We want non-violence. The motion is
					 designed to create a mechanism to take the identified terrorists aside and tell
					 them they cannot come to Canada, that Canada will not be a place for them to
					 launch their terrorists activities or for them to go to other
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the issue. I wish the hon. member would comment
					 on that issue rather than on the immigration issue at large.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I say to the hon. member that I mentioned
					 that we have the necessary provisions already in the law. Our immigration
					 officers are acting as peace officers. We already have mechanisms at work to
					 protect our borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that some people slip through. We have
					 never claimed to have a perfect system. I would say to the hon. member that of
					 course we all want safe borders but there is no doubt in my mind that the
					 immigration officers are doing their work. Quite often they are doing it quite
					 well. There are circumstances, and I have to say in exceptional cases sometimes
					 there are errors, but all in all they are doing a very good job.</p>

					 mill dogs and identify puppy mills in their areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of dogs need loving homes. Adopting helps

					 adopted into her new home.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OSPCA is headquartered in the northern end of my
					 riding. Over the summer it took in well over 200 dogs and puppies from puppy
					 mills. As a charitable organization the society's work is funded entirely by

	Mr. Speaker, in the wake of September 11 we have heard
					 a growing number of voices of moral equivalence in Canada from anti-American
					 diatribes aired in ridiculously unbalanced CBC forums, to left wing
					 editorialists like Haroon Siddiqui suggesting that the Americans got what was

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be clear that there is no room for this kind of
					 moral relativism in the face of September 11. The root cause of this terror is
					 hatred, particularly a virulent strain of anti-semitism. When referring to

	Mr. Speaker, I should like to recognize the

					 It works every day, even Christmas Day, to bring Canadians essential
					 information: weather forecasts, warnings of severe storms, smog alerts, and

					 warnings can save lives and its smog alerts safeguard our health.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today marks the 130th anniversary of the Meteorological
					 Service of Canada which was created in 1871 when Canada was still a fledgling
					 nation. Its purpose then was to safeguard ships from severe storms in the Great
					 Lakes and on the St. Lawrence River. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the most basic level it used and still uses
					 volunteer observers in all parts of Canada with stations near people's homes,
					 on farms and campuses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early weather forecasts used telegraph lines and
					 hoisted flags to warn of an approaching storm. Since then its work has expanded
					 across the country. Its tools now include computers and satellite
					 transmissions. Its scope has broadened to include many types of environmental
					 information.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, in trying to explain this past week's drug
					 purchasing fiasco, the health minister has referred to the many versions of
					 events. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are used to many versions of Liberal drug
					 patent policy. Before being elected in 1993 they were vehemently opposed to the
					 Mulroney drug patent extension and vowed to reverse it. The post-election
					 version, however, saw them extending it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was the new version in 1997 election and the
					 promise of a national drug plan. Then there was the version that ended up as
					 Bill S-17 extending patent protection again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no wonder the health minister got confused last
					 week. He did not remember which version he was on. The NDP version of what
					 needs to happen is that instead of having a contest between the Liberals, the
					 Alliance, the Bloc and the Tories as to who worships property rights more than
					 public health and who is better friends with the drug industry, the law in
					 question should be changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If September 11 has changed everything, perhaps it is
					 time to change our drug patent law.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is delighted to
					 highlight today the historic agreement reached between the government of Quebec
					 and the Cree. This agreement establishes a new relationship, nation to
					 nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand chief of the Grand Council of the Crees, Ted
					 Moses, said “With this agreement, a new relationship will be established
					 between Quebec and the Cree. This relationship will be built on trust and
					 mutual respect. Some may think that this relationship is impossible. We will
					 prove them wrong”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this agreement, based on dialogue, all legal
					 proceedings instituted by the Cree against the government of Quebec are
					 dropped. Those involving the federal government, however, remain in
					 effect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strengthening of the Cree's economic control over
					 their future, this enhanced dialogue, obvious mutual respect and more modern
					 partnership between the Cree nation and the Quebec nation point the way to the

	Mr. Speaker, the minister of agriculture gives the
					 impression to many Canadians that he is dealing responsibly with the farm
					 crisis and the drought experienced this summer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing could be further from the truth. He has stood
					 in the House and told farmers that there are programs available to them, but he
					 neglects to mention that they do not work and are not properly
					 funded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the minister says that crop insurance
					 should soften the effects of the drought, but the province of Saskatchewan has
					 requested $200 million to cover the shortfall for this year. The minister
					 responds to these desperate needs saying that he is waiting to see how the
					 programs work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers cannot wait. There should be the biggest payout
					 in years, yet these programs are not even covering their input costs. CFIP and
					 AIDA do not help those farmers who need them most.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talks about his programs but it is all hot
					 air. They do not work and are not properly funded. We have already had enough
					 hot air on the prairies with the drought this summer. We need some action
					 now.</p>

					 C-11, it was going to prevent many of these things. In other words, a lot of
					 people who managed to get in by the back door did not take the front door. We
					 are going to speed up the process in the future with Bill C-11, which will
					 prevent a lot of people from exploiting the system by coming in through the
					 back door.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of the measures proposed by the member are
					 already in existence. They will be even better under Bill C-11. It is just a
					 question of time before we get all the aspects together and then we will be
					 able to do a better job.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my
					 colleague, the member for Cypress Hills--Grasslands. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heightened anxiety and concern that Canadians have
					 been feeling at the threat of terrorism is natural at this time, especially
					 since we know what has been happening in the United States can virtually happen
					 anywhere. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our citizens need to know their government is taking
					 the necessary legislative steps to combat international terrorism. With the
					 introduction of the comprehensive anti-terrorism bill last week some of these
					 concerns have been addressed. However much work remains to be done,
					 particularly in the area of immigration and border control. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the government has attempted to brush off
					 suggestions that we have a terrorist problem by pointing to the fact that none
					 of the September 11 hijackers appear to have significant Canadian connections.
					 However this argument ignores the fact that we have known for years that Canada
					 has a major problem with terrorists using our country as a base for their
					 activities abroad. This is a fact stated in the June 2000 CSIS report, in
					 reports from national defence and by officials representing American
					 intelligence agencies, the FBI and the CIA. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can only ask why these terrorists would want to
					 attack Canadian locations when they can safely use Canada as a staging point
					 for their international criminal operations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As friends and allies, we also owe our American
					 neighbours some measure of protection from security risks beginning in Canada.
					 There is no question that the Americans are very concerned about who is
					 entering from their northern border, and justifiably so. They have already
					 tripled the number of agents patrolling the Canadian-American border, a move
					 that indicates they are extremely concerned about what measures we have or
					 rather do not have in place on our side of the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The B.C. premier, Gordon Campbell, in a move supported
					 by all other premiers but two, has called for a serious discussion with the
					 United States about a continental perimeter that would protect the security
					 interests of both countries and allow for the free movement of people and trade
					 between them. The idea of harmonizing our laws and anti-terrorism operations is
					 necessary if we are to continue a positive relationship with our most important
					 trading partner. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government's response so far on this issue
					 has been to hide behind arguments that harmonizing immigration and refugee laws
					 would be an infringement on our sovereignty and the core values of Canadians.
					 Unfortunately, the Liberal government is trying to define Canadian by what is
					 not American. However we have to think beyond this narrow scope and define our
					 nation on our own terms. We must work together with all western leaders,
					 linking our arms with a common strategy and with a common goal of defeating
					 terrorism, not by simplistically defining our terrain with a line drawn in the
					 sand. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years it has been obvious to Canadians, it
					 certainly has been obvious to members of the Canadian Alliance caucus, that the
					 Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has had no serious thoughts of
					 addressing the issue of terrorists entering and remaining in Canada via the
					 refugee determination system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A January 1999 report of a special senate committee on
					 security and intelligence stated what most Canadian already know, that there
					 are several indications that serious problems with our refugee determination
					 system exist. Among the serious problems reported were the number of claimants
					 who disappear, the perception that our system is leaky and our enforcement
					 system is overwhelmed and the perception that it is in the claimant's interest
					 not to comply with our immigration rules, terms and conditions. Indeed, what
					 the report states is that it is in the interests of claimant's to use criminal
					 procedures to get into our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has done
					 nothing to enhance training for customs officers. She has done nothing to give
					 the appropriate resources to law enforcement officials. She has done nothing to
					 detain refugee claimants who cannot prove their identities. She has failed to
					 promptly deport refugee claimants who break the law in Canada.</p>


	<A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1515)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing the minister has done is she has
					 attempted to deflect criticism from Canada's ridiculously open system by
					 calling those who have constructive suggestions on how the system can be
					 improved, anti-immigrant. It is statements like these that desperately
					 demonstrate the minister's failure to carry out her
					 responsibilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After years of inaction, last week she finally
					 announced new, allegedly fraud proof identity cards for landed immigrants to be
					 implemented next year. Unfortunately, terrorism and immigration experts already
					 consider these new cards obsolete as they are not likely to pose any problem
					 for terrorists intending to forge or reproduce them. The cards issued will not
					 contain the security features, such as imbedded fingerprints already found on
					 the U.S. green card, or iris identification.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publicly available polling indicates Canadians
					 recognize that these tracking features are necessary even if the minister and
					 her department do not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond tracking capabilities, we must also have the
					 means to detain those who wish to criminally abuse our refugee and immigration
					 systems, those who arrive at our shores without proper documentation every
					 year. Most, if not all, of the terrorists who have entered the country have
					 done so by criminally using our generous refugee system. This was confirmed
					 officially when the RCMP told a conference on October 17 that the modus
					 operandi of all international terrorists entering Canada was, first, to claim
					 refugee status and then, to move on to obtain welfare and medical benefits
					 before turning to crime to boost their income.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the minister can continue to deny this fact in
					 light of such evidence remains a great mystery to me. Certainly she has the
					 evidence of her own security agencies, including the RCMP, to tell her very
					 clearly that she has a problem and that the steps she is taking are not
					 adequate?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would call on all members of the House
					 today to recognize that significant improvements must immediately be made in
					 terms of our border laws by voting in favour of the motion.</p>

					 Hills—Grasslands, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity this
					 afternoon to discuss customs and immigration issues. Canada has an obligation
					 to encourage immigration. Having been given what we have in Canada it is only
					 right to welcome refugees and immigrants to our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Canadians are descended from immigrants. My
					 grandparents on my father's side came from Scandinavia. They looked for a
					 country where they could have new opportunities. They looked at Canada and
					 decided to come here. My mother decided in the 1950s that she would like to
					 come to Canada. She emigrated from Scotland. She came here as a midwife and
					 became a nurse. We all have immigration in our history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to have immigration we have an obligation to
					 do a good job. I will ask a couple of questions this afternoon about whether we
					 are doing a good job with our immigration policies. First, if we think we are
					 doing a good job, could we not ask people in the general public what they think
					 of our immigration policies? If we went to the public I am sure people would
					 say our immigration policies are complicated and difficult to understand and
					 that no one knows what the rules are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People do come here. Last year 225,000 people tried to
					 immigrate to Canada, 35,000 of whom claimed refugee status. People come here to
					 stay because it is a good place to live and a safe place to live. We would like
					 to keep it that way. I will take a few minutes to look at the present
					 legislation to see if it would make Canada a safe place to live.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-11 has been introduced and is going through the
					 process of becoming legislation. It seems well intentioned. My mother has a
					 Scottish saying that members may be familiar with. She says the road to hell is
					 paved with good intentions. This could be the government's statement of purpose
					 on immigration legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-11 tries to make the system workable but the
					 government refuses to provide enough staff to make it workable. Bill C-11 tries
					 to speed up refugee processing, or at least as the public sees it. The
					 government's target includes referring refugees to the Immigration and Refugee
					 Board within three days. However its processing time continues to be 90 days,
					 the same as it has always been.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not address issues like out of date
					 health standards or accountability of appointments, those of citizenship judges
					 in particular. However the real problem with the immigration legislation is the
					 problem at the heart of the Liberal government: it has no accountability.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are more concerned about the application of
					 the present law than about having new laws. If people can come here, do damage
					 and try to destroy the country, it justifiably causes fear among Canadians
					 about what they may be doing. Montreal detective Claude Paquette said our
					 porous immigration laws have turned Canada into “a Club Med for terrorists”.
					 CSIS head Ward Elcock has said that with perhaps the singular exception of the
					 United States there are more international terrorist groups active in Canada
					 than in any other country. This is a poor place to be second.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I rode in a taxi from the airport with a
					 young gentleman who was concerned about the things going on around the world.
					 He was from the Middle East. He said he came to Canada to have peace, not to
					 have the dangers of that world come here. Canadians want to be safe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are concerned that the system has been
					 corrupted. We need to look at some of the major concerns Canadians have about
					 failed political candidates being given appointments and jobs in the
					 immigration system, a system in which immigration lawyers stand to make large
					 amounts of money from people who cannot afford it, a system in which corrupt
					 immigration advisers often try to take people's money away before they get to
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with these problems the Canadian Alliance has
					 some suggestions. First, we need to take a serious look at a common perimeter
					 security system with the United States. This is a simple and real opportunity
					 to improve security for both Canadians and Americans. Simply put, it would
					 increase security at our entry points. People cannot swim to this country. They
					 come in through airports and the ports where our ships dock. We need a common
					 perimeter security system.</p>


	<A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1520)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we need a perimeter security system? We need it
					 for a couple of reasons. First, we need it for our own security and safety.
					 This is the first duty of the federal government. Second, the United States has
					 announced it will be requiring everyone leaving and entering that country to
					 register when they do so. This will be done for several reasons. It will be
					 done partly as a trade restriction, something we do not particularly
					 need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of weeks ago one of the senators from North
					 Dakota began using the security issue to try again to restrict agricultural
					 products coming into the United States. Some of their bureaucrats and
					 politicians are trying to use the issue to restrict things like softwood lumber
					 and the ability of Canadians to work in the United States. We need to be aware
					 that the United States is concerned about its own security. If we do not have a
					 secure perimeter and cannot be trusted at our borders we will not be able to
					 get through the U.S. border easily.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a second suggestion for the government. It
					 should detain refugee claimants until it has properly identified them. That is
					 common sense. We cannot simply let people go and collect their baggage when
					 they arrive at and leave our airports. The Canadian people do not realize how
					 the system is operating right now or they would be rising up and criticizing
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrivals need to have verifiable documentation so the
					 proper checks can be done. It is easy to do security and background checks on
					 people who have the correct documentation. However those without verifiable
					 documentation or who are questionable should be detained until we know whether
					 they are safe. If they prove not to be safe they should be deported. Canadians
					 do not find that unreasonable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some examples where stricter standards should
					 have been applied. A convicted PLO terrorist lied to get into Canada. He
					 currently lives in Brantford, Ontario, and has lived there since 1987. He is a
					 failed refugee claimant but continues to avoid deportation through court
					 appeals. If the government cannot deport a terrorist, whom can it
					 deport?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Toronto man who works at a grocery store has been
					 positively linked to Osama bin Laden. He has been identified as a high ranking
					 member of the Islamic terrorist group al-Jihad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahmed Ressam, a failed refugee claimant, assembled bomb
					 material in Burnaby, B.C., and tried to get into the United States. While he
					 was fighting the Canadian refugee process it was discovered he was allowed to
					 travel abroad for more terrorist training before returning to
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A former terrorist wanted for questioning by the FBI
					 for assisting in the bombing of an Egyptian embassy in the late 1980s is living
					 in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many other terrorists are hiding in Canada? One of
					 the biggest concerns of Canadians is that the present inadequate screening
					 system cannot tell them that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more bizarre examples of this occurred on
					 October 7 when a plane arrived at Toronto's Pearson airport with an estimated
					 30 to 40 refugees from Pakistan and Afghanistan who had come through Germany, a
					 safe third country. These people, I would suggest, were not refugees but rather
					 immigrants. They were processed and released into the general public and
					 immigration officials lost them. Where are they? More important, who are they?
					 People cannot just disappear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration Canada has been left with insufficient
					 resources to track these people down. Does the government have the will to
					 protect Canadians, either at the beginning of the immigration process or when
					 things go wrong?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Thompson of the Mackenzie Institute, a Toronto
					 based strategic think tank, says CSIS, our security agencies, immigration
					 officers and police officers cannot act because they do not have the resources
					 or the will behind them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a couple of suggestions regarding customs.
					 First, one of the ways to deal with the problems is to make customs officials
					 full law enforcement officers. The government cannot decide what they are right
					 now. They are expected to protect our borders but are only given the tools to
					 be tax collectors. If our first line of defence is to be our customs officials
					 let us give them sidearms and the equipment they need. If they are only to be
					 tax collectors let us give them calculators.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a huge concern that customs officials are left
					 without the proper training. In larger centres they are getting some training
					 but in smaller ones they have less access to the RCMP and little access to
					 police support. They do not have access to quick response training and are
					 often left out of the training schedule, especially lately regarding pepper
					 spray and the use of batons. The people who most need protection and training
					 are the last to get it. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to be here today to speak about the role of
					 the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and about the fact that our customs
					 officers must be well trained to carry out their duties.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to clarify for my hon. colleagues and
					 members opposite that the customs component of CCRA is not a police force but
					 rather a border agency that administers the Customs Act and 70 other acts and
					 regulations on behalf of other government departments and agencies.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Confederation, the Department of National
					 Revenue, now the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, has been responsible for
					 collecting revenues for the Canadian government. Initially, it collected
					 customs and excise duties. Later on, it began to collect individual and
					 corporate income taxes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, however, the mandate and activities of
					 the department, which is now an agency, evolved significantly, largely in
					 response to the new requirements of its clients.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, the agency collects 95% of federal
					 revenues. Customs officers continue to collect customs and excise duties, to
					 gather important import and export data, and to check the shipments and
					 manifests of travellers and commodities. The agency also has a mandate to
					 ensure a level international playing field for Canadian companies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, 111 million Canadians and 11 million
					 commercial shipments from over 160,000 importers cross our border. The majority
					 of these travellers and clients are honest and law-abiding. Accordingly, they
					 must be processed quickly and efficiently. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is, however, true that a few of these
					 travellers and trade missions represent threats to the health, security and
					 economic well-being of Canadians. We must be vigilant in order to detect and
					 counter these threats. This was our reality before September 11 and it remains
					 so today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandate of customs within the agency is clear. It
					 continues to be to protect the health and security of Canadians and to
					 facilitate the flow of eligible travellers and trade missions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commerce and trade form the cornerstone of Canada's
					 economy, and customs is the key to their vitality and continuity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure Canada's continued prosperity and security, I
					 released the customs action plan in April 2000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In proposing innovative solutions to today's problems,
					 the plan ensures that our customs' processes will not stand in the way of
					 Canadians' prosperity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action plan, which Bill S-23 will implement,
					 provides for a complete risk management system integrating the principles of
					 pre-arrival data input and a system of prior approval, all thanks to
					 technology.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the result of the events of September 11, it is all
					 the more important to put this plan into action. It is vital to meeting the
					 challenges facing us, including that of maintaining heightened security and
					 ensuring economic stability at the same time.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk based processes contained in the plan are even
					 more crucial to the security of Canada. With a few adjustments, I am proceeding
					 rapidly to implement these changes so that our country remains safe while we
					 keep its economy in good shape. The adjustments we plan to make involve the
					 acceleration of several security related initiatives which will provide for $21
					 million for new technologies and increased staff at our airports and seaports.
					 Our focus on airports and seaports is necessary given the increased risk that
					 exists at our external borders from threats such as terrorism and
					 drugs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to proceed with the implementation we have
					 secured all party support for Bill S-23, which is the foundation for this plan.
					 It includes, for example, new authorities for strengthening security at our
					 airports by allowing us to receive advance information on passengers. With the
					 legislation in place we would be able to proceed rapidly with the
					 implementation of new services that Canadians need and deserve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an investment we have made in a smarter border;
					 however, this alone is not enough. Not only do we have to accelerate the
					 protection initiatives, we must also expand our activities with the U.S. to
					 merge best practices and develop common programs. Canada and the U.S. need to
					 have joint risk based programs at the land border and co-ordinated approaches
					 at the external border. This would lead to dramatic efficiencies for commercial
					 trade and strengthened defences against terrorism at our international airports
					 and seaports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior officials have already met to look at what we
					 can do together to meet the challenges of our dual mandate of protection and
					 facilitation of trade and travel. As I mentioned before in the House, trade and
					 tourism are the lifeblood of our economy and customs is a key component in
					 ensuring their vitality and continuity. While our dual mandate of protection
					 and competitiveness may seem distinct and unconnected, they are in fact very
					 much related.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customs process is a continuum of linked activities
					 that extend from admissibility decisions and examinations performed by customs
					 officers at the border to post-release verification activities. This continuum
					 is critical to the effective functioning of the customs program. The joint
					 effort of all customs personnel is required to effectively assess and respond
					 to risks posed by goods and people entering and exiting Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the customs program, the agency is responsible
					 for identifying inadmissible people, prohibited goods and controlled strategic
					 goods. In addition to detecting and interdicting contraband and inadmissible
					 people, customs inspectors are also instrumental in ensuring the administration
					 of a wide area of trade related legislation governing the transborder movement
					 of goods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in order to protect the health and safety
					 of Canadians, inspectors: refer agricultural products and other commercial
					 goods for inspection; sample denatured alcohol, other chemicals and gasoline;
					 control the entry of dangerous goods such as hazardous waste; and refer goods
					 for inspection that must meet Canadian standards.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said on a number of occasions in the House,

					 Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate
					 regarding Canada Customs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is a border
					 agency that manages the Customs Act and customs duties and regulations on
					 behalf of the Canadian government. However, Canada Customs is not a police
					 force. It has the important mandate of protecting the health, safety and
					 security of Canadians and at the same ensuring that trade and travel flow
					 freely at the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one and a half years the Canada Customs and Revenue
					 Agency has worked on the new customs action plan. It will modernize our customs
					 system by introducing pre-approval programs for businesses and travellers. It
					 has a dual mandate for trade and passengers so we can expedite low risk
					 travellers and goods and focus on high risk shipments and
					 passengers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CCRA is responsible for identifying inadmissible
					 people and prohibiting illegal material such as drugs, firearms, obscene
					 material and hate literature. We all know that the customs officers work on the
					 front lines at the border. They have to specialize in the work and be specially
					 trained. They are always peace officers with the power to detain and arrest
					 individuals who commit illegal acts under the Customs Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the Minister of National Revenue and I, with a
					 team, visited the Douglas border crossing in B.C. It is a very busy area. One
					 of the officers in a booth at the crossing demonstrated the computer technology
					 used to pre-screen low risk car passengers to facilitate faster movement at the
					 border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of Bill S-23 in the House we would be
					 able to apply specialized technologies to improve our security measures at the
					 seaports, airports and land border crossings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCRA will introduce a new customs action plan with
					 public support. Recently customs received additional funding of $12 million for
					 the application of new technologies and $9 million for an additional 130
					 customs officers with special training.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs has an excellent state of the art training
					 program which enables our officers to carry out their duties professionally and
					 safely. CCRA has many dedicated and hard working officers to serve Canadians at
					 the border, airports and seaports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency will continue to
					 serve Canadians as an innovative leader and a valuable partner. It is an
					 organization that is essential to the government. I do hope my colleagues in
					 the House will support Bill S-23.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary for

					 amount of business we do every day with the United States and how important the
					 open border is to Canadians in terms of standard of living. I would like to ask
					 the parliamentary secretary, because she is from Vancouver, if she has had
					 discussions with the port authority in Vancouver to talk about issues such as
					 the container business, which is of vital importance to the city of
					 Vancouver.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the container business that makes Vancouver the
					 first port of call for a lot of container traffic, traffic that has tripled in
					 volume over the last seven years. How does the government intend to deal with
					 security issues that the United States has with Canada in order to make sure
					 that we can maintain the flow of container business into the United States in
					 terms of having it pre-inspected by U.S. authorities so that it does not need
					 to have an inspection again? How will we meet the security concerns the
					 Americans have in order to facilitate that and maintain the amount of product
					 shipped to the United States out of the port of Vancouver?</p>

					 George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the
					 member for Peace River. I rise on behalf of the people of Prince
					 George--Bulkley Valley and indeed all Canadians who are concerned about their
					 safety and security subsequent to the terrorist attacks of September 11 and
					 some of the attacks that have taken place since that date.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the official opposition have been imploring the
					 government to come up with a plan which will assure Canadians that their
					 communities, streets and buildings will be safe wherever they go in Canada. We
					 have been asking the government to make the official opposition and all other
					 opposition parties in the House part of that plan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government to date has refused to do that. As a
					 matter of fact, for a great many days following the September 11 attacks the
					 government was in virtual denial that Canada was at threat or could be at
					 threat. It has only been recently that the government has actually recognized
					 the fact that as an ally to the U.S. and other western countries and as a
					 member of NATO we are at threat. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the safety and security of our
					 families and our communities, the government needs something to give Canadians
					 which will make them feel the government has a handle on the very present
					 threat. It has not done that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to draw an analogy for a moment. We know from
					 the evidence presented that people associated with terrorist organizations are
					 living or have lived in Canada. There is ample evidence. I have some quotes
					 that I will read from CSIS and from police departments. We know they are here.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through its departments and its authorities the
					 government has a responsibility to search these people out and hold them
					 accountable for whatever activity in which they have been involved. If that
					 means illegal activities in Canada, they would be tried under Canadian laws. If
					 it means they have come from another country where they have been involved in
					 terrorist activity and are subject to extradition, the government should be
					 co-operating to the fullest extent with the countries seeking their
					 extradition. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like cleaning up the nest. We should be doing
					 that aggressively as a government because of the very real threat. If at the
					 same time we are not taking measures to protect the perimeters of our country
					 from more people coming into Canada, which in this case is the borders between
					 Canada and the U.S. as well as the complete North American perimeter, the clean
					 up job within will go on forever. The government has not put forward anything
					 substantive to protect the perimeters of the country. That is what this supply
					 day motion is all about. It starts out as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

						  perimeter initiative to secure Canada's borders and protect the security of

						  officers enhanced training and full peace officer status to allow them to
						  detain and arrest suspected criminals or terrorists at the border;</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot do that now.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard in the House over the last couple of
					 weeks that border guards cannot detain people whom they suspect of being either
					 terrorists or involved in terrorist activity. They need to phone a police
					 department somewhere to come and arrest them. That is very
					 inefficient.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have called on the government to move customs border
					 officers out of tax collection. We know the Liberals love to collect taxes and
					 this really goes against their grain. I am sure the former minister of national
					 revenue cringes when I talk about taking people out of tax
					 collection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a time of crisis like this one when we have a
					 terrorist threat, would it not be logical to move these customs border officers
					 out of tax collection and put them into a law enforcement department so that
					 they would have expanded powers to deal with real threats?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure people trying to sneak across $200 worth of
					 cigarettes that they are not allowed to bring across the border must be low in
					 priority as compared to trying to detain and arrest someone who is maybe a
					 terrorist threat to our country or to the U.S.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also call on the government to take steps to detain
					 all spontaneous refugee claimants appearing without proper documentation. This
					 is not rocket science. It happens in many other countries. They should be
					 detained until their identities are confirmed and they have cleared proper
					 health and security checks. What is wrong with that?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are logical steps that a government which
					 recognizes there is a threat in the country would take, but it has not taken
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to safe third countries including the
					 United States and members states of the European Union from which Canada will
					 no longer accept refugee claimants. If people are fleeing from a country where
					 they feel they are being persecuted or they are in danger to a safe country,
					 why are they not seeking asylum or refugee status in countries that are members
					 of the United Nations protocol on refugee claimants? Many people who come from
					 another country into a safe country and use it as a stepping stone to Canada
					 have ulterior motives. We have seen that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a couple of quotes that will not be a
					 surprise:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Canada is almost a welcome wagon for
						  crime. Here it is much lower risk of detention and prosecution than in the
						  United States and Europe. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not a surprise. It was stated by an expert on
					 organized crime. Here is another statement referring to Canada:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>With perhaps the singular exception
						  of the United States there are more international terrorist groups active here
						  than in any other country of the world</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this written by someone who does not know? This is a
					 statement by CSIS head Ward Elcock on March 3, 2000. It goes on and on and
					 on:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Many of the world's terrorist groups
						  have a presence in Canada where they are engaged in a variety of activities in
						  support of terrorism including logistical support.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is from another CSIS report. That is the agency
					 which is supposed to advise the government if there is a threat from things
					 like terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountains of evidence indicates that Canada has been a
					 haven for criminals from other countries who have come here to commit criminal
					 acts, including people who are associated with terrorist cells. They come to
					 Canada because it is a wonderful place to work from. Despite all the evidence
					 that has been presented to the government, it has been in denial. It has been
					 acting in the most Pollyanna way possible: everything is all right; we will
					 just hope that it goes away and for sure it will.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have asked the government to allow us to be part of
					 dealing with this real threat to the country. We are taking this initiative
					 among many others to be part of it. Will the government let us be and will it
					 adopt our supply day motion?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if it struck the member as it certainly struck
					 me. He mentioned the Pollyanna attitude, the constant denial from the Liberal
					 side of the House that there is any problem. The Minister of Finance went to a
					 fundraising deal. CSIS warned him it was a problem but he still went. Now we
					 have denial. They will not even mention CSIS warnings about the number of

					 put the RCMP in the national parks to protect the bears from people feeding

					 Canada-U.S. border is of vital importance to the Canadian economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an understatement to say that the events of
					 September 11 changed everything. We must accept that things are radically
					 different and that business as usual is not what it used to be. We must move
					 quickly to develop appropriate strategies to move forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key challenges facing governments in Canada
					 and the U.S. today is how to best balance the need for increased security with
					 the need to keep the economy moving. The new security concerns must be
					 addressed, while allowing commerce, goods and people access to the North
					 American market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is at risk if we do not adequately address the
					 perimeter security issue and come up with a new border protocol?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians understand that a new border protocol must be
					 established to safeguard our standard of living. Fully one-third of the
					 country's GDP is dependent upon trade with the U.S. Trade between the U.S. and
					 Canada represents more than $1.9 billion a day in business across that border.
					 According to the Canadian Trucking Alliance, a freight truck crosses the
					 Canada-U.S. border every three seconds. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the border was suddenly closed in the wake of
					 September 11, Canadians and Americans became painfully aware of our reliance on
					 the easy border transit. In a matter of hours, trucks were lined up for
					 kilometres at border crossings across the country and the industrial and
					 commercial interests of both of our countries felt the pinch. That is what is
					 called an integrated society in business, which we have in so many areas
					 between Canada and the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many industries, the auto industry in particular,
					 operate on a just in time delivery system. Goods arrive by truck timed so they
					 can enter the production process hours after being received. It is only hours,
					 not days and months. Otherwise, whole assembly operations can be shut down and
					 people sent home, something we witnessed after September 11. For businesses
					 operating on a just in time delivery system, the border runs right through the
					 middle of their auto assembly lines. The fear is that Americans will buy U.S.
					 made components instead of waiting for Canadian parts that are stuck at the
					 border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some foreign buyers have even demanded consignment
					 inventories which will be financed by the selling company right up to the point
					 where the buyer uses the goods, a direct increase in costs. In some cases, they
					 are demanding that there be a big build up of inventory to offset for any
					 slowdown at the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business groups and provincial governments have made it
					 clear that the preservation and efficient and secure trade across the border
					 must be the number one business issue for the government. They have other
					 concerns, like high taxes and low productivity, but they have said this is the
					 number one issue that needs to be addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight provincial premiers and two territorial
					 governments have signed B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell`s letter to the Prime
					 Minister, which called for a continental security perimeter around North
					 America by sharing information and collaborating to address all the aspects of
					 the border, including security, immigration, trade and the movement of people
					 and infrastructure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of nearly 50 Canadian business associations and
					 companies have joined forces behind the perimeter concept and are calling
					 themselves the Coalition for a Secure and Trade Efficient Border. They are
					 talking to their U.S. counterparts and demanding an indepth discussion on the
					 border between the two countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the current difficulties at the border,
					 the coalition is concerned that the failure to ensure an open trading climate
					 will result in significant future investments bypassing Canada and locating in
					 the United States. Why would a business establish in Canada when 80% of their
					 production is going into the United States, if the border will be a problem for
					 them in terms of delays? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have good reason to be nervous. The president of
					 Honda Motor Company has said the Japanese company may have to revise its North
					 American strategy, which has industry analysts warning that Honda's statement
					 could foreshadow a move to direct future investment into the United States at
					 the expense of Canada. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked about the port of Vancouver. It is concerned
					 that tighter controls at the U.S. border pose a threat to the port's viability
					 as a North American gateway, which by the way, was a hard won victory for the
					 port of Vancouver not too long ago. It was chosen as the first port of call for
					 container ships coming in from China, containers that make their way to Chicago
					 and other U.S. destinations by CN and CP Rail on another just in time delivery
					 basis. It is concerned that if there are delays at the border, Vancouver may
					 not be the port of call in the future. It may shift to Seattle because of the
					 tight timing that is needed to deliver product.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those fast, reliable rail connections to the U.S.
					 mid-west are in jeopardy. Canadian National Railways has similar concerns to
					 CP, because 52% of CN's business goes across the border into the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more ominous, the commissioner of the U.S.
					 immigration and naturalization services told the American senate just the other
					 day that he plans to impose an entry-exit regime as part of the U.S. plan to
					 beef up its borders. Under this system visitors will be required to be
					 interviewed by U.S. customs agents and have their names recorded and confirmed
					 when they enter or leave the United States. Canada fought off a similar measure
					 two years ago, but after September 11 this will be much more difficult to
					 avoid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously an entry-exit system would create enormous
					 backlogs at the Canadian border. This is precisely what Canadian businesses
					 have been worried about and why they are urging the government to start
					 immediately on bilateral negotiations to discuss the security
					 issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the plans for the Prime Minister to meet with
					 the American and Mexican presidents to discuss a common security arrangement in
					 North America. However, I wish he would meet with the business groups in Canada
					 and his provincial counterparts before the meeting so that he can understand
					 fully the gravity of this situation. What is at stake is the Canadian standard
					 of living. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that in the current context it will not be
					 possible to begin negotiations on strategies to eliminate border disruptions
					 unless the Government of Canada takes immediate steps to address U.S. security
					 concerns. That is the way the U.S. can send a strong message to Canada that it
					 will not allow terrorists to come into the U.S. via Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent steps, such as the creation of a cabinet
					 committee to oversee domestic security issues, are steps in the right
					 direction. However, this is not the time for foot dragging. The Liberal
					 government does not seem to like the word perimeter. It raises the spectre of a
					 bogeyman in some parts of the cabinet and caucus across the way. The normally
					 sensible Minister of Foreign Affairs has branded the concept simplistic without
					 bothering to flesh it out or even hear it. The Americans are talking about it
					 and if we do not start to listen, the border will be closed down or delayed for
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Business Council
					 on National Issues, the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, the Canadian
					 Federation of Independent Business, the Canadian Trucking Association, the Rail
					 Association of Canada, as well as American business groups and the U.S.
					 ambassador call on the government to listen carefully to these voices.
					 Canadians recognize that our naive border and refugee determination process is
					 part of the problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has long enjoyed many benefits due to our
					 geographic, political and economic proximity to the United States. Now it is
					 time to take our responsibilities seriously to ensure that continues to be the
					 case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had a 30% difference in lower productivity than
					 the United States over the last 30 years. Our Canadian dollar has been sliding
					 over that same period. We are already behind in terms of competitiveness. We
					 cannot allow this border issue to put us any further behind or deny Canadian
					 businesses access to the United States market. A huge population, 275 million
					 people, need Canadian product, but they do not need it so bad that they will
					 sacrifice security concerns to get it. They will start to source elsewhere if
					 we do not react. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ball is completely in the government's court. It
					 has to make sure that our standard of living is maintained by addressing the
					 security concerns that the United States have, as well as the very big concerns
					 that Canadians have that their safety is not being jeopardized.</p>

					 Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened closely to the hon. member for
					 Peace River. It is obvious from his comments that he has not been following
					 what Canada has been doing in terms of our border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact , the hon. member probably is not aware of the
					 blueprint on customs which was done some two and a half or three years ago when
					 I was Minister of National Revenue. We wanted to use technologies at our
					 borders, use our resources in the high risk areas and make sure that we worked
					 with the Americans. Of course to do that we need to work with partnerships. We
					 need to make sure the Americans also are on board so we can talk about
					 protocols.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business community has worked on this and has said
					 that 40% of all the trade across our border is done with 100 companies. We were
					 working on a protocol so that those companies, after their drivers had gone
					 through security clearance, could drive across our borders, thereby improving
					 the movement of goods and services across the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member also knows we had the Canpass which put
					 people through a security check. Once their security was approved and once they
					 were considered very low risk, they could move back and forth across our
					 border. The problem was the Canpass only worked one way. One of the things in
					 which I was very much involved was to have a common pass. The Americans had
					 Instapass and we had Canpass. I wanted to have a common criteria so we could
					 work together with the Americans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of work was done on that. I visited my colleagues
					 in the states to work together in partnership. Our border system was made
					 pre-free trade and we had to move to post-free trade so that we could have
					 protocols, use technologies and improve the movement of goods and services
					 across the border. Unfortunately at that time the Americans were not as
					 motivated as we were to adopt some of these new technologies, to move forward,
					 to sign agreements and to sign protocols so that we truly could have movement
					 of goods and services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that members on that side of the House
					 and the hon. member have not been following this. He has not watched what has
					 been going on. If he wanted go back we could give him the material that was
					 completed. We would be happy to give him more documents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the member looked at the blueprint for customs that
					 was done some two and a half years ago? That is exactly what it talks about;
					 the movement of goods and services across the border.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am happy to address that issue. There
					 was substantial work done. We do not deny that, but we are very concerned. The
					 member does not seem to realize that all the work that was done is now in
					 jeopardy because the government has neglected the security issues that have
					 concerned Americans for the full eight years it has been in office.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not just that the Liberals were misinformed.
					 Their priorities were in different areas. They chose to neglect the security
					 issues. They chose to ignore, underfund and cut back the budget of CSIS. They
					 chose to cut back the budget of the RCMP.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have one person in the country who has been here
					 since 1984. He came here illegally. He was involved in a hijacking in the
					 Middle East in 1971. He has never been able to be removed because of the appeal
					 process at immigration and the immigration industry that has been built up.
					 Those are the kinds of concerns that the Americans have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the good work that was done to develop border
					 protocol is now in jeopardy because the United States has said that if we do
					 not start to address the its security concerns, with 6,000 people killed by an
					 act of terrorism, it will stop us by shutting down or restricting our border.
					 So we better start to listen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the message I have for the minister across the
					 way. All the work that has been done is in jeopardy because of the neglect of
					 the government.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be dividing my time with the hon.
					 member for Halifax West. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take part in this debate. This is important
					 not only for the House but also for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. It
					 involves every individual and every family across the country in one way or
					 another.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not take very lightly the fact that over 87%
					 of our trade is done with our partner to the south, the United States, to the
					 tune of about $1.4 billion on a daily basis. The vast majority of that trade
					 crosses the border by truck or train. On the other side of the equation,
					 approximately 25% of American trade around the world is done with Canada. To a
					 large extent we need each other as trading partners as well as neighbours and
					 allies. We are countries that share common paths and interests, and a common
					 future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorist attacks on September 11 changed the way
					 we live and the way we conduct our business. Since September 11 I have asked
					 myself as a Canadian what I want my government to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost I want my government to have the
					 safety of Canadians as an objective. Second, I want to see what the government
					 plans to do about ensuring the safety of Canadians. Third, I want to see the
					 actual implementation of its plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of objectives, planning and implementation,
					 the government moved swiftly immediately after the September 11 tragedy. Within
					 minutes the Prime Minister was on the phone to the American authorities through
					 the embassy in order to communicate our concerns, our support and our strong
					 condemnation of what took place. As well, every single government department
					 was mobilized. A cabinet committee was established. The hon. member for Ottawa
					 South, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, is chair of that committee. He is doing
					 a magnificent job. The government established that committee to map out a
					 strategy and to plan a way to make Canadians feel safe and good about
					 themselves and feel secure when they go to their place of work. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning has taken place. Recently legislation was
					 introduced in the House. It is my hope that in the next week or so
					 implementation will take place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not fool ourselves. The best and the strongest
					 laws in the world will not save us from the terrorists from within unless we
					 are vigilant in our own society. Unless we have a secure society from within,
					 we will not be able to deal with this issue effectively. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has established a broad range of
					 initiatives that will deal with the security issue on the internal side of
					 things. We also have other responsibilities which deal with the issues that
					 confront us from the outside and that is the issue of the border. That is why
					 the motion by the Leader of the Opposition is before the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some major problems with the motion. If in
					 talking about the perimeter the member is talking about a cedar hedge around
					 Canada, the United States and Mexico, the answer is no. If he is talking about
					 a common strategy to deal with the issues that confront Canadians, Americans,
					 Mexicans and every member of the free world, yes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole issue is how we should deal with the threat
					 to our safety and security, and our sovereignty. The government has been
					 exceptionally open and co-operative with our friends and allies the Americans
					 in trying to deal with every aspect of the security issue that we have been
					 faced with since September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not fool ourselves by putting a motion such as
					 this one before the House. In paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the motion the opposition
					 wants the government to “provide both immigration officers and customs officers
					 enhanced training and full peace officer status”. Immigration officers and
					 customs officers already have peace officer status. This part of the motion not
					 only is out of order, it is irrelevant because we already have that. It is not
					 relevant at all. It is redundant because we already do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph (<i>b</i>) the opposition wants to “move
					 customs border officers out of the tax collection agency and into a law
					 enforcement agency”. I want to share with my colleagues the fact that our
					 customs officers enforce the Customs Act in addition to in excess of 70 other
					 acts from other departments of the Government of Canada. They have other
					 responsibilities as well. They ensure precisely the flow of goods and services
					 and the mobility of legitimate people across the border between the two
					 countries. That is specifically what they are there for. To move them away from
					 what they are already doing, in order to put them in another section with other
					 authorities frankly does not further the debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They already have authority under the act to identify
					 people who are inadmissible and to detain them. As well, under the act they
					 have the authority to stop the flow of prohibited goods, in particular chemical
					 precursors, drugs and other items. This part of the motion is redundant
					 too.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph (<i>c</i>) the opposition wants to “detain
					 all spontaneous refugee claimants appearing without proper documentation until
					 their identities are confirmed and they have cleared proper health and security
					 checks”. That is already done under the act. In fact in 2000-01 in excess of
					 8,000 refugees were detained at the border an average of 16 days until such
					 time as we were assured they did not pose a security threat to Canada.
					 Furthermore in 2000 in excess of 20,000 potential criminals coming from the
					 United States into Canada were stopped at the border as opposed to 14,000
					 criminals who were trying to cross the border from Canada into the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would wonder about the relevancy of the motion
					 before the House today. I close with paragraph (<i>d</i>) in which the
					 opposition wants to “create a list of safe third countries”. Under the act we
					 could do that now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these comments I cannot support the motion. I
					 will be voting against it.</p>

					 to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to comment on
					 the motion before the House. The issue of how we receive and treat refugee
					 claimants at our borders is one that has taken on a different sense of urgency
					 in the wake of the tragic events of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the world the terrorist attacks in the U.S.
					 forced a wrenching re-examination of many aspects of life and society long
					 taken for granted. In Canada, as elsewhere, we have been compelled to rethink
					 the ways in which our society functions. We are forced to carefully review and
					 question such fundamental issues as how we protect our society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the questioning and re-examination has
					 inevitably focused on how we deal with those who come to Canada as refugees.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the attacks of September 11
					 were virtually beyond our capacity to comprehend. How can we make sense of such
					 violence and callous disregard for innocent human life? Yes, we are shocked and
					 horrified by these events but we must not let the terrorists drive us to take
					 actions that result in a turning away from the very values that define us as
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of those values is our longstanding commitment to
					 welcome genuine refugees. Who we are as a people and as a nation has been
					 substantially defined by the contributions of those who have come to our shores
					 either as immigrants or as people fleeing injustice and persecution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strength as Canadians is directly tied to the
					 diversity of our society, a society that we have built together. Our world may
					 have become more threatened since September 11 but we must not allow the
					 current situation to lead us toward actions that we will later
					 regret.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then do we find a balance between ensuring that
					 Canada continues to welcome legitimate refugees while also ensuring the safety
					 and security of our society? That clearly is the challenge before us and the
					 challenge all Canadians want us to grapple with. This balance is reflected in
					 the government's new immigration and refugee protection act, Bill
					 C-11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new legislation, the refugee determination
					 process would be streamlined and it would enable departmental officials to
					 suspend and terminate the processing of refugee claims where persons are
					 determined to be a security threat. That is a very important change considering
					 what happened last month.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Immigration Act authorized detention of a
					 person considered a danger to the public or one who was unlikely to appear for
					 immigration proceedings. Existing authorities also permit the targeted use of
					 detention at a port of entry in cases where an individual's identity is in
					 question or where there are security concerns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures for 2000-01 show that some 8,790, almost 9,000,
					 persons last year were detained under the Immigration Act. These numbers attest
					 to the fact that our officials are being vigilant. We all, nevertheless,
					 recognize the imperative to make our processes work even better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-11 would also strengthen authority to arrest
					 criminals and those who pose security threats. In addition, it would eliminate
					 appeal rights in such cases and provide for a streamlined certificate process
					 to remove security threats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
					 outlined in her statement of October 12, the government is investing $49
					 million to strengthen the capacity of her department to do its job. This
					 includes $9 million for additional staff for key enforcement activities like
					 the examination and security screening at ports of entry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These additional employees will also be carrying out
					 detailed screening of refugee claimants who are already in Canada, along with
					 increasing detention and deportation.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This investment in the safety and security of Canadians
					 is part of an ongoing process. These new resources are in addition to ones
					 identified in the 2000 budget for the citizenship and immigration department,
					 funds targeted specifically for the enforcement program that is so important in
					 this climate and in light of what happened last month.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw the attention of hon. members opposite to the
					 $1.8 billion that have been invested by the government in key departments and
					 agencies, such as Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Canada Customs and
					 Revenue Agency, CSIS and the RCMP, since budget 2000. This investment took
					 place long before September 11, reflecting the government's commitment to
					 provide federal departments and agencies with the tools they need to fight
					 terrorism. This is a fight we must and will win.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next important step we can take toward that victory
					 is to pass the legislation when it is before the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understandably, Canadians are concerned in these
					 difficult times. We have entered into an era of world events without precedent
					 but we must avoid the temptation to allow our fears to overwhelm us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we heard from our leaders, it is important to go out
					 and shop and to go on with our normal lives. I read somewhere, and I think it
					 is true, that the return to normalcy is the greatest affront to terrorism. That
					 is the key. If we want to say no to terrorism, we have to live our normal
					 lives. We have to carry on and be courageous, maybe hug our kids more often. We
					 need to recognize the value and the preciousness of our lives more readily and
					 more completely but we also need to go on with our lives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are rising to the current challenge, as they
					 have done in other periods of difficulty and threat, as we have seen too often
					 in the past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are firm in our determination to work with the
					 United States and our other allies to overcome the threat of terrorism. We are
					 likewise determined to take the necessary steps that will increase the security
					 of our borders and the safety of our citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada has acted and will act to
					 protect Canadians. Bill C-11 is a major step in honouring this commitment.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could provide other examples of how this new
					 legislation can and will address the very issues that the opposition has raised
					 in its motion. However how we treat refugees and how we balance refugee claims
					 with the largest security concerns of our society, are matters of fundamental
					 importance. Let us not give the terrorists an additional triumph because we
					 choose to act out of fear. Let us not give in to the temptation to diminish our
					 commitment to welcome legitimate refugees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before us is neither necessary nor deserving
					 of support. Let us instead stay true to our commitment to compassion and the
					 values that define us as Canadians. Let us show the world that we have become
					 stronger because of the challenge we face.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my colleague noted the issue of terrorism,
					 how it has affected our country and the importance of getting on with business
					 as usual. I have to admit even I, who enjoys shopping to great lengths, found
					 it a bit much when the answer to fighting terrorism was that we should get out
					 and shop and it will make everything better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I do want to comment on the return to
					 normality which, quite frankly, is important, and so is the fight against
					 terrorism. My New Democrat colleagues and I strongly support the fight against
					 terrorism but we do have concerns over the anti-terrorism bill. We feel it
					 would very severely affect the civil rights of all Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that wish to return to normality, we want to see a
					 sunset clause put into the anti-terrorism bill. After hearing my colleague's
					 comments I had hope the member would also be willing to support such a clause
					 so that, in Canada, we can return to normality in civil liberties for all
					 Canadians.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, when my hon. colleague mentioned getting
					 out and shopping, it reminded me of a cartoon in one of the newspapers showing
					 a gentleman at home reading the paper and when his wife arrives with a bunch of
					 boxes he says “So how goes the war on terrorism?” My wife cut out the cartoon
					 and put it on our fridge at home because we both enjoyed it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my hon. colleague is right, in spite of the
					 levity of what happened it is very important for us to return to normalcy. We
					 must get on with our lives and get out and do our shopping. The greatest damage
					 terrorism could cause is if we as Canadians were so terrorized that we stayed
					 in our homes, that we did not go out, that we did not carry on with our lives
					 and that we did not do the things that keep our economy going. We must continue
					 purchasing, working, living our lives and going on vacations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of members of parliament travel on
					 airplanes all the time and I do not think we feel threatened by travelling on
					 airplanes. I think we have very safe airplanes and airports and a very good
					 system that has been improved in the last couple of months. That is very
					 important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to address the concerns my colleague mentioned
					 about the anti-terrorism bill, which of course is not part of today's
					 opposition day motion but I am cognizant that this is an issue we have been
					 hearing about. I know you are aware, Mr. Speaker, as is the hon. member, that
					 the Minister of Justice and the Prime Minister have indicated their openness to
					 hearing the views of the committee and members on this bill. It is important we
					 take the time to go through the bill. Obviously there is some sense of urgency
					 but at the same time we do not want too much urgency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to hear the concerns of members, to
					 debate the bill and to discuss in full the options or perhaps some alternatives
					 to the provisions proposed. The Prime Minister clearly indicated the other day
					 that this government bill was being presented and that it was supported.
					 However it is important to understand that an openness has been declared to
					 hear from the House and members about the kind of things the hon. member has
					 suggested she feels should be included in the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certainly looking forward to seeing how this
					 develops as the bill goes forward through committee, through report stage and
					 in the third reading debate before the House.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon.
					 member for Souris--Moose Mountain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to rise in the House today on behalf of
					 the people of Surrey Central on the opposition supply day motion regarding
					 border security. Surrey Central, the constituency I represent, is one of the
					 largest constituencies in Canada in population. It has a high population of
					 immigrants. Also it is in close proximity to the U.S. border, so I will be
					 making my remarks from the point of view of some practical experience and what
					 my constituents who come to my office tell me. Therefore it will be a more
					 practical point of view.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion asks the government to take action on a
					 number of policy fronts. Victory in this war against terrorism depends as much
					 on our immigration and border policies as it does on our defence, intelligence
					 and other policies. Specifically, the motion asks the government to protect our
					 borders and our trading relationships with the United States by providing
					 immigration and customs officers with full peace officer status in order to
					 allow them to detain and arrest suspected terrorists. It also asks the
					 government to move customs officers out of the CCRA into a law enforcement
					 agency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian customs officers not only process travellers
					 and commercial goods but also monitor and control the importation of firearms,
					 drugs and other goods. If they are to do their job of law enforcement they must
					 be given the resources, training and powers of law enforcement
					 officers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mandate of the customs officers is to be tax
					 collectors then they should be given calculators. If their mandate is to
					 protect Canadians at our borders then they should be given guns. At this time
					 they have neither calculators nor guns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the auditor general's April 2000 report, he noted
					 that the students as well as the long time customs officers are deficient in
					 training in immigration law, drug enforcement and vehicle examination. We know
					 that rather than taking this issue seriously the government has hired part time
					 students to monitor our border, without proper training and without proper
					 tools and resources. The Liberal government, instead of giving them tools to do
					 their job, have cut 488 customs and trade employees since 1994 even though
					 their work has increased.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next the motion calls for all spontaneous refugees
					 without any documents or those who are hiding their identity to be detained
					 until their identity can be established and verified and also their health
					 checked so that they do not pose any health risks. If it is determined that
					 they do not pose a threat to the safety and security of citizens of our country
					 and that of our neighbours, only then should they be allowed to mix with the
					 general population of the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak and arrogant Liberal government rejected a
					 1998 House of Commons standing committee report recommending increased use of
					 detention to deal with undocumented or improperly documented refugee claimants.
					 I am not talking about genuine refugees. I am talking about those who are
					 posing as refugees but are bogus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion asks Canada to create a list of safe third
					 countries. We know that the United Kingdom does not allow refugees from safe
					 third countries, like Canada, the United States and other safe countries in the
					 economic union and others. A safe third country provision has been in law since
					 1989, but the government has failed to designate any countries. We do not have
					 a list of safe third countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government insists on increasing police presence
					 and powers inside Canada rather than at the border.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it clear that the Canadian Alliance
					 supports immigration. Our policy declaration clearly states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--we
						  see Canada as a land built by immigrants, and will continue to welcome new
						  immigrants...We affirm Canada's humanitarian obligation to welcome genuine
						  refugees--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion is designed to put an end to the practice of
					 people destroying their documents in transit so that they cannot be deported.
					 According to the auditor general, 60% of the refugee claimants who come to
					 Canada and apply for refugee status come without any documents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By asking for the tightening our immigration laws, we
					 are calling on the government to get up to speed with international
					 developments. Other countries are tightening their immigration laws,
					 particularly after the incidents of September 11. If Canada does not do
					 likewise it will continue to be a safe haven for people who want to break the
					 law. We certainly risk being shut out of trade relationships with our largest
					 trading partner, the United States of America. We do well over $1.5 billion a
					 day in trade with the Americans. The United States accounts for approximately
					 82% of Canada's exports in goods and services. We learned today that the
					 Americans are planning to implement section 110 of their immigration act, which
					 would impose entrance and exit restrictions on people moving into and out of
					 the United States. Section 110 would cause some serious problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did we reach this position? Because of the weakness
					 and arrogance of the weak Liberal government. With a recession looming, such a
					 restriction imposed by the Americans could have a devastating effect on
					 Canada's economy. When the Alliance proposed a motion on September 18, I stood
					 in the House and said that the U.S. congress would move with or without us. I
					 am sorry to say that once again I have been proven right.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion also continues the Alliance's long term
					 commitment to national security, robust law enforcement and a strong Canadian
					 armed forces. With its cuts to each of these areas, the Liberal government has
					 left us vulnerable. The motion seeks to correct this oversight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area is our frontline offices and our foreign
					 missions. I commend our officers in foreign services for their dedication and
					 hard work. They have their own problems, which I will talk about some other
					 day, but I want to mention corruption in our foreign missions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read in the newspapers, and there are
					 documented reports, that about 2,200 blank visa forms were stolen in Hong Kong
					 and 788 taped computer files were altered. Who did it? Why did they do it?
					 Because they will sell them to organized criminals. Unwanted people who are a
					 threat to Canadian security will abuse our system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that money has been stolen from many
					 Canadian embassies. Bribes have been taken by our officials who issue visas. I
					 reported a case in which action was taken. The authorities found out that
					 corruption was taking place and bribes were being taken in New Delhi and
					 Islamabad, so they fired some locally hired employees. Many investigations are
					 continuing. The government should also pay attention to that issue. Foreign
					 officials who are monitoring our immigration policies abroad are our front line
					 of defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion I would like to say that organized crime
					 and terrorism are two different things but are interlinked. Now, because of the
					 incidents of September 11, there is a knee-jerk reaction and we are focusing on
					 terrorism, but I remind the government that it should integrate its resources
					 and policies. We should not leave organized crime out of it. Organized crime is
					 latent, invisible and hidden, whereas terrorism is explicit and its effects are
					 evident. I would remind the government that there should be a synergy and an
					 implementation of resources to combat these two areas.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, in listening to the speech given by my
					 colleague, when he was talking about crime it made me think about B.C.'s
					 Liberal premier Gordon Campbell who is not very popular with members on the
					 government side. I wonder if the member has noticed that they never use his
					 name. They never talk about the Liberal premier from B.C. because of course
					 Gordon's positions are completely in common with the Canadian Alliance policies
					 and in fact could even be called reform policies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that Gordon Campbell has been talking
					 about in the last few days in connection with crime is the outrageous release
					 on bail of a suspected terrorist in Vancouver. The U.S. law that has been
					 introduced on terrorism restricts the bail that can be granted to people who
					 are suspected of terrorism. The judge in Vancouver took the position that
					 because the person had not run away before September 11 he therefore would not
					 skip the country now. That is totally ludicrous. Anyone knows the whole
					 situation has changed now. Gordon Campbell criticized the judge and then the
					 judge criticized Gordon, and Gordon said he was sticking by his guns, that it
					 was a bad, stupid decision. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member could comment on the need to
					 restrict bail, perhaps in the bill that is being run through the House
					 now.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his keen
					 observation. He is a very keen observer in many areas and has been highlighting
					 some of the weaknesses of the government. He has done a perfect job as critic
					 many times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a valid point. The hon. member mentioned bail.
					 I will not comment on the particular bail because the issue may still be in
					 front of the courts. However, in general and from a broader perspective, the
					 government is very lenient and our policies are very lenient. The amazing thing
					 is that our overall policies, which we derive from the Liberal government, are
					 policies of reverse onus. That is very wrong. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When prospective refugees come here we want them to
					 prove that they are genuine refugees. Why does the government not do its job?
					 Similarly when terrorists and criminals are arrested, why would we believe only
					 reverse onus? I think that there is a fundamental flaw in the vision, or I
					 would say lack of vision, of the Liberal government, and I do not know how to
					 correct its vision. We cannot do that. The government has been so weak and

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to discuss the topic tonight and
					 the motion as it relates to the people of my constituency, which is in
					 southeastern Saskatchewan. We share miles of border with the United States. We
					 touch two states, Montana and North Dakota. My constituency probably has more
					 points of entry, nine of them, than any other constituency in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11 have touched rural
					 Saskatchewan. They have even touched my constituency. Last week we had our
					 first anthrax scare. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government were doing the right thing with
					 radio, TV and newspapers, ads should be going out explaining to people how to
					 react if they open their mail and white powder falls out. It has not done that.
					 Not only has it not done that, but it has not warned people. It has not warned
					 the hoaxers and the pranksters of the penalty for becoming involved in such an
					 act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Britain and the United States have enacted
					 legislation to deal with hoaxers. In both cases it is automatic jail time. We
					 are one week away from celebrating Halloween and no doubt there will be hoaxers
					 scaring people. The government should show people what it is doing to curb the
					 epidemic which has already killed people in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are concerned about our military, which has gone
					 overseas. In the U.S. and the U.K. this is a time of war. War has not been
					 officially declared, as Canada did in 1914 and 1939, but the question that is
					 being asked is simply this. During this war on terrorism will our service
					 personnel, if they are harmed, hurt or even killed, have the same benefits as
					 they would have if the nation declared war? The government has left this
					 question completely wide open.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last eight years Canadians have read almost
					 weekly in every paper across Canada about the problems in our immigration
					 system. We have heard a lot today about them. I would like to cite some figures
					 so that people watching get an idea of what this party has been talking about
					 since 1993. Between 1993 and 1997 over 99% of refugee claimant applications
					 were deemed eligible to go through the refugee determination process.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words they would come to the border, apply for
					 refugee status, and 99% came in. Once these applicants appeared before the
					 refugee board it took an average of 2.5 years to go through the appeals process
					 to reach a final determination. During that period of time only 22% of rejected
					 applicants were confirmed to have left the country. The story is all
					 there.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This country became blinded to what was going on. The

					 a reputation which will take a long time to cure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many things we can do to co-operate with our
					 neighbours, not just in forming the shield of protection around North America
					 but we could take a look at border crossings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week I visited two of the nine border crossings in
					 my riding. Officials were busy preparing and changing for the onslaught that
					 may be coming. We were on the Canadian side. The U.S. announced that it will be
					 asking people to report not only upon entry into the U.S. but also as they
					 leave the U.S. This is something entirely new and I wonder why the U.S. is
					 doing it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if people come from the U.S. into Canada
					 they traditionally do not stop at U.S. customs. They stop at Canadian customs.
					 If they want to make a run for it, and that has happened, the only choice the
					 poor Canadian customs officer has is to phone the closest detachment of the
					 RCMP. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have border crossings in my constituency where it
					 would take an RCMP officer an hour to get there because the detachments have
					 all been halved by the government. If it was a three man detachment, it will
					 now have one officer or maybe two. If it was a four man detachment, it will
					 only have two officers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is ill prepared. All the border crossings or
					 ports of entry, as we call them, in the United States are manned 24 hours a
					 day. One of the reasons the U.S. is pleading to have individuals stopping in
					 both directions is that it cannot trust the Canadian immigration system any
					 more. We should be ashamed that we have sunk to a low level.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. did not withdraw, as one of the members
					 indicated, the Canpass card. Many people in my constituency have Canpass cards.
					 It is a simple card for a select group of people that can pass back and forth
					 with no problem. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian government panicked and cancelled the
					 cards but the United States did not. Many of my constituents go to school in
					 the United States and some of them work there. Many were born in the U.S.
					 simply because they were closer to a hospital there. The Canadian government
					 panicked and put a wall up against the very people it trusted to have the
					 Canpass card in the first place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and the United States need to work together on
					 the trucking industry. We have horrendous long lineups. There is a tremendous
					 extra cost and time wasted by drivers. Canada to date has made no attempt to
					 meet with its counterparts to discuss these border stoppages. Trucks line up
					 and wait for an hour or sometimes three. All of that is costing us dearly. It
					 is costing truckers a lot of money and it will cost Canadians a lot of
					 money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we can co-operate with the United States in many
					 areas and we should. It wants to co-operate with us. We need to recognize that
					 we are a continental country. We need to recognize that we have not done our
					 share with regard to immigration and the terrorists who lived in our country.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard members on the government side say that if the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were a terrorist coming from another country and I
					 wanted to go to the United States I would come to Canada first. I would receive
					 free welfare, medical and dental benefits as well as a free apartment in which

	Madam Speaker, I visited Fort Erie recently. It is a
					 very busy border crossing. I was pleased to see the workers there doing the
					 very best they could with what capabilities they have. It could be much
					 better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a firm believer that if we want to find out how
					 the job is going and what we can do to make it better, we need to talk to the
					 frontline people that are doing the work. I would like to inform the House and
					 the member that I was denied the privilege of meeting with any of the frontline
					 workers. It was not allowed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from British Columbia who was with me was
					 also denied the privilege of meeting with the employees. We were not allowed to
					 meet with them either in a coffee room during their break or during a smoke
					 break.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a directive from Canada customs and there is a
					 warning that states that employees should refrain from making any direct, or
					 through a third party, public pronouncements critical of federal policies,
					 programs and officers or on matters of current controversy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final part of the directive it states that in
					 the event they do not abide by this directive, they will be subject to
					 disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are not very anxious to speak to us
					 because their jobs would be on the line. They send me e-mails. I get hundreds
					 of e-mails asking me not to use their names because they will probably lose
					 their jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Canada. This is supposed to be a democracy. I
					 have never seen such nonsense in all my life. The government ought to be
					 ashamed of itself for having brought itself to the point where it is warning
					 its employees, such as prison guards, border guards and police forces, that
					 they cannot speak out about their jobs or they will lose them. That is not a
					 democracy. That is the worst kind of dictatorship I have ever run across in my
					 life. Would the hon. member like to comment on that?</p>

	Madam Speaker, over the years when I have gone to my
					 ports of entry I have always been received very cordially by both sides. That
					 was the case last week. Perhaps they had not received this directive as
					 yet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do know of the letter my colleague has spoken about.
					 When a customs officer with many years of training and service opens a file and
					 shows the people he has tried to apprehend without any protection, I can
					 understand what my colleague is saying. If individuals are employees of Canada
					 customs it does not mean they have to zipper their lips.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, in the few minutes remaining in the
					 debate, I would like to make a few comments with regard to this important
					 issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a suggestion made by the member for
					 Okanagan--Coquihalla that somehow we on this side of the House would call the
					 measures outlined in the motion draconian. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I would suggest that individual initiatives
					 that have been presented have some merit and that is what the government is
					 acting on. The Canadian government does not want North America to be anything
					 but a secure place but the decisions must be made by Canadians for Canadians.
					 We must ensure that our policies and procedures are complementary, that we are
					 not working at cross purposes with the United States, and that we do not
					 sacrifice our sovereignty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent testimony at the Standing Committee on
					 Citizenship and Immigration the commissioner of the RCMP claimed he was
					 strongly in favour of the perimeter initiative put forth by the Canadian
					 government. He believes that our border officials already are setting the
					 standard. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians can be proud of the security measures
					 enforced by our immigration and customs officers at the Canada-U.S. border.
					 Indeed the United States ambassador, Mr. Cellucci, recently commented that his
					 government is very impressed with the co-operation between our two
					 administrations and the work being done in Canada to increase security in its
					 immigration procedures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada deploys immigration and customs officials at the
					 border in numbers that are comparable to those of the United States. Both
					 countries have increased these numbers and are on an enhanced security level
					 since September 11. Last year alone, Canadian officials stopped 21,000
					 criminals from entering Canada from the United States while the American agents
					 stopped 14,000 criminals from entering the U.S. from Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and
					 Naturalization Service recently praised Canada's security efforts. He noted
					 that Canadian officials helped arrest half of the 8,000 criminal aliens caught
					 in the first six months of this year. This is despite the fact that the U.S.
					 has eight times more agents on its Mexican border. He credited the success to
					 Canada's “excellent system” of information sharing with the American
					 authorities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Bill C-18 passed in 1999, customs officers were
					 given officer powers to arrest and detain individuals suspected of having
					 committed offences under the criminal code, such as impaired driving, child
					 abduction, or those with outstanding arrest warrants. Officers will complement
					 the work of police forces by bridging the gap between the time an officer
					 detects a criminal code violation and the time when police can arrive and
					 intervene.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When proposing the bill, the minister at that time
					 stated on May 13, 1998:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>By expanding the scope of their
						  powers to include violations under the criminal code, we will enhance the
						  overall safety and security of Canadians.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that Canada customs officers already have the
					 powers necessary to enhance the overall safety and security of Canadians, there
					 is no reason to move Canada customs officers out of the tax collection agency
					 and into a law enforcement agency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the issue of detention of refugee
					 claimants, as part of the $280 million anti-terrorism plan, the government
					 recently invested $49 million to accelerate the Department of Citizenship and
					 Immigration's ability to complete an increased security strategy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this new money, $17 million is going to the security
					 screening of refugee claimants. Because of the new security concerns, all
					 refugee claimants must go through interviews and examinations upon their
					 arrival. These include indepth questioning, checking the claimant's information
					 against various databases, taking the claimant's photograph and fingerprints,
					 and keeping all travel documents on file. If the claimant is considered to be a
					 security risk, he or she is detained.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000-01, 8,790 individuals were detained on the
					 average of 16 days. Due to the increased state of alert and more intense
					 security screenings, CIC officials expect there will be more detentions in the
					 future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that when we are making
					 decisions, we are making them in Canada's interest. I am always concerned that
					 our friends across the way would like us simply to be absorbed by the Americans
					 in their approaches.</p>

						  1915 and condemn this act as a crime against humanity.</p>


	</small></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: Madam Speaker, it is with some emotion that I
					 rise this evening to begin this first and only hour of debate on Motion No.
					 328, which reads as follows: “That this House recognize the Armenian genocide
					 of 1915 and condemn this act as a crime against humanity”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is on the strength of the support of the
					 parliamentary arm of the Bloc Quebecois and with the support of many colleagues
					 of all political allegiances that I speak to members in the hope of drawing
					 their attention in this House so that all together we finally, may act
					 responsibly, with compassion and justice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “genocide” at the heart of this motion was
					 used for the first time by Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who said, in
					 1943:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>By “genocide” we mean the destruction
						  of a nation or an ethnic group...In general, genocide does not necessarily mean
						  the immediate destruction of a nation. It means, rather, a co-ordinated plan of
						  different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the
						  life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups
						  themselves.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years later, in 1945, the term “genocide” was
					 included in the indictment by the Nuremburg tribunal at the trial of Nazi war
					 criminals. It provided that the accused “...conducted deliberate and systematic
					 genocide, viz., the extermination of racial and national groups, against the
					 civilian populations of certain occupied territories...national, racial or
					 religious groups”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later, in 1948, the term “genocide” was
					 given a legal definition by the convention on the prevention and punishment of
					 the crime of genocide, which was ratified by Turkey just 50 years ago this
					 year. Its use by governments in the recognition of the tragedy suffered by the
					 Armenian people is not without significance, as is the refusal to apply
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Armenian genocide occur? Some people deny it.
					 However, internationally renowned historians, whose reputations are beyond
					 doubt, confirm that the events of 1915 and 1916 were indeed
					 genocide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed the operation planned by the prefect of the
					 Constantinople police, Bedri Bey, for the night of April 24-25 was intended to
					 eliminate the Armenian elite. On that night and during the days that followed,
					 some 600 persons, intellectuals, writers, poets, journalists, physicians,
					 priests and lawyers were imprisoned, gagged and unable to alert international
					 opinion to the massacre being prepared.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arnold Toynbee, a world renowned British historian,
					 estimated that two out of three Armenians living in the Ottoman empire were
					 killed or died while being deported. The final death toll was 1.2 million. Yves
					 Ternon, author of <i>Les Arméniens: histoire d'un génocide</i>, also estimated
					 that two-thirds of the Armenian community was killed, although he based his
					 figures on the official Ottoman census, which listed the number of Armenians
					 living in the Ottoman Republic in 1914 at 1,295,000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1919, Turkey's minister of the interior placed the
					 number of dead at 800,000. Nowadays, the figure given by Toynbee is
					 used.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Armenian genocide did indeed take place. It was
					 deliberately and knowingly orchestrated by a government which, in an enactment
					 dated May 27, 1915, authorized the deportation of the Armenians, thus giving
					 the insidious go ahead for the massacre of over one million people. The
					 deportation was a legal cover and orders to execute were given in
					 secret.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read a few lines from a letter
					 addressed to U.S. President Wilson by a German Red Cross officer named Armin
					 Wagner:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>After depriving them of leaders and
						  spokespersons, the executioners drove the populations out of the cities at all
						  hours of the day and night. Groups which had numbered in the thousands when
						  they set out from their homeland in Upper Armenia were down to a few hundred
						  upon arriving in the outskirts of Aleppo, but the fields were littered with
						  corpses. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The deportees were forced onto the
						  highways until thousands were reduced to hundreds, and hundreds to a small
						  band, which was still hunted down until it no longer existed. And then, they
						  had reached their final destination.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one knows that the ultimate destination of the
					 deportees' long journey was the Deir Ez Zor desert in Syria and not the lush
					 banks of the Euphrates, how can one not see that the purpose of this
					 deportation was none other than the final solution, death?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can survivors of this massacre be expected to
					 forget? Seeing the calm tenacity with which they seek to have the Armenian
					 genocide recognized, Hitler's cynicism just a few days before the invasion of
					 Poland by troops of the Third Reich, can only horrify us.</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in front of his staff on April 22, 1939,
					 Hitler did not hesitate to ask if anyone still remembered the extermination of
					 the Armenians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreshadowing the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide is
					 the first genocide of the 20th century. There is no excuse for refusing to use
					 the term “genocide” to describe the terrible catastrophe that the Armenian
					 people experienced in 1915-1916. Many parliaments have recognized this
					 genocide, including the parliaments of Russia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece,
					 Lebanon, Belgium, Argentina, Uruguay and Australia. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The European parliament and the UN Commission on Human
					 Rights have also recognized it. More recently, on January 18, 2001, it was
					 France's turn. Legislation was passed unanimously by the national assembly and
					 the Senate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In North America, the states of California, Delaware,
					 Massachusetts and New York have also recognized the genocide. The Quebec
					 national assembly and the legislature of Ontario have done the same. Given that
					 the populations of Quebec and Ontario combined account for 60% of the
					 population of Canada, it is hard to understand why Canada still refuses to
					 describe the Armenian genocide as such, and refers to it instead as a tragic
					 event.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the Canadian government so cautious? One can
					 only speculate. Perhaps the Armenian diaspora living in Canada does not have
					 enough demographic clout. There are more than 100,000 Armenians living in
					 Canada; 60,000 of them are in Montreal and Laval and the rest live in the
					 Toronto area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being lucky enough to live in close proximity to the
					 Armenian community in Laval, I can say, to their credit, that they have done a
					 wonderful job of integrating into their host community. They have every reason
					 to be proud of their social and economic contributions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reputation of the Armenian community in the arts is
					 well established. Take the example of Maryvonne Kendergie, a well-known
					 musicologist who, through her teaching and boundless energy, has made a major
					 contribution to the field of contemporary music. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filmmaker Atom Egoyan, whose talent is celebrated,
					 joins other renowned artists such as conductor Rafi Armenian, soprano Isabel
					 Bayrakdarian, violinist Catherine Manoukian and Yousef Karsh, the extraordinary
					 photographer who took the famous picture of Winston Churchill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we owe it to Canadians and Quebecers of
					 Armenian origin to officially recognize the genocide of 1915. Is it completely
					 farfetched to think that some diplomatic reservations based on economic
					 considerations might weigh in the balance? If so, how can we explain the
					 numerous European countries in relative proximity to Turkey having had the
					 courage to do so? And what about the European parliament, which after
					 recognizing the Armenian genocide on June 18, 1987, reaffirmed in connection
					 with the discussions around Turkey's membership in the European Union the
					 necessity for the latter to recognize the Armenian genocide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, paragraph 10 of the resolution passed
					 November 15, 2000, contains the following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Calls, therefore, on the Turkish
						  Government and the Turkish Grand National Assembly to give fresh support to the
						  Armenian minority, as an important part of Turkish society, in particular by
						  public recognition of the genocide which that minority suffered before the
						  establishment of the modern state of Turkey</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Canada going to wait until Turkey recognizes this
					 reality before adding its voice to those of the other parliaments?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1993, the question of genocide has been debated a
					 number of times before this House. The Bloc Quebecois position has always been
					 clear. It has made us the target of objections from the Turkish embassy. It is
					 was easy to imagine what comments were directed to the party in power. I have
					 trouble, however, believing that a country like Canada, whose commitment to
					 human rights is well known, would bow to diplomatic representations on
					 something of such gravity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noteworthy that, following the adoption of its
					 legislation by the French national assembly, the government of France stated
					 that it made a clear distinction between the Ottoman empire and contemporary
					 Turkey. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the political recognition by the various states
					 and international organizations, I would like to touch on another recognition
					 before I close. This was the position of Pope John Paul II. On November 27,
					 2000, the Pontiff signed a final declaration on the occasion of the visit to
					 the Vatican of His Holiness Karekin II, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All
					 Armenians, whose apostolic church comprises seven million faithful. The text
					 could not be any clearer. The following are just a few excepts from it:
					 </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The extermination of a million and a
						  half Armenians, generally considered genocide, and the annihilation of
						  thousands more under a totalitarian regime are tragedies which must still live
						  on in the memories of the present generation.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these troubled times, the recent visit to Armenia by
					 Pope John Paul II, which coincides with the 1700th anniversary of the adoption
					 of Christianity by Armenians, has a very special significance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some were disappointed that the Pope did not use the
					 term “genocide” in his sermon at the mausoleum. He preferred to use the
					 expression “Metz Yeghern”, the great catastrophe. For 86 years, these words
					 have described, among Armenian families, the 1915 genocide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international press reported on the intense emotion
					 that could be felt when Pope John Paul II read the names of the 29 martyr
					 cities of the genocide, including Ani, Marach, Var and Mouch.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that this visit by John Paul II
					 was criticized by the Turkish diplomacy, which expressed to the Vatican
					 ambassador in Ankara its “consternation following the condemnation by John Paul
					 II of the Armenian genocide”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly no coincidence that, on October 7, John
					 Paul II beatified Archbishop Ignazio Maloyan, the Armenian Archbishop of
					 Mardin, Turkey, who was killed with 400 faithful during the 1915
					 genocide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pope said “Faced with the dangers of persecution,
					 the blessed Ignazio did not make any compromise. Let his example inspire those
					 who, today, want to be true witnesses of the Gospel”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six weeks to the day, America and the whole world found
					 themselves in the eye of the storm. Through very well orchestrated actions,
					 terrorism fully showed its anger and hate with total disregard for innocent
					 victims and their grieving families. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of these actions was to destabilize our
					 capitalist society. Since then, our outlook on things has changed, because
					 beyond the actions, we have a duty to understand, so as to fully assume our
					 responsibility to the poor on this planet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1915, a deliberate action effectively destroyed a
					 community to destabilize the Armenian society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call upon the will of my colleagues so that we
					 finally recognize the Armenian genocide.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for sharing her
					 views concerning the events of 1914 to 1925, during the closing years of the
					 Ottoman empire, which claimed so many victims and had such a devastating impact
					 on the Armenian people and other peoples in the region. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a period of history when so many atrocities were
					 committed. Our previous debates and the moving addresses made in the House by a
					 number of members have given many of us a better grasp of the magnitude of
					 those events and of the suffering endured by Armenians and other groups who
					 were displaced by the millions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall that on the occasion of the 80th
					 anniversary of the Armenian tragedy of 1915, the Prime Minister spoke to
					 Canada's Armenian communities in these terms:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Canada recognizes and deplores the
						  fact that a great number of Armenians were killed during the wars which marked
						  the end of the Ottoman empire and extends its sympathy to the Armenian
						  Community. Following the war, numerous displaced Armenians came to Canada and
						  their contribution, as well as that of their descendants, has greatly enriched
						  Canadian society. It is my hope that the memories of the past will serve to
						  remind us of the importance of tolerance and respect for the diversity of our
						  people. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also recall that on June 10, 1999,
					 following comprehensive consultations, the position of the Government of Canada
					 with regard to these events was set out in a statement made in the House by the
					 hon. member for Halton speaking on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
					 The hon. member stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--we
						  remember the calamity inflicted on the Armenian people in 1915. This tragedy
						  was committed with the intent to destroy a national group in which hundreds of
						  thousands of Armenians were subjected to atrocities which included massive
						  deportations and massacres. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>May the memory of this period
						  contribute to healing wounds as well as to reconciliation of present day
						  nations and communities and remind us all of our collective duty to work
						  together toward world peace--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of the above statements demonstrate that we share
					 the memory of the suffering during this painful period. We have not forgotten.
					 It is indelibly etched in our minds. During the debate on the Armenian tragedy
					 in 1996, the House adopted a motion recognizing the week of April 20 to April
					 27 each year as a week of remembrance of the inhumanity of people toward one
					 another.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has shown in previous debates and
					 continues to show today that it attaches a great deal of importance to ensuring
					 that the memory of this human tragedy is never allowed to fade from our
					 collective conscience. It is important that knowledge of this event and of
					 other calamities throughout the 20th century be kept alive and passed on to
					 future generations. Remembering these events should also prompt us to further
					 develop international mechanisms for preventing them from recurring and
					 promoting reconciliation, which is crucial to achieving everlasting peace and a
					 new start for all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this perspective, our country is a symbol of hope
					 for humanity. In Canada, people from all over the world suffering from
					 oppression, displacement and damaged dignity have found and continue to find
					 refuge and comfort, an oasis of tolerance, sharing and understanding. These
					 people who have been displaced, including people of Armenian descent, have
					 succeeded here in rebuilding their lives in a safe place where individual
					 freedoms are protected in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a land of hope, of renewal and of
					 reconciliation and we are all working very hard, especially in these times, to
					 ensure that Canadian ideals and values, such as tolerance, democracy and
					 supremacy of law, are reflected in the work of international organizations and
					 in the tools developed to prevent any recurrence of the horrors of the
					 past.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not alone in defending these ideals, of course,
					 but it is something we do naturally because we live in a tolerant society, a
					 society where the diversity and differences of people from around the world is
					 not only allowed but protected, promoted and, I might say,
					 celebrated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our regular participation in peacekeeping missions
					 around the globe is clear testimony to our desire and determination to make a
					 concrete contribution to shaping a world where reconciliation and tolerance can
					 replace hate and intolerance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential, indeed I would say it is our duty, to
					 work tirelessly to promote multiculturalism throughout those parts of the world
					 where its acceptance is precarious because we can use Canada as a shining
					 example.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today more than ever we must strive to promote
					 tolerance and reconciliation among peoples so that the horrors of the past,
					 like the tragedy suffered by the Armenian people, are never
					 repeated.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier I had the opportunity to speak on the same
					 issue through a motion moved by the hon. member for Brampton Centre who did a
					 great deal of work on this issue. He even caused the matter to go before the
					 Canadian heritage committee and forced the committee to issue a report.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A delegation from Canada's Armenian community visited

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I was saying that I highly appreciate
					 the interest expressed by both communities in the work we do as
					 parliamentarians.This is a very emotional and controversial matter. I have had
					 the opportunity to visit both Armenia and Turkey. My heart goes out to the
					 families and the survivors of this dark era in human history.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been more loss of life on this planet due to
					 man made wars than to natural calamities. We all sadly remember the genocide in
					 Rwanda and Burundi. We know of genocide and ethnic cleansing in the name of
					 civil and ethnic wars. Humankind should learn from the horrible experiences of
					 the past and make sure they are not repeated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also took part in a private members' debate on a
					 motion asking the Liberal government to cause the British crown to present an
					 official apology to the Acadian people for the wrongs done to them in its name
					 between 1755 and 1763. That debate went nowhere. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I rise with misgivings about what the Liberal
					 government will do in this debate. I regret that I cannot be more positive in
					 my outlook, but I do not want to try to fool anyone and I do not want either
					 the Turkish or the Armenian communities to be hoodwinked by this Liberal
					 government with its weak backbone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be very clear from the outset that the
					 government will not recognize the Armenian genocide of 1915 or apologize to
					 anyone for anything done wrong in Canada or abroad. There are many examples in
					 Canada which I would like to refer to the House. Let me remind the House of the
					 1914 incident involving 376 ship passengers who were British subjects and
					 arrived on the ship named <i>Komagata Maru</i>. They were not allowed to land
					 on Canadian soil because of an exclusionist immigration policy based on race
					 and country of origin. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy had its origin in the 1880s when the
					 Canadian government first imposed a head tax on Chinese immigrants. The
					 government erected a variety of barriers until 1962. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passengers of the <i>Komagata Maru</i> thought they
					 had the right to enter Canada because they were British subjects. Ninety per
					 cent of the passengers on the ship were Sikhs and the rest were Hindus and
					 Muslims, all from Punjab state in northern India.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sikh soldiers had served throughout the British Empire.
					 They thought that they should be able to work wherever the British flag was
					 flying. After two months of detention in Vancouver harbour, the government
					 brought in the cruiser HMCS <i>Rainbow</i> which aimed its guns at the
					 <i>Komagata Maru</i>. The ship was escorted away, with 352 passengers still on
					 board. It was a bitter and disappointing moment for the friends watching the
					 ship disappear. A voyage that began on April 4 did not end until September 29
					 in Calcutta, India, where the police opened fire and killed 19 of those
					 passengers. Those remaining were arrested.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a more tolerant Canada, the <i>Komagata Maru
					 </i>remains a powerful symbol for Sikhs and one that other Canadians should
					 understand. As a consequence we are beginning to reassess our past. Giving
					 attention to the <i>Komagata Maru</i> is part of the process. Do we think that
					 this government will offer an apology to community members for the <i>Komagata
					 Maru</i> incident? I do not think so. </p>


	<A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1820)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the Chinese internees who are demanding an
					 apology, along with 10 or so other groups? Promises for apologies and
					 recognition have been used to buy political votes. Both the current Prime
					 Minister and Prime Minister Mulroney also promised to offer redress to the
					 Ukrainians and both have failed to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also mention an exchange that took place in the
					 House of Commons about an apology in regard to the Canadian government and the
					 internment of Japanese Canadians during the second world war. Prime Minister
					 Trudeau said on June 29, 1984:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>There is no way in which we can
						  relive the history of that period. In that sense, we cannot redress what was
						  done. We can express regret collectively, as we have done. I do not see how I
						  can apologize for some historic event to which we or these people in this House
						  were not a party. We can regret that it happened. But why mount to great
						  heights of rhetoric in order to say that an apology is much better than an

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in 1994 a conversation took place in the House in
					 which the minister for multiculturalism at the time summarized the government's
					 position. She said:</p>


	<p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my time has almost expired I will say that the
					 hon. member is facing unfavourable odds in terms of having the motion passed by
					 the House. The behaviour of the prime ministers past and present does not bode
					 well for the fate of the motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, if it is decided that we need to consider the
					 wider implications of this issue, what happens if we decide in the debate today
					 that recognition ought to be given to the Armenian genocide? Does it mean that
					 the other long ago wrongs perpetrated against other groups are also to be
					 regarded as the collective responsibility of the Canadian people?</p>

					 genocide which took place between 1915 and 1923. Barbaric acts took place
					 during this period. Mass murders were committed in Constantinople or, as we
					 know it today, Istanbul. There were unwarranted arrests and wrongful
					 imprisonments. There were massive deportations of the civilian population,
					 rapes, abductions and forced religious conversions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Armenian genocide was the first genocide of the
					 20th century and sadly not the last. Since then we have witnessed genocide in
					 other parts of the world: the Nazi Holocaust of World War II, the genocides in
					 East Timor, Rwanda, Cambodia and elsewhere. It is only by acknowledging the
					 wrongs of the past and understanding our history that we will avoid such
					 horrors in the future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly Canada has yet to officially recognize the
					 Armenian genocide even though the United Nations did so 53 years ago as far
					 back as 1948.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Democrats have been pleased to work side by side
					 with the Armenian community to seek this recognition. We are proud to continue
					 to do so but it is heartbreaking. It is unacceptable that Armenian Canadians
					 continue to have to plead with the Liberal government for recognition of the
					 genocide yet only by doing so will people be able to get on with the healing.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have met with representatives of the Armenian
					 genocide community. I did so when they were here again this year on April 24,
					 the day we have set aside to commemorate the Armenian genocide. They told
					 stories. Several among them were orphaned and raised by people not known to
					 them who took them into their care because they had lost their parents and
					 grandparents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased to be interviewed on the <i>Horizons</i>
					 television program in Toronto about the continuing struggle to gain official
					 recognition of the Armenian genocide by the Government of Canada. It is wrong
					 for that community to have to continue putting its case to the government. It
					 is time we corrected that wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased earlier today to hear that the Minister
					 of Veterans Affairs has finally announced compensation for the 15 surviving
					 Buchenwald vets. This was long overdue. These gentlemen are aging rapidly.
					 Thank goodness the government has finally seen fit to acknowledge the
					 horrifying situation the Buchenwald vets faced. It is time to do the same and
					 recognize the Armenian genocide for what it was.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year the member for Burnaby--Douglas asked
					 the Minister of Foreign Affairs a straightforward question. He asked if the
					 Liberal government would finally stand and officially recognize the massacre of
					 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 as genocide. What answer did the Minister of
					 Foreign Affairs give? He gave an insulting non-answer. He insulted the entire
					 Canadian Armenian community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently circulating a petition on the issue
					 which I intend to table in the near future, a petition that calls upon
					 parliament to, first, officially acknowledge the Armenian genocide; second,
					 condemn all attempts to negate the genocide in accordance with the United
					 Nations convention for the prevention and repression of genocide; third, to
					 designate April 24 as the day of annual commemoration of the Armenian genocide;
					 fourth, to press the government of Turkey to acknowledge and recognize the
					 genocide; and, fifth, to help develop understanding, heal wounds and move
					 forward the process of reconciliation among all Canadians about this tragedy in
					 accordance with the Canadian tradition of promoting human rights, peace and the
					 rule of law in international affairs.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year commemorates the 1,700th anniversary of the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was recently given a book of essays and poems
					 entitled <i>The Armenian Genocide: Resisting the Inertia of Indifference</i>. I
					 think what we see from the government is exactly that, the inertia of
					 indifference. This book was written by Lorne Shirinian and Alan Whitehorn. Let
					 me quote briefly from a poem contained in the book, “Remembering Genocide”:
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<blockquote>
		
<p>We must remember.<br>
		

	Remember and learn.<br>
		

	Remember and tell.<br>
		

	But also remember and live.<br>
		

	And some day, remember and forgive.<br>
		

	</p>


	</blockquote>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight I call on the House to heed those words.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I seek the unanimous consent of the House
					 to make this motion votable, so that it is clear that as a House we remember
					 the Armenian people, and we acknowledge this genocide and will not forget
					 it.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is an honour to enter into the debate
					 on private members’ Motion No. 328. I commend the member for Laval Centre for
					 bringing the motion forward. We had a discussion earlier about the issue. It is
					 very clear how strongly she feels and how committed she is to the
					 cause.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recently had another debate similar to this on a
					 motion brought forward by the member for Brampton Centre. We had the same
					 debate with him as well. There are certainly a lot of strong feelings about
					 this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole debate surrounds the terrible massacre of
					 human lives between 1915 and 1923, with estimates in excess of a million and a
					 half men, women and children who died.There was violence, deportations,
					 internments, mass murders and all kinds of atrocities we in the House can
					 hardly imagine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it into perspective for me, we were all so moved
					 and concerned about the September 11 tragedies in the United States. For every
					 person killed in the United States in that horrible terrorist act, 250 people
					 died in the period from 1915 to 1923. The Armenians were the victims. To put
					 that into perspective, the disaster was 250 times worse than what we
					 experienced in North America. We cannot imagine what these atrocities were like
					 and what families and people lived through. We cannot imagine parents and
					 grandparents seeing their families wiped out through mass murders, atrocities
					 and deportations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the events between 1915 and 1923 were
					 terrifying and horrifying. They resulted in the terrible deaths of hundreds of
					 thousands of people. The Armenian people were the victims and suffered greatly,
					 more than anyone else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition coalition abhors any mass slaughter or
					 killings, whether they occur in Rwanda, the Middle East or Europe and by any
					 country or any group. It is important that we remember these issues. This is
					 exactly what the motion is doing today. It is helping all of us understand and
					 learn about issues we have never been exposed to before. Personally it has been
					 a learning curve. I appreciate the input by all the members who have shared
					 their thoughts with me and the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps by discussing these issues and bringing them
					 forth continually we will maintain public awareness. The healing process and
					 reconciliation will be helped by the fact that we in the Canadian parliament
					 are discussing these issues. Perhaps these discussions and motions will help
					 avoid such atrocities in the future, although recent events are not very
					 encouraging.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my
					 colleague from Scarborough Centre. I had an opportunity recently to call the
					 Minister of Foreign Affairs regarding the Pontian genocide. The minister said
					 to me that he could not comment as he was not born at that time. Even today the
					 parliamentary secretary to the minister told me to get real. I would like to
					 get real.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in my hands the November 1922 issue of
					 <i>National Geographic</i>. There is a picture called “The children of Smyrna”
					 and it states that “This was a photograph taken shortly before the recent
					 holocaust”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have in my hands the November 1925 issue of
					 <i>National Geographic</i> and it states “Dynamiting the walls and buildings
					 along the quay along the Smyrna fire”. On page 558 of the same issue it states
					 “Boat loaded with refugees leaving the railroad pier at Smyrna”. On page 559 it
					 shows American sailors moving refugees on hand tracks to Smyrna. On page 562 it
					 states “Weeding out men for deportation, Smyrna” and on the same page there is
					 a picture of a member of my family. On page 565 it states “Ghouls fishing for
					 bodies after the Smyrna disaster”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue has pictures of people looking for loaves of
					 bread. On page 578 there are people with lists of names looking for people. On
					 page 580 it shows people raiding trucks in order to have bread. On page 587 a
					 picture caption states “Housekeeping in a refugee barrack at Saloniki”.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my colleague who says I should get real I have to
					 tell her that I was born in one of those shacks because my parents were part of
					 that history. This is not “I wasn't born then”; this is reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a duty to stand and recognize what happened,
					 not coat it with smooth words. We have a duty to make sure that atrocities like
					 that do not happen again. We sent people to Kosovo and today we are engaged in
					 Afghanistan. What is different from what I see in these pictures from what I
					 see in Afghanistan?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I will get real. This is why, along with my
					 colleague from Scarborough Centre, I seek unanimous consent to accept this
					 motion to make sure that events like this will not cause people to say I was
					 not born then or it did not happen. We cannot say it was not part of history.
					 It was documented by <i>National Geographic</i>. There was nothing better.
					 Today we depend on <i>CNN</i>. At that time we depended on <i>National
					 Geographic</i>.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to add my voice to those
					 speaking in support of having the Government of Canada, and this parliament in
					 particular, recognize the genocide of the Armenians perpetrated by the former
					 Ottoman empire in 1915.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the genocide are public knowledge. They
					 are certainly well known to this House, since this is not the first time we
					 have debated this subject. There have been other debates on other motions,
					 which have unfortunately been defeated in a vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to recall that this genocide was not
					 the last of its kind. By recognizing that the Ottoman empire of the time
					 engineered the genocide of thousands of women and children by leaving them to
					 die of hunger and of their wounds in the Turkish desert, Canada's parliament
					 could recognize one of the great genocides of this century, not the only one,
					 unfortunately, but one of the major ones.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is up to parliament to show its colours,
					 to show that the genocide committed by the Ottoman empire is unacceptable to a
					 country like Canada and to show that the Parliament of Canada deplores this
					 event, if I may call it that, in its most negative sense. Let parliament
					 therefore show not only how much it deplores an event like the one a few years
					 ago, as in Rwanda, and the one many years ago in fascist Nazi Germany, but that
					 it deplores as well other events of importance to the Armenian people and those
					 of Armenian origin who are now Canadian citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important in my opinion to resolve this debate
					 once and for all. Other countries have passed motions. The French government
					 and senate have adopted a motion. I know other governments have done so
					 too.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Canada must show our fellow citizens of Armenian
					 origin that we understand what happened, that we recognize that Armenians were
					 murdered in 1915 in the Ottoman empire. We must, once and for all, stand on the
					 side of the righteous, and the Parliament of Canada must pass the motion by the
					 member for Laval Centre.</p>

	Madam Speaker, in the few moments I have I want to make
					 some comments in this debate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very pleased that most of the members I listened
					 to stuck to Motion No. 328 on the Armenian genocide. It was very sad for me to
					 hear the member for Surrey Central use such examples especially in such
					 difficult times as these when the world is fighting terrorism. In the United
					 States there are no Republicans or Democrats, and in this country there should
					 be no Liberals or Conservatives or NDP or whatever that party is called. It is
					 all of us collectively together. That is why I was so pleased when I heard the
					 member for Halifax so eloquently make her position. She did not criticize the
					 government for this or that but she came right to the point. I thank her for
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank the member for Cumberland--Colchester
					 as well who so eloquently said that this is the time for reconciliation. That
					 was the most important word. Many nations in the past have erred. As the saying
					 goes, he who is without sin, let them cast the first stone. We have all made
					 mistakes. It is in learning from our mistakes that we will go forward. Several
					 years back we discussed this issue and we were no closer then, but today we
					 have moved that agenda forward. We are using the words “genocide” and
					 “atrocities”. We have moved beyond where we were five, six or seven years
					 ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some horrendous activities took place in South Africa
					 over many years. There was a truth and reconciliation commission. Everyone came
					 forward to kind of cleanse themselves and say “Yes, these things did happen,
					 but now let us draw a line and move forward and learn from those mistakes”.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were there atrocities that took place in 1915 and 1912?
					 Funnily enough it was all in the same area. It all happened at the same time.
					 It happened to be the Armenians on one side and the Pontians on the other. What
					 has the Pontian community done nowadays? It has erected a monument in the
					 former borough of East York, which is now part of the megacity of Toronto,
					 commemorating the lives that were unfortunately and sadly slaughtered, et
					 cetera.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I know the Greek Canadian community, the Pontian
					 community go once a year to pay homage to those people. The other day we were
					 celebrating. I had the opportunity to be at a function to celebrate the 10th
					 anniversary of the Republic of Armenia. Who could have imagined that 15 or 20
					 years ago? There is progress in itself. When I saw the young children and the
					 seniors, I thanked them for the performance and the many people that have
					 contributed to the development of building a nation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I was sad when the member for Surrey
					 Central, who in my view did nothing but exploit a situation that we should
					 focus on, went back and said what happened in Canada's history. Sure mistakes
					 were made. Mistakes were made in the United States of America. Mistakes were
					 made in Germany. Mistakes were made in other parts of the world. That was not
					 the issue tonight and that is what has upset me. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing I want to thank each and every member who
					 stood up and focused on the motion. That is what it was all about, and not to
					 exploit and use certain examples in our history in Canada. I want to thank the
					 Armenian Canadian community who have contributed so much to the development of
					 nation building in Canada.</p>

					 there that evening will agree what a wonderful event that was. </p>

					 be sending him a copy of the tape of this evening's proceedings because he
					 himself would like to see this country move forward on such a
					 motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask for unanimous consent of the House
					 to make this valuable motion votable. If it is made a votable item I believe it
					 will have almost unanimous consent of the House. Then we could tell the
					 Armenian community in Canada and in the world that we truly care about them and
					 respect the historical wrongs of the past. Maybe by making it a votable motion

	Madam Speaker, all of today's speakers have
					 demonstrated their sensitivity to the Armenian genocide, even if they did not
					 all use that term, regretfully, but I am appreciative of their participation in
					 this debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that, had this motion been votable, it would
					 have obtained the support of the majority of MPs. Unfortunately, on several
					 occasions voices from the government side have prevented parliament from
					 expressing its view on a motion that, apparently, interests all members of this
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I profoundly regret what I would term an “insufficient
					 view of reality”, the view of those in power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genocide of April 24, 1915, is a reality even if
					 certain people wish to deny that reality. The planning that led up to it, the
					 number of deaths that resulted from it, the eyewitness accounts, the research
					 by competent historians, the political recognition by a number of states and
					 multinational organizations and by the Vatican, all of these realities fully
					 justify the appeal made on March 24, 1998, by Robert Kotcharian, prime minister
					 of the Republic of Armenia at that time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called for international recognition of the
					 genocide, which was not, and I quote “the tragedy of the Armenian people only”
					 but a tragedy for “all of humanity and a heavy burden for the Armenian people
					 because it has gone unpunished and, worse yet, has not been condemned as it
					 ought”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has come for Canada to respond to this request
					 because only international recognition of the genocide will allow this painful
					 wound to heal, thereby promoting reconciliation. It is up to all of us to
					 remember. The Armenian people are very conscious of this fact, and Robert
					 Agazian, who travelled to Armenia to celebrate the 1,700th anniversary of the
					 establishment of Christianity last September, attests to this. He
					 said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>When I come here, alone or with
						  pilgrims, I am always very moved. I am reminded of my parents, my grandparents,
						  of all of our families that were separated and scattered around the world
						  randomly due to the exodus and the convoys. I am also reminded of all of the
						  stories told and heard, all of the accounts that I have read and that describe
						  the tragic events of our Armenian history. In coming here, I am fulfilling my
						  duty to remember and I am expressing my desire for justice. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of where they live, Armenians recall this
					 painful wound. I would like to say to them today that these memories contain
					 life. Without them, the events that nourish our existence become lost beyond
					 the limits of the consciousness. The respect they have for their history and
					 for freedom is an example for us all, because it is the memories of the living
					 that push back the boundaries of death.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Émile Henriot wrote “the dead live on in the memories
					 of those they leave behind”. I thank ythem for their faithfulness to their
					 people.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, on September 26, I asked a question in
					 the House about the airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question was for the Minister of Human Resources
					 Development. Since there were going to be layoffs, I asked her what she
					 intended to do to help airline employees. The surplus in the EI fund stood at
					 about $43 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister replied as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That is why my deputy minister met
						  yesterday with officials from Air Canada to discuss precisely this fact; the
						  programs and services that can be made available to the company and, most
						  particularly, to its employees.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister went on to say “The employment insurance
					 program is strong and sound”. If it is strong and sound, could the
					 Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Resources Development tell
					 the House what the minister has done since September 26 with respect to a job
					 sharing program, since she had tasked her deputy minister to look into
					 this?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask if, by chance, she sent her
					 deputy minister to Alcan where 3,670 employees were just laid off? What will
					 they do back home? I am not talking about 3,000, 2,000, or 1,000 people.
					 Yesterday I heard about a company called Méga Bleu that has 8,000 pounds of
					 blueberries that cannot be shipped to the United States because of the events
					 of September 11. On Monday morning it laid off 40 people until further
					 notice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the government doing to help these people with
					 its strong and sound system? More important, can the parliamentary secretary
					 tell us what the minister will tell us this week when in committee all of the
					 parties agreed that the number of hours to be eligible for EI should be reduced
					 from 910 to 700? This measure could help people in the regions where these
					 layoffs took place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about thousands of people being laid
					 off. We have a strong and sound system but people cannot apply for employment
					 insurance because they only have 700 or 750 hours accumulated. How is it that
					 the government can be insensitive to this situation?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister of Human Resources Development has
					 had an opportunity to examine her conscience since September 26. I have heard
					 that in Newfoundland even Liberal members were saying that the minister was not
					 sensitive to workers who lose their jobs, when we have a program that belongs
					 to the workers and employers that contribute to it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am still waiting for an answer. We have asked the
					 question on numerous occasions in the House. When it comes to the money that
					 belongs to the workers, is the minister ready to give it back to those who
					 contributed it especially since we have a strong and sound system?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear the answer from the parliamentary
					 secretary to the minister. Is the department more aware of the situation and
					 have any steps been taken regarding job sharing programs for those who have
					 lost their jobs in the airline industry, at Alcan and in other sectors across
					 Canada?</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, the matter raised by my colleague for
					 Acadie—Bathurst is certainly important, not only for him as the representative
					 of the people of Acadie—Bathurst but for us in government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell him, and I think he already knows, that the
					 Government of Canada is always concerned when workers lose their jobs. I would
					 assure my colleague that the officials of the Department of Human Resources
					 Development have worked with and continue to work on a daily basis with
					 employees of the airline and with the union and employers to come up with
					 solutions and ensure that the employees affected have recourse to all the
					 programs and services provided by HRDC.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Air Canada as one example of many—and I
					 stress that—the department and we are in daily contact with Air Canada. The
					 Minister of Human Resources Development has personally met the representatives
					 of the unions affected and those of Air Canada and has assured them that we
					 will work with them so the employment insurance plan will help those employees
					 laid off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently working with the employees, the unions
					 and the employer to be sure that the members and employees of Air Canada get
					 the benefits they are entitled to as effectively as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that not only are we working with them but
					 under HRDC's program we visit the company's premises. Departmental employees do
					 this in order to get information to employees as quickly as
					 possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HRDC offers several forms of assistance to employees
					 and to employers in cases of mass layoffs. As I have just said, we visit the
					 employer's premises or a mutually agreed upon location in order to help
					 employees fill out their EI application.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are on site, we can gather the necessary
					 information and process applications as soon as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions with company representatives—I am speaking
					 here of Air Canada, but this can be multiplied by a number of companies, which
					 are almost in a free fall right now, given the number of employees they are
					 laying off—and unions focused on work sharing mainly as a way of offsetting the
					 impact of the present economic downturn and reducing the number of
					 layoffs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to refresh the hon. member's memory, work sharing
					 allows employers to deal with cutbacks without resorting to layoffs. It entails
					 a reduction in the work week and a corresponding reduction in salary. For days
					 not worked, HRDC will see that workers receive EI benefits, which partially
					 compensates for the reduced salary they are receiving from their employer. Work
					 sharing therefore benefits workers, because they do not have to go through the
					 difficult experience of being laid off.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they receive a reduced salary from their
					 employer, they also receive EI benefits and can continue working, which is
					 obviously important. This also allows workers to maintain their professional
					 skills.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am certain that by demonstrating goodwill and
					 flexibility, we will be able to conclude work sharing agreements with the
					 airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our priority right now is to ensure that employees who
					 have received a layoff notice and who must rely on the EI system can receive
					 all the benefits--</p>

	Madam Speaker, my question was whether there had

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards what the hon. member said about job sharing,
					 I can say that, when I was working at the Brunswick mine in 1978 we had a job
					 sharing program. I know what job sharing is about. I am a former union staff
					 member, and we used job sharing arrangements on a number of occasions.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work is shared. One person may work for three days and
					 be laid off for two days, during which time he or she collects employment
					 insurance to make up for the shortfall. In other words, the workers' salary is
					 topped up so that they do not lose money. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question does not concern only Air Canada but other
					 airlines as well. Time has passed. Now there is Alcan and other companies. What
					 is the federal government doing for all the companies that are laying people
					 off? As I said earlier, what is it waiting for to take action through a sound
					 an aggressive employment insurance program to help workers and perhaps at the
					 same time provide training programs to people so they can— </p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, yesterday I raised the same issue on the
					 late show regarding airline security. I asked the government if it would accept
					 full responsibility for pre-flight screening of hand luggage and passengers.
					 This is now handled by the airlines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said yesterday, at the Ottawa airport there is a
					 big sign before people go through the x-ray machines which says “Airport
					 security is an airline responsibility”. As a former airline employee, for years
					 I have been saying that this should be the responsibility of the government.
					 Now with the events of September 11, one would assume that the government would
					 finally figure out that it is its responsibility. The government should have
					 full control over training, employment and the standards that are adhered to in
					 pre-boarding flight screening. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked another question yesterday, which did not
					 receive an answer, with regard to the x-raying of all check-in baggage and
					 cargo prior to entry onto an aircraft. This is still not happening. There is
					 nothing stopping a terrorist from getting on board an aircraft with checked
					 luggage which has something inside it that could do great damage to the
					 aircraft while in the air. I could check in all kinds of paraphernalia in my
					 suitcase and board the aircraft. I will be checked, my hand luggage will be
					 checked but my check-in baggage will not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will the department start x-raying all luggage,
					 materials and cargo going onto the aircraft prior to departure?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also asked about removing metal cutlery from the
					 aircraft, such as serrated knives. I give the minister and the airlines credit
					 because they did remove those articles from the aircraft. In fact, some of the
					 airlines removed the entire meal service. That ended that problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions are straightforward. I ask my hon.
					 colleague to put down the notes he got from the department. He is very capable
					 of speaking for himself. Will the government accept full responsibility and
					 full costs for employment and training airport security? Will the government
					 implement a program to x-ray all luggage and cargo prior to departure of the
					 aircraft?</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to provide my colleague
					 from 
					 Sackville--Musquodoboit
						Valley--Eastern Shore with a response to her question of
					 September 24.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that since September 11 the
					 entire matter of airport security and safety has constituted an extremely
					 important issue for the government as whole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11, a number of measures have been
					 announced by the minister as circumstances have dictated. The government has
					 announced numerous measures which contribute to enhancing security and
					 safety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must not be forgotten, however, that a few months
					 before the events of September 11 the International Civil Aviation Organization
					 gave Canada a top rating in terms of security and safety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICAO said that Canada's methods for ensuring security
					 and safety were unparalleled. I would therefore like to point out to my
					 colleague that we were not starting from scratch.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to point out as well that the
					 government did react after the events of September 11. In response, Transport
					 Canada issued a directive on September 12 for the confiscation of certain
					 articles at preboarding check points. If members of the general public attempt
					 to get around this directive by attempting to get past check points with knives
					 and other sharp objects, charges will be laid. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reiterate that we were not starting
					 from scratch in the field of safety and security. Throughout this whole
					 assessment, this whole process, we have come to the realization that other
					 objects, such as the cutlery provided by airlines for meals, will need to be
					 evaluated even more carefully.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These revised directives were made public September 21
					 to provide further direction for the industry regarding passengers and carry on
					 baggage. These security measures were implemented to allow us to find and
					 confiscate any dangerous objects and weapons aboard aircraft and in restricted
					 areas of airports. The discovery of such objects on aircraft or in restricted
					 areas must be reported immediately to the police and to Transport Canada
					 officials.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased security measures have also been issued
					 regarding food serving utensils provided by airlines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this effect, I would like to specify that knives
					 with serrated edged blades, like a saw blade, are banned from aircraft, and
					 this ban has been extended. However, butter knives with blunt blades and ball
					 tipped points or plastic knives are still permitted on board aircraft for meals
					 served in flight. This approach is consistent with that of the United States on
					 this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the airlines and airports, Transport
					 Canada continues to ensure that these heightened measures are appropriate and
					 can be implemented effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue our momentum to further increase the
					 safety and security of travellers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out to my colleague that
					 everything to do with security and the standards applied are checked daily by
					 Transport Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the events of September 11, the minister has
					 answered all the questions in the House every day. He took part in the
					 emergency debate we had. He appeared before the Standing Committee on
					 Transportation to answer all questions raised by my colleague and by
					 others.</p>

					 available. Still, this is two days in a row and it is a simple yes or no
					 answer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will water the question down a bit to make it easier
					 for the government. Will the government at least indicate to the airlines that
					 it will look at assuming full costs, full control and full employment of all
					 employees and all security levels at airports in Canada?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now pre-board screening goes to a tender process
					 and 99% of the time it goes to the lowest bidder. We are asking these people to
					 be at the same level customs officers are at now which, by the way, is handled
					 by Transport Canada or Revenue Canada.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly Transport Canada will continue to define the
					 standards surrounding the application of the measures that must be taken with
					 airports. Transport Canada will continue to assume its responsibilities in

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be remembered that international agencies have
					 rated our security and safety system as one of the best in the world and
					 unparalleled. It is true it is not perfect. It is easier to be perfect in
					 opposition than in government. That is not a criticism. It is a
					 fact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we will continue to examine things. Every
