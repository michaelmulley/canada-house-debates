</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance)</B> 
moved that Bill C-278, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(prohibited sexual acts), be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise again today to 
speak to my private member's bill, Bill C-278, which would raise 
the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should make mention at this point that it is the third time 
this private member's bill has hit the floor of the House.  It is 
the third time there was enough emotion and concern to bring it 
forward, and that is the viewpoint held by so many people outside 
the House.  I might also point out that I think parliamentarians 
overall find a universal agreement on matters like this in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of our children is the key point that the bill 
targets.  It brings into focus the concern expressed by the 
public who want a greater level of security for our children. The 
bill would not answer all the problems out there when it comes to 
sexual offenders and how they may act or react against our most 
vulnerable.  There are other variables, such as the early release 
of pedophiles and sexual offenders, that contribute to the 
growing number of victims in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all have a differing view on the role of government 
in this area.  However, overall, whether we are Conservative, 
Bloc, Liberal, socialist or libertarian, there is a general 
consensus to protect Canada's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the one word that really describes the reaction of the 
public when a child, one of the more vulnerable in our society, 
is attacked by a pedophile or a sexual offender, is outrage.  I 
think we have seen this outrage expressed time and time again in 
every community across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a police officer, I remember when a whole community would 
almost have to hunker down because a sexual offender was released 
from prison.  The sexual offender was so dangerous that the 
public had to be notified and his picture had to be posted, and 
yet he was being released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big concern regarding that particular individual was the 
fact that his target was young children.  He would not touch 15 
or 16 year olds as they were of no concern to him.  He was after 
the younger children, the ones who were 14, 13, 12 and perhaps 
younger. 
That took great resources from the community, the police and 
social services.  Partnerships available to deal with this kind 
of crime must be tied together to combat it effectively.  We must 
put those at risk in a more secure area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of press releases before me that reflect what 
happens when a sexual offender threatens a community. I will read 
two very important examples because they do tell quite a story. 
These stories will have been heard and repeated time and time 
again in communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first story deals with a 52 year old parolee who had been 
serving a life sentence as a dangerous sexual offender.  He was 
released on parole.  Hardly a few days had gone by when he 
grabbed a young girl, just above being a toddler, and walked down 
the street with her.  Fortunately, her father was not far away 
and he was able to intercept and get his daughter back to safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parolee's propensity was to go after the very young and the 
very vulnerable.  He was fully paroled after serving 29 years of 
a life sentence for brutally raping a three year old girl. 
Everyone, including the police, were notified about this man's 
release.  The parole board said that it had no choice.  The 
community, in this particular case, was unaware of what was about 
to happen.  Thank God there was some intervention on the part of 
the father as this individual was attempting to apply his desires 
upon this young girl.  These things should not be happening.  The 
community has a right to know about these kinds of situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second example deals with a repeat pedophile who was 
infected with HIV, syphilis and two strains of hepatitis.  He was 
freed from prison and moved into a Toronto halfway house.  He had 
four previous charges and was convicted of sex crimes against 
pubescent boys aged 9 to 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are habitual types of crimes zeroing in on the most 
vulnerable:  children aged 12 to 15.  My bill would like to raise 
the level of protection up to 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have proclaimed that they would like to see the age 
of consent lowered to 12.  However, the majority of Canadians do 
not hold that viewpoint.  The House has made an effort to do 
that.  However, that does not reflect the viewpoint of people in 
my community and it certainly does not reflect the viewpoint of 
parents who are attempting to keep their children safe and secure 
and want what is best for them. 
They want to be able to protect them, and herein lies the 
involvement of our legislators in government, the people in the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems, as time passes from one generation to the next, the 
innocence of childhood gets shorter and shorter.  The bill is a 
very small attempt to restore innocence to youth, to curtail and 
incarcerate sexual predators who pick on those under 16.  For 
too long we have allowed the exploitation of society's most 
vulnerable, our children, by those who would extinguish their 
youth and replace it with mistrust, suspicion and lasting 
psychological and sometimes physical damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the psychological costs to the victim, the societal 
costs can be absolutely enormous.  On numerous occasions I have 
had individuals come to me, both male and female, who were 
sexually assaulted as youngsters.  They bear the shame and 
sometimes feel guilty about their own actions and the fact that 
they were caught in that situation.  Out of fear, or whatever the 
case may be, it was never revealed.  Something triggers it in 
their lives and they had to confess to someone else what had 
happened to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the psychological profiles of victims having to 
bear these dramatic things in their lives, even trying to hide 
them in some cases, it affects their relationships with others, 
sometimes their productivity in the community and certainly close 
relationships like those with family or between husband and wife 
in future years.  They have major problems to overcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never be able to get rid of all attacks by those who 
want to exploit children, but we sure can curtail them.  We have 
a responsibility as parliamentarians, as the government today, to 
bring about a more secure future for many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about ending the vicious cycle of one person 
exploiting another, who exploits another, who exploits another. 
If it means raising the age of consent to include a larger group 
of youngsters when they are still vulnerable, still shaping their 
thoughts and their futures, and putting them under a protective 
umbrella, that is what the House should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year the House grappled with fallout from the 
Sharpe case in British Columbia.  We were reminded in no 
uncertain terms through this pedophile and his actions that there 
were some very dangerous, conniving and manipulative people out 
there.  I believe it is essential to develop and direct the law 
of the land to protect our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter to whom we talk, consultations with police 
departments and prosecutors will reveal what must be done and 
should be done, if only the legislators really, truly and 
honestly want to compile that information from those two groups 
of authorities in our land.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislators at all levels of government must not shirk their 
responsibility to step in where society breaks down.  In that 
respect I am very much aware of the rage out there when 
pedophiles and others attack our young children, as I would 
suggest most members would be.  Far from just a casual number of 
offences are taking place in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know too that there are other related offences such as 
Internet pornography.  A registry for controlling pedophiles and 
other forms of law that require partnerships with social services 
and the like are certainly required.  People who fall into those 
categories should be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we are not the same society we were when the 
current legislation came into effect back in the late 1800s, but 
we as legislators are in the driver's seat.  We must not let 
changes in society allow the moral high ground to slip away.  It 
is our job to protect it.  The bill is about protecting Canadian 
children.  I know we all agree that it is a goal worth pursuing. 
I urge support for Bill C-278. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity this morning to speak to Bill 
C-278, an act to amend the criminal code respecting prohibited 
sexual acts, introduced by the hon. member for Calgary Northeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-278 proposes to amend in isolation several sections of 
the criminal code where the general minimum age of consent is 
part of the definition of sexual offences involving a child 
victim.  The current age of consent to most forms of sexual 
activity is 14, but there is an important exception for 
consensual sexual activity between young people within 2 years of 
age and under 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-278 proposes to increase the general age of consent to 
sexual activity from 14 to 16.  The age would also be raised to 
16 in the existing exception.  The proposed bill would also raise 
the age to 16 in connection with the powers of the courts to make 
prohibition orders against offenders who are convicted or who are 
discharged on conditions in a prohibition order of certain sexual 
offences against a person under 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-278 reflects valid concerns about whether the current 
protection provided to young people in the criminal code is 
sufficient.  There appears to be general agreement that the 
current minimum age consent for sexual activity, which has been 
in the code for more than 100 years, should be reviewed.  At the 
same time care must be taken that any changes provide 
comprehensive protection and do not accidentally create an 
inconsistency in the code or criminalize the consensual sexual 
activity of young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me to raise three distinct points.  First, as we know, in 
November 1999 the Department of Justice released a consultation 
document entitled “Child Victims and the Criminal Justice 
System”.  The document examines a wide range of possible changes 
to both the criminal code and the Canada Evidence Act to improve 
public safety for children.  Although the major responsibility 
for child protection lies with the provinces, there is a key role 
for the criminal justice system in supporting provincial and 
territorial efforts in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation paper is a collection of suggestions for change 
put forward by provincial and territorial officials and others 
working with children.  Three main areas are under consideration: 
the creation of further child specific offences, including the 
age of consent issue; sentencing to protect children from those 
who might reoffend; and additional means to facilitate children's 
testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The release of the consultation paper invited comments from all 
Canadians.  The public consultation phase is now complete and 
efforts are being made to complete the provincial and territorial 
consultation with their co-operation as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been argued that the general present age of consent, 
which is 14, is too low to provide effective protection from 
sexual exploitation by adults.  The relatively low age allows 
pimps, for example, to seduce young girls, with the intention of 
luring them into prostitution without fear of prosecution. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1125

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social workers are concerned that many young people in care may 
be vulnerable to be targeted by pimps.  Canada's age of consent 
is lower than that of many other countries that use 15 or 16 as 
the minimum age.  However the bill put forward by the hon. member 
for Calgary Northeast is premised on the belief that the issue is 
a straightforward one and that all that is involved in addressing 
the complex issue of age of consent is simply to change the age. 
With respect that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting our children goes beyond a simple and arbitrary 
increase of the age of consent to sexual activity.  It means 
addressing the broader issues of the safety and well-being of our 
children.  Our objective is to develop and maintain effective, 
comprehensive measures to support provincial and territorial 
measures to improve public safety for children and to protect 
children from serious injury and even death at the hands of 
adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The achievement of this objective rests in a collaborative 
effort by the provinces, the territories and the Government of 
Canada.  While the provision of services to children who are in 
need of protection is the responsibility of the provinces and 
territories, the assurance that appropriate offences and 
penalties are available for serious harm done to children remains 
the responsibility of the Government of Canada.  By targeting 
extreme forms of harm through the criminal code, the Government 
of Canada would provide strong support for provincial and 
territorial initiatives to protect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However Bill C-278 does not maintain a comprehensive approach. 
It leaves a reference to age 14 in several provisions, for 
example section 281 dealing with the abduction of a person under 
age 14, and even more critically perhaps in section 810.1 which 
allows a court to issue a prohibition order if there are 
reasonable grounds to suspect that an individual will commit a 
sexual offence against a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision in section 810.1 has proven to be an effective tool by 
some police forces and high risk offender teams in providing 
community monitoring and control of pedophiles.  It is 
unfortunate that these two sections have been left out of 
the bill.  It is also unfortunate that the only remaining child 
testimony provision that refers to age 14, section 486 which 
allows child witnesses to have available to them a support person 
while they are testifying in court, should also have been left 
out of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill does not address the criminal code consequences 
of raising the general age at which sexual activity with young 
people would be criminalized.  With respect, by not addressing 
this issue, Bill C-278 proposes an amendment that is inconsistent 
with the other relevant sections of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, even though the complainant's age would be raised 
to 16, there is no consequential change to the age of the accused 
in the exception that prevents criminalizing consensual sexual 
activity between young people close in age and under 16.  The 
result is that a teenager over the age of 16 who has consensual 
sex with a person under 16 but who is close in age would be 
considered to be engaging in criminal conduct.  At the same time 
a younger teenager would be able to consent to sexual activity 
with a person close in age.  This outcome would appear to be not 
only discriminatory but also contrary to common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultations undertaken by the Department of Justice have 
generally indicated that if the age of consent is raised the 
close in age exception for these older children must be 
broadened, perhaps to include within the exception consensual 
sexual activity between children who are three or even four years 
apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would allow a child who is just before his or her 16th 
birthday to engage in consensual sexual activity with a young 
person who is approaching his or her 18th or even 19th birthday. 
Otherwise that behaviour, which may be considered inadvisable but 
certainly not criminal by most Canadians, would be subject to 
prosecution under the criminal code.  Bill C-278 does not address 
the issue but rather could create confusion and criminalize the 
behaviour of all children over 16 years of age even where the 
behaviour was consensual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill does not address the broader implications that 
arise from the amendment to the general age of consent.  Since 
legislative changes do not take place in a vacuum, we must be 
aware that a change in the age of consent may have an impact on 
other legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, such changes may impact on the age 14 for providing 
assistance to child witnesses, as I mentioned a minute ago, for 
competency to testify in the criminal code and the Canada 
Evidence Act, and even for marriage legislation in the few 
provinces that still allow children under 16 to marry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  Would an amendment to the age of consent to 
sexual activity require amendments to other age related 
provisions of the criminal code and other statutes?  Furthermore, 
any arbitrary changes in the criminal code would be inconsistent 
with the government's commitment to consult with the provinces 
and territories before introducing amendments intended to support 
its efforts to protect children from abuse, neglect and 
exploitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the consultations several jurisdictions voiced concerns 
about proceeding too quickly on this question and accidentally 
criminalizing the behaviour of young people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice cannot support Bill C-278 for three 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the issue of age of consent is a real concern. 
Children deserve to live in a safe society and be protected from 
all forms of exploitation by adults.  At the same time, to be 
effective, people in the community and at every level of 
government must work together because we all have an important 
role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe all Canadians should be given an opportunity to 
express their views on the issue.  We also believe changes to the 
age of consent must be practical and carefully considered to 
ensure they achieve their goal without unintended negative 
effects.  To do so they should be dealt with in a comprehensive 
package within the broader context of other age related issues in 
the criminal code.  That is why the Department of Justice issued 
its consultation paper.  The results of that consultation process 
should be used to ensure that the best options are put forward 
and carefully considered so that children can be given the 
comprehensive protection they deserve.

an act to amend the Criminal Code (prohibited sexual acts), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part in 
the debate on Bill C-278.  I know it has been before the House in 
previous incarnations and is one that all members take very 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to the comments of the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice.  He raises 
some very good points and very specific technical implications. 
There are always implications when one looks at a bill as 
comprehensive as the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My overall reaction to his commentary is to ask what is stopping 
the government.  It is a shame that private members bring forward 
good ideas and that the response of the government and the 
parliamentary secretary is to simply stand and tear the ideas 
apart limb from limb rather than embrace them and offer creative 
and constructive suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the underlying theme of his commentary was to say that, 
yes, the government sees this as a problem that could be 
addressed.  However the response is typically that they should 
study it more, do a survey and somehow engage more of the 
stakeholders to get their feedback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is consistent with the overriding concern of the Liberal 
Party to make sure it is okay in the polls.  The Liberals want to 
make sure there is sufficient public support rather than take 
bold action on something that could have considerable impact on 
the lives of Canada's most vulnerable citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must begin by commending the hon. member for having the 
initiative to bring the matter forward, a matter he has been 
persistent in raising before.  I believe it is because of his 
deep seated concern, having worked as a police officer, for 
children who are so vulnerable and who are often placed in a 
situation where someone in a position of trust preys on their 
vulnerability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that it is sad that sexual predators are 
out there.  They can be found in every province and every corner 
of the country.  Infamous cases have occurred in places like 
Mount Cashel and in my home province of Nova Scotia in Shelburne 
at the school for boys.  These were terrible instances where 
individuals were preyed upon by those whom they should have been 
able to rely on for protection.  Sadly, the opposite occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The life altering and life lasting implications and damage that 
result from a child being abused in this way is absolutely 
shocking and abhorrent to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard time and again of the horrible events that can 
occur in a child's life.  What better place to address the issue 
than the Parliament of Canada?  What higher calling, what higher 
cause could there be than to protect children from this fate?

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sexual predators, I submit very firmly, are not always 
interested in sex but in power, control and severe violence. That 
reinforces the worry parents have every time their children leave 
their homes.  To properly deal with the situation we need a 
national sex offender registry, something other parties have 
called upon the government to enact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the government's response has been a half measure.  It 
says it has something on CPIC that is similar but CPIC does not 
provide the early intervention or information that police and 
communities need to play a truly protective role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government, and the solicitor general in particular, 
must take responsibility to enact this type of legislation and 
bring forward a national sex offender registry.  The Liberals say 
it is one of their top 10 priorities but time and again the issue 
seems to slip through our fingers when we have an opportunity to 
do something about it here on the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, some provinces are taking the initiative. 
Ontario last Monday launched the first sex offender registry of 
its kind in Canada.  Each sex offender in Ontario must register 
within 15 days of release from custody.  The same applies to 
those serving sentences in the community.  A file will contain 
the offender's address, phone number, physical description, 
aliases and list of offences.  Such information is critical to 
police if they are to afford protection to those whose children 
could be preyed upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone sentenced to less than 10 years must report their 
whereabouts for 10 years.  Offenders sentenced to longer than 10 
years will remain on the registry for life.  This is the type of 
bold, proactive and, in some instances, harsh legislation we 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario government cares about public safety and is reacting 
to the concerns of communities in the province.  Its law was 
passed in honour of Christopher Stephenson and is often referred 
to as Christopher's Law.  Thirteen years ago young Christopher 
was abducted at knifepoint from a Brampton mall, sexually 
assaulted and murdered by repeat sex offender Joseph Fredericks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely gut-wrenching that something like that must 
happen before politicians and legislators take notice.  However, 
such examples illustrate how important it is to take initiatives 
that can prevent lifelong suffering, murder, exploitation and 
terrible instances of sexual assault and intrusion into young 
people's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, with the current state of affairs, offenders registered 
in Ontario can leave the province to avoid tracking because of 
the lack of a nationwide sex offender registry.  Currently we 
have only piecemeal laws to deal with sex offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former government legislation, old Bill C-7, names pardoned sex 
offenders and requires them to remain on the RCMP database.  Such 
information would only be released to certain parties under 
special circumstances and with the approval of the solicitor 
general.  However that is not enough.  There is not enough money 
currently in the CPIC system.  There is not enough know-how or 
infrastructure to allow CPIC to fully address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private member's bill before the House is an opportunity to 
bring forward legislative change that the member, and I think 
many members of the House, embrace and see as an improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would require changing the current age of consent under 
the criminal code from 16 to 14.  The parliamentary secretary 
makes a good point in that some implications might be unwanted 
and unforeseen by the hon. member moving the motion.  There is an 
anomaly with respect to those close in age engaging in consensual 
sexual activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot speak for the hon. member but I suggest he would be 
enthusiastic and pleased if the parliamentary secretary or 
someone on the government side amended the legislation to make it 
more in keeping with his intent: to protect children from 
exploitation by those who would recruit them for prostitution, 
lure them on the Internet or in person, or in any instance prey

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary Northeast has brought forward 
legislation that the Progressive Conservative Party will be 
supporting.  We have moved similar legislation in the past which 
tried to expand the envelope of protection for children.  This 
bill quite clearly fits into that category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of reported instances gives rise to the need for 
action on the part of all governments, be they federal, 
provincial or municipal.  We must do more.  We must be more 
pro-active and involved in ensuring children are protected.  We 
must ensure that those who contravene current or future laws are 
dealt with in a serious and straightforward way.  We must do 
everything in our power because that is currently not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More could be done.  The hon. member who moved the motion knows, 
having worked as a police officer, that the implications are so 
grave and life altering that public safety should be our sole 
motivation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased the bill has been reinstated in parliament.  I 
encourage all members of the House to support this and other such 
legislation.  If we must amend it, as suggested by the 
parliamentary secretary, let us do so quickly.  Let us make 
the necessary changes so that it fits cheek and jowl with the 
current legislation and there are no unwanted consequences.  Let 
us ensure that there are consequences for those who break the law 
and prey upon children.  Let us make this issue a firm commitment 
and legislative priority of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in support of the private 
member's bill introduced by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Calgary Northeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would amend sections of the criminal code that deal 
with prohibited sexual acts committed with children under the age 
of 14 and in the presence of children under the age of 14.  The 
bill would extend the prohibition to acts committed with children 
under the age of 16 or in the presence of children under the age 
of 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the fourth time the hon. member has introduced this 
bill.  His perseverance and dedication on behalf of children and 
families needs to be recognized and commended.  It is a valuable 
bill and one that aims to protect the young and vulnerable in our 
society from sexual predators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former police officer, the hon. member has no doubt 
witnessed first hand the devastating effects on 14 and 15 year 
old children who have been victims of the manipulation and 
coercion of adult sexual predators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person under the age of 16 is still considered a child in our 
society, deserving and requiring protection.  Although the law 
states that a 14 year old has the legal authority to consent to 
sex with an adult, a person must be a full 18 years of age to 
participate in pornography.  This is because the creation of 
permanent records of teenagers' sexual activities has 
consequences which children of that age may not have sufficient 
maturity to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent Supreme Court of Canada decision in Sharpe, aside 
from two exceptions, substantially upheld this law.  However one 
could argue that the average 14 year old or 15 year old does not 
have the maturity, confidence or understanding to make a rational 
decision to become sexually involved with an adult. 
With regard to children 14 years of age and older, parents really 
have no legal recourse if they find that their child has been 
enticed into a sexual relationship with an adult.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this note I believe that the reintroduction of this bill is 
very timely.  It goes to answer some of the concerns raised by 
the secretary of state or the parliamentary assistant to the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-15 the government has recently introduced long 
needed legislation to protect children from Internet predators. 
Unfortunately, with the current age of sexual consent, this 
protection is only substantially provided to children under 14 
years of age.  Many Canadians, including concerned parents, are 
not aware of this present serious deficiency in the law.  For 
example, a 30 year old man could pose as a 16 year old boy over 
the Internet, converse with a 14 year old girl and lure her to a 
private residence or hotel room.  Provided that he obtains a 
so-called legal consent from the girl, he may legally have sexual 
contact with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has one of the lowest age of consent laws in the 
developed world.  Albania, Bolivia, Colombia, Iran, Kosovo, 
Romania and Serbia are among the nations that have set the age at 
14.  I do not think that is company we should be proud of being 
in with respect to this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, the age of consent in Australia varies depending on 
the region, because of course the criminal law there is state 
based rather than based on the federal government.  It varies 
between 16 and 17, as it does in the United Kingdom.  New 
Zealand's age is also set at 16. The age of consent for most 
American states also ranges from ages 16 to 18.  Only four 
states, Hawaii, Iowa, Missouri and South Carolina, have set the 
age at 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply looking at our counterparts in other developed nations 
should give us an indication that we may need to rethink our 
current age of sexual consent.  For the member opposite to stand 
up and say we need to do more studies on this is simply avoiding 
the problem, trying to excuse years of inaction that the member 
for Calgary Northeast has identified and, to his credit, 
continues to raise in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of groups and lobbyists and others who would 
like to see the legislation changed, including a very prominent 
group in my hometown province, Child Find Manitoba.  This group 
has first hand experience dealing with sexual crimes against 
children and we need to take its concerns seriously.  I recently 
had occasion to meet with members of that group and they are 
clearly concerned about the current age of sexual consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sexual predators need to be controlled by specific constraints 
that are set out in the law.  Setting the age of sexual consent 
at 16 would give parents and law enforcement officers the legal 
protection and authority they need to give these children 
proper protection from predators.  We need to protect these 
children from criminals who use the current law as a defence as 
they coerce children into giving their consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One need not go very far in looking at examples.  Mr. Sharpe, 
whose case was considered by the Supreme Court of Canada, had the 
audacity to say on national TV or radio that because children's 
bodies might be sexually maturing at age 12 he saw this as a 
God-given justification for allowing predators like him to take 
advantage of children like that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to raise the numerous and lengthy arguments about 
why that kind of reasoning is perverse.  I think every member 
here recognizes the perversity of that reasoning and the 
perversity of that individual.  However, it does illustrate that 
there are actually people in our free and democratic society who 
think in that manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment will send a very strong and clear signal from the 
Government of Canada and from this parliament to the people who 
look to parliament to establish these guidelines and these rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking as a former crown prosecutor and as a member of the 
Manitoba attorney general's department for many years, during 
which time I also did child welfare work, the excuse put forward 
by the Liberal member that this is a complex matter is simply not 
correct.  If there was any concern on the part of government 
about this issue, this law could easily accommodate concerns 
raised.  Any consequential amendments that would have to be put 
in place are minor.  It is simply an excuse that should not be 
given any credence here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple reason, the simple answer, is that the government 
does not care enough to make these changes to protect these 
children and to give our parents and our law enforcement 
authorities the necessary jurisdiction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is a very serious issue.  I want to commend the 
member for Calgary Northeast for bringing his private member's 
bill, Bill C-278, to the floor of the House of Commons.  The bill 
would raise the age of sexual consent from 14 to 16 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem is not new to anyone.  It is a very serious problem 
in our society.  I come from British Columbia.  Saanich—Gulf 
Islands is my riding and we witnessed last year the case of John 
Robin Sharpe, who was trying to justify that it is okay to 
sexually abuse young children.  He was trying to suggest that 
child pornography is okay.  That case went to three levels of 
court:  to the B.C. supreme court and the British Columbia Court 
of Appeal, which actually ruled that possession of child 
pornography for one's own personal use was okay in British 
Columbia, and to the Supreme Court of Canada, which thankfully 
was able to see that it was actually not okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are sexual predators in our society.  They are real.  They 
are being released from prison.  They are offending right away in 
many cases.  This is just not okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Manitoba who just spoke said that this amendment 
will send a strong and clear signal from the Government of 
Canada.  Unfortunately it will not, because this private member's 
bill is not votable.  The committee that decides on private 
members' bills decided that this one should not be made votable. 
Members of the House will not even have an opportunity to 
vote the wishes of their constituents on this private member's 
bill, private members' bills being categorized as free votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not acceptable either.  This is not a partisan issue. 
This is not a Canadian Alliance, a Liberal or a Tory issue.  This 
is an issue which a former police officer, the member for Calgary 
Northeast, is bringing to the floor of the House of Commons, and 
it is a very serious concern.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliament of Canada had an opportunity, if it had wanted to 
make this votable, to send a very clear signal about the age of 
sexual consent.  Children 14 years of age are hardly out of 
elementary school.  They are the most vulnerable in our society 
today.  We are sending the wrong message.  In fact I understand 
there are some hon. members who suggest that the age of consent 
should be 12.  Children that age are still in elementary school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally know that the hon. member for Calgary Northeast is 
one of the most honourable of men.  I have the highest 
respect for him.  He is bringing forward a private member's bill 
which should be made votable and it has not been.  We will not 
have the opportunity to send this clear signal.  That is 
troubling.  Why are we not getting this opportunity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the type of thing that Canadians want us to focus on. 
Canadians are looking to us as leaders to put forward 
constructive solutions on justice issues and on so many other 
issues in health care and finance.  I could go on and on.  This 
is just one small snippet.  There are many more.  This is one 
area that the hon. member for Calgary Northeast feels is 
important enough that he has drafted a private member's bill to 
be brought before the House of Commons.  I do not think it is 
acceptable that this bill is not votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a partisan issue.  We as parliamentarians have a 
duty to bring issues like this forward.  I want to commend the 
hon. member for Calgary Northeast for bringing this to the House 
of Commons.  There may be different viewpoints, but I am 100% 
solidly behind this private member's bill.  I think it is 
excellent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would first certainly like to thank those members in 
the House who made very direct presentations in support of my 
bill.  I know that they speak for many others.  Just for the 
record, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, the hon. member for Provencher 
and the hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue when offences like this take place in the 
community—again I am going to say it—is summed up in one word: 
outrage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking through the statistical background of sexual 
offenders in federal correctional institutions at present. 
Unfortunately I could not get the most up to date information, 
but as of December 31, 1997 there were actually 4,591 sex 
offenders under federal jurisdiction.  That does not include 
those under provincial jurisdiction.  That is quite an extensive 
number of individuals.  Twenty-one per cent of the total federal 
offender population is considered to be sex offenders.  The 
average age of sex offenders under federal jurisdiction was 
43 years old.  The oldest sex offender was 89 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just happened that I walked through one of the federal 
institutions one day not too long ago.  That day they admitted an 
83 year old man for a sexual offence.  This is an issue that does 
not diminish with the age of the offender.  The offender 
constantly has this propensity to get involved in this kind of 
criminal activity, picking on our youngest and most vulnerable. 
The victims unfortunately can be of any age, some as young as 
babies in their crib.  This I gathered from my experience in the 
police department in Calgary for 20 some years.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FARM CREDIT CORPORATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK16">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 26 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-25, an act to amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today we are debating Bill C-25, an 
act to amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts.  The first amendment is 
to change the Farm Credit Corporation of Canada to Farm Credit 
Canada, both acronyms being FCC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the Farm Credit Corporation had a $3.5 billion loan 
portfolio.  Information from its director given to us the other 
day in the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food was 
that the portfolio is now in the neighbourhood of $6.8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an obvious need in Canada for the Farm Credit 
Corporation.  The Canadian Alliance Party generally supports 
it.  However the debate today is about amendments to the act that 
would create this credit corporation in Canada.  The vote is 
about the amendments and not whether Canada should have a Farm 
Credit Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation has a role to play.  The question is 
how big a role should that be?  Government lending institutions 
in competition with private and other government lending 
institutions, like the Business Development Corporation, is a big 
question.  Is the Farm Credit Corporation the appropriate vehicle 
for carrying out government policy?  Another big question which 
needs to be answered in this debate is whether it will remain 
focused on the primary producer?  This is a big concern because 
the original purpose of the Farm Credit Corporation was to ensure 
that Canada had, as part of its insurance, a viable agriculture 
sector with the ability to produce food in this country for both 
domestic consumption and export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask at this time, Mr. Speaker, for the consent of the 
House to share my time with the member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, under the bill the 
leading role of the Farm Credit Corporation would be expanded to 
allow the corporation to lend to businesses that were not 
necessarily directly involved in primary agriculture production 
and did not necessarily have farmers as their majority 
shareholders.  This is the first of three major changes proposed 
in the amendments being put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leading role of the Farm Credit Corporation would be 
expanded to allow the corporation to provide equity financing. 
This would be accomplished by allowing farm credit to hold 
non-fixed assets, for example cattle, lend money on that basis 
and hold the cattle as collateral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my time in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police I had quite a 
bit to do with the federal Bankruptcy Act.  There are a whole 
additional set of problems that come along with holding 
collateral that is not real estate or real property. 
This is the area that the Farm Credit Corporation is moving in. 
It may provide some opportunities but it also provides greater 
risk. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 would also formalize the Farm Credit Corporation's 
leasing ability, which could include farm land.  One of the things in 
the bill is that there are no real limits or restrictions on 
FCC activities.  It would allow the FCC to get into a lot of 
areas that maybe it traditionally was not in and would greatly 
expand its operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would expand the focus of the Farm Credit Corporation 
beyond its original purpose to provide financial services only to 
family farms and businesses directly related to primary 
production.  I do not believe it is valid to extend Farm Credit 
Corporation's involvement beyond farming operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of the primary producer, will the farmer benefit? 
Will the farmer have to compete for the available credit?  Will 
he or she end up in a cross-subsidization situation, where other 
agriculture businesses would be receiving the FCC funding at the 
non-primary producer level? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By extending the Farm Credit Corporation's lending abilities 
beyond primary production, the bill would bring the FCC more 
directly into competition with private lending institutions and 
would overlap with government institutions such as the Business 
Development Bank.  We saw the influence that the Prime Minister 
had with the Business Development Bank in a negative way.  We 
have to be concerned that the Farm Credit Corporation does not go 
down that same road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding competition with the banks, the Canadian Imperial Bank 
of Commerce, for instance, is very active in Selkirk—Interlake. 
We do not want to see competition from a government lending 
institution that would have the effect of reducing the ability of 
private institutions such as our locally owned and run credit 
unions to continue to be a part of the communities, carry out the 
funding and lending necessary and actually help stabilize our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation is run out of Regina.  Not every 
small community has a Farm Credit Corporation in town.  That is 
why I caution about the Farm Credit Corporation getting into 
competition with banks and credit unions.  It would be 
one area where expansion would create unfair competition or 
competition that would only be there because of government.  This 
is a good reason to oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 would also formalize Farm Credit Corporation's ability 
to own or lease land.  The FCC stated that this was not the 
intent of the amendment.  It claimed the leasing provisions would 
be for equipment.  However this is not clear in the legislation. 
It is not appropriate for the federal government to be an owner 
of Canadian farm land on a long term basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing the FCC to permanently hold and lease land could result 
in the Canadian government's holding influencing the market value 
of farm land.  Allowing the FCC to hold and lease land 
permanently may also provide the corporation with an incentive 
not to pursue every possible means to allow farmers experiencing 
financial difficulties to stay on the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made the point and will come back to it over the next few 
minutes that the Farm Credit Corporation, like every other crown 
corporation, has as a portion of its mandate the implementation 
and carrying out of policy that comes directly out of the creator 
of the crown corporation, in this case the federal government.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Farm Credit Corporation is an instrument of the 
federal government.  The policies and the dictates of the federal 
government change with the wind sometimes and sometimes for good 
reasons.  However those changing dictates would have the Farm 
Credit Corporation carrying out government policy.  I am not sure 
that it is always the best vehicle for government policy to be 
carried out through a lending institution like the Farm Credit 
Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even under the current legislation, the Farm Credit Corporation 
has become a significant land holder.  In the year 2000 the Farm 
Credit Corporation owned over 360,000 acres, 95% of which was 
held in Saskatchewan, the province that has been hardest hit by 
the farm income crisis 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is impossible for it to avoid holding land for short 
periods of time, the act should and could explicitly state that 
the Farm Credit Corporation should divest of any holdings as 
quickly as possible.  The question of having a time frame in 
there would also be worthwhile looking at.  The price of land is 
determined by market value and that is established over the 
course of years.  Therefore, a time frame could be included, not 
necessarily one year but five years, for the government to 
release its holdings of massive amounts of land for whatever 
reason would be reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25, also extends the Farm Credit Corporation's lending 
ability into the area of equity financing.  This would be done by 
allowing it to hold non-fixed assets, as an example cattle, as 
collateral for these loans.  This change would allow the FCC to 
provide farm financing to primary producers who were not eligible 
under the current legislation.  In many cases this would provide 
financing that would not be available from private lenders.  This 
is a positive change to the legislation, providing the funding is 
limited to primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good parts to this bill but there is also some serious 
concern about the massive expanded role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance policy on this issue states as follow: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will foster a healthy economic environment for the benefit of 
consumers by pursuing free and open trade at home and abroad, 
including the elimination of inter-provincial trade barriers.  We 
will withdraw government from areas of the economy where the 
private sector could deliver the same services more efficiently 
and will end the unfair practice of providing subsidies to 
industries, businesses and special interest groups. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not advocating that the Farm Credit Corporation be 
eliminated or disbanded.  We are putting in a caution to ensure 
that it does not provide unfair competition by getting into an 
area that is being well-serviced by the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 takes the primary focus of the Farm Credit 
Corporation away from providing credit to primary producers. 
The Canadian Alliance believes that this shift is wrong. 
Members who appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food said this was not the case and that 
it would still focus on farmers as primary producers. 
However we all know that as policies change and the government 
dictates to the corporation what it is going to be doing, that focus 
could change.  In fact it may no longer be the case that the primary 
producer is the main beneficiary of the Farm Credit Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of credit, I would like to deal for a minute on 
the present situation in agriculture in western Canada.  It is 
more than credit that is needed there in regard to the overall 
agricultural farm policy and what can be done for the benefit of 
farmers.  What is required is that the federal government get 
out of the way of farmers attempting to accomplish their economic 
objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board from 
Regina has the opportunity to take action with his cabinet and 
government to move the Canadian Wheat Board along on a voluntary 
basis to become a marketer for wheat and barley for those farmers 
who want to have their grain marketed through there.  However for 
those farmers who do not, there should be a choice to market 
their grain otherwise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sole purpose of the Canadian Wheat Board Act is the orderly 
marketing of wheat and barley according to the various sections 
contained in the act.  It is only incidental if it gets a good 
price and passes that price back to farmers.  That is not its 
primary objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in the Farm Credit Corporation, what is wrong with free 
enterprise like the rest of the grains, oilseeds and specialty 
crops are involved in?  What is wrong with free enterprise in the 
marketing of the personal crops that a farmer grows on his or her 
farm?  This is a major issue.  Rather than looking at giving more 
loans to farmers as the government is saying under the Farm 
Credit Corporation and cash advance programs, it should be 
looking at what it could do to lower taxes and change marketing 
so that farmers can actually increase their incomes themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not one other grain, oilseed or specialty crop that is 
fighting to get underneath the monopoly of the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act.  If that does not tell the minister something then I 
do not know what does.  It is one area that would lower the 
necessity for credit if farmers were able to increase the income 
that they could get from wheat and barley that are currently 
constrained under the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the Canadian Wheat Board regulates all of 
Canada outside the designated area as to exports and export 
permits.  The costs of these export permits and the 
administration of them are paid by farmers in the designated 
area.  Money comes out of the pool account for a service that 
farmers are not getting in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, 
but the service is being provided to farmers in other parts of 
the country.  I am asking the auditor general to look into that. 
That issue will be coming up in the next few weeks and months in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the cost for the regulation outside the designated area 
was only one dollar, the real question is:  Why should farmers in 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta have to pay even one lousy 
dollar for a regulation that they receive no benefit from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that will be raised over the upcoming weeks, and I 
am putting the wheat board minister on notice, is why a farmer 
has to buy back his own grain to export it or, in the case of 
organic flour producers, to mill it right in Canada?  Obviously if 
Mr. or Mrs. Farmer could get a permit to export the grain or mill 
their own wheat there is nothing intrinsically wrong or evil in 
milling flour or exporting wheat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only conclusion that I could come to is that the minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board wants to keep farmers 
under the dictatorial powers of the Canadian Wheat Board, which 
it gets through the federal Government of Canada, by forcing the 
buyback provisions on to farmers.  That way the minister 
is able to make sure that it is uneconomical for the farmer to 
have to sell his grain to the Canadian Wheat Board, buy it back 
and then export it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about all the credit we want but there are many 
things like changes to the Canadian Wheat Board, including things 
such as getting rid of the four cent federal excise tax on fuel, 
that would help farmers directly today.  The Farm Credit 
Corporation Act is supposed to be about helping farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it is very important that all of us in the House of 
Commons speak out clearly and loudly to say that there are many 
other things that could be done to help our primary producers. We 
have to get on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested to hear the minister of agriculture's remarks. 
We get some of the real intent of why he put these amendments 
forward.  I will mention just a couple of them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said in his speech that the corporation would assist a 
greater number of agriculture enterprises in creating jobs and 
economic growth in rural Canada.  This points out that it is a 
clear instrument of government policy.  The government is looking 
at somehow using the Farm Credit Corporation to move agriculture 
beyond the crisis to which the throne speech referred.  I do not 
know whether additional bureaucracy and instructions from the 
minister would move agriculture beyond crisis.  We should free 
our farmers up so that they would move beyond crisis if the 
government in some cases just plain gets out of their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also said that there was a definite need for 
services that help farm families make the transition from one 
generation to the next, just as beginning farmers need help in 
getting a solid start.  According to the Farm Credit Corporation, 
it said in committee that it had no plans to be involved in any 
transition project.  The Farm Credit Corporation is supposed to 
be a self-funding institution.  As a result, the question of 
whether or not the taxpayer would be exposed to a much greater 
risk is one that would have to be dealt with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Anderson (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake on his presentation and for sharing his time 
with me.  We are here today to debate Bill C-25, an act to amend 
the Farm Credit Corporation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Farm Credit Corporation, since 1959 when the 
Farm Credit Act was passed, has been to provide 
farmers and those involved directly with production access to 
loan money.  A short history of the FCC shows that major changes 
have happened over the years, but we can see that it has also 
maintained its original mandate of providing loans to primary 
producers over the 40 plus years it has been in existence.  It 
was established in 1959 to provide credit to farmers and 
specifically to primary producers.  At that time the loan rate 
that money was lent to farmers was set at a legislated rate of 
5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1960s saw substantial changes to the FCC from the initiation 
of an appeal board in 1965 to the introduction in 1968 of a 
market formula rate that allowed the FCC for the first time to 
cover the cost of its borrowing.  During the 1970s the FCC 
expanded and in 1978 it posted its first ever surplus.  The 
1980s, however, were a much different story.  This was a 
difficult time for much of the agricultural farm sector.  The FCC 
found itself caught in the agriculture squeeze and the federal 
government was forced to put $600 million into the FCC to keep it 
solvent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Farm Credit Corporation Act was passed allowing the 
FCC more flexibility to fund farmer owned, farmer related 
agricultural proposals.  It was not just farm land that money was 
being lent on, but farm related businesses could also get loans. 
However those farm related businesses had to be controlled by 
primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the FCC has been self-funded and it continues to 
grow, but throughout its 40 plus year history its mandate has 
always been to fund primary producers in their agriculture 
related endeavours.  We are today again debating the future of 
the FCC in Bill C-25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill makes several changes to the Farm Credit Corporation. 
It makes significant changes in some areas and not so significant 
changes in others.  One of the changes involves changing the name 
of the corporation from the Farm Credit Corporation to Farm 
Credit Canada.  This is not a name change that is necessary in 
western Canada where everyone is familiar with the Farm Credit 
Corporation, but it is being done to give it a stronger name 
recognition in the province of Quebec.  I hope that the expense 
can be justified when it comes to changing the name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More substantive changes are being made to the bill than just 
the name change.  I would like to talk about three or four of 
them today.  The first one deals with equity financing.  This 
change is seen as a positive change if it is properly done.  If 
the FCC is to be involved in agriculture lending then it needs to 
move carefully in this direction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members were to take a look at some of the developments in 
agriculture, particularly in western Canada with hog barns being 
built and feedlots being proposed and built, they would see a 
situation where people do not have a lot of collateral to put up 
for these projects.  For the lenders to be involved in that they 
need to be able to take out an equity position in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would allow the FCC to do those kinds of things and 
then to develop its loan portfolio from there. These are projects 
that have a higher than average risk factor to them.  It gives 
people an opportunity to get some financing.  It also gives 
lenders an opportunity to cover their own interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second change the bill proposes is to formalize the lease 
financing arrangement in which the FCC has already taken part. 
Lease financing allows producers some good possibilities as well. 
For different reasons, people sometimes do not want to buy their 
equipment.  Lease financing allows them to lease it.  Leasing for 
some is also a tax decision.  Leasing gives the producer the 
choice of service that he wants to take part in.  It is a good 
opportunity for producers and for the FCC.  The FCC's lease 
financing in the past has been shared with other institutions, 
for example, the CU lease program.  This would give lenders the 
opportunity to protect themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main concerns I have about lease financing is in the 
area of land and how land is handled by the FCC.  It was because 
of the situation through the 1980s that the FCC found itself 
holding in excess of one million acres of land at one point and 
it had to do something with it.  Some of the land was leased back 
to farmers.  Over the years the acreage that it was holding has 
been dropping off, which has been a good thing, but the bill does 
not address the issue of whether the FCC would be into land 
leasing in a big way or not.  From the evidence, it seems that 
the FCC is not interested in that.  If that is the case, it 
should be addressed in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation, in order to be supported, needs to clarify that 
area.  Farmers do not need more competition, particularly from a 
government funded corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main change I see in the bill, and the one that is most 
important, is in the loan eligibility criteria.  Up until 
this point loans that were given out by the FCC had to be given 
to people who were primary producers or the majority of people 
involved in the project had to have been primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 proposes to change that.  It would allow lending to 
ag-related businesses that are not producer controlled or 
producer owned.  The argument for this change is that it would 
help develop value added businesses.  The benefits of this 
argument are outweighed by some potential problems.  I would like 
to talk about two or three of those problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, and most important, the legislation represents a basic 
change in FCC policy and philosophy.  For 40 years the FCC has 
had one mandate, which is to provide primary producers with 
access to credit.  This would change from farmer oriented to 
agribusiness oriented and the focus would shift significantly 
because of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I have a concern over a potential conflict of interest 
in the legislation.  We have seen in the past that other 
semi-independent government institutions have given us examples 
of conflict that we do not want to see in the FCC.  The most 
prominent of these and the most obvious has been the Business 
Development Bank.  We have watched and we have been assured that 
it is business as usual for even the Prime Minister to call these 
institutions to influence loan decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this point the FCC has been free of those problems and 
accusations, as far as I know, and it should stay that way.  The 
legislation brings in a potential conflict of interest problem 
that the FCC and producers do not need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third concern is the possibility of large agribusiness 
corporations or co-operatives coming to the FCC for financing. We 
have seen businesses of different sizes getting in trouble.  For 
the first time the bill would allow the FCC to make large loans 
to large scale businesses.  The problem with that is if that does 
happen it would remove the possibility of financing for smaller 
operators and for farmers.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to wrap up my comments today with some conclusions. 
First, the equity financing provision in the bill is a 
potentially positive addition.  It would be an improvement if it 
were properly and carefully managed.  We will be pushing for 
amendments, however, in a couple of the other areas that I have 
mentioned, particularly in the area of restricting lease 
financing to equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the FCC did have over a million acres in its portfolio, 
it has reduced that.  Two years ago it had 360,000 acres and last 
year it dropped off to 120,000 acres.  From what we see here, it 
is trying to get rid of the land.  We need an amendment that 
would ensure the FCC does not find itself in the same situation 
that it did 10 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, we need an amendment that would continue to 
require that active producers are the majority participants in 
order to be eligible for FCC loans.  This runs contrary to what 
the legislation suggests but, in the interest of primary 
producers, needs to be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 40 years the FCC has been concerned, first and foremost, 
with primary producers and their agricultural operations.  It is 
essential that remains the focus of the FCC business.  The bill 
leads FCC away from that.  The FCC should restrict itself to its 
historical mandate and work to do a good job in that area rather 
than trying to spread itself all over the agricultural landscape. 
Bill C-25 needs some amendments to accomplish that goal. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part today in the debate on Bill 
C-25, an act to amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts. Amending an act 
always has an impact on other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understood the essence of the bill correctly, the Farm 
Credit Corporation is going through an identity crisis. It is 
normal that, at this time and in the current context, the Farm 
Credit Corporation finds itself lacking in identity. 
Is it related to a province, to a country or another country? 
Thus it was decided to settle the identity problem by changing 
the name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am anxious to meet with the officials, at the stage of the 
clause by clause examination of the bill, and see whether they 
can justify why, by changing the name of the corporation and 
giving it a Canadian identity, they are debasing the French 
language in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation used to be called “Société du crédit agricole” 
in French. Now its name will be changed to “Financement agricole 
Canada”, three words with no link between them and no modifiers. 
I wonder what warranted such a change. It could easily have been 
called “Société du crédit agricole du Canada”. Adding “du 
Canada” would have been enough. Why introduce the concept of 
“Financement”? That does not tell us how it is organized. 
This tells us that someone is involved in “financement”. 
Someone, something, some agency somewhere is providing financing 
to the agricultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the effort to find something elegant in French 
has not been excessive, to put it mildly.  I will have some 
questions on this lack of respect for the French language for I 
feel linguistics have been rather short-circuited here.  It 
strikes me as unacceptable that they want to change the name 
while not respecting the essential elements of the language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the minister has raised three points in his 
speech, while the summary gives six reasons for changing this 
bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech the minister referred to his desire to extend the 
corporation's capabilities to provide services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In itself that is good news because our farmers have told us 
on a number of occasions that theirs is a sector in crisis. 
Farmers need to see financial steps taken to allow them to keep 
going, either to get through bad times, or to develop, create 
more employment and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So extending the scope of services is, in itself, a good thing. 
The desire to do so however must not allow the new Farm Credit 
Corporation to go beyond the primary sector, for example, and to 
focus increasingly on financing the processing sector to the 
detriment of the production side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not see anything in the bill in the way of a safety 
valve—or a guarantee or security—that would enable 
us to be absolutely certain that farm credit in Canada will not 
suddenly become obsessed by profit, like all funding agencies, 
and want to neglect the primary sector, the agricultural 
producers, in order to make more profit by supporting 
second level development, for example the processing sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second objective is to help family farms achieve their 
long term goals. 
This is good news because we see more and more a tendency where 
family farms are disappearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend I took part in a symposium in 
Sainte-Croix-de-Lotbinière where farmers had chosen as a meeting 
theme “Rethinking Agriculture”.  They are concerned, and rightly 
so, about industrial farm development at the expense of family 
farming, which is reasonably big and allows a family with a few 
children to live from farming and to leave a legacy to its 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see the increasingly huge developments in different 
sectors and, as a farmer put it, when they have to leave 
$2 million of rigging to their children before leaving them their 
assets, there are few young people who will be able to become 
farmers if we do not pay attention to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all the more important because, if we neglect family 
farm production—the small farm,—our rural communities 
will be depopulated. A farmer told me that in his village in 
Kamouraska there is only one child. There are no other 
children. They have all gone because there is no longer a 
school. Instead of taking the bus to get to the neighbouring 
village, people move directly to that village. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some villages there are four, five or six abandoned farms 
that were, not too long ago, during the settlement, cleared away 
and returned to farming, and that are now lying fallow and quite 
often returned to the forest because there are no other means 
of supporting the young people who would like to move there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the Farm Credit Corporation will always have as a 
goal the provision of long term support to an increasing number 
of family farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, there is an issue which will have to be dealt with and 
which is a real social problem. It has to do with the third goal 
of the bill, which is to help family farms make the transition from 
one generation to the next. This issue will really have to be 
dealt with.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to find incentives and other measures to facilitate 
passing on farms from one generation to the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a farmer is unable to pass on his farm to his son because 
most of it will go to income tax, there is a major problem 
because people will try to sell their properties instead of 
trying to find solutions to the situation. We will have to deal 
with this problem and help families to pass on their properties 
to the next generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reviewing the goals of the bill we see that, according to 
the information we were given, there were several series of 
consultations before the bill was introduced. It seems that 
those responsible for the Farm Credit Corporation have consulted 
several agricultural organizations and that a majority of them 
were favourable to the proposals contained in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Quebec looks favourably upon the amendments 
contained in the bill, but it believes that the new corporation 
should continue to play a limited role in Quebec's agricultural 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Quebec government would like the new agency to play 
fair and avoid providing, in Quebec, loans at below market 
rates. It would not like Farm Credit Canada to take hold of the 
Quebec market by offering discount rates, as is already being 
done to a point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard complaints by some credit unions and information to the 
effect that in certain areas even the National Bank is a 
victim of the current Farm Credit Canada, which is providing 
loans at below market rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this new agency will have to abide by the market 
rules and abstain from providing lower rates to attract 
potential clients. It is extremely important that the agency be 
very cautious with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UPA, or Union des producteurs agricoles du Québec, was 
indeed consulted in 1999. It agreed with the principles of the 
bill being discussed then and it should still agree with this 
bill, provided it has not been changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the UPA has one serious reservation. It is against any 
direct loan by the new agency to companies that are exclusively 
in the processing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my preamble, Farm Credit Canada should not shift 
its focus from the primary sector to the processing sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also concerned that that could result in a shift in Farm 
Credit Canada's mandate where it would end up supporting the 
processing sector to the detriment of the primary sector, which 
could jeopardize the great objectives the minister of 
agriculture was talking about last week and I also mentioned 
earlier, namely helping young farm families to settle in and 
to inherit their parents' properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Farm Credit Canada changes and ends up giving preferred 
treatment to processing, we could have problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What led the government to pot for the changes it is introducing 
today? I can think of three, including the need to give farmers 
greater choice in financial and commercial services. Per se, 
that is good news. When a farmer goes to a bank, a caisse 
populaire or to Farm Credit Canada, he will probably be able to 
negotiate better conditions if there is competition. He will 
sometimes be able to find a better account or better loan 
conditions by comparing. It is very important that the Corporation 
not make it a policy to offer the lowest rates at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot usher a farmer into its office and say “How much did 
the bank want?  How much did the caisse want?  I will give a 
lower rate to start with”.  It should not work like that 
otherwise it would be really unpleasant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another principle underlying the amendments is the need for 
greater structural flexibility.  Farm producers have often told 
us that greater flexibility is needed.  The rules are often 
complicated and complex.  The bureaucracy is heavy and things no 
longer get done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Farm Credit Canada—I have a hard time remembering that name, 
because it means nothing in French and is impossible to 
remember—has greater flexibility, it will be farmers who 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also wants to create partnerships, which will 
serve farmers over the long term. 
This too is very interesting to imagine.  Although it is not 
possible at the moment, we can see that in the economic 
development of our regions, it would be extremely important to 
be able to create partnerships because the resources we need 
are not always available among our young people or farmers 
themselves.  It is important to be able to create partnerships 
if we are to develop the economies of our regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government should be concerned about examining the state of 
the regions at the moment.  Resource regions are losing their 
populations.  The day the resource remains, but the people have 
left, we will pay a whole lot more to recover the resources in 
these regions than we do at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vital we keep our resource regions alive, that is, with an 
economy to support the existence of the local market, the gas 
station, the confectionery store, the grocery store, the school, 
the church, the caisse populaire, and so on.  If we do not keep 
this in our regions, we will wake up to the fact that it will be too 
late.  Special programs will be required to recover the land we 
gave up.  This is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the main changes?  First there is a name change and 
the name is not entirely a success.  I hope we will get some 
explanation and at least have a full sentence in the bill.  If 
I get an answer like “The lawyers suggested it”, I will remember that 
lawyers specialize in the law, not in language, as I have always 
known.  It is because they have such a hard time drafting 
legislation that we have so many trials. 
If they were as rigorous with the language, if they took words 
for what they mean, there would be fewer trials to interpret 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I am told that lawyers provide linguistic help I think 
there is a problem in terms of understanding people's respective 
responsibilities. A lawyer is competent in the legal field, but 
language is not necessarily his forte. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main changes will allow the corporation to provide business 
services to producers, directly or through a partnership. These 
services include business and estate planning and also land 
management.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our aging population it will be extremely important—and I 
support the idea—to ensure that this corporation can help our 
communities in the estate planning area since it is critical to 
ensure that the land is passed on, under acceptable conditions, 
to members of the younger generation who are interested in 
carrying on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These services are already provided in certain areas, but the 
bill seeks to make them accessible in every rural area in the 
country and this is a positive point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will also allow the corporation to provide lease 
financing to farm producers. The current act does not prevent 
the corporation from providing such financing, but the bill will 
clarify and define its scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As can be seen in the automobile industry, an 
extremely important factor has been to allow people to drive more 
comfortable and better cars since many are taking advantage of 
the option to replace their vehicles at regular intervals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a young person who wishes to go into farming or take over 
the family farm but wants to acquire more modern equipment, I 
think that leasing is probably a more interesting approach for 
him to consider, or at least to think that it might be available 
instead of thinking that he has to tie up $200,000, $300,000 or 
$400,000 in equipment, before even starting to plant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would also give producers and farm corporations access to 
equity financing.  The corporation will thus be able to share 
directly in the business capital or use these investments to 
attract other investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This too is excellent news for our producers, for our farming 
co-operatives, and for the projects that our farmers are 
developing in certain sectors short of resources.  This is 
surely a very good prospect for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the corporation will be to provide financial 
services to businesses related to farming.  Here again—I wish to 
be clear about this, and we will be discussing this at committee 
stage—it will be necessary to ensure that this represents 
perhaps a percentage of the financial products devoted to this 
and to ensure that the primary sector will not suffer as a 
result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the corporation will be able to create subsidiaries to 
form partnerships which will provide new services independently 
of the existing corporation. 
This too is good news but, again, care must be taken to avoid 
having the legislator's intention circumvented by the kind of 
flexibility the government wishes to introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to tell the House that the Bloc Quebecois will be 
supporting this bill and that we will do everything we can to 
see that it is passed as quickly as possible so that farmers can 
benefit from the services which this new legislation will offer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise 
to speak to the upcoming changes for the FCC.  I am speaking on 
behalf of our agricultural critic, the hon. member for Palliser, 
who unfortunately could not be with us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also a special hello and thanks to the dozens of farmers in my 
riding of Musquodoboit Valley.  They are some of the best 
producers in the entire country.  I am very proud to stand in the 
House to represent them and quite proudly say to them that I and 
my party support the thrust of this bill, although there are 
always a couple of cautions that need to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, we thank the government for these much needed changes. 
Similar to our colleague from the Bloc, we hope they pass fairly 
quickly.  Above all we hope the constant consultation and 
dialogue with the main producers and with those people directly 
affected by the legislation continues.  That dialogue is 
extremely important for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who could forget the crisis in the agricultural industry over 
the last few years?  Many of us were at farm rallies on the Hill 
and at rallies held throughout the country, especially in the 
prairie provinces.  Statistics show that over the last two years 
22,000 families in the western provinces alone have left the 
farm.  If that does not constitute a crisis in the industry, I am 
not sure what does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a fairly new MP, going into my fourth year in this place, 
I always felt that it should be up to the Government of Canada, 
irrespective of one's political leanings, to look after our 
agricultural industry.  If we do not do this to the best of our 
ability then unfortunately we will seriously neglect what I 
consider the most important industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members had breakfast this morning and when they have 
dinner tonight, I hope they appreciate the people who are willing 
to get up at all hours of the day to sow the seeds so our 
families can be nourished.  I think I speak for all members of 
parliament when I say we are extremely proud of the Canadian 
agriculture industry.   We are very proud of the thousands of 
farmers and their families who toil in the fields and factories 
so we can provide nourishment to our families on an ongoing 
basis.  Above all they do it fairly cheaply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Food costs in Canada as compared to other countries are 
relatively inexpensive.  People who suffer through tight 
financial times always worry about the cost of putting food on 
the table.  When we look at the overall picture of what it costs 
to put food on our table compared to other items which we 
purchase such as shelter, clothing, home heating oil et cetera, 
food is relatively inexpensive.  Therein lies one of the problems 
we are facing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The price that producers get for their product is very low. This 
is one of the crises we have.  Wheat is made into bread and the 
bread is sold in the stores but the price of that generally goes 
to the middle man; the marketers, store owners and so on. If a 
loaf of bread cost $1, I believe the primary producer may get 
about 6 cents.  That has to change so our primary producers who 
feed us and export to other countries get better value for the 
work they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC is a wonderful institution for farmers when they need to 
diversify or when they need to purchase new equipment in order to 
ascertain future funding so they can carry on their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young man from Saskatchewan with his family and many other 
farmers appeared before our caucus a few months ago to describe 
the scene on the family farm.  I asked this young man, who was 
about 12 years old, if he was going into farming like his father 
and grandfather.  He said no.  I asked if there was anybody 
else in his classroom who was thinking about taking up 
agriculture as a livelihood.  The young man again said no. 
That begs this question:  Who are going to be the farmers of 
tomorrow?  We know who the farmers are today, and many of them 
are going through a crisis because they are not sure if they will 
be able to make out the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody likes to go from crisis to crisis year in and year out. 
Farmers know very well that historically there have been great 
years and poor years.  They have always got through those years. 
However a tremendous number of farmers from coast to coast, not 
just in the prairies but in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, 
are going through a very difficult time.  Anything the federal 
government can do to assist them should be done very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appalls me at times when I hear the federal government say 
that it has a new aid package based on provincial funding and 
that it will give $6 out of every dollar for aid but the 
provinces have to come up with the other $4.  Nova Scotia is 
going through a pretty severe debt and deficit situation right 
now.  It simply does not have additional funding to give to its 
farmers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia rightfully says that if the federal government is 
swimming in billions of dollars of taxpayer money then at least 
it should assist those provinces and others with more funding for 
farmers, at least to get them through this crisis stage so they 
can set up long term arrangements for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the federal agriculture minister from Ontario is a decent 
fellow, but he made a comment regarding P.E.I. potato farmers 
that I am sure he will live to regret for the rest of his days. 
He said that maybe those potato producers should grow something 
else because of the recent battle with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is easy for someone to say, but P.E.I. grows some of the 
best potatoes on the entire planet.  They have diversified in 
potato farming.  The infrastructure, the machinery, the plants 
and the workers were set up for that.  Then the federal 
agriculture minister turns around and says that the battle with 
the United States is pretty tough so maybe they should grow 
something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal minister honestly believes that, which I am sure 
he probably does not, then P.E.I. potato producers should say 
“Okay, Mr. Minister, if we are to diversify, what should we 
diversify into?  Is the federal government going to provide the 
funding for us to diversify?”  If that is indeed the case, the 
minister should back it up with dollars and then maybe some of 
those producers will grow something else.  If the minister is 
suggesting that they need to grow something else after they 
already grow the number one potato product in the country—at 
least that is my biased opinion, coming as I do from Atlantic 
Canada—then he should at least back it up with some dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall the changes in the FCC are positive, as long as the FCC 
continues to focus on the primary producer.  That is essential. 
The Canadian Federation of Agriculture has indicated to us that 
it has no overall objections to the legislation.  Credit Union 
Central of Canada, representing credit unions across the 
country, formed a committee to study this legislation.  During 
the consultation process it fully supported the proposal as long 
as credit unions could participate in some of the services, 
equity financing and partnerships.  This of course would include 
the caisses populaires of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This aspect of it is extremely important.  Bill C-8, the 
financial restructuring act, is now going through the House.  It 
has gone through this place and is on its way to the Senate, 
ready for royal assent.  It will create great change in the 
financial sector in the country.  When all those changes happen 
it will be extremely important to ensure that agencies such as 
credit unions and caisses populaires, which play vitally 
important roles in our country, especially in rural Canada where 
most of our farms and primary producers are based, have an 
important say and a role in the future of how FCC does its 
business.  If they do, they will continue to have our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Farmers Union is concerned that the FCC may soften 
its focus on family farms and primary production.  The government 
and the FCC have made a commitment that farming and the primary 
producer would continue to be the main focus of the corporation. 
That is essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to maintain the so far lukewarm support of the National 
Farmers Union, which represents a tremendous number of farmers 
across the country, it is imperative that the government and 
whatever party is in government years down the road continue that 
important dialogue with groups such as the National Farmers Union 
to ensure that primary producers rural communities and 
those family farms are indeed integral to any decisions made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to do that is with open and transparent 
consultation.  The federal government has been blamed many 
times—I think of the Sea King operation for example—for hiding 
behind its words, for other concerns it tries to hide from, and 
for not being completely open and transparent.  I beg the 
government to ensure that it does not do this with our 
agricultural concerns.  That would be a very sad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation's main focus would continue to be small and 
medium sized operations that contribute to local communities.  We 
have to take the government and the directors of the FCC at their 
word.  If indeed that is correct, they will have our support and 
the support of many family farms throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, again I would like to remind the government and those 
in opposition right across the country that it is imperative to 
maintain that and not lose sight of the main focus in years to 
come. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the FCC has only a handful of accounts with businesses 
that have revenues over $5 million.  The majority of its day to 
day business is indeed with small and medium sized family farms. 
That is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern in regard to a lot of family farms these days is 
lease financing.  Under the new legislation the FCC would offer 
lease financing directly to or in partnership with agricultural 
operators.  There is a growing need for lease financing in the 
agricultural industry for operators who want to manage cash flows 
with increased flexibility.  The 1993 act does not prevent FCC 
from offering lease financing.  However, the new amendments 
clarify the scope of the corporation's service in that area. More 
important, with a more flexible financial structure the FCC will 
be able to create subsidiaries to partner with other 
organizations in offering more comprehensive financial packages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-8 and the concentration of our financial 
institutions, it is very important, at least in my mind, that 
farmers and primary producers have the option and flexibility to 
look for the best rates when it comes to their lending needs. The 
corporation would have access to additional financial management 
tools to secure its portfolio and offer expanded services to 
agricultural operations.  A more flexible financial structure 
contributes to the viability of the FCC and its ability to serve 
agriculture in the long term.  That is definitely what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country deserves and demands an agricultural policy from A 
to Z that really meets the needs of the family farm and medium 
sized producers and ascertains and tells Canadians once and for 
all that in this country we will be able now and in the future to 
feed ourselves.  An awful lot of people are concerned that we as 
a country may be losing our agricultural sovereignty.  We simply 
cannot allow that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help but notice that one of the greatest fighters 
for the family farm, a gentleman from Ontario, is in the House 
today.  I thank him for his personal efforts in bringing the 
issue of the family farm to the House of Commons and to his own 
government.  He should be complimented for his work in creating 
awareness of the crisis on the family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other concerns throughout the country.  We would like 
to ensure that the family farm issue is not just not a debate in 
the House and is then forgotten.  We would like the family farm 
issue to continue in the House and we would like to ensure that 
when changes need to occur we can meet those changes along the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure every September and October when I 
come to Ottawa to bring with me about 100 pounds of Annapolis 
Valley apples of various descriptions.  I hand them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Bring lobsters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  My colleague from Brandon—Souris 
would like me to bring lobsters.  I can do that tomorrow if he 
wishes.  We could have lunch together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like bringing the Annapolis apples to Ottawa because I pick 
them right from the trees and hand them out to the first 100 
people I see.  Those apples are from farmers and producers and 
their families who are very proud of what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All who go to the beautiful Annapolis Valley will see for 
themselves the pride of the communities in regard to growing a 
tremendous product.  Anyone seeing the farms in Prince Edward 
Island will see the pride of farmers in producing those great 
potatoes.  A great songwriter in Canada, Stompin' Tom Connors, 
wrote a great song called <I>Bud the Spud</I>.  I highly recommend 
listening to that song in lighter moments.  It is absolutely 
fabulous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already debated what farming does for us in terms of 
being able to feed ourselves and in maintaining an agricultural 
policy.  However, a majority of Canadians now live in urban 
centres and some of them have forgotten what it is like to be on 
a family farm.  I highly recommend that all members of parliament 
and their families take time out of their busy lives to visit a 
family farm and thank farmers for the work they do and for 
maintaining the high standards of quality of the food we consume 
on a daily basis.  Without farmers the country would be at a 
severe loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of farmers in my riding of Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore, it gives me great pleasure to rise today 
in support of this bill.  We agree with the government that it 
should be moved ahead fairly quickly so that the farmers and 
primary producers of the country can get on with their busy 
lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to take a couple of minutes to first of all address 
the remarks of my colleague from the New Democratic Party, who 
touched on the fact that urban members do not seem to really 
understand the stresses and strains in agriculture, but I know 
all members of parliament understand that the hourglass is 
running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks are for the hon. member and, I hope, for 
officials in the department of agriculture.  On February 20, all 
of us in the Chamber gathered together to say that we wanted to 
do more, that we wanted to support our Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food at the cabinet table and make sure there were 
sufficient funds for this spring for seeding on April 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was home on the weekend and I have to confess that I am 
absolutely embarrassed.  That $500 million in extra money that 
all members of parliament, all parties under the leadership of 
our minister of agriculture, managed to get through the system 
has not been sent out.  Farmers are out there.  Anybody who takes 
a drive in the country these days can see everybody is out there 
planting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about urban people not really being as sensitive as they 
should be to the challenges and stresses of the Canadian family 
farm, but, Mr. Speaker, I would like through you to say to 
officials in all the ministries of agriculture across Canada and 
in the department of agriculture and the treasury board, wherever 
they process that money, to please get it out because it was the 
unanimous position of the House of Commons that it was to be out 
by the end of March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comment.  He is right about the $500 million being 
allocated on February 20.  We on this side of the House and 
others have agreed that was about $400 million short.  However 
the fact is that the delay of that money, which did not get sent 
out when it should have, is absolutely inexcusable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take just a moment to mention the member for Malpeque, 
P.E.I., who has been very critical of the department of 
agriculture for really being out of touch with what is happening 
on the family farm.  I believe his criticism is rightfully placed 
because the department is simply out of touch with family farms 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member from the Liberal Party that I 
believe all he really has to do is walk over to the Minister of 
Finance and the Prime Minister, tap them on the shoulder during 
question period and tell them to get on with the job of looking 
after our family farms.  We would be very supportive of that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the comments from the previous speaker.  We have gone 
off in a different direction with respect to the bill before us 
right now, the bill dealing with the Farm Credit 
Corporation.  However I will touch on that other direction just 
for a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are well aware, I am the Progressive Conservative 
Party critic for agriculture.  I have obviously had a lot of 
dealings not only with members on this side but with members on 
the government side as well as producers.  In my constituency, 
agriculture is the backbone of our economy and therefore I deal 
with this issue on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the dollars that were earmarked for the agricultural 
economy, dollars that were to go back to producers, the $500 
million, different provinces are providing those dollars in 
different fashions.  In Manitoba we call it CMAP 2, the second 
program.  With provincial and federal contributions, it will come 
to about $92 million.  That has been capped at about $11,000 for 
each producer.  To the member for Toronto—Danforth, $11,000 
might sound like an awful lot.  However, currently it is costing 
the average producer somewhere in the neighbourhood of $120,000 
to $150,000 to put a crop in the ground. 
Input costs such as those for fertilizer, gas and pesticides are 
included.  Therefore the $11,000 is not a substantial amount of 
money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore was 
right when he indicated that there was an additional requirement 
for $400 million.  That would have brought it up to what we 
consider to be a reasonable limit of $900 million at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into a debate, but every member on that 
side of the House stood and voted against an additional $400 
million. It was not a non-confidence motion.  It was just not 
meant to be.  The amount of dollars that were necessary at the 
time were not forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For producers who will receive their portion of the $500 
million, it is not sufficient to keep most of them on the land, 
on the farms this year.  A long term well thought out safety net 
policy is necessary and must come forward, a policy that would 
allow farmers some glimmer of hope they can produce crops that 
pay a fair price for a commodity and that they can continue 
farming not only in their lifetimes but hopefully into the 
lifetimes of their children and their grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here not only to talk about agriculture but a component 
of agriculture, the Farm Credit Corporation.  As we have seen in 
the debate, agriculture has changed over the last number of 
years.  It has changed effectively from last year.  The Farm 
Credit Corporation has to maintain its ability to compete in that 
world of change in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation was created on October 5, 1959 by 
the Diefenbaker Conservative government when the Farm Credit Act 
was proclaimed into Canadian law to provide a consistent source 
of lending services that farmers could rely on through all 
economic cycles.  At that time the corporation was mandated to 
provide one product at a fixed rate, that is first mortgage loans 
to farmers to a maximum $20,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention that because we have come a long way from 1959 to 
today, and the Farm Credit Corporation has to move with that 
change within the agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the first 34 years the Farm Credit Corporation and the 
Farm Credit Act went through many evolutions to keep step with 
the agriculture industry.  In 1968 farming corporations became 
eligible for FCC loans.  Loan limits increased to $150,000 in 
1975. In 1982 amendments to the act led to the introduction of 
more loan products and the FCC made its debut on the capital 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Farm Credit Act was replaced with the Farm Credit 
Corporation Act, which expanded the mandate of the FCC to better 
respond to the needs of the agricultural sector.  The FCC could 
now offer products such as financing to purchase or improve 
farmland and buildings, buying personal property for farming 
purposes and consolidating debts.  It enabled the corporation to 
support value added production by providing financing for 
diversified enterprises on or off the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act has helped bring the FCC in sync with the changing 
marketplace.  The Farm Credit Corporation loan portfolio has 
grown from $3.4 billion in 1993 when the act was introduced to $6 
billion today.  At present the crown corporation serves 44,000 
customers with 900 employees in 100 offices across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation is a good corporate citizen.  It is 
there for a purpose.  Back in 1959 the purpose was identified, 
the need was identified and the Farm Credit Corporation was born. 
It is a good crown corporation that provides a very valuable 
service to many farm customers across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bank.  Let us make no mistake about that.  I can go out 
and find people anywhere who do not like dealing with banks of

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes people who borrow money do not like paying it back and 
therefore the bank is at fault.  The FCC is a good bank.  It does 
its business properly.  It puts money into the agricultural 
sector.  It gets the money back from producers and puts it back 
into the sector again.  It is self-sufficient and 
self-supporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the FCC put record amounts of dollars back into the 
farm economy.  A record amount of $1.7 billion was lent to 
agriculture producers.  We recognize that there are some 
difficulties in the farm economy right now. Why is it that 
banks are lending a record amount of $1.7 billion?  Is most of it 
rewriting old notes and old loans?  The answer I was given was 
no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About $200 million of it was rewriting old notes, but $1.5 
billion was new money going back to people to expand their farm 
operations, to put in different types of operations, agriculture 
operating practices and value added processing units.  It is good 
money and good business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bank must expand its abilities to be able to compete in a 
world where agriculture needs new and innovative measures and 
programs.  It has done that since 1959 when it started with a 
maximum $20,000 mortgage loan at one rate.  It has gone the whole 
gambit now.  The act would allow the Farm Credit Corporation to 
put forward new products to producers that would help them 
continue their operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative government improved the way FCC was 
managed.  We brought in the FCC equity building plan in 1990 to 
allow farmers to extend their leases and buy back land once they 
were on firmer financial ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservatives moved the head office of FCC to 
Regina so that it could be closer to those who it serviced the 
most, namely the majority of customers in Saskatchewan, Manitoba 
and Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We passed a bill to expand the role of FCC allowing it to make 
loans to farmers who wanted to diversify their operations. The 
bank was able to and allowed to put more dollars into the pockets 
of farmers who wanted to diversify their operations and become 
better at what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of components in Bill C-25 that I would like 
to speak to and in some cases I wish to question.  In every 
legislation one wants to hear from the people whom it will 
affect.  We also want to hear the ups and downs or the pros and 
cons of amendments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention another point. The president of the FCC 
appeared before the agriculture committee last week.  I stood in 
the House about a week ago on a piece of private member's 
business and suggested having crown corporations including the 
Canadian Wheat Board open to access to information guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the government argued against me quite vehemently. 
They suggested it was my backdoor way of trying to get at the 
Canadian Wheat Board, which in fact it was not.  It was simply a 
matter of trying to have transparency and accountability in a 
crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC is a crown corporation.  I asked the president if the 
FCC was eligible under the Access to Information Act and he said 
that it was.  I can file an access to information request with 
respect to the FCC and I would then have access to that 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the president if it was a real deterrent in a very 
competitive business like banking.  He explained to us that it 
was not the case, that he did have the ability under the act to 
withhold some very sensitive information that would be a 
detriment to the competitiveness of the business, but he said in 
general terms that having to deal under the Access to Information 
Act was not an impediment to its operation.  I say to the 
government side that here is one crown corporation, which is in a 
very competitive business with banks, credit unions and other 
financial lending institutions, that can work under those 
circumstances and still have access to information available in 
its crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a step in the right direction.  The PC Party will be 
supporting reference of the bill to committee after second 
reading.  We look forward to asking specific questions of 
stakeholders who will come before the committee to give their 
impressions of the legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing the bill would do is change the name from Farm 
Credit Corporation, the name which I grew up with and know very 
well, to Farm Credit Canada.  There is not much differentiation 
between Farm Credit Canada and the Farm Credit Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize FCC as a federal institution.  I am told that 
the only reason this is to happen is so that more credit can be 
given to the federal government. When customers go to farm 
credit Canada as a crown corporation, they will recognize it as a 
Canadian federal institution as opposed to a provincial 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me there is much in a name.  Perhaps there are reasons that 
can be explained to me as to why this is absolutely necessary.  I 
would also like to know what the costs are in changing the name 
from Farm Credit Corporation to Farm Credit Canada.  Changes in 
the letterhead, operating tools, all the documents and required 
legal changes in a name change may well have a huge cost 
associated with them.  Perhaps it would be better to use those 
dollars to give producers a lesser rate, or perhaps even more 
support systems to producers, than simply to change the name.  We 
would have to debate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the FCC would be expanded from financial services 
to farming operations and businesses related to farming, to 
business services and products to such enterprises.  That in 
itself is broadening the mandate of the FCC, of which our party 
approves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farming is changing quite dramatically.  In my constituency 
alone the majority of the economy is either directly or 
indirectly related to agriculture.  We have often said that we 
cannot simply sell the raw material at the farm gate and expect 
an income generated that would allow people to stay on the farm. 
We have to value add.  We have to add to the product. We have to 
make sure that those businesses are set up to take a raw material 
and make it into something more than just simply a bushel of 
wheat or a bushel of barley going some place else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means a number of opportunities.  In my area in particular 
we have a state of the art hog processing plant which means that 
more raw material must be produced.  That raw material requires a 
lot of investment in hog farms, cattle operations and chicken 
farms.  The FCC must have the ability to be able to finance those 
types of operations to allow for diversification in the 
agricultural community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that, looking into the production services and processing 
services of other businesses can now go forward.  We have around my 
area an isoboard plant that produces strawboard.  FCC should, 
does and would have the ability to fund those operations so that 
straw taken from agricultural production could go into the 
production of another commodity that has value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC should also have the ability to do equity deals, another 
opportunity in expansion of the services that it would be able to 
provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC would have the authority to provide loans to businesses 
related to farming in both cases where the business is majority 
owned by farmers and where it is not.  Currently it has to be 
owned by farmers.  Now it can go outside those guidelines, 
outside the box, and allow dollars to go to loans given to 
corporations which do not have any direct farmer impact.  That is 
good as it expands the services available from the FCC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC would be given authority to incorporate, amalgamate and 
dissolve subsidiaries.  It would be able to provide lease 
financing for assets to be used in a farming operation or a 
business related to farming.  This again is a change in the FCC 
mandate where there could be lease financing for assets.  This 
would allow operations to free up cashflows to go into the 
operation or expansion of their businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC would be given the authority to acquire and dispose of 
equity interests in farming operations or in businesses related 
to farming.  The president of the FCC would be designated as its 
CEO.  A provision would be made for the appointment of an acting 
president and an acting chairperson where necessary.  This is 
just good business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the FCC is a well run and 
self-sufficient corporation.  It has $6 billion outstanding in 
loans, but it must get with the program of today's 21st century 
operations of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are potential questions and criticisms.  I mentioned the 
name change and the cost.  The bill has the potential to 
unnecessarily compete directly with credit unions and banks.  The 
purpose of the FCC is to provide loans to farmers and not to 
equipment dealers and wheat pools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that we must question this, not necessarily disagree with 
it.  It must expand its opportunities to compete.  Competition in 
the banking industry is not so terrible, and neither is 
competition in grain marketing.  Banks and credit unions can 
compete effectively with the FCC.  I do not believe the rules 
have unfair advantages for the FCC and I am sure banking 
institutions see it the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill expands the lending powers of the FCC, farmers 
do not need more debt.  That is one of my concerns.  Extending 
more credit to farmers is perhaps not the best thing for farmers 
who already have substantial debt.  Unfortunately banking 
institutions too often are more the problem than the solution. 
Where there is equity in the land moneys will be given to 
farmers, and that is not necessarily the best thing.  However I 
have faith in the FCC to know what is best for it, for its 
customers and for the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not heard a lot from other members, stakeholders or 
industry groups, but that is what the committee is all about. 
Perhaps when witnesses appear we will have a chance to examine 
the bill more thoroughly and get their input into what is good or 
bad about the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party we 
will be supporting this piece of legislation.  I agree in all 
sincerity with the mandate of the Farm Credit Corporation.  It 
does an exceptional job, considering that it is a bank and that 
people have as much respect for bankers as they do for 
politicians.  However as a banking facility it does, in my 
opinion, provide the services that are needed in the agricultural 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to coming back to the House after committee and 
perhaps putting forth amendments.  I certainly look forward to 
coming back at third reading and suggesting that some of the 
stakeholders proposed good changes to what I consider a good 
piece of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will direct a question to the hon. 
member from the Conservative Party.  It concerns the flooding 
that occurred in the southwest of his constituency and in the 
southeast of my constituency.  About 100,000 acres in my 
constituency are under water at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to those years as they relate to the Farm Credit 
Corporation because the people in that corner of my constituency 
and in the corner of the hon. member's constituency have never 
financially recovered from the flood.  I wonder if the new 
regulations of the Farm Credit Corporation will venture into that 
broke and devastated area and see fit to help those people get 
back into the farming economy.  With pictures like the one I have 
right now, we can see those people are finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to get crop insurance farmers had to put a crop in. 
They also had to take it off, so they took off barley that 
weighed about 38 pounds and oats that weighed under 30 pounds and 
they still have it in their bins.  They cannot sell it or give it 
away, and yet when they applied for the AIDA program they had to 
list it as a saleable commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think the new bill we are debating will help 
people in Gainsborough, Saskatchewan, or Melita, Manitoba?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know where the member 
for Souris—Moose Mountain's sympathies lie.  I sympathized with 
producers in my area and his area in 1999 when a lot of our 
constituents were unable to put in a crop.  The worst thing that 
can happen for a producer is to see land sitting there and not 
allow it to grow a crop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could stand here and argue the insensitivity of the government 
in not providing proper support to the area as it did for the ice 
storm, the Red River Valley flood and other situations. However 
that is not the question.  The question is whether the bill will 
allow the FCC to put the proper tools and money back into those 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC always had the tools to put money into those areas but 
on an individual, one on one basis.  The hon. member is a farmer. 
He recognizes that different operations are handled differently. 
Each operation has different commodities, different debt loads 
and different cash flows, and each must be dealt with 
individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC, as any other bank, looks at the likelihood of repayment 
as the final requirement in deciding whether to put more dollars 
into those areas.  I believe the FCC would consider investing in 
those areas, certainly more so than some of the large national 
banks that are pulling out of them.  I am sure the member would 
agree that banks are not as forthcoming with agriculture, whether 
in our areas or other areas.  Only the FCC would consider 
investing in those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Credit unions may consider it as well.  I give credit 
unions a lot of support for going into smaller areas and putting 
money back into the agricultural community, particularly in our 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are finding it tough.  There is no question.  Some people in 
the area affected by the flood will not put in crops this year. 
It is as simple as that.  Will the land be farmed?  In most 
cases, yes.  It will be rented out and farmed by someone else, but 
perhaps not by the right people.  It should be farmed by the 
people who owned it originally but they have decided to get out 
of farming.  That is sad.  It is something we try to prevent, but 
unfortunately the government does not listen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question is for the hon. member 
for Brandon—Souris.  As he knows, the FCC has now expanded 
outside agriculture and into aquaculture.  Should aquaculture be 
under the authority of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans or 
the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many commercial fishermen and the Canadian Council of 
Professional Fish Harvesters have expressed concern about 
government lending to aquaculture sites when environmental 
concerns about aquaculture have not yet been fully debated or 
researched.  Does he or his party have concerns about funding to 
industries such as aquaculture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is one of the few 
areas in which I do not have a lot of experience or 
understanding.  However I too was not a recipient of the apple. 
There were 100 apples given out and I never got one.  Maybe it 
has something to do with the fact that I do not know much about 
aquaculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do know, however, that aquaculture is funded by the FCC.  It 
should be funded by some sort of venture capital program. 
Aquaculture should have the opportunity to develop as an 
industry.  In order to do so it must have investment programs 
available to it, particularly venture capital investments. 
Whether that is done through the FCC or some other program is not 
important.  However the FCC does have experience with that and I 
would like to see it continue putting dollars back into the 
industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to address an issue 
of great importance to my constituents.  I will be raising 
questions that the government must answer before we can continue 
the debate.  I look forward to hearing the answers which will, 
hopefully, be forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those watching on television, I will outline what we are 
debating today.  Bill C-25 is an act to amend the Farm Credit 
Corporation Act and make consequential amendments to other acts 
that affect this area. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1340

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill, as outlined by the government, is to 
modify the role of the Farm Credit Corporation.  The bill 
proposes changes to three key areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lending role of the FCC would be expanded to allow it to 
lend to businesses which are not directly involved in primary 
agricultural production and in which farmers are not necessarily 
the majority shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lending role of the FCC would also be expanded to allow it 
to provide equity financing.  This could be accomplished by 
allowing the FCC to hold non-fixed assets, for example cattle or 
other things, as collateral.  Bill C-25 would formalize the FCC's 
leasing ability which could include farm land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is of primary importance to the people of Saskatchewan.  I 
looked at some of the figures put out by the Farm Credit 
Corporation.  Saskatchewan alone has $1.3 billion in loans. 
That is second only to Ontario, which has $2.1 billion. 
The other provinces fall in line.  Alberta and Quebec are next 
with a little under $1 billion in assets in the portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because that is of such critical importance to the people of 
Saskatchewan, and with the farm crisis we are currently 
experiencing, it is important that the government handle the 
issue very carefully.  We need to ensure that primary producers, 
farmers of Saskatchewan, are properly protected and that we 
do not move away from properly serving them through the Farm 
Credit Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us would expand the focus of the Farm Credit 
Corporation past its original mandate of providing financial 
services only to family farms and businesses directly related to 
primary production.  We need to ask whether the Farm Credit 
Corporation's involvement should go beyond direct farming 
operations and, if so, how primary producers would be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from B.C. who is sitting beside me would ask the 
same question in relation to things that go on in B.C.  People in 
the Maritimes would also like to know how they would be 
protected.  They would like to know if the focus of the FCC would 
continue to be on farmers and their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we extended the FCC's lending abilities beyond primary 
production the bill would bring the Farm Credit Corporation into 
direct competition with private lending institutions and make it 
overlap with other government institutions such as the Business 
Development Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the little town I come from there is a credit union that was 
established many years ago to serve the clientele in that area. 
It is a co-operative of sorts.  I need to know if the FCC will 
directly compete with organizations which were established to 
serve local people and which have done an excellent job of doing 
so.  Sometimes a good thing can undermine one that is even 
better.  We need to ensure that does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is tremendous openness for interpretation in some of the 
bill's clauses.  I will read a section from the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Corporation is to enhance rural Canada by 
providing specialized and personalized business and financial 
services and products to farming operations, including family 
farms, and to those businesses in rural Canada, including small 
and medium-sized businesses, that are businesses related to 
farming.  The primary focus of the activities of the Corporation 
shall be on farming operations, including family farms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sounds wonderful. It sounds good.  It is an intention that we 
could never disagree with, but years down the road how will it be 
interpreted?  What will a business related to farming include? 
What will it consist of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we have an assurance that somehow primary producers, 
farmers, will be protected, we would have difficulty supporting 
this idea.  The idea is great, but we need to know what will 
happen and how it will be interpreted in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also note Bill C-25 that we are discussing will formalize the 
FCC's ability to own and lease land.  The FCC has stated that 
this is not the intent of the amendment.  It claims that the 
leasing provisions are for equipment.  However, again the 
legislation does not make this clear.  It can give the government 
the mandate to make changes behind the scenes, to slip in changes 
that would affect agriculture very adversely.  It is not like 
other legislation that is often brought before the House.  It is 
enabling legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the administration of the bill many changes can be made 
that were not anticipated when the bill was debated in the House 
of Commons and often received the support of many members.  We 
need to know if this will give the FCC the ability to begin to 
own land, possibly for long periods of time, without any limit as 
to how long it can hang on to the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this inflate the price of land and cause hardship for many 
farmers who right now have a difficult time competing with those 
who are not directly involved in agriculture?  We need to know if 
that will be the case.  We do not see any limitations within the 
bill that address some of these concerns.  Will the FCC be 
allowed to permanently hold and lease land that could result in 
the market value of farmland increasing and hurting primary 
producers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those may not sound like major concerns at this point but years 
down the road, once the legislation comes into full effect, it 
could hurt the people involved across Canada.  Allowing the FCC 
to permanently hold and lease land may provide that corporation 
with the incentive not to pursue every other possible means to 
allow farmers who are experiencing financial difficulty to stay 
on the land.  In short, the bill could provide the FCC with the 
incentive to prematurely foreclose on Canadian farmland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the FCC continue to look at its mandate to help farmers or 
will it become more involved in ensuring that the corporation is 
financially successful?  That could have a very negative effect. 
We need to have the assurance and the proper amendments need to 
be made so that farmers have the guarantee that it will not move 
away from its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the clause in the bill which can be interpreted in many 
other ways.  We would agree that businesses in rural Canada, 
including small and medium size businesses and businesses related 
to farming, should get the help they need, but how far away from 
farming does a business have to be before one begins to say it is 
not really related to farming? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool be eligible for loans under the 
legislation?  I would like to know.  I do not know.  We are 
asking some tough questions that need answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current legislation, the FCC will become a significant 
landowner.  In 2000 the FCC owned over 360,000 acres.  Guess 
where most of that farmland was owned? 
Some 95% of it was in the province of Saskatchewan, the province 
that is experiencing the most difficulty right now in the farm 
crisis.  Not to belittle the problems that farmers are having in 
Manitoba, Alberta and across the country, but this is having a 
major impact because of the dependence on grain and oilseed crops 
in the province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is impossible for the FCC to avoid holding land for 
short periods of time, the act should somehow explicitly state 
that the FCC would divest itself of any holdings as quickly as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 also extends the FCC's lending ability into the area 
of equity financing.  This would be done by allowing the FCC to 
hold non-fixed assets such as cattle as collateral for loans. 
This change would allow the FCC to provide farm financing to 
primary producers who are not eligible under current legislation. 
In many cases this would provide financing that would not be 
available from private lenders.  This is a very positive change 
to the legislation.  The funding that would often be limited to 
primary producers would no longer be available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Canadian Alliance policy we state very clearly that we 
will foster a healthy economic environment for the benefit of 
consumers by pursuing free and open trade at home and abroad, 
including the elimination of interprovincial trade barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will withdraw government from areas of the economy where the 
private sector could deliver the same services more efficiently. 
We will end the unfair practice of providing subsidies to 
industries, businesses and special interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want the government to compete with areas in the 
private sector that are providing a good service and possibly 
undermine that service.  That is what we are saying in our policy 
and we stand by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will withdraw from areas in the economy where the private 
sector could deliver the same services more efficiently.  I 
already pointed out that they might be competing with another 
institution, namely the Business Development Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Bill C-25 take away the primary focus of the FCC from 
providing credit to primary producers?  If that were to happen, 
we as Canadian Alliance members of parliament believe that this 
would be a shift in the wrong direction.  This would be a move 
away from where we should be moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC should not be providing funding for non-farming 
operations if it hurts farmers and primary producers. Lending 
institutions are already in that area, for example the Business 
Development Bank of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Alliance Party do not want the Farm Credit Corporation 
under Bill C-25 to go into direct competition with private sector 
lenders.  That would be wrong and that would get the government 
involved in areas that it should not be involved in.  That is a 
basic policy area of the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill formalizes a lot of the FCC's leasing ability.  We have 
to be very careful.  Short term ownership of land is unavoidable 
in some cases, but the FCC should not go into the business of 
owning farmland in the long term.  It could inflate the price of 
land and hurt the whole agricultural sector.  This might make it 
more difficult for farmers and for primary producers to get 
credit where they normally would be able to access that credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of other questions, but the key question still 
needs to be asked and has to be answered by the government. Does 
the bill ensure that farmers will be properly served?  Will 
farmers have to compete for capital now that they normally did 
not have to compete for before? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to mention something else.  Will Canadian taxpayers be on 
the hook for loans that would not normally have been made but 
would be made and in turn be a higher risk loan?  Would taxpayers 
be on the hook for any bad decisions made?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned about this being enabling legislation, enabling the 
government to do things behind the scenes that it would not 
openly do.  I am noted for following the Firearms Act issue.  One 
thing I have found through that piece of enabling legislation is 
that the government has brought forward many things it originally 
said was not its intention, such as private police and 
enforcement agencies.  The kinds of things we were assured would 
not happen are in fact happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that have to do with this legislation?  Will this bill 
be an open book for the government to bring in government policy 
through the back door that may hurt farmers but may not be 
directly visible at this time?  We need to have that kind of 
protection.  Are the changes here in the best interest of 
farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will adequate provisions be made in Bill C-25 that would prevent 
the FCC from bailing out large, non-farmer owned businesses at a 
future date?  I do not see that protection right now.  Large 
corporations could possibly access capital for a bailout that 
would hurt farmers directly.  A large agribusiness, possibly even 
a multinational agribusiness, could access the money unless there 
are proper provisions put in place that this would not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read the legislation it sounds good, but it could be 
interpreted years down the road in a very different manner than 
we are expected to interpret it at this point.  Would a limit be 
set on the size of loans offered to businesses that are not 
majority owned by farmers?  We need to have that protection put 
in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would a farm equipment dealer be able to access the resources of 
the Farm Credit Corporation?  Could these businesses access 
capital through other lending institutions?  We do not know what 
checks and balances will be provided to ensure that certain 
companies will not be able to access the capital, which would 
then remove that capital base or pool of capital from primary 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things need to be addressed.  I should like to hear 
some of these questions answered by the government.  I see that 
my time is up.  I have asked what I think are the key questions 
farmers in my riding are asking.  I would like the government to 
answer those questions today.

who has diversified into organic wheat production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Schmidt has gone further than just growing organic grain for 
a niche market.  He has developed sales for organic flour milled 
from his own grain.  This is exactly the type of initiative that 
will bring agriculture out of the current income crisis caused by 
the disastrously low world prices for traditional crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, Mr. Schmidt cannot get an export permit for his 
organic flour from the Canadian Wheat Board.  This is in spite of 
the fact that the Canadian Wheat Board provides no marketing 
services to him.  This is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that it has introduced Bill C-25 in order 
to promote value added processing.  What it refuses to understand 
is that the best way to promote diversification and value added 
processing is to get out of the way of entrepreneurs like Mr. 
Schmidt.

Mr. Speaker, abuse of power is a dangerous thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario's privacy commissioner condemned this government's habit 
of opening and reading private citizens' mail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister assure the public that his government 
will immediately stop the despicable practice of opening 
people's mail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary 
of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions 
of Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the customs legislation clearly 
provides that Customs Canada officials can intercept, upon their 
entry into Canada, and—with the upcoming legislation—also upon 
their departure from the country, goods shipped through mail 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This authority is based on section 99 of the act and on the 
existence of reasonable grounds. Incidentally, when he looked 
into the matter, the privacy commissioner acknowledged that 
these powers were exercised within the law and in good faith by 
customs officials. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

Canadians cry out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the commissioner here in Ontario.  The federal 
privacy commissioner has commented about this particular habit. 
This is an ongoing hostility toward the rights of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister give clear direction and tell these 
people to stop reading the mail of private citizens in our

would read subsection 99(1) of the act it is quite obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not reading the mail at all.  We are looking at, on a 
sample basis, goods coming into Canada by way of the postal 
stream.  The privacy commissioner has said that we are acting 
within the law and in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe in the next question I should quote from the privacy 
commissioner as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  That is what we are asking, Mr. Speaker.  It is 
very rare to see high level public servants, one from a province 
and one from the federal government, agreeing on a concern.  The 
concern is the federal government's hostility to the rights of 
individuals.  It continues to open our mail.  Never mind looking 
at the legislation, it should look at what the privacy 
commissioners have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister put into practice new safeguards and new 
limits on this dangerous increase in the abuse of power? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and 
Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the

politics is perception and the leader knows it as well in 
telling the population that we are having a look at mail, which 
is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are stopping illegal goods from coming into Canada through 
the postal stream.  The privacy commissioner has said that we are 
acting in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to bear in mind that customs officers have a dual 
mandate, one of course being the question of economic 
development, and the other, which is important and which I stand 
by, being the protection of our Canadian society.  We will 
continue to work hard for that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on the one hand the government is opening the public's mail and 
on the other hand it is not allowing us to look at its mail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner said that complaints relating to 
this have doubled in the last year.  The public is unable to look 
at the government documents.  Since the government is looking at 
private documents why will it not release government documents? 
Why so much secrecy?

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is reported that the justice department has ordered Canada 
Customs to allow counterfeit documents found entering Canada 
through the mail, including phony Canadian passports, to be sent

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a debate on the Access to Information Act. At this 
point, the issue is to define to what degree documents from the 
cabinet and from ministers' offices are of a private nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is of course a debate going on. An act was passed and we 
want it to be implemented. I am sure that the last thing that 
the Leader of the Opposition would like is to see in the 
newspapers what is going on in his office. If journalists were 
able to check what has been going on over the past three days, 
we would have a whale of a time in the House.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadian assistance to developing countries is way down. 
According to OECD statistics, Canada has dropped from 6th to 
17th position on the list of 22 contributing countries over the 
past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2000 there was even an historic shortfall with only 0.25% 
of gross national product allocated for international 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister ready to stand behind the generous 
statements he made at the Quebec summit and make an immediate 
commitment to set aside 0.7% of GNP for assistance to developing 
countries, as recommended by the United Nations? 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have had a very difficult period financially in Canada and, 
unfortunately, the proportion of Canadian assistance to 
developing countries has dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in recent years we have increased our contributions and we 
intend to continue to do so.  In 2001-02, we intend to increase 
our spending in this area by 7% to 10%. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
figures show the opposite.  Under a Liberal administration 
assistance to developing countries has gone down while the 
economy has grown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the GNP has increased by $334 billion while 
international assistance has dropped by $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister admit that it is all the more important 
to meet the UN development assistance standards when the economy 
is doing well in the interests of international solidarity? 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have just explained that this has been the government's policy 
over the past two years.  We are going to continue to increase 
our assistance to developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had asked that we do this when we were at the Japan summit 
last July.  In the 2001-02 estimates we are going to 
increase our spending in this area by 7% over previous years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
concrete ways of assisting developing countries and at the 
same time developing new international trade markets is to 
support the suggestion made by President Fox to create a 
development fund for the poor economies of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Canadian government plan to support the initiative 
proposed by President Fox and to contribute to the creation of 
this fund? 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

me as one that will gain the acceptance of the countries making

my question is for the right hon. Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 5 last year the Minister for International Trade said 
in committee that the government is not seeking an 
investor state provision in the WTO or anywhere else.  I 
further clarified that by asking him about the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister allow the Minister for International 
Trade to make that policy announcement in committee at that 
time and then later on make the statements that the Prime 
Minister has made to the effect that there is nothing wrong with 
the very thing that the minister says they no longer seek? 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, our view has not changed.  I will repeat 
it once again in the House because I think it is very important. 
We believe that NAFTA has served Canada's interests very well and 
that chapter 11 works reasonably well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our view is that we want to clarify certain aspects of chapter 
11 within the present mechanism of NAFTA, mechanisms that do 
exist, in order to make sure that we respect the true intentions 
of the drafters of NAFTA. 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question was not about NAFTA, it was about future 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the Minister for International Trade could tell us how 
he reconciles his statement to me on April 5 last year that the 
government would not be seeking this kind of mechanism in any new 
agreement.  How does he reconcile that with the fact that the 
government now appears to be seeking just such a mechanism in the 
FTAA and is defending the very idea that he rejected on that 
day? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is referring to one 
aspect of chapter 11.  It is the investor state provisions.  We 
as a government are trying to clarify that agreement right now 
within the existing mechanisms of chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously when a government negotiates any new agreement or 
adopts any new formula it takes into light previous experiences.

<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to 
Bill C-16 which is an act designed to allow the government to 
use and protect classified security, criminal intelligence and 
information in denying or revoking the charitable status of an 
organization with terrorist affiliations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 balances the government's need to protect classified 
information against the basic requirement to ensure fairness and 
transparency in assessing the status of registered charities or 
applicants for charitable status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective is to prevent the abuse of the charity 
registration system now and in the future by those few 
organizations that would provide support to terrorism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with members a quick overview of the 
pressing challenges we as a government face, and indeed all 
Canadians, that makes this bill so essential in contributing to 
Canada's effort to combat terrorism and just as important to 
preserve the integrity of Canada's registered charities system, 
one of the country's greatest social strengths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to briefly discuss the process by which Bill 
C-16 was developed, how it will work, its importance and benefit 
to Canadian society and public safety and how it integrates with 
broader efforts devoted to international security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 responds directly to the 1999 report of the special 
Senate committee on security and intelligence which observed that 
groups with terrorist affiliations conduct fundraising activities 
in Canada often using benevolent or philanthropic organizations 
as fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the report's key recommendations called for the Income 
Tax Act to be amended to allow Revenue Canada, as it was called 
then, to deny charitable registration to any group on the basis 
of a certificate from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
stating that the group constitutes a threat to the security of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also been listening to Canadians.  We know that they 
look to the federal government in many ways, and in this way as 
well, to take a leadership role in remaining vigilant and ready 
to act to prevent terrorist activities from taking place in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that Canadians want us to take any action that is 
appropriate and necessary to protect basic and core Canadian 
values.  The legislation would help us address concerns expressed 
over the past few years by various ethnic groups, by the 
voluntary sector and by the Canadian public in general.  The 
integrity and essential contributions of charitable organizations 
must be protected and maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to be assured that if they are approached to 
support a charitable organization, they can be confident that it 
is a bona fide organization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation allows the government to respond to threats to 
the public safety and national security of Canada and to other 
states stemming from front groups using charitable status to 
cloak in the blanket of legitimacy their activities in support of 
terrorism.  We all know that terrorism is a global problem that 
ignores borders.  That is why Canada is and must be committed to 
working globally to fight it.  For this reason, Canada works in a 
wide range of international fora to encourage both the collective 
condemnation of terrorism and effective, practical action against 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last number of years a series of G-8 communiques and 
declarations and United Nations conventions and resolutions have 
addressed the issue of terrorism and more specifically the 
financing of terrorism.  These international statements and 
agreements depend on action by Canada and other partner countries 
to give them life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting in 1995 with the Ottawa ministerial declaration on 
countering terrorism, G-8 countries agreed to:  share 
intelligence and technical knowledge; share information on 
terrorist organizations and terrorist incidents; share expertise 
on the protection of public buildings; and improve procedures for 
tracing and tracking suspected terrorists.  At the same time they 
agreed to pursue measures aimed at depriving terrorists of their 
sources of funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of last year Canada was one of the first countries, 
and we should be proud of this, to sign the international 
convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism. 
Canada has been a vigorous advocate in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Terrorism is not new to the modern world.  What is new is the 
magnitude of the terrorist activities undertaken by groups to 
further their goals through indiscriminate violence and 
destruction.  The tools of terrorism cost money.  Many terrorist 
organizations have devised unscrupulous methods of finding the 
money they need.  This bill will put a stop to one of those 
methods, that being the use of charitable tax receipts to help 
support the use of violence in pursuit of a political objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a charity system that can be trusted and is not 
open to abuse.  They want a system and legislation that strikes a 
balance between the need for transparency and the need to deal 
firmly and effectively with those who would seek to abuse the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill therefore carries a dual mandate, closing the back door 
through which organizations supporting terrorist groups are 
subsidized by Canadian taxpayers, while at the same time ensuring 
that the standards of procedural fairness enshrined in the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is currently a judicial process in place to review 
applications for charitable status or to revoke charitable status 
for those organizations that do not meet the requirements of the 
Income Tax Act.  The classified information is not used in the 
current process since disclosure of such information would damage 
national security.  A special legislative regime is needed to 
allow this information to be used, and that is precisely what the 
bill provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process outlined in this bill is based on the immigration 
act and has withstood scrutiny by the courts.  A certificate 
based on security and criminal intelligence information is issued 
by the Minister of National Revenue and the Solicitor General of 
Canada.  Both ministers review the information separately and 
independently.  The certificate is then reviewed by a judge of 
the Federal Court of Canada who in turn determines if the 
certificate issued by the ministers is reasonable or should be 
quashed.  Sensitive intelligence information is reviewed by the 
judge and a summary of that information is provided to the 
applicant for charitable status or the registered charity, as the 
case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organization is entitled to legal counsel and to a hearing 
at which evidence may be presented.  It is only after the 
certificate has been confirmed by a judge that the Canada Customs 
and Revenue Agency would deny or revoke charitable status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The certificate is valid for a period of three years.  However 
it can be cancelled within that three year period if the 
organization presents new information which supports a conclusion 
that its resources are no longer being used to support terrorism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech From the Throne confirmed the government's intentions 
and commitment to further provide the necessary tools to fight 
terrorism. 
The bill is one of the tools the Government of Canada requires to 
wage the battle effectively.  Canada is a country built on 
diversity.  Our strength is based on diversity.  In order for 
Canada to continue to grow and flourish it is important that our 
diverse nature be recognized and accepted.

use of violence to perpetuate conflicts is inconsistent with the 
values of a tolerant multicultural society which is Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say the bill does not go far enough.  They will say we 
need to do more to combat terrorist fundraising in Canada.  Let 
me say on behalf of the government that clearly there we agree. 
That is why Canada was one of the first countries to sign the UN 
convention last year.  Our commitment is clear.  We will fulfill 
our international obligations and will do so in accordance with 
Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is an important and necessary step.  That is why we are 
here to debate it today.  This small but necessary step in our 
fight against terrorism and the support of terrorism through 
fundraising is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we can look forward to the support of all parties on this 
very important piece of legislation.  After all it is what Canada 
is all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member opposite virtually wrote a part of my 
speech.  He pre-empted some of the comments I was going to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When talking about funding terrorist organizations, it is very 
interesting that the Liberal government says that the bill is a 
small but necessary step.  As for terrorism in any country, it 
should not be dealt with by a small and necessary step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is supposed to provide a mechanism for denying 
registration as charities under the Income Tax Act to 
organizations that raise funds for terrorists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that with the large bureaucracy and with all the 
members of parliament in the House of Commons, the government 
would come up with a more efficient way to fight terrorism than 
merely dealing with a comprehensive approach, through a federal 
court judge, of denying registration as a charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the people in Canada think of that kind of step where 
the government says that, yes, we have a severe problem with 
terrorists being funded from funds raised in Canada and what we 
will do is deny registration as a charity if it goes through a 
whole bunch of processes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely Canadians are expecting more than this from a government. 
What more could the government do?  I did not hear anything about 
the Immigration Act.  There was casual mention of it.  What about 
application of the Immigration Act to many people who are 
involved in terrorism in this country?  If an organization is 
suspected of dealing with terrorist activities, then surely the 
people within that organization are suspect.  What proposal is 
being made for deportation of non-citizens, if that is the case, 
within the Immigration Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What proposal is made under the criminal code for those citizens 
within Canada who are involved in terrorism?  What proposal is 
being made through the criminal code for wire tapping?  Right now 
it takes about 1,500 pages to fill out the application and 
approval for a wire tap when approximately eight years ago it 
took about five pages.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that this is a feeble attempt, at the very 
best, to deal with terrorism in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite said that if a group constituted a threat to 
the security of Canada, then the government would take a lot of 
action.  It would file through a federal court judge to make sure 
that an association, with which an individual or individuals were 
involved, could have its certificate removed as a registered 
charity.  It is hard to believe that a government could come up 
with this kind of approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things that can be done about terrorism such as 
simplifying the procedures for obtaining wiretaps and providing 
more resources for the RCMP, CSIS and for organizations involved 
in the prevention and apprehension of those involved in terrorism 
and organized crime.  We should define what a terrorist group 
constitutes, just as we were supposed to define what an organized 
crime gang in law was and failed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to get enthusiastic with the registration of a 
charity and the refusal or removal of that when we are dealing 
with such a large issue as organized crime or terrorism.  Where I 
come from it is hard to believe that the triads, who possibly 
are involved in terrorism, would be overly concerned about losing 
their registration as a charitable organization.  Quite frankly 
they deal in tax free dollars.  It is called revenue from drug 
sales, prostitution, embezzlement, money laundering, all illegal 
activities.  I hardly think they would be concerned with their 
charitable organization certification being removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved in looking at the issues in criminal 
justice for my entire time in the House of Commons.  I asked time 
and time again for policies and legislation to be tabled in the 
House which were meaningful, which would do something 
constructive, which would help reduce the importation and the 
traffic of drugs and which would stop the problems with sexual 
exploitation of children and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I get back in return are solutions like this.  It is hard 
to believe that people watching television today and listening to 
this discussion will have a lot of confidence in the Government 
of Canada when it says that it will fix this terrible problem of 
terrorism, that it may remove charitable organization 
certification and that it may not allow them to get tax free 
status for the money they send to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can they honestly believe that members of parliament are 
actually debating this bill?  Would they not prefer to hear that 
in cases of organized crime and terrorism we will deal with it in 
a different manner?  They just have to listen to the speeches 
today and ask themselves if this will deal with the problems 
related to terrorism in Canada?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the proposal adequately stop or hinder terrorism or in 
any way put somebody in jail for being involved in terrorism? No, 
it would not.  It says people would not get tax free dollars by 
way of a tax receipt, a tax receipt for which they did not pay 
tax for in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I not only question the bill but I question the sincerity of the 
government.  I question the ability of the government to 
comprehend the serious nature of the problem that we are dealing 
with.  If people watching television today think I am wrong, they 
should listen to the speeches from the other side.  This is the 
effective action that the government will take on terrorism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask everybody watching to write letters to the House of 
Commons, to the solicitor general, to me as the solicitor general 
critic and to state whether or not they believe that the way to 
fight terrorism is, in the words of the Liberals, to fight what 
constitutes a threat to the security of Canada.  Or, is it what I 
described?  Is it denying the registration of charities under the 
Income Tax Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rest my case.  This is not only ineffective but it shows a 
lack of comprehension of what the real problems are with 
organized crime and terrorism in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
bill respecting the registration of charities and security 
information and to amend the Income Tax Act seeks to counter 
activities in support of terrorism as provided under the 
convention on the financing of terrorism which was approved by 
the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its bill, the government wants to counter terrorism by 
preventing supporters of terrorism from engaging in fundraising 
or the transfer of money and materiel abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks to deny support to terrorist activities and to 
protect the integrity of the charity registration process 
through the fair and transparent use, to the extent that it is 
possible, of confidential information that could jeopardize 
national and human security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concretely, this bill seeks to prevent organizations that are 
related to terrorist groups from obtaining the status of 
charities. This should help reduce the funding of terrorist 
activities. The legislation would, among other things, 
facilitate the use of confidential information to determine the 
eligibility for registration as a charity or to revoke the 
registration of a registered charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the minister does not define what 
he means by "terrorism" even though the purpose of the bill is 
precisely to counter the funding of organizations that engage in 
such activities. Such an omission can of course lead to a broad 
or liberal interpretation of the term. This means that in a 
highly politicized context there is always a potential risk of 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that perspective, we have no guarantee that the criteria used 
for interpretation purposes will allow us to distinguish between 
the funding of legitimate activities, such as political protest, 
and that of violent activities. The word "terrorism" must be 
thoroughly defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the judicial review of the certificate, while the 
procedure is relatively simple, it does raise some concerns. 
First, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service will inform 
the solicitor general and the Minister of National Revenue that 
it has come to the conclusion that an organization is 
fundraising to finance terrorist activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of that notice the ministers can then start 
procedures to prevent that organization from getting the status 
of charity or to revoke its registration. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that this process is set in motion by an administrative 
notice to the political arm, which then issues a certificate, we 
feel that this approach is flawed by the absence of any 
possibility of judicial control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the impossibility of filing an appeal places any 
organization faced with such a procedure at the mercy of errors 
or political and judicial administrative abuses which might 
arise from excessive alarmism. Knowing that CSIS practices are 
not above reproach, we are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there is the absence of control mentioned earlier. 
What reasons could the organization give for purposes of control 
or appeal, when it is not entitled to know the information 
giving rise to the certificate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is no objection to giving it information which does 
not pose a threat to national security.  In other words, it will 
be given information which is not really relevant because the 
denial or revocation of charitable status will be based on 
information which could pose a threat to national security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the only procedural guarantee the organization is 
allowed is the <I>audi alteram partem</I> rule.  But one might wonder 
just how useful that is since the organization will not have 
access to the facts and the reasons for the certificate being 
issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section on evidence raises equally important concerns. 
First, under a procedure provided for in the bill a judge will 
be able to allow evidence regardless of its admissibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By disregarding specific rules of evidence the government is 
ignoring the contradictory nature of our judicial system.  The 
bill would institute an inquisitional procedure which is 
unacceptable in a free and democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have only ten or so 
minutes each,  I will skip over a few of my remarks 
and go to the heart of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wonder how anyone could possibly think an accused would have 
the impression that justice had been done.  For that to be the 
case, there would at least have to be the appearance of justice. 
The whole thing is hard to verify, when the evidence is revealed 
in camera, in the absence of the principal parties. It can be 
said therefore that in the case before us the procedure stands 
out because of its almost total lack of transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organization mentioned in a certificate will be able to 
apply for a review by showing that a material change has 
occurred in circumstances since the determination.  This is an 
interesting possibility since the organization is permitted to 
mend its ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we consider the problems raised previously it seems 
to me uncertain that an organization can prove this.  In order 
to prove reform, a party must know the allegations against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the ministers have given their decision, the organization 
will have all the time in the world to apply to the federal 
court to review the decision.  Once again this possibility 
appears to accord certain procedural guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this is not entirely the case.  In fact, the 
ministers do not seem to have to give reasons for the decision 
that is to be reviewed.  In addition, the federal court will 
review the decision only if it was given under subclause 
10(5)(<I>b</I>) of the bill, that is, if the circumstances have 
changed but the certificate continues to have effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This implies therefore that when the ministers conclude that the 
situation has not changed materially, the federal court does not 
have real review power.  In such a case it can only quash the 
decision on the grounds that the circumstances have materially 
changed and return the file to the ministers for another 
determination. 
In this way, there is no real control because the file goes 
back to those who made the original determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this bill is most worthy, but the means to achieving 
it are dubious.  At the moment, as it is written it snags on 
too many principles of justice to be passed in its present form. 
The committee will have to improve it significantly, otherwise, 
it would set a dangerous precedent in terms of the violation of 
procedural guarantees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say that charities may be a disguise for terrorist 
organizations.  Even if they are right, I do not believe the 
right thing is being targeted.  It is somewhat absurd to think 
that the supporters of terrorist organizations want to take 
advantage of tax credits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may even wonder to what extent this bill is not a roundabout 
way of enabling the minister to control taxation.  It must be 
kept in mind that terrorism is not financed exclusively through 
charitable organizations.  Although the government is attempting 
to show that it is taking concrete actions against terrorism, 
with this bill it is opting for facility rather than really 
attacking the source of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, all it is doing is making sure that tax receipts 
cannot be issued for financing terrorist activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree is a very real phenomenon and we must help fight it. 
On the other hand, do we need to recreate psychoses such as 
there were in the era of fear of the communist threat, or worse 
still, go back to the era of the Inquisition and its search for 
heretics?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it would be far more effective for the criminal code 
to properly address the financing of criminal activities for 
this would focus directly on those involved in such acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, to conclude, Bill C-16 could be summarized as follows: 
suspicion, discretionary power, enigmatic proof, and lack of 
control. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for the opportunity to speak briefly to the referral of 
Bill C-16 to committee.  It is a procedure that is not used all 
that often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 is a bill which is well suited to this kind of 
examination in committee before second reading so that no parties 
in the House, and particularly the government, find themselves 
committed to any particular position on the bill.  It leaves the 
way open for members on the committee to explore all the various 
concerns that a great many people have expressed about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor 
General, it seemed to me that he made a speech that was more 
appropriate for a traditional second reading debate in which he 
vigorously defended the bill and the government's position on the 
bill.  That is not what should be happening now.  The bill is 
going to committee before second reading presumably because the 
government has some sense that there are things which need to be 
looked at before any final commitment on the part of the 
government is made to the passage of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be an opportunity for people to come forward, as 
they have been doing through correspondence to various members of 
parliament, particularly those associated with this file, and 
express their concerns on the record before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another bill which may be suited to this kind of process would 
be a bill that the government could bring forward having to do 
with workplace safety and changes to the criminal code with 
respect to the charging of companies or individuals of companies 
responsible for the death of workers on the job through corporate 
negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to a bill that existed in the last parliament 
that was sometimes called the Westray bill. Our party was pushing 
that bill in the last parliament, particularly our leader, the 
hon. member for Halifax.  We were urging the government to act on 
that particular issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to me if the Minister of Justice, as she has said 
to me, wants to hear from more Canadians, if she is not prepared 
to act on the Westray file at this moment, that bringing forward 
a piece of legislation and referring it to committee before 
second reading so that more people could be heard on that 
particular subject would be a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make no apologies for using the opportunity when we are 
employing that process with respect to Bill C-16 to say that 
there are other issues which are equally important and which I 
think the government should act on by using this particular 
process.  One of them could certainly be acting on the Westray 
file, that is to say, changing the criminal code in such a way 
that the kind of activity that led to that particular tragedy 
would be the kind of activity that could be gone after much more 
efficiently than it can be gone after now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-16, there is no need to speak at great 
length about the bill.  We want to see it go to committee.  I 
would say that the government should be open, as I think I 
already know it is, as to whether or not it finally should go to 
the justice and human rights committee because the justice and 
human rights committee is a very busy committee.  We have Bill 
C-7, the youth criminal justice act, Bill C-15, the omnibus 
amendments to the criminal code and the organized crime bill, 
and there will be more.  I would hope the government would 
consider whether or not at some point, perhaps in discussion with 
House leaders, if we could agree to send this bill for this kind 
of an examination to some other committee, a committee that can 
do it sooner.  It is not because we do not want to do it in the 
justice committee, but perhaps we could agree to send it to some 
other committee whose calendar of work would permit it to do this 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely all Canadians would agree that if this is a problem that 
needs to be addressed then it should be addressed sooner rather 
than later.  I put it on the record that we should look at 
perhaps where we might refer this bill for this kind of study. We 
could always change it by unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of groups have already expressed concern about the bill, 
but I will say briefly that we in the NDP support the principle of 
the bill, which is that taxpayers should not be funding, 
surreptitiously or innocently by virtue of deception any 
particular organization or terrorism activity either here or in any 
other country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my understanding of the bill is correct, I think what the 
government has in mind here is terrorism abroad.  When I listened 
to the Alliance spokesperson complain that the bill does not 
fight terrorism in the many ways that he thinks it should, he may 
be right that there are other things the government could be 
doing to fight terrorism, but the bill is directed toward 
amendments that need to be made to the charities act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness to the government, we could say that it should be 
doing this, that and the other thing, and that all may be true, 
but the bill itself, it seems to me, zeros in on a particular 
problem and that is, how can we prevent the Canadian taxpayer 
from subsidizing terrorism through the charities act?  How can we 
do that in a way that does not interfere with the legitimate 
activities of a great many charities which may in fact be 
configured in relationship, not necessarily to another country or 
to a cause in another country, but configured culturally or 
ethnically in a way that leaves them open to that suspicion or 
may in fact, depending on what is actually the case, leave them 
open to being used in that particular way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the groups that would fall into that category have a 
legitimate concern, I think, that they not be dragged through a 
process in which, even if at the end of that process they are 
found to be innocent, they would nevertheless have expended a 
great deal of time, energy and perhaps reputation in defending 
themselves against that charge.  How can we balance that concern 
with the very real concern that some organizations may actually 
be or may be tempted to be or may in the past have been or may in 
the future act in such a way that the moneys which Canadians give 
to them, which are tax deductible, are used in some way or 
another for terrorism?

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end by saying that one of the things we need to keep in 
mind while trying to find this balance is that we also need to do 
a lot more critical thinking about what constitutes terrorism, 
particularly when we are talking about terrorism abroad, which is 
mostly the kind of terrorism we are talking about.  It is 
sometimes a very political matter what is defined as terrorism, 
which is obviously unacceptable, and what is defined as 
resistance or legitimate rebellion or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is reminded of a time in the House when one left oneself 
open to very severe criticism if one spoke in any sort of 
supportive way of the African National Congress and the 
anti-apartheid movement.  Yet there were acts of violence 
associated with the anti-apartheid movement and the African 
National Congress within South Africa.  Would that have meant in 
the context of this bill that anti-apartheid groups in Canada who 
were raising money for the cause of anti-apartheid in South 
Africa could have been dragged through the process that this bill 
lays out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that question because it is a legitimate concern. The task 
of the committee will be to address that concern while at the 
same time respecting the principle of the bill that Canadian 
taxpayers should not be funding terrorism.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I as well am pleased to have an opportunity to put a 
few remarks on the record with respect to Bill C-16, which is a 
very important piece of legislation dealing with charitable 
organizations and regulations that relate to fundraising 
activities in Canada.  I could not agree more with my hon. 
colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona that the process in which we 
are pursuing this matter is a very important part of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Westray issue in particular is something of great interest 
to me as this tragedy occurred in Plymouth, Nova Scotia in the 
constituency of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  There was an 
unusual coming together of members of parliament on that issue of 
workplace safety and the broader implications that exist for 
those who can be injured in the workplace.  We saw this past 
weekend recognition in a day of memorial, a day of remembering 
those who died in the workplace.  We should be renewing our 
efforts in that regard as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To speak specifically to this issue, this is a piece of 
legislation that puts in place a judicial process by which the 
government would be able to deny charitable status to any group 
found to be supporting terrorist activity.  Much of this, I 
suggest, will have to be fleshed out in terms of the 
organizational definition and the definition of terrorist 
activities, yet it is certainly a step in the right direction. It 
is a positive initiative which the Progressive Conservative Party 
will support in this initial stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is long overdue.  The Conservative Party has 
been very consistent in calling upon the government to act in 
this direction to curtail terrorist activity in Canada.  We 
qualify this support, realizing once again that the government 
tried to initially deal with this problem through avoidance. 
Since that did not work it has been literally shamed into 
bringing forward this legislation, which sadly does not go quite 
far enough.  It is a typical legislative half measure.  The 
support of our party therefore will hinge on our ability to bring 
forward amendments and to delve into greater detail at the 
committee level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we send a message of deterrence and a 
message that rings throughout the country that this type of 
terrorist activity funding and enhancing of terrorist causes will 
not be perpetrated in Canada and will not be tolerated by 
government or by law enforcement communities.  Other western 
countries have enacted similar legislation so Canada is following 
the leader in a sense.  It is certainly important that ethnic 
Canadians are not coerced unknowingly into becoming charitable 
fronts for terrorist fundraising activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are a magnanimous people by nature.  I know that in 
your part of the world in Kingston, Mr. Speaker, that could not 
be more true.  Canadians generally want to give.  They want to 
reach out and help.  My colleague from Cumberland—Colchester 
raised the issue today of the need to do more to help other 
countries and to do more for the African AIDS epidemic where so 
many millions of people are suffering from this horrible disease.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile we need to have some safeguards to ensure that these 
causes are genuine and that these fundraising activities are 
those in which the most amount of aid and assistance will 
actually be obtained by those groups.  We need to ensure that in 
our effort to combat terrorism, legislation does not unfairly 
target legitimate, peaceful, law abiding fundraising groups, 
especially those fundraising groups of different ethnic 
backgrounds that engage in very valuable fundraising activities 
or initiatives for the betterment of their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hopeful that we will be able to produce legislation that 
will improve public safety for the country and meet this balance 
that is required while not trampling on the rights of those who 
are in some instances very vulnerable citizens in this country 
and are making very legitimate efforts to try to assist those 
from their originating countries in their plight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 sets up a process by which organizations supporting 
terrorist activities could be denied or lose their charitable 
status.  If the solicitor general and the minister of revenue, 
after reviewing security and criminal intelligence reports, have 
reasonable grounds to believe that an organization makes or will 
make resources available to terrorism, they both would be 
required to sign a certificate.  The organization would then be 
given notice of this certificate and the matter would be referred 
automatically to the federal court for a judicial review.  The 
applicant would have the opportunity to apply to the federal 
court to have its identity protected and a judicial process would 
then occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal court could and would provide the applicant with an 
opportunity to introduce evidence, call witnesses and 
cross-examine in a public forum.  This is a very important 
process in getting to the root of the allegation if the group is 
suspected of being involved in terrorist activity and 
fundraising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process would allow for the review and the classification 
in camera, and the judge would then provide the organization with 
a summary of the classified information produced.  The summary 
would contain sufficient information to allow the organization to 
respond but would also exclude information that the judge has 
determined would be injurious to national security and the safety 
of persons.  There is a fairly indepth and comprehensive process 
there to protect the rights of those involved.  Confidentiality 
is often very critical in the integrity of the process, but to be 
very blunt, it is often a matter of life and death.  These 
terrorist groups are very ruthless in their activities, and the 
repercussions and the revenge factor are certainly real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If confirmed, the certificate would then be valid for three 
years and the judge's decision would be final and not available 
for or subject to appeal.  However there is a provision for 
review if there is a change in the material circumstances of the 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this is to say that Bill C-16 provides a very good 
starting point.  However some of this process is going to have 
to be worked through and more detail put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Terrorists often look outside their borders.  That is clear. 
Canada, because of the financial and material resources that 
exist here, is very much a target of terrorist organizations. 
Over the past number of years the approach to terrorism, I would 
strongly suggest, has been inadequate and has allowed, to a large 
extent, terrorist fundraising activities to thrive and to 
flourish in Canada.  The regrettable result is that terrorist 
organizations have been able to exert their influence over and 
even infiltrate some very legitimate operating Canadian 
organizations that already have charitable status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we have seen concern raised over the charitable 
organization known as the Federation of Associations of Canadian 
Tamils, FACT, which has been identified by federal lawyers as a 
front for the known terrorist organization, the Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam.  Justice department lawyers have said that the 
Tamil Tigers engaged in torture, mistreatment of prisoners, 
summary executions, ethnic cleansing of Muslims and kidnapping 
and forcible conscription of children, all absolutely abhorrent 
activities.  I am sure that some who may have contributed to this 
organization would be appalled to think that their money went to 
that organization for those purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen similar fundraising activities that play upon the 
emotions and the passions of Irish Canadians.  For many years in 
this country we have seen Irish Republican Army activists who 
have tried to raise money for what turned out to be explosives or 
weaponry that was used to perpetrate their cause. 
That cause is thankfully now through due to the peace process and to 
negotiations in Northern Ireland and is moving in a very positive 
direction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be stated that Canadian Tamils have made valuable 
contributions to the country.  The fact that the particular 
organization is one of several political and benevolent front 
organizations that support a terrorist organization has resulted 
in a great deal of controversy in the House of Commons.  It 
demonstrated the reach of such terrorist organizations into what 
seemed to be a well intentioned charitable group.  It is also a 
reminder to Canadians of the care that must be taken and the 
background checks that must be made before any well intentioned 
person decides to aid in an effort of a charitable group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Donations to a charity qualify for tax credits which reduce 
federal taxes by 17% for the first $200 of eligible donations and 
29% of the balance to a limit of 75% of income.  Such donations 
also reduce provincial taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is positive in its direction.  The difficulty is 
that police often have trouble making the connection between a 
charitable organization and the terrorist front that is being 
used for that purpose.  Fundraising fronts usually take care to 
commit no crime in this country and police can currently only lay 
charges of conspiracy if a direct connection can be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much work to be done in this area.  The United Nations 
General Assembly adopted the international convention for the 
suppression of the financing of terrorism, but Bill C-16 falls 
somewhat short of Canada's obligations under that convention. 
Other countries such as the United States and Great Britain make 
it completely illegal to provide material support or resources 
for any group that the government has found to be a terrorist 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can learn from the example of other countries.  We have 
an opportunity to improve the legislation and we hope that we 
would have the opportunity to do that in the justice committee. 
There may be some need to refer the bill to another committee, 
but wherever it goes we would be looking to improve it.

Bill C-16, which I am introducing jointly with my colleague the 
solicitor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities play a critical role in the achievement of goals, both 
here and abroad, that Canadians deem important. Charities 
provide humanitarian assistance in times of crisis. They promote 
the building of civil society in developing countries. 
They provide help to the needy and they work to respond to 
social concerns and problems. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To recognize this and to encourage Canadians to support 
charitable activities, the Income Tax Act grants significant tax 
privileges to charities.  Charities are accountable for how they 
use donations.  They hold the public trust and they depend on 
public confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides the legal means to deal with any suspected 
abuse of charitable status by terrorist supporters who try to 
use charities to disguise their activities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will also guarantee that tax privileges granted to 
registered charities are provided only to organizations that 
engage in charitable activities under the Income Tax Act. Above 
all, it will guarantee to Canadians that their donations to 
registered charities in Canada will be used for legitimate 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the tax incentive related to gifts to charities 
is administered under the charities registration process. 
These legislative provisions and the registration process 
administered by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency are 
evidence of the clear intention of parliament to support, 
through the tax system, activities conducted for charitable 
purposes under Canadian legislation.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, as in other common law jurisdictions, the courts have 
been very clear that the pursuit of political objectives falls 
outside the legal bounds of charity.  Any organization that 
operates in whole or in part to support political aims and 
objectives would not be eligible to receive charitable status 
for income tax purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of violence or the threat of violence to achieve a 
political aim, regardless of the cause concerned, cannot be 
reconciled with the legal concept of charity.  The bill before us 
today addresses very serious international concerns about 
terrorist activities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada as a nation and Canadians individually do not and cannot 
tolerate terrorist activities. In order to maintain public trust 
in the treatment of charitable organizations, the government 
must ensure that the tax privileges available to such 
organizations do not benefit any organizations using violence to 
attain their goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain organizations which condone acts of terrorism are also 
involved in humanitarian assistance and community development 
programs. 
They may therefore attempt to make a distinction between that 
part of the organization which engages in terrorism and that 
part which provides humanitarian services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill makes it impossible to sanitize a terrorist 
organization merely by keeping humanitarian activities separate 
from terrorist activities on the organization chart.  It is 
naive to think that the purpose of these groups' assistance 
activities can be kept separate from their use of violence to 
attain their political goals, unless the intention is to 
deceive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill makes it clear that Canada will not tolerate the abuse 
of our democratic system and institutions to promote and fund 
terrorism. 
We will not allow terrorists to obtain charity status by 
concealing their terrorist operations behind charitable 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not the only country to take steps to prevent 
terrorist organizations from passing themselves off as 
legitimate charities.  In July 1996 all of the G-8 countries 
made a commitment “to take steps to prevent or counteract, 
through appropriate domestic measures, the financing of 
terrorists and terrorist organizations, whether such financing 
is direct or indirect through organizations which also have or 
claim to have charitable, social or cultural goals”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is part of Canada's response to this 
international concern.  It is not the total solution.  It 
addresses only the issue of tax incentives that are being 
provided to organizations whose activities are not consistent 
with the concept of charity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such provisions do however indicate a step in the right 
direction.  As confirmed by the report presented in 1999 by the 
special senate committee on security and intelligence, taxation 
measures applicable to charitable organizations are exposed to 
the possibility of abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee pointed out that a variety of groups with 
terrorist affiliations are carrying out fundraising activities 
in Canada and that benevolent or philanthropic organizations 
often serve as fronts for fundraising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report specifically points out that such groups use the 
status of registered charity under the Income Tax Act to enhance 
their credibility. 
It also suggests that Canadian taxpayers may be unwittingly 
supporting violent political actions by these groups through 
donations they believed were going to provide humanitarian aid.

registered charities are charitable as the term is understood by 
the law.  We have a clear onus to ensure the integrity of the 
system and to take whatever steps are necessary to see that the 
legislative framework for the system guards against abuse. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the bill does.  It protects the registration of 
charities by providing recourse to secret information, to 
security information, relevant to the determination of a 
charity's right to receive donations providing tax relief. 
To this end, it in fact creates a parallel appeal process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The automatic judicial review process will be used only when the 
solicitor general and the national revenue minister take steps to 
revoke or refuse a registration on the grounds that donations are 
being used to support acts of terrorism.

information relevant to national security in determining the 
status of the charity, while protecting from inappropriate 
disclosure delicate information on national security. 
The rules currently in effect requiring full public disclosure 
will continue to apply in all other appeals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to building 
Canadians' trust in the voluntary sector and in the integrity of 
our tax administration. This is a step that should be welcomed by 
all concerned about our charity registration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To close, we cannot and will not neglect our responsibility to 
all Canadians to ensure tax measures relating to charitable 
organizations are respected and may be controlled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the very foundation of public trust in tax measures 
applying to charities.  This trust is fragile and must be

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on behalf 
of the constituents of Surrey Central to send Bill C-16 to 
committee before second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is the Liberal government's feeble attempt to 
prevent terrorist groups from obtaining charitable tax status. 
The solicitor general has tabled a grandiose scheme to try to 
prevent undesirables from setting up shop in Canada to raise 
money to overthrow a foreign government or for oppressive violent 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is often raised by force, with the threat of personal 
injury or death.  We know that approximately 26 groups have 
charitable tax free status in our country thanks to the weak 
Liberal government that lacks vision and backbone.  It is trying 
to pass some kind of multi-step program to slowly revoke the 
bogus charitable status of terrorist groups operating in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly describe the multi-step process set out in the 
bill that would lead to the denial of charitable status.  First, 
the RCMP and CSIS would inform the Solicitor General of Canada 
and the Minister of National Revenue of an organization's 
suspected provision of resources to a terrorist group.  If the 
ministers conclude that the organization makes or would make 
resources available for terrorism, these ministers would then 
sign a certificate to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the certificate is signed, the organization would be 
notified and the certificate would be referred to a federal court 
judge.  The judge would review the intelligence reports in 
private and would provide a summary to the organization.  If the 
judge upholds the certificate the organization would lose its 
charitable status for three years, subject to a review if there 
has been a change in material circumstances to the organization. 
Finally there would be no appeal of the judge's decision.  That 
is the good news.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of the bill is unlikely to be major.  The process is 
sufficiently complicated that the first designation will probably 
not be made until years have lapsed.  Provisions for in camera 
hearings are necessary to protect intelligence sources and 
methods.  There are no such provisions in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is obligated, pursuant to a United Nations convention, to 
make it a criminal offence to raise funds for terrorists. However 
the government is not serious about fighting crime or preventing 
terrorists from using bogus charitable status to raise taxpayer 
dollars to finance their schemes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I met with representatives from the Canadian 
Association for a United Sri Lanka.  We discussed the United 
Nations international convention for the suppression of the 
financing of terrorism.  The individuals I met pointed out that 
while many countries are expected to support the convention, at 
least 22 countries must ratify it before it can come into effect. 
So far only two countries have ratified it and I hope more will 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill the government is doing nothing to stop criminals or 
terrorists from raising funds in Canada for terrorist activities. 
About a year ago two cabinet ministers attended a fundraiser in 
support of the Tamil Tigers in contravention of warnings from the 
U.S. state department, the high commission in Sri Lanka, CSIS and 
the RCMP.  This demonstrated the Canadian government's lack of 
seriousness about fighting terrorism.  It is only interested in 
doing what is politically expedient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers are assisting the funding of terrorist 
activities because the money raised by these bogus charitable 
status organizations is subsidized by the taxpayer.  Even if the 
tax status were removed, however, would the government stop these 
organizations from raising funds in Canada?  I do not think so. 
There is nothing about that in the bill.  It is a violation of 
the UN convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the activities of the finance minister and the 
international development minister.  They attended a questionable 
fundraising event.  Article 2, section 5 of the United Nations 
international convention for the suppression of the financing of 
terrorism says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any person also commits an offence if that person:

</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two cabinet ministers could be charged under this section of 
the UN convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shameful case of Ahmed Ressam should set off alarm bells and 
signify to the government how weak and ineffective it is at 
fighting terrorism.  This was a textbook case of a terrorist who 
was arrested crossing the border from Canada to the United States 
on December 14, 1999.  Ressam had plans, the ability and the 
material to commit a bombing in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The details of this man's life for the previous five years have 
come out at his trial in the U.S. where he was convicted on all 
nine indictments against him.  The case reads like an indictment 
of the Liberal government.  Canada has no laws against terrorism 
thanks to a weak Liberal government which lacks vision, a 
backbone and the political will to combat terrorism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ressam, like other terrorists, took advantage of our lax refugee 
and immigration system.  He arrived in Montreal in 1994 and 
claimed refugee status at the airport, describing himself as a 
suspected Islamic terrorist.  He was fingerprinted, and guess 
what?  He was set free.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He collected welfare for most of the five years.  He was not 
deported after he was arrested for theft.  Later he was arrested 
for pickpocketing elderly women and set free again.  He was 
arrested for stealing luggage and set free again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He failed to show up at his refugee hearing in 1995 and the 
refugee board concluded that he had abandoned his claim.  Rather 
than deporting him at that stage, the board allowed him to appeal 
that decision in 1996 and he was set free again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then changed his identity and got a Canadian passport. Let us 
imagine a terrorist getting a Canadian passport.  Then he got a 
social insurance card and a Quebec driver's licence and began to 
travel the world, pursuing terrorist training outside Canada that 
included an association with Bin Laden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 French government representatives tried to get into 
Canada to interview Ressam but was not allowed in until October. 
After October they immediately got the goods on the guy by 
searching his apartment in Montreal, although Ressam was nowhere 
to be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally he showed up.  He showed up trying to get into the U.S. 
in December and was arrested.  The world is disappointed in 
Canada.  What would have happened if Ressam had been arrested in 
Canada?  He would have received a maximum of ten years, of which 
only two would be spent in jail.  Having been convicted in the 
U.S. he will now spend one hundred years in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, after years of the Reform Party and now the 
Canadian Alliance fighting for tougher laws to combat gangs, 
criminal activities and terrorist organizations, the Liberal 
government has finally introduced some of the legislation we have 
been calling for.  However the weak Liberal government that lacks 
the political will to get tough on crime, particularly organized 
crime and terrorism, has only done so under pressure from the 
opposition, the United Nations, the public, the RCMP and CSIS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Combating organized crime and terrorism was part of the Alliance 
justice platform.  However the bill is a feeble attempt by the 
government to address the issue.  It will be ineffective and 
lengthy and will lead nowhere.  It is not enough.  It is not the 
giant step that is needed.  We will therefore be opposing the 
legislation.

Canada is proud to be a multicultural nation of peace and

of rights and freedoms is a model for the world which reflects 
Canada's commitment to human rights.  The bill reflects core 
Canadian values and is fully consistent with our fundamental 
charter principle of fairness and due process under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill focuses very narrowly on terrorism and on organizations 
that may improperly use charitable status in Canada to raise 
funds to support terrorism.  The bill includes many safeguards, 
including provisions that allow organizations to regain 
charitable status by demonstrating that they no longer support 
terrorism and that their activities are fully consistent with 
charitable status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill recognizes that Canadians have the right to engage in 
political activity.  They have the right to make their views 
known in ways that are accepted in a free and democratic society, 
through advocacy, protest and dissent.  They have a right to 
finance groups and support political causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the bill interferes with those rights for any 
Canadian.  What the bill does is set a clear standard for public 
policy.  It draws a line between the exercise of rights and the 
abuse of charitable status to cover support for terrorism.

</I></B></P><P align=left>No civilized society can condone terrorism.  By taking steps to 
prevent the abuse of charitable tax status Canada is supporting 
the international campaign to stop support for terrorism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also help eliminate the suspicions and innuendo 
that produce tension based on racial, ethnic, religious or 
national differences.  Allegations and suspicions would be dealt 
with based on facts.  We want to be able to assure Canadians that 
an organization that has charitable status uses the funds it 
raises for charitable purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have argued that legislation should focus on individuals 
rather than on organizations.  They argue that organizations may 
be unaware of the true agenda of individuals who are using them 
to support terrorism.  However it is organizations, not 
individuals, that are registered as charities.  Charitable 
organizations have an obligation under the Income Tax Act to 
maintain direction and control over how their resources are used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have suggested that the proposed process may be unfairly 
influenced by unreliable and politically motivated information 
from foreign governments that do not share Canada's commitment to 
human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have confidence in our system of parliamentary democracy and 
judicial independence.  Canadians can be assured our laws would 
be administered fairly and, when required, interpreted in a fair 
and just manner by our courts.  The process would be open and 
transparent so that all Canadians could judge for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, every stage of the proposed process would be driven 
by hard facts.  Risk factors used to identify suspicious cases 
would be based on facts documented in security and intelligence 
reports.  When a concern is identified, Canadian security 
agencies would be asked to determine if there is a strong and 
credible case.  Only then would the facts be presented to the 
Solicitor General of Canada and the Minister of National Revenue 
for separate, independent reviews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case would not proceed further unless each minister agreed 
there were reasonable grounds to believe the organization was 
providing support for terrorism.  The ministerial review 
requirement would impose a significant level of political 
accountability before any case was presented to the courts or any 
public comments were made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next step would be to subject the facts to an independent 
and rigorous judicial review.  Before that took place however 
the organization would be allowed to seek an order from the court 
directing that its identity be protected during the proceedings 
to avoid undue harm to its reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A federal court judge would prepare a summary of the facts 
contained in national security documents.  The summary would 
protect sensitive information but would enable the organization 
to be reasonably informed of the circumstances causing the 
government to consider refusing or revoking charitable status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An open hearing would then be held at which the organization 
would have the opportunity to call witnesses and introduce 
evidence in its defence.  Only after all the information had been 
considered would the court determine whether the government was 
entitled to refuse or revoke charitable status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shall not lose sight of the fact that the whole process would 
take place against a backdrop of other independent checks and 
balances designed to protect the rights and freedoms of all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian security services are subject to stringent controls and 
accountability mechanisms.  For example, the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee, SIRC, and the Inspector General of 
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, CSIS, have 
complementary roles in overseeing CSIS operations.  They ensure 
that Canada's security and intelligence service functions 
responsibly and that its actions are appropriate and in 
conformity with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SIRC is a non-partisan committee of five privy councillors.  It 
is independent of the government in its operations but reports to 
parliament.  It has access to any information under the control 
of the service and is entitled to look at everything the service 
does.  It has the power of independent inquiry and authority to 
investigate complaints about any act or thing done by CSIS even 
where the complainant is not personally affected by that action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inspector general serves as the solicitor general's internal 
auditor for CSIS providing another independent means of assurance 
that CSIS is complying with the law, ministerial direction and 
operational policy.  Together these underlying accountability 
mechanisms offer Canadians unparalleled protection against 
discriminatory practices and abuses of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation targets violent activities no Canadian could 
condone.  It would provide a fair and just mechanism for dealing 
with persons or groups who would abuse the trust of Canadians. It 
is legislation that meets the needs of all Canadians and is 
legislation that we can all be proud of.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to rise in the House today to speak to 
Bill C-16, an act respecting the registration of charities and 
security information and the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to provide a mechanism to strip 
organizations of their charitable status if they are caught 
fundraising for terrorist groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the bill would have minimal impact on stemming 
terrorism in Canada.  Effectively, the legislation says that it 
is all right to sponsor terrorism, it is all right to financially 
raise support for terrorists, but a person cannot get a tax 
deduction for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective legislation, legislation Canadian Alliance could 
wholeheartedly support, would make it a criminal offence to raise 
and provide funds to support a terrorist organization.  This type 
of legislation already exists in the United States and the United 
Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If curbing the operation of terrorist front groups truly was the 
goal, we could emulate Great Britain's terrorism act 2000, which 
empowers cabinet to ban from its country any organization that it 
believes is involved in terrorist activities.  The law proscribes 
any group if it commits or participates in acts of terrorism: if 
it prepares for terrorism; if it promotes or encourages 
terrorism; or if it is otherwise concerned in terrorism either in 
the United Kingdom or abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British government publicly identified 21 groups that were 
associated with terrorism.  Among the groups were the likes of 
Babbar Khalsa, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Abu Nidal 
Organization and the Kurdistan Workers Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States tried to get at terrorist fundraising through 
the anti-terrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996. 
Section 302 of the act authorizes the secretary of state to 
designate as foreign terrorist organizations any group that meets 
specific criteria.  The act makes it an offence to knowingly 
provide or conspire to provide material support or resources to a 
foreign terrorist organization.  In 1999 there were 28 foreign 
terrorist organizations that were listed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1998 CSIS report said that there were as many as 50 
international terrorist organizations active in Canada, often 
using the country as a banking centre.  The report said that 
liberal immigration laws, relatively open borders, freedom of 
movement, advanced communication systems and the proximity to the 
United States made Canada inviting for terrorists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1999 an influential Senate committee, headed by 
Senator William Kelly, spent months hearing closed door 
testimonies from almost 100 members of the security and 
intelligence community.  The reports of the special Senate 
committee on security and intelligence stated very clearly that 
Canada remained a venue of opportunity for terrorist groups.  It 
remained a place where they could raise funds, purchase arms and 
conduct other activities to support their organizations and their 
terrorist activities elsewhere.  Most of the major international 
terrorist organizations already have a presence in Canada 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report made 33 recommendations which unfortunately the 
Liberal government failed to embrace.  The most important 
recommendation was for a new criminal penalty to combat cyber 
attacks on vital computer systems by hackers and other electronic 
saboteurs.  It also called for powers to battle terrorist 
fundraising, more money for intelligence agencies and measures to 
better track possible extremists who made their way or who came 
into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senators determined that technological advances available to 
terrorists and spies, from cash debit cards to sophisticated 
satellites, posed the most serious challenge to Canadian 
authorities.  The committee confirmed that several groups with 
terrorist affiliations raised money in Canada, often through 
philanthropic organizations registered as charities under the 
Federal Income Tax Act.  The Senate committee said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such status enhances the credibility of such groups and, 
ironically, creates the situation where Canadian taxpayers end up 
subsidizing their activities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate committee also found that the operating funds for 
federal agencies with a security or intelligence role fell to 
$333 million in 1997-98, down from $467 million in 1989-90, a 
trend that it suggests and that it would argue must be reversed 
to keep Canada from falling behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 2000 budget for the United States security and 
intelligence sector was increased by approximately $2 billion. 
The amount of the United States increase alone was more than four 
times the total amount budgeted for Canada's security and 
intelligence community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the committee's recommendations pertained to a legal 
migration into Canada, primarily through our refugee 
determination system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is a means by which terrorists may circumvent our 
vetting process abroad and enter Canada in search for a temporary 
or for a permanent haven.  Once here they may conduct fundraising 
activities or other activities.  In a very few cases they also 
organize acts of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, large volumes of illegal migrants may ultimately provide 
the stream in which a few terrorists gain entry into the United 
States by circumventing Canadian and United States border 
controls, since Canada has no exit controls.  No exit controls 
mean that it is impossible to calculate how many people remain in 
Canada illegally, how many slip into the United States, how many 
return to their country of origin or how many go elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of October 23, 1998 there were 6,110 warrants for removal 
issued against persons deemed to have abandoned or withdrawn 
their refugee claims.  Of these, 640 warrants were executed and 
the persons removed from Canada; 240 warrants were cancelled; and 
there was no action on the remaining 5,272 warrants.  It is quite 
obvious that this is a very serious problem.

reported that RCMP officers testified at an immigration hearing 
that as many as 8,000 Tamil guerrillas with military weapon 
training were now living in the Toronto area after fleeing a 
civil war in Sri Lanka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to the Tamil guerrillas, I would like to conclude 
today by quoting the April 27 <I>National Post</I> article which 
said:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sergeant Fred Bowen said most were “in the retired category” 
but a few remain active and all had undergone some form of 
military training provided either by India's military 
intelligence agency or the Tamil Tigers rebel army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sergeant Bowen's estimate of the number of guerrillas who have 
slipped into Canada during this influx matches a Toronto police 
figure and may explain how the small rebel force manages to 
raise, according to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 
$2 million a year in Canada to finance its war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sergeant Bowen testified that aside from the former guerrilla 
fighters there are 12 to 15 active members of the Tigers who are 
on call to commit crimes for the insurgent force in Toronto, as 
well as 1,000 Tamil gang members, about a third of them 
supporters of the rebels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said there had been 65 shootings in the Toronto Tamil 
community since September, 2000...“The vast majority of the 
community is not involved.  They are being victimized, they are 
being extorted.

passport theft; drug dealing; crimes of opportunity; frauds; 
counterfeiting; credit card frauds; attempted murder; 
kidnappings; extortions.”

</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support this ineffective legislation in its present 
form, therefore I call upon the government to introduce and 
enact legislation that would make it hard for terrorists and 
their supporters to get here, stay here and that would make it 
impossible for them to raise money while they here.  If they were 
caught in any way, shape or form supporting terrorist activities 
here or abroad, criminal charges with a very severe penalty would 
be handed down.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FARM CREDIT CORPORATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK215">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-25, an 
act to amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act and to make 
consequential amendments to others acts, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, once again I am honoured to rise in the House to debate 
issues that are specific to the agriculture sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a farmer and member representing a predominantly rural riding 
where the agriculture industry is a major economic engine of our 
communities, anything related to farm and to finances is 
extremely important to me, as it is to my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 is an act to amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act. It 
proposes to modify the role of the Farm Credit Corporation. What 
does Bill C-25 do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Bill C-25 will change the name from Farm Credit 
Corporation to Farm Credit Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it expands the role of the Farm Credit Corporation to 
allow the corporation to lend to businesses that are not 
necessarily directly involved in primary agriculture production 
or do not have farmers as the majority shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it expands the lending role to let Farm Credit 
Corporation provide equity financing by allowing it to hold 
non-fixed assets such as cattle as collateral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it formalizes Farm Credit Corporation's leasing ability 
which, although not specific, could include farmland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is the last day of April.  We are back on a Monday.  After 
I spent the weekend in my constituency back in Crowfoot 
travelling throughout the constituency I can tell members that it 
is very apparent that farmers are in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were promised and guaranteed by the federal agriculture 
minister that Canadians would see financial help before the seed 
was put in the ground.  That has not been the case.  As we 
travelled throughout the constituencies people continuously 
asked where the money was that was promised by the federal 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were home this week.  Springtime is usually the time where 
spirits are high as farmers look forward, with great expectation, 
to preparing the soil, seeding, planting, putting in their crops. 
Spirits are not high on the family farm and throughout western 
Canada and rural Canada.  As we travel throughout the 
constituencies we see that it is a cloudy horizon, a troublesome 
horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how I could explain to the House some of the 
things that we saw as we travelled throughout Crowfoot this past 
weekend.  In the distance we saw on the horizon clouds that 
looked like they were fires.  They were not fires.  They were 
dust clouds.  They were dust storms.  The wind was blowing hard; 
it was hot and dry and the dust was blowing.  Farmers were 
turning off the tractors and shutting them down because they 
realized that the more they cultivated the more the moisture 
disappeared.  They were already laying the seed into a dry bed, 
so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spirits are not high.  As farmers go to the fields, they 
realize that this spring input costs have soared and are going 
through the roof.  Fertilizer costs have nearly doubled from last 
year.  Commodity prices are in the pit.  Barley is around $2, 
wheat is $3 and canola is under $6.  Commodity prices farmers 
are getting have not kept up with the input costs.  Hope is 
diminishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the winter our farmers were writing and calling and 
stopping at the office asking what we could do about the heating 
bills.  Working in the shop was almost ruled out because they 
were trying to save on their heating bills.  The troubles just 
seem to go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, have no fear, because the Liberal government has come 
forward with a proposal that will change the name of the Farm 
Credit Corporation, a proposal that will expand the lending 
abilities of the Farm Credit Corporation to allow it to now lend 
to businesses, not just farmers, not just the family farm, but 
remotely related agriculture businesses.  That just does not sell 
down on the farm.  That just does not sell where the rubber meets 
the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the name change, the federal government believes 
that this name change is absolutely necessary to affirm its 
federal identity to the program and to the corporation.  I was 
born and raised on the family farm and have been farming actively 
for over 20 years.  I think it is a very well known fact that the 
Farm Credit Corporation is an agency of the Government of Canada. 
I therefore do not necessarily agree that the name should be 
changed, particularly if it will result in the needless 
expenditures of scarce federal dollars for agriculture and 
agriculture related programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently 94% of the corporation's financial services are 
directed to farmers and businesses that are directly related to 
primary production. 
Recognizing that expanding the lending capability of FCC may 
strain the corporation's ability to service farmers' demands for 
credit, I must oppose this amendment to the FCC act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance, as stated by my colleagues earlier today, 
does not agree with extending Farm Credit Corporation's 
involvement beyond family farm operations.  The extension of that 
lending ability beyond primary production may bring Farm Credit 
Corporation into direct competition with private lending 
institutions and may overlap the government's institutions such 
as the federal Business Development Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should think of what the Liberal government is trying to 
accomplish.  It says we need money.  It says we need to provide 
financing for farmers and for agriculture related businesses, but 
now it would open up the floodgates to other businesses that are 
not necessarily primary producers or tied to producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government has perhaps changed the wrong name. 
Maybe it is not the word corporation that it should get rid of, 
but the word farm, because the legislation would take money off 
the farm tables and undoubtedly put it onto many business tables, 
and it may also effectively end up remaining on cabinet tables. 
The problem we are seeing in rural western Canada is that there 
are not enough funds being put onto the kitchen tables on the 
majority of farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not change the name to Canada Credit Corporation, CCC? It is 
easy to remember.  Then the word farm will be taken right out of 
the equation.  We could change it to CCCP, like the hockey team's 
sweaters that read CCCP, Canada Credit Corporation Policy.  Maybe 
that is what the government should be looking at.  It might be as 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to formalizing the leasing ability of FCC, the 
government has stated that the intent is not to include land. 
Rather, it claims the leasing provisions are for equipment. 
However, this is not made clear in the legislation.  This will 
definitely be one of the amendments which I hope will come 
forward through our very good agriculture critics in the Canadian 
Alliance, or all parties could bring that amendment forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance does not think it is appropriate for the 
government to be holders of farmland.  We believe that if Farm 
Credit Corporation is allowed to permanently hold and lease land, 
it could result in the Canadian government's holdings influencing 
the market value of farmland.  While we accept that it is 
impossible for Farm Credit Corporation to avoid holding land for 
short periods of time, the act should explicitly state that Farm 
Credit Corporation should divest itself of any holdings as 
quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of years ago I looked for packages of farmland on a map 
of Saskatchewan.  As I looked at the central Saskatchewan area, 
close to Central Butte and Riverhurst and some of those areas, I 
was appalled to see how much farmland was actually held by Farm 
Credit Corporation.  It held quarters and quarters of land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will happen.  It is evident, especially with what farming 
and agriculture have gone through.  However, the responsibility 
of the government and the responsibility of Farm Credit 
Corporation must be to hold that land for a very short period of 
time to allow the market to set the value, to disperse it and to 
give hope to young people who want, for some reason, to get into 
farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support extending FCC's lending ability to include equity 
financing.  We applaud it.  It is a great idea, but as stated 
before, we want that given only to primary producers.  That 
portion of the bill must be related only to those who are farming 
and involved in primary production, those who are making their 
living by putting the seed in the ground or raising cattle or any 
of the other things primary producers are doing.  Allowing 
non-fixed assets such as livestock to be collateral for loans 
would greatly assist farmers who are currently not eligible for 
financial assistance.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance certainly encourages increased financial 
assistance for cash-strapped farmers toiling endless hours a day 
producing the high quality food products that Canadians have come 
to appreciate, enjoy and expect.  Unfortunately the federal 
Liberal government's failure to provide farmers with a much 
needed cash injection will result in more farmers depending on 
loans to get their crops in the ground this spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As raised in the House on many occasions in the brief three 
months of this session of parliament, farmers have continually 
come here, lobbied and asked the government for a minimum of $900 
million.  I have heard some groups explain to the government why 
they needed a minimum of $1.6 billion, others why they needed 
$1.2 billion, but it was generally accepted that the lowest 
figure was the minimum of $900 million.  The government however 
saw fit to come forward and provide only $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore proposed on March 20 in a supply motion that the 
government authorize the expenditure of an additional $400 
million.  En masse Liberal members of parliament voted 
against our motion and again the federal government denied 
farmers the much needed financial assistance.  My colleagues have 
repeatedly stood in the House expressing our sentiments and those 
of our constituents regarding this financial holdout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to share with all members of the House the 
opinion of Mr. J. J. Huber of Midale, Saskatchewan, as written in 
a recent edition of the <I>Western Producer</I>.  I ask members to 
listen carefully.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me sick to my stomach to have to listen to the senseless 
dribble coming from our rural Liberal MPs.  They talk the talk, 
but when their job is on the line, they cannot abandon the 
Canadian farmers quick enough.  I tell you, if we lose 45 percent 
of our farmers in the near future, agriculture will become a 
non-issue in Canada.  Maybe we should just seed all arable land 
to grass and we can import all of our ag products from the U.S. 
or U.K. because they are the only people left in this world who 
care about their agriculture industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And when our consumers in Canada give their urban MPs grief 
because the price of food has quadrupled, who will the MPs run to 
then?...The farm gate is just the starting point.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To hear the MPs say that farmers or other common folk don't 
understand politics, what's not to understand?  It's really 
simple:  you lie to the people and tell them how you will speak 
for them, and once the waters get a little rough in Ottawa, you 
ditch the people who you represent because you might lose your 
job if you actually do what your constituents want you to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You then do a 180-degree turn and tell your constituents that 
they do not know much about politics and that your abandoning 
them is just part of the political game.  I don't know of any 
other job in the world where you can continue to lie to the 
people who pay your wages, and turn your back on them when they 
want you to actually do your job, and still continue to get paid. 
Politics, it makes me sick to my stomach. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture, politics, I think it tends to make all of us a 
little sick to our stomachs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I say to Mr. Huber that he should take great strength 
because the government has come up with a bill that would give a 
name change to Farm Credit Corporation.  Does that make Mr. Huber 
feel better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that does not quite do it, he can understand this.  The 
legislation will allow not just farmers to receive the help from 
a lending institution of this Canadian government, Farm Credit 
Corporation, but it will also allow help to other businesses so 
that the government can stand and say <I>x</I> amount of dollars 
is available to farmers and to agriculture when actually in 
effect it is going to businesses that are not even related as 
primary producers.  Does that make Mr. Huber feel better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about expanding the lending role to let FCC provide 
financial equity by allowing it to hold non-fixed assets as 
collateral?  There is a little grab-all in every legislation. 
Maybe that is the one little bit that we need to grab hold of and 
put our hope and our trust in for better help.  What about the 
pill to formalize FCC's leasing ability, which could include 
farmland?  How does that make Mr. Huber feel?  Mr. Huber and 
young people across Canada would have the ability to lease back 
land.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a hope that we could own our farmland, make payments 
and pay off debts.  Now we have the ability to lease it back from 
our federal government. Despite the financial hardships that our 
farmers must endure as a result of increased costs of production, 
the legislation needs to be changed.  We can change it and make 
it truly effective.  The legislation is a bitter pill to swallow, 
as I study it further and see it coming down the pike described 
as some type of agricultural help.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural 
Development)(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern 
Ontario), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the 
hon. member across the way.  His passion and concern for his 
constituents in the agricultural community certainly came 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns, though, because part of his approach is 
too limited in its scope.  He is right.  We do have to deal with 
the issues and the concerns of our primary producers.  However 
there is more than one way to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that is critical is that our primary producers 
have a greater opportunity to paint a long term vision for 
agriculture.  The hon. member has spoken about a long term vision 
for agriculture.  Part of that should be developing down the 
chain from producer to consumer.  There is a fairly long chain 
between when we produce the goods until we eventually sell them. 
The more of that chain and that value adding of our agriculture 
production that can actually occur in rural Canada in our farming 
communities, the better off our rural communities would be and 
the better off would be their long term sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to create a value added entity within a rural 
community, access to capital must be one of those issues. If the 
FCC's mandate is expanded, not so that it can fund just any old 
business because that is not what is being done but to fund 
businesses that are part of that chain, we would be working 
toward the sustainability of rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member explain why he would not see that as a positive 
way of helping our primary producers and a way of sustaining our 
rural communities, which I know is critical to him and to all 
rural members who sit in the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very good 
question coming from an individual who has studied rural 
development a great deal and understands the things that need to 
happen in agriculture.  I am thrilled that he mentioned value 
added and the important role that value added products give to 
Canadian agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my concerns is that we do not see the Farm Credit 
Corporation as the agriculture credit corporation.  We need to 
have a body such as the FCC that can provide capital to young 
farmers, farmers who want to buy more land, enlarge their 
facility and to do some of the things that the FCC is very good 
at doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of FCC branches in our constituency.  Very 
close friends of mine have used the FCC and have gained financing 
from it.  However, I do not wish to see the FCC becoming only an 
agriculture credit corporation.  It is imperative to have 
directives toward the farm that will encourage farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give the government some credit, we have the Federal Business 
Development Bank.  Would it now get out of anything that may be 
deemed agriculture?  Would it abandon anything that might be 
remotely close to being agriculture?  I think not.  Good sound 
business such as value added products, fertilizer, equipment and 
any of those things would still be covered by the Federal 
Business Development Bank.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything should not be thrown into the Farm Credit 
Corporation.  It should be pointed singularly toward farming, 
farmers, the family farm and the people who are trying to get 
started.  Right now 94% of the moneys available through the FCC 
are given directly to family farm operations.  It can 
deteriorate.  It can be chipped away at.  Pretty soon a very 
small percentage could be dedicated to the family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as value added, let me also say that many other things 
would encourage value added products or businesses being promoted 
in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the hindrances toward that could be the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  The Canadian Wheat Board says that if we were to begin to 
make a value added product in the west we would not be able to 
buy our wheat locally.  We would have to pay the transportation 
of that wheat to a port, pay the transportation of it back, even 
if it were next door to where the wheat was produced.  We would 
have to buy it off the Canadian Wheat Board, pay the elevation 
charges and all those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could do a number of things to help promote value added.  The 
member has hit the nail on the head.  We should start with the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-25, 
an act to amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act.  As a mother 
living on a family farm and who has lost two sons from that farm, 
I speak passionately about the Farm Credit Corporation and the 
institution that it is in western Canada and for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides services that are not available through other more 
traditional financial institutions.  Farmers have come to rely 
upon the Farm Credit Corporation.  The bill would expand the 
focus of the Farm Credit Corporation past its original purpose of 
providing financial services only to family farms and the 
businesses that are directly related to primary production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lending role of the Farm Credit Corporation would be 
expanded to allow the corporation to lend to other businesses 
that are not necessarily directed or involved in primary 
agriculture production and do not necessarily have farmers as 
major shareholders.  It raises some serious issues with respect 
to government getting involved in areas where the private sector 
already operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By extending the lending abilities of the Farm Credit 
Corporation beyond primary production, the bill would bring the 
Farm Credit Corporation into direct competition with private 
lending institutions and would overlap with other government 
institutions such as the Business Development Bank of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the proposal is that it lacks clear definition. 
It is not stated clearly.  It raises more questions than it 
answers.  For example, if the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool needed an 
infusion of cash, would the provision allow the Farm Credit 
Corporation to become a major lender to the Saskatchewan Wheat 
Pool?  That is of great concern to a lot of people.  The Canadian 
Alliance has always opposed government expansion into areas 
already competently served by the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 would formalize the ability of the Farm Credit 
Corporation to own and lease land.  The Farm Credit Corporation 
has stated that it is not the intent of the amendment.  It claims 
the leasing provisions would be for equipment.  However it is not 
made clear in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not appropriate for the federal government to be the owner 
of farmland.  Canadian farmers are supposed to own farmland. 
Allowing the Farm Credit Corporation to permanently hold and 
lease land could result in the government holding and influencing 
the market value of farmland.  We have seen that lately in our 
own district. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing the Farm Credit Corporation to permanently hold and 
lease land may also provide the corporation with an incentive not 
to pursue every possible means to allow farmers to stay on the 
land if they are experiencing financial difficulty. 
In short, the bill could provide Farm Credit Corporation with an 
incentive to prematurely foreclose on farmers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even under the current legislation the Farm Credit Corporation 
has become a significant landowner.  In 2000 the Farm Credit 
Corporation owned over 360,000 acres in Canada.  Ninety-five per 
cent of that land is held in Saskatchewan, the province that has 
been the hardest hit by the farm income crisis.  That is scary. 
The last thing Saskatchewan needs is for the federal government, 
through the Farm Credit Corporation, to start distorting the 
market value of farmland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is impossible for the Farm Credit Corporation to avoid 
holding land for short periods of time, the act should explicitly 
state that the Farm Credit Corporation should divest itself of 
any holdings as quickly as possible.  My party hopes to convince 
the government to bring forward amendments to the bill to clarify 
this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 would extend the lending ability of the Farm Credit 
Corporation into the area of equity financing.  It would be done 
by allowing the Farm Credit Corporation to hold non-fixed assets 
such as cattle as collateral for loans.  This change would allow 
the Farm Credit Corporation to provide farm financing to primary 
producers who are not eligible under the current legislation.  In 
many cases it would provide financing that would not be available 
from private lenders.  It is a positive change to legislation of 
which my colleagues and I are supportive, provided financing is 
limited to operations involving primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A point not directly addressed by the legislation is the issue 
of fairness.  In many cases the Farm Credit Corporation treats 
supply managed sectors differently than it does sectors not 
governed by supply management.  This is something that my party 
is opposed to.  It would be far better for the Farm Credit 
Corporation to treat equally all producers, regardless of which 
sector they may be a part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we have a situation where the Liberals have 
introduced provisions that we object to for sound reasons coupled 
with reasons we support.  Extending the equity financing 
capability of the Farm Credit Corporation to non-fixed assets 
like livestock is certainly a positive move and one which we 
support.  However, if we put that up against extending the 
ability of the Farm Credit Corporation to lease and hold land and 
to lend beyond primary producers we have a stalemate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the Canadian Alliance has decided to oppose the 
legislation unless significant amendments are made to clarify the 
problems I have identified. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a short 
question for my colleague who is a very valued member of the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.  The member is 
from Saskatchewan and I respect her knowledge of the situation in 
her province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about her party not being in favour of 
extending the Farm Credit Corporation moneys beyond the producer. 
I encourage her to ask her neighbours and colleagues if they feel 
the same way.  When we offer money to the agri-food companies and 
expand markets, we are able to move the grain beyond the farm 
gate.  They have done a great job of diversifying, but there are 
many crops grown today in Saskatchewan which we could market 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to support the legislation.  I look 
forward to her amendments if she is making any.  Would she ask 
some of her neighbours at home how they feel?  I have heard from 
people in Saskatchewan who are in favour of the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as a producer of lentils, 
chick peas, hay, wheat, oats, barley, elk and bison, I know a lot 
about marketing in Saskatchewan.  I also know a certain segment 
of our economy looks to the Farm Credit Corporation.  My problem 
is that the Farm Credit Corporation is not clearly defined in 
these changes.  A large multinational corporation can come in and 
get a huge amount of money from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the government sees the agriculture producers in 
Saskatchewan as being able to market their own grain.  I would 
like to tell the hon. member that we have tremendous marketing 
people in our industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A previous member spoke about the Canadian Wheat Board. I want 
to mention to the hon. member that the Canadian Wheat Board is 
not a Canadian wheat board.  It is a western Canadian wheat board 
because it is not the same in Ontario or in Nova Scotia.   When 
the Canadian government expands the wheat board and makes it 
equal across Canada for everyone, not just the western provinces, 
then maybe we will have fairness in the system.  Maybe then 
producers in western Canada would look at this more favourably. 
The neighbours I have spoken to are not in favour of this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I value the privilege of speaking to the bill because it 
addresses the wider issue of agriculture, a very important aspect 
of what happens here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not originally scheduled to speak on this but after 
listening to the debate throughout the day, and especially to my 
hon. colleague from Crowfoot, it got me fired up.  I felt I had 
to get to the House and deliver some words that would castigate 
the Liberal government for its total mismanagement of the 
agricultural sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here talking about the Farm Credit Corporation, a 
corporation that should have been designed to help farmers but 
which, too often, has been just the opposite.  What the country 
needs is a government policy that would permit farmers to 
actually produce and market their product at a price they 
can afford to pay for production and provide themselves and their 
families with a reasonable living.  That is what is really needed 
and that is the part that is missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore in the few minutes I have I will talk a little bit 
about not only the Farm Credit Corporation and financing for 
farmers and agricultural producers, but I also want to address 
briefly and tie it in with the whole idea of marketing by the 
wheat board and the way it applies and misapplies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I became fired up is that I remembered not long ago 
speaking with a farmer from Saskatchewan.  I have said a number 
of times in the House that I was born in Saskatchewan.  I used to 
say that I was actually born at home because it was a long time 
ago when a lot of people were born at home.  I used to say that 
as soon as my mother saw me they had to rush her to the hospital. 
That was not really true.  It was just a little bit of humour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I was born and raised on a farm in Saskatchewan in the 
last year of the thirties.  Out west we know the term dirty 
thirties.  I do not think that term is as well known in Ontario 
and points east.  In those years we had a tremendous drought.  We 
had jokes about how poor we were and all sorts of different 
things. 
However I do not want to get into that.  What I want to say is 
that when my mom and dad got married and started farming it was 
a difficult uphill climb.  It meant long hours of work, being 
subjected to extreme variables and, once in a while, getting a 
good crop. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those years a really good crop meant maybe 20 to 25 bushels 
to the acre.  Ten to fifteen bushels was considered average and 
anything less than that was mediocre or a crop failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incredible thing is that right now farmers are producing 
crops that average 40 to 50 bushels per acre on the same land. 
Production has gone up because of the advanced use of modern 
technology.  Efficiency has also gone up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My dad and his two boys farmed 10 quarters, which was considered 
a pretty big farm back in the forties when I was a young boy.  A 
typical farm today that can make its own way is at least 10 times 
as large.  We are talking about 40 quarters to make a good viable 
farming operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of summer fallowing every other year and having only 
half the land in production, with the use of chemicals and modern 
farming methods they are able to do much better than that, in 
many instances not engaging in summer fallow for the rest of the 
land at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really true that my brother and his boys today can produce 
four times as much crop per acre as my dad did some 40 years ago. 
What is so absolutely distressing is that in this modern day, 
when production has never been as good, farmers are suffering 
more than ever.  We need to ask ourselves why that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My dad, who is in his 90th year and has seen many crops come off 
the land, cannot be kept off the land at harvest time.  There is 
something magnetic about the grain coming out of the combine or, 
back in the old days, out of the threshing machine.  We are 
producing food to feed people who would otherwise starve to 
death.  That is a very noble profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My dad told me last year how sad it was that when we have one of 
the best crops ever farmers are not making it.  That is 
really sad because farmers still work hard and long hours, as 
we do.  Nothing has changed.  For farmers to be successful they 
must work long hours, especially during seeding and harvest.  It 
involves a great deal of hard work, massive investment and a lot 
of risk taking, studying and reading to be competent in all the 
different aspects of farming. 
What do we have?  We have a government that stands in the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about a farmer to whom I spoke.  When I go to 
Saskatchewan to visit my relatives, I go with my brother to the 
elevator to look at the prices, to deliver a load of grain or to 
do different things and I end up talking with different people. 
When they find out that their neighbour's little brother is an MP 
they like to talk to me.  I talked with a farmer who was very 
frustrated.  This is very relevant to today's discussion.  He 
told me that he was frustrated because he was going to be out of 
business with the way things were going.  He said that his 
payments were due and that the Farm Credit Corporation was 
telling him to pay up or it would foreclose on his farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same farmer told me that he could pay the bill.  He said 
that he had a market for his bins full of grain if only he could 
be permitted to get a trucker to haul it.  He said that he could 
sell his Durham wheat for approximately 50% more than he would 
get from the wheat board.  He said that he could get the cash 
right away, make his payment and then everyone would be happy. 
However the wheat board said no.  It said that he had to sell it 
to the wheat board at a loss.  The government agency, the wheat 
board, which presumably is there to help farmers, in this 
instance specifically prevented the farmer from even surviving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members of the House see why I am fired up and had to rush 
down here to say this?  This is so wrong.  Liberals ought to 
wake up and realize that if they cannot give a proper price to 
farmers for their product so they can pay their bills, make a 
living and not go deeper into debt until they face bankruptcy 
and lose farms that have been in the family for 100 years, then 
maybe they should consider that their policies might be wrong. 
Maybe they should think about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation was supposed to be designed to help 
farmers.  The only way one can help people by lending them money 
is if those people have the ability to repay, otherwise it 
becomes a massive, socialistic way of confiscating farmers' land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, the Farm Credit Corporation, under its new name, 
which will cost thousands of dollars to change all the stationery 
and everything, would have the right to own property and 
lease it out.  In other words, this is a very thinly disguised 
plan to simply take over all the farmland on behalf of the 
government.  I am not one to say that this is the government's 
overt plan, but I predict it will be the result of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation has the ability to lend money to 
farmers when those farmers at the same time do not have the 
capacity to pay that loan back as well as pay for their other 
operating costs because of the restrictions of the wheat board 
and other government policies, such as high taxes and a whole 
bunch of other things.  In the end farmers will face 
foreclosure and the Farm Credit Corporation will end up owning 
the land, which by the way, in the short term I think it is 
inevitable that some farmers will not make it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in this particular bill the Farm Credit Corporation 
would now be given the freedom to continue to keep that land, 
farm it or rent it out to other people. It is a straight form of 
confiscating the very essence of what farming is all about, and 
that is the private family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned that the government, in tinkering with 
stuff like changing the name of the Farm Credit Corporation, is 
missing entirely the whole impact that agriculture has and the 
impact that this lazy, Liberal federal government has on the farm 
scene in Saskatchewan, Alberta and in Manitoba particularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what members think about this, but I believe in 
the equality of people.  It does not seem right to me that a 
farmer in one of the prairie provinces can be coerced, under the 
threat of going to jail, to sell his grain to the wheat board, 
whereas farmers in other parts of the country are not so 
required.  Other farmers can get an export permit if they want 
and can export to the United States if they find a market for 
their product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am at a loss for proper vocabulary here.  I know I must be 
respectful in the House, but why, in the name of everything 
going, can the government justify that?  If there are farmers in 
Saskatchewan who want to build a co-operative pasta plant 
together, what is it in the government's motivation that says 
that they cannot do it, that they must first sell all their wheat 
to the wheat board at a loss and then the wheat board will sell 
it to the pasta plant?  Farmers look at the bottom line and 
say that if they need the wheat board as the middle agent here, 
they cannot make it and therefore the deal is off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it in the government's interest and in the people of 
Canada's interest to say to farmers that they might have an idea 
that will help them but that they had better not do it because it 
is against government policy?  It is self-evident that the policy 
is totally wrong.  If a person actually comes up with a solution 
to the problem, why would the government not allow them to 
expedite that solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other businesses have no such restriction.  A good friend of 
mine is a car dealer who has a lot of inventory.  I asked him one 
day how he managed to keep so much inventory.  He said that it 
was a good business decision.  He said that when his lot is full 
of new cars, people come by and say that he is really successful 
because of all the new cars he expected to sell.  They pop in and 
buy a new car.  His volume goes up simply because of his business 
decision.  There is no government rule that says he cannot do 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another car dealer nearby who has a very small 
inventory.  He claims he has lower costs because he does not 
maintain a big inventory.  Therefore people can go to him and get 
a lower price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is competitive.  Both of them are doing fine.  They do not 
need a government agency to tell them how to run their 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time that the federal government butts out of most of 
its very restrictive rules and regulations and gives farmers the 
freedom to market the products they produce in the way they 
choose.  After all, one could properly ask who owns the product? 
Who is making the payments on the land?  Who is paying for the 
fuel and paying all the taxes on it?  Who is buying and repairing 
the machinery?  Who is getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning to 
work on the land?  Who works all day until sundown?  Who is 
taking all the financial risks?  It is the farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do?  It says the last thing it wants 
is a successful farmer in Canada.  That is really the message it 
is giving.  I cannot understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence what I am saying is that the bill is totally 
misdirected.  The government should be focusing much more on 
getting its act together with respect to marketing and 
international agreements.  It should do what it should have been 
doing for the last seven years, and frankly it was the same for 
the Conservatives before.  The government should have been 
working on making sure the world market had a level playing 
field, something the government totally failed to do.  That is 
what it should be concentrating on.  That is what we should be 
discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead what we are discussing is changing the name of the Farm 
Credit Corporation so that it can in the name of government 
confiscate all the property in the country that belongs to 
farmers, meanwhile making it impossible for farmers to make a 
living because they cannot sell their product for what it costs 
to produce it.  How shameful.  I think the government is totally 
misdirected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to ask a question.  I think members 
of the House should ask this question, as should anyone who 
happens to be watching on television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I doubt there are very many farmers watching 
CPAC right now.  This is not the time of year to be sitting in 
the house.  In Saskatchewan and Alberta right now it is 3.30 in 
the afternoon.  Farmers are out there working.  They are not 
watching television, but I hope the word gets to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions that they should be asking are:  Why should they be 
supporting a government which uses the very agencies that should 
be helping them and why should they be supporting a government 
which makes it virtually impossible for them to succeed?  The 
government's policies do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example just came to mind.  I talked to a farmer in 
Saskatchewan.  My roots are there and I know a lot of people, 
although I represent a riding in Alberta.  I speak to a lot of 
farmers there as well.  This farmer in Saskatchewan said that 
what he did best was raise durum wheat, that his soil was best 
suited for that.  He said he could not make a living with that 
and had to diversify.  He has.  He now does other things.  He has 
entered into contracts with international companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This individual is a successful farmer.  I think it is totally 
ironic that to be successful he had to divest himself totally 
of wheat board crops so that he has the freedom to make a living. 
Is that not ironic?  The government should smarten up.  That is 
my final answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 26 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-6, an act to amend the International Boundary Waters 
Treaty Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in spite of the comments from some of my colleagues in the 
Conservative Party, I intend to speak to this issue as long as I 
am entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The hon. member is 
allowed 20 minutes with 10 minutes for questions and answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it seems that information needs to be 
shared with other members of the House.  When I watched some of 
the early debate on this bill, I was taken a bit by surprise in 
that the debate by the government was led off by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, followed by the Minister of the Environment.  I 
was taken aback because in my review of the proposed bill the 
debate should have been led off by the Minister for International 
Trade, because the bill is not about the preservation of our 
water system in Canada and the protection of the export of our 
freshwater resources but just the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is supposed to be about protecting the ecosystem that our 
freshwater feeds into.  It should be about protecting our 
freshwater from the travails we will have with it as climate 
warming moves ahead.  It certainly should be about having 
available to all Canadians a safe freshwater system.  That is not 
what it is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back in history for a minute or two and draw 
to the attention of the House the resolution that was passed on 
February 9, 1999.  That was a resolution introduced to the House 
by the NDP member for Winnipeg—Transcona.  It was a motion that 
received support from all members of the House, including members 
of the Liberal government, and ultimately it passed unanimously. 
I will read the motion to the House.  It read as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in 
co-operation with the provinces, place an immediate moratorium on 
the export of bulk freshwater shipments and interbasin transfers 
and should introduce legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater 
exports and interbasin transfers and should not be a party to any 
international agreement that compels us to export freshwater 
against our will in order to assert Canada's sovereign right to 
protect, preserve and conserve our freshwater resources for 
future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That resolution passed unanimously.  I would like to make an 
additional note about that motion because an important part of 
it was an amendment which included the phrase I have already 
read: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and should not be a party to any international agreement that 
compels us to export freshwater against our will— 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That motion recognized, first of all, the need to pass 
legislation that would ensure bulk water could not be exported 
from any source in Canada.  Second, it specifically and 
explicitly recognized that water needed to be exempted from any 
future trade deals because there is of course a serious issue 
under the existing trade deals as to whether we have that 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that no one spoke against the motion. 
No one voted against it, as I already indicated.  It passed 
unanimously.  No one stood up and said he or she believed we were 
wrong and that we should export water.  No one said that.  No one 
said our freshwater supply should be included in the next trade 
deal.  None of that was said at that time.  Everyone was 
unanimously of the opinion that we needed to take action on the 
issue.  I think it was obvious to every member of the House at 
that time that action would be forthcoming from the government 
and that our freshwater would be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are a little over two years later.  What is the 
situation we are confronted with today?  We are debating a bill 
that any objective observer would say does not realistically 
address the issue of exporting bulk water.  It just does not do 
it.  In fact, it opens the door to the export of water by 
providing for the licensing in certain circumstances, the 
licensing that would eventually lead to the export of bulk water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also faced two years down the road, under the FTAA, with 
another trade deal.  Of course we still have not seen the text of 
the deal.  We do not really know what it contains and the 
government has been less than clear as to what its position is on 
the trade deal.  We do know that the government has refused to 
make an absolute or unequivocal commitment that the FTAA will 
prohibit the export of bulk water.  It has been adamant about 
refusing to make that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it interesting last week when the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs was speaking on the bill.  I would like to quote him.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians recognize that water is a natural resource unlike 
any other. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that from other members of the government.  It 
makes sense and we all agree with that.  I think all Canadians 
agree with that.  The problem I have when I look at the bill is 
that the government is in fact not committed to that principle. 
It in fact does not recognize that water is a natural resource 
unto itself, unlike any other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his remarks, the Minister of Foreign Affairs went on to say 
this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians look to all levels of government to take action now to 
protect Canada's water.  We must ensure that our children and 
grandchildren inherit a Canada in which our freshwater resources 
are secure. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I ask:  does he really understand what he is saying?  Why 
will the government not give us that commitment, which was 
certainly contained in the motion passed over two years ago that 
was brought forward by my colleague from the NDP?  It did not at 
that time place an immediate moratorium on the export of bulk 
freshwater and the legislation that has now been introduced in 
the form of Bill C-6 does not in fact prohibit bulk freshwater 
exports.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me draw the House's attention to proposed section 11 of the 
bill on licensing.  To be fair, there is a separate provision 
which talks about prohibiting the export of water, never using 
the term of course.  The government knows that if it uses that 
term it may invoke the trade deals.  Again that is something it 
will not admit in public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part of proposed section 11 states “except in 
accordance with a licence”.  A licence in fact would permit 
this.  The proposed section continues, and this is the important 
part “no person shall use obstruct or divert boundary waters”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reverse that says, and I guess I am wearing my lawyer's hat 
for a minute, that the Minister of Foreign Affairs who is 
responsible for this, and that it is interesting too that it is 
not the Minister of the Environment, could issue a licence that 
would allow “for the use, either temporarily or permanently” of 
boundary waters.  It is permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history up to this point of this legislation and the treaty 
it flows into with the United States, is that nobody has done 
this.  Canada and the United States have not done it.  What we 
hear is the implicit understanding that we will not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the more recent history in the last decade with the free 
trade agreement, NAFTA and now the proposed FTAA, it is obvious 
that we are very concerned that the water would be treated as a 
commodity and would be exposed under chapter 11 of the NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that if we pass the bill, 
it becomes law and is incorporated into the treaty then all 
problems would be solved.  Anybody reading the proposed section 11 
would say that that is not what the bill does.  It does just the 
opposite.  It allows some subsequent minister of foreign affairs 
to licence the export of bulk water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point about the bill is that it is primarily designed 
to deal with the water in the Great Lakes Basin and the St. 
Lawrence.  It deals with boundary waters across the whole of the 
country.  What it clearly does not do though is prohibit the 
export of water.  It does not deal with the proposal we heard 
floated from the province of Newfoundland and the export of bulk 
freshwater from Gisborne Lake.  That proposal has not been dealt 
with at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fall back as we so often do and say that that is the 
provincial responsibility.  That is not good enough for 
Canadians.  If we have what is called a Monroe government, which 
is prepared to expose the rest of Canada to chapter 11 under 
NAFTA by going along with the bulk export water scheme, we as a 
Canadian government have to tell it that it cannot do that, that 
water is a natural resource which is also a national resource. We 
have a responsibility to protect all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Gisborne Lake or some other type of hare-brained scheme like 
that was to go ahead, there would be no protection for the export 
of bulk water any place in Canada, none whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of legal opinions in the country that accept 
the proposition I just made as the reality under the NAFTA.  If 
Gisborne Lake or some other scheme like that goes ahead, water 
becomes a commodity in the whole of the country.  We then lose 
our ability to protect that freshwater resource.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs in his address to the House last 
week made this comment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To pretend that one government can solve the issue with a wave of 
a legislative wand, or that the issue may be simply reduced to 
one aspect, such as `water export', in the words of some critics, 
is unrealistic, ineffective and undermines the goal we have. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the government's attitude.  Obviously what it is trying 
to do is pass the buck and say that it is not its fault, that it 
is what the provinces did or did not do and that it did nothing 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reality is that two years ago the government should have 
implemented a moratorium on the export of bulk water.  It should 
have introduced meaningful legislation to the House that would 
have prohibited absolutely and unequivocally the bulk export of 
freshwater right across the country.  It would have made a clear 
and unequivocal commitment that the FTAA would not include any 
provision that would expose our water to a claim under that 
treaty, if we ever did do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have taken a leadership role but it did 
not.  It needed to follow both the wording and the spirit of the 
motion that was passed two years ago in the House.  What did we 
hear from the Minister of Foreign Affairs?  He said that kind of 
export ban would undermine the goals we had.  One has to question 
what the government goals are with regard to freshwater and the 
bulk export of it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to note in the minister's closing comments 
last week on Bill C-6 when he said that the bill was “consistent 
with Canada's international trade obligations”.  That is so 
meaningful.  Like just about everything else the government does, 
it is driven by those obligations, not driven by what is in the 
best interests of the country or its citizens but by these trade 
deals that the government has entered into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have made more sense to have had the Minister for 
International Trade front this bill because that is really what 
it is about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment when he spoke to the bill made 
this comment “the safest and most effective way of protecting 
Canada's water resources is through an environmental approach, 
through an approach based on trade”.  I agree with that 
statement.  That is the way the government should be conducting 
its business but it is not in fact the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still do not have the commitment that the FTAA will not 
compel us to bulk export.  If water is not on the table under the 
FTAA, then we should be given a commitment.  The government is 
not prepared to give a commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment went on to quote from the 
international joint commission's final report on the issue of 
water in the Great Lakes Basin, specifically and more generally 
in transboundary water, which said “that international trade law 
does not prevent Canada and the United States from taking 
measures to protect their water resources”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment is conceding that we in fact 
cannot pass legislation that protects our water resources.  Again 
the question is obvious.  Why do we not do that?  Simple 
legislation is required to ban the export of bulk fresh water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to finish off by talking about the legal position 
we are in vis-à-vis the trade deals.  I will quote from a legal 
opinion that was commissioned by the Council of Canadians in 1999 
referring to the trade conflicts involving export controls on 
water.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The opinion stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the potential for such conflicts should not delay action by the

noted, delay in doing so is likely to further limit Canada's 
options. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was two years ago and we still do not have it.

research and development programs that were not covered under

far enough.  It does not deal with it adequately.  It allows for 
licensing and does not deal with the export of water elsewhere in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position on this legislation will be to oppose it and to 
continue to press the government for more realistic and adequate 
legislation that will protect the interests of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
while I appreciate very much the intent and objectives expressed 
by the member for Windsor—St. Clair, I do not share his view as 
to the sinister motivation of the Government of Canada with 
respect to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware of the council of environmental ministers 
agreement in November 1999 when they agreed to honour the need to 
prohibit bulk water removal?  If he is aware of that agreement, 
how would he propose that we build on that particular agreement 
to make absolutely certain that bulk water removal will never 
take place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am aware of that 
conference and the agreement.  Before I fully answer the 
question, let me make this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem with that agreement is that it is an 
understanding between three sovereign governments, but it does 
not control the conduct of some company that might come in say 
that since we have treated it as a commodity they will challenge 
that sovereign government.  It does not prohibit that company 
from taking that action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the question and the resolution of the issue is 
for a ban to be passed in Canada and in the United States, and I 
suppose in Mexico as well, so we have national legislation. We 
need an amendment to the NAFTA agreement, and in the FTAA if we 
ever go ahead with it, that specifically exempts water from those 
types of challenges.  It would recognize that it is not a 
commodity, that it is a fundamental right of those individual 
countries and cannot be challenged in any way by any private 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps I was not 
sufficiently clear in posing my question and I will rephrase it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1999 the council of environmental ministers of 
Canada met, concluded and agreed, that is my understanding at 
least, on the need to prohibit bulk water removal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understood the hon. 
member for Davenport.  My answer remains the same.  We need 
legislation.  We need specific provisions in the treaties to 
prohibit the export of water and prevent challenges under chapter 
11.  I do not know if I can be more explicit than that.  That is 
the manner that I see for dealing with it and it is consistent 
with legal opinions we have heard on the topic.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I fully endorse the comments of the NDP member. However 
in 1993 we thought that NAFTA was one of the greenest agreements 
that could be negotiated and one on which we could agree 
regarding trade. Now, the fact is that there have been many legal 
challenges under chapter 11 on relations between companies and 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking in particular of the legal challenges issued by 
companies, which I will not name, when they wanted to get a 
permit from a province such as British Columbia. This is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore would it not be fair and appropriate to include in 
the future agreement on the free trade area of the Americas 
which, if I am not mistaken, is scheduled to be signed in April 
2005, provisions that cannot be legally challenged, to ensure 
that water is not defined as a good but rather as a resource 
and an investment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians should we not immediately show leadership 
in the negotiations to ensure that water is not a good, but a 
resource to be protected? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not disagree in any 
way with my friend from the Bloc.  The point he has made is well 
taken.  We must not only prohibit companies from doing that.  We 
must define what water is.  It is not a commodity; it is a 
natural resource.  We should move it to a higher level where it 
is a basic human right, and we should define it that way in the 
treaties.  In all respects, no matter how broadly we looked at 
it, that would prevent water from ever being treated as a 
commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brings to mind the Sun Belt challenge we are facing in 
British Columbia.  If water is classed as a basic human right no 
corporation in the world would even think of mounting such a 
challenge.  My friend from the Bloc is correct.  The wording must 
be strong and clear so that we never again face such a challenge.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was interested in 
the member's comment about stopping corporations from suing.  I 
am quite surprised.  I know the hon. member across the floor was 
a barrister in his previous career.  I also practised law for 18 
years before entering the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It perplexes me that the member is now proposing that we bring 
in legislation to forever prevent corporations or governments 
from suing. 
As the member knows, legislation and lawsuits are based on 
interpretations of legislation every day.  How do we prevent a 
corporation from issuing a $75 or a $125 statement of claim and 
suing?  We can never prevent that.  There are frivolous and 
vexatious lawsuits.  As the hon. member knows, lawsuits are 
undertaken for many reasons and not necessarily because they are 
right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the hon. member's expertise as a barrister in this 
area, can he tell the House how we or any government can prevent 
a corporation, individual or country from pursuing a claim 
against a government or individual?  I would be happy to hear how 
he addresses the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the list is fairly long 
and the answer must be short.  The easiest answer, as I said in 
my response to the member from the Bloc, is that we make the 
wording of the legislation and the treaty so clear that they 
would not even think of starting a lawsuit.  That is the first 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other ways.  The introduction of a cost 
disincentive is one method we have used traditionally in the 
court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important is who gets to make the decisions.  The 
decisions must not be made by faceless, non-elected, 
non-responsible panel members.  The composition of the panel 
would make a big difference as to whether such litigation 
attempts are made. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise on this very important subject.  The 
aspect of the debate that peaks my interest is how fast the water 
issue has changed.  For hundreds of years we have taken our water 
supply for granted.  We have always just turned on the tap and 
had good, clean, clear water, although lately we are finding some 
of our water to be contaminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard of Walkerton and the issues there.  In my own 
riding there are two or three areas where, for the first time, 
water is contaminated and no longer drinkable.  We are becoming 
greatly inconvenienced and facing real problems because of 
contaminated water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little community called Nappan in my area has water that is 
totally contaminated, perhaps by certain practices in the farming 
community.  This will happen more and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The water issue is important and deserves far more attention 
than the government is giving it.  As my colleague from St. 
John's West said in the last few minutes, we need to stop 
pussyfooting around and enact legislation with teeth.  He is 
absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is kind of interesting.  It broaches the 
subject and starts to deal with it but does not go nearly far 
enough.  In a very few years water will become the most priceless 
asset and important resource a country can have.  We should be 
addressing the issue now that we know what is happening.  We need 
legislation far stronger than the bill before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is somewhat similar to Bill C-156 that the 
Conservative government tabled in 1988.  However that was a 
different time and the bill was a prelude to other legislation. 
This legislation is final and we have an opportunity to do much 
more than we are doing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government takes our comments seriously.  We want 
better legislation that is more comprehensive and has teeth.  We 
want the government to take a stand on all freshwater in Canada 
and not just border water supplies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member  for St. John's West recently raised the issue 
of the proposed exportation of Newfoundland water.  He was told 
in the House of Commons by the minister that there was nothing to 
worry about because the government would deal with it in Bill 
C-6.  Here is Bill C-6, and it does not even come close to 
addressing that important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last speaker mentioned rogue governments, which was rather 
interesting.  I think he was referring to the Liberal government 
of Newfoundland which is proposing to export water. 
We have no protection against that.  The government has no way to 
stop it, control it or deal with it.  This could be the bill to 
do so but it is not.  It deals only with boundary water systems 
and allows for the export of even those waters.  It is not at all 
appropriate or what we need. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is sending mixed messages about its position on 
water exports, which is confusing.  It says one thing in question 
period, another thing in the media and another thing 
provincially.  Now it has this bill which dances around the issue 
but does not really address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is talking about setting up a committee next fall 
to study issues, such as the selling and exporting of freshwater. 
Why is that not part of the bill?  Why are we not dealing with it 
now?  Why are we passing a half-baked bill with no teeth, as the 
hon. member for St. John's West has said, that pussyfoots around 
the issue but does not really deal with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will not even come close to dealing with the 
Newfoundland issue.  After the Prime Minister's negotiations with 
the American president he suddenly changed his position.  At one 
point he was adamant about water exports and then he shifted 
ground.  He is now sending a message that we will change our 
position, and that is scary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is sending another mixed message regarding the 
NDP's call for a moratorium on water exports.  Everyone supported 
the motion, including all the Liberals.  Where is the motion now 
in the bill?  It is not there.  It is completely invisible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then again, maybe we should be used to that because the 
government seems to always say one thing and do another.  Need I 
mention the promises to cancel the GST, change the free trade 
deal and bring in an ethics commissioner answerable to 
parliament?  Those things have never happened and no commitment on 
freshwater is being honoured here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party has been very clear on this.  We support the total 
prohibition of the selling of bulk freshwater.  That is very 
clearly the way to go for the future, to guarantee protection for 
our water supply which we see changing very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to a program on CBC Prince Edward Island the other 
day about how the province must revamp its agricultural 
processes.  It must cut back on agricultural production and 
completely change the way it does business because of the 
poisoning of rivers and lakes.  Obviously the agriculture 
industry does not want to be part of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prince Edward Island has a serious problem.  We also have 
problems in Ontario and Nova Scotia.   Newfoundland is talking 
about selling water.  This is going on and on.  There is no 
excuse for not dealing with the issue now but we still do not 
know the real position of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the prohibition we would like to see, the amendments 
in the bill allow for a licensing regime for boundary projects 
such as dams and obstructions.  Here we are talking about a 
licensing regime for exceptions.  We are talking about passing a 
bill but are already including exceptions that would contravene 
the rules, go around the system and ruin whatever strength and 
teeth the bill has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the countries in the world we are the most vulnerable, 
although we have the biggest supply of freshwater.  We have 300 
lakes and rivers that share boundaries with the United States. 
Dividing them up in the future will be extremely controversial, 
yet the bill does not deal with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, Canada has 40% of the freshwater in the 
world and we should be protecting it.  Eventually it will be the 
most priceless commodity and valuable asset any country can have. 
At present, one billion people do not have access to safe water. 
We have it now and should do everything we can to protect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as 1984 the Progressive Conservative Party was 
concerned about the issue of exporting water.  We formed a 
committee to study the issue and ensure the right steps were 
taken. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT87"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT87"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1815

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately when the Liberal government came to power it 
dropped all interest in preserving freshwater.  It made deals, 
such as the free trade agreement which, prior to being in power, 
it opposed vehemently.  It was entirely against the free trade 
agreement and then all of a sudden switched positions, became in 
favour of it and supported the enhancement of the delivery of 
water, which is what we are talking about here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the late eighties and early nineties, the Progressive 
Conservative Party repeated that Canada's water was not for sale 
and that it would not be affected under the free trade agreement. 
Now we hear talk about loosening it up, being a little more 
flexible, bringing it to committee and finding out what is 
appropriate and what is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that there should be no sale of bulk water.  We do 
not need to bring it to committee to discuss it.  The sale of 
bulk water is prohibited and it should stay that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I bring up the changing environment with which we are all 
dealing.  We have all taken freshwater for granted for years and 
years and all of a sudden it is no longer applicable.  We cannot 
take our water for granted anymore.  We have to take steps to 
protect it or we will no longer have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our world population is expected to grow to eight billion people 
by the year 2025.  By then it is estimated that half of the 
world's population will not have access to clean water.  I hope 
that the changes we make in parliament will not mean that Canada 
will be part of the population that does not have access to clean 
water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One statistic recently estimated that water consumption would 
increase by 40% and that 17% more water would be needed to grow 
food for our growing population.  Water could become our most 
valuable asset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 21 of the bill details areas that the governor in 
council, basically cabinet, could regulate.  This is scary 
because cabinet, this cabinet or the next one, could change 
regulations without bringing them to parliament or to the public 
for discussion or debate.  Regulations affecting our water could 
be changed with no consultation with parliament.  No regulations 
referring to exports of water should be made without full 
consultation with parliament, and the opportunity to debate it 
and hear from the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the legislation opens up the freshwater debate in a way 
that would allow everyone in Canada to speak. If Canadians are 
given that opportunity, the vast majority would say that we 
should not export our water.  A few people who want to make big 
profits and take advantage of an opportunity would say that we 
should export water but I believe the vast majority of Canadians 
would oppose any move to make our water available to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government eventually states its position on the sale 
of Canada's freshwater and that it clarifies it in all respects. 
I hope the Liberal position supports the Progressive Conservative 
position that Canada's freshwater is simply not for sale.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Cumberland—Colchester for his 
intervention.  I want to make sure that I understood him 
correctly.  Could we take it as a firm commitment on the part of 
the member and his party that they are opposed to any form of 
bulk water exports, including a proposed export by the province 
of Newfoundland that may occur one day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is as 
concerned and interested in this subject as are we.  We are 
totally and absolutely against the export of bulk water from 
Newfoundland.  Our Newfoundland members support that position, as 
does our entire party.  We are against the export of bulk water 
from Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, although this bill is relatively clear but rather broad 
in scope, we are once again going to look at the issue of 
exporting water while the Minister for International Trade is 
here in the House. He has of course played a very active role at 
the summit of the Americas. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether the hon. member thinks that the 
Minister for International Trade should do everything in his 
power to ensure that water is not considered a commodity, 
something that is negotiable and can, to a certain degree be 
exported, thus depleting our natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Minister for International Trade here in the House, I 
ask the Progressive Conservative member to tell us his position 
with respect to the upcoming negotiations which, in December 
2005, will result in an FTAA agreement which, to a certain 
degree, is very desirable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to be unclear 
at all.  I am very clear that we are against bulk exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen the whole subject of freshwater change dramatically. 
In Atlantic Canada we are considered a pristine part of the 
world.  We have a lot of freshwater resources, but even there we 
have places where our freshwater is now at risk and our water is 
contaminated.  Over the last 12 months, for the first time in 
history, I have had three areas of my riding which have reported 
back with contaminated water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take steps now to address the issue because it will 
get worse.  I mentioned earlier that I listened to a long program 
on CBC Prince Edward Island the other day.  Agriculture in Prince 
Edward Island would have to change its practices and cut food 
production dramatically because the result of the increased food 
production would be contaminated water and less water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very serious issue.  We cannot take any chances.  In 
many of these trade agreements, if we start to deliver a resource 
and it becomes a commodity we are locked into that delivery.  If 
in the future our resources decline we cannot cut back on those 
exports and we cannot cut back on supplying foreign countries 
this product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we establish a pattern we have to maintain it.  We cannot 
get into this subject at all, especially on P.E.I., where the 
water has been contaminated and the farmers there are cutting 
back.  They are required to do so.  I wanted to point that out to 
the member from Prince Edward Island who is making interventions 
and trying to help me make my point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
could make the same argument that we would make in the province 
of Newfoundland when we talk about bulk exports.  We have many 
requirements for the funding of health and education.  Where do 
our new dollars come from?  They would come from the development 
of our resources including the proper development of our water 
supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seemed to be on our side when it responded to 
questions I asked earlier.  The Prime Minister then came back 
after his chat with the president of the United States and was 
very wishy-washy about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot afford to export bulk anything unless we maximize 
every job possible in that resource.  Does the member not believe 
that it is time that we salt down a deal to stop the export of 
freshwater in the legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my riding has the highest 
tides in the world and the Prime Minister's position was similar 
to the tides.  It came in and then it went out.  The tide came in 
when he was establishing his own position.  He was totally 
against the export of water.  Then when he had a little visit 
with the president of the United States, the tide went out.  He 
changed his position and said maybe we could negotiate this, 
maybe we could bring it to committee and talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we should have legislation with teeth in it. We 
should not pussyfoot around, to use the hon. member's own terms. 
We should be very clear on our position and not have an ambiguous 
proposal for legislation such as we have here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have another question of the member for Cumberland—Colchester.  In 
November 1999 the Canadian council of environmental ministers 
agreed on the need to introduce a ban on the export of bulk 
water.  Given that commitment, does the hon. member think that a 
voluntary commitment by the provinces on banning bulk water 
exports would work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in answer to the member's 
question, I do not think it is enough because governments change 
too fast.  We are about to see some provincial governments 
change and hopefully the federal government as well.  However I 
think in the very bear future we will see provincial governments 
change.  There is no guarantee or assurance that a commitment by 
a government today will be honoured by the next government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Or even by the same one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Or even by the same one because we have 
seen local governments change position on subjects right away. 
No, that is not enough.  It has to be embedded in ironclad 
legislation by the federal Government of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to rise to 
speak on the act to amend the International Boundary Waters 
Treaty Act, Bill C-6.  I welcome this opportunity because it 
gives me a chance to also address some of the concerns that have 
been raised and also perhaps address some myths that have been 
raised in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very strong consensus in Canada that governments 
should act to ensure Canada's waters are protected from bulk 
water removal.  Therefore, the issue before us then is not 
whether to protect the water but how best to accomplish that 
common goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of 1999 Canada announced a three part approach to 
prohibit the bulk removal of water out of all major Canadian 
drainage basins.  The environmental approach would protect and 
regulate water in its natural state in the water basins and was 
comprehensive, environmentally sound, respectful of 
constitutional responsibilities and consistent with Canada's 
international trade obligations.  Bill C-6 embodies all aspects 
of this approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people and groups advocated that the federal government 
should take unilateral action by bringing in an export ban on 
water.  I would respectfully submit that such a trade based 
approach is wrong.  It is unrealistic especially in a 
federal-provincial context.  It would be ineffective, but worse 
it would actually undermine the goal we all share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will outline why Canada has pursued an environmental approach 
and why that approach is better than an export ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The International Joint Commission also known as IJC delivered a 
landmark report in February 2000 entitled “The Protection of the 
Waters of the Great Lakes”.  I will reflect briefly on the IJC's 
conclusions and recommendations.  They are consistent with and 
supportive of the broad environmental approach adopted by Canada 
on the issue of bulk water removal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IJC concluded that water was a non-renewable resource.  The 
vast volume of the Great Lakes was deceiving.  Less than 1% of 
the water was renewed every year through the hydrological cycle. 
The other 99% was a gift of the glacial age.  Furthermore, unlike 
a forest that could be replanted, taking water out of the water 
basin was like mining.  When it was gone, it would never return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The IJC report stated “If all the interest in the Great Lakes 
Basin were considered, there was never a surplus of water. Every 
drop of water had several potential uses”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty million Canadians and Americans depend on the waters of 
the Great Lakes for every aspect of their lives: day to day 
living, industry, recreation, transportation and trade.  On top 
of this, the ecosystem of the Great Lakes has its own equally 
important demands on the water.  As we are dependent on the 
future health of the Great Lakes, the future health of the 
ecosystem is dependent on our action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see, Mr. Speaker, you are telling me that time is up.  Perhaps 
when we continue the debate, I will be allowed to continue at 
that time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Absolutely, and I am 
sorry to interrupt the hon. member.  She will have 17 minutes 
left in her speech when debate resumes on Bill C-6. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10.00 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
