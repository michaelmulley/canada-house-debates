<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now prepared to rule on the 
question of privilege raised on Thursday, November 19, 1998 by 
the hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale concerning the 
publication of a draft report of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade on Canada's foreign 
policy regarding nuclear weapons. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to thank the hon. member for his succinct 
and emphatic presentation as well as the hon. members for Fraser 
Valley, Beauharnois—Salaberry, Richmond—Arthabaska, 
Scarborough—Rouge River and Crowfoot for their valuable 
contributions on this question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale and several other 
members explained that this is, by no means, the first time a 
case of this nature has been raised on the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, a case virtually identical to this one was before us 
this time last year, to be precise, on December 9, 1997.  I noted 
at page 2945 of <I>Debates</I> that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No potential breach of in camera proceedings can be taken up 
without a specific allegation of misconduct directed against 
particular individuals... a complaint concerning premature 
publication of a committee report is incomplete without reference 
to a specific source responsible for the disclosure of the 
report. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present case resembles both last year's case as well as a 
number of other recent cases where committee reports or draft 
reports have been leaked before the committees had presented 
their findings to the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speakers' rulings are consistent in these cases.  For example, 
Speaker Jerome on June 23, 1977 dealt with the premature 
publication of a subcommittee document where the question of 
privilege cited a press source for a leak but did not attempt to 
identify the source of the leak itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker declined to find the matter of privilege prima facie 
because the complaint did not deal with the responsibility of the 
House and its members with respect to premature disclosure.  At 
page 1209 of <I>Journals</I> Speaker Jerome stated:  “Since it 
misses that point, it misses something I think most important 
with respect to the privileges of the House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case before us today, I must therefore rule, as I have 
consistently done in the past, that the matter raised by the hon. 
member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale does not constitute a prima 
facie matter of privilege.  However, that does not mean that the 
matter is not a serious one or that no action should be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House once again of a caution I 
issued in dealing with another case of this type on October 9, 
1997, at page 689 of <I>Debates</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of committees and ministers working with committees have 
an obligation to ensure that they themselves and those whose 
expertise they seek, be they personal assistants or departmental 
officials, respect the confidentiality of their documents and the 
integrity of their deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees must address their work processes and be very clear 
about how they expect draft reports and other material relating 
to in camera meetings to be treated.  Everyone present at such 
meetings, including officials from departments and agencies, must 
realize their obligation to respect the confidentiality of the 
proceedings they witness and the material they may therefore be 
privy to.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the present case, it certainly remains open to 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
to pursue the question of how their draft report has been dealt 
with.  Concerning the broader issue raised by the hon. member for 
Toronto Centre—Rosedale, it may be that the House or those whom 
the House has mandaterd to oversee the practices and procedures 
of this place will decide that it is time to examine this 
question in its entirety. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale and all of 
the other interveners for raising the matter which I know both 
the Chair and the House itself view as one of great seriousness. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I wish to thank you for 
that ruling, which I respect.  I wonder if it would be more 
efficient and practical if we took it upon ourselves in the House 
this morning to refer this issue to the procedure and 
House affairs committee so that it may review it and take action 
on the issue since it really is not going to go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The House can do whatever it wants to do, 
but it is not the purview of the Speaker at this point to send 
this matter to the procedure and House affairs committee.  I am 
always in the hands of the House in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to move that 
we refer the issue of the privacy and confidentiality of 
committee reports to the procedure and House affairs committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have permission to put 
the motion to the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys,

stack of petitions, probably in the tens of thousands, from 
people from Kamloops and other parts of British Columbia 
concerned about the unfair treatment of people who carry out acts 
of cruelty against animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a long list of court cases where it has become clear 
that individuals have been very cruel to animals and have not 
received virtually any sentence at all, a little tap on the 
wrist.  They feel this is unfair.  They point out that the 
government consider directing judges to take this issue more 
seriously and to consider increasing the penalties for those who 
carry out acts of cruelty against animals.

British Columbia.  They point out that any future trade agreement 
into which Canada may enter ought to include provisions to ensure 
actions against child labour and to include environmental 
standards and labour standards generally.

petitions signed by several hundred residents of the riding of

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first one, the petitioners call upon the government to 
put the surplus accumulated in the employment insurance account 
back into the pockets of the unemployed by revoking the current 
eligibility rules for new entrants and using surpluses for 
training for the unemployed, thereby promoting direct 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, current employment insurance eligibility rules 
should be revoked so that more unemployed people can have access

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK29">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 16 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-48, an act respecting marine conservation areas, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
debate on Bill C-48, an act respecting marine conservation areas, 
started at second reading, the Reform Party tabled an amendment 
calling for the withdrawal of that bill in its present form. 
That amendment was rejected by the majority in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But make no mistake about the meaning of that rejection. Indeed, 
during the debate on the amendment, a number of members of this 
House clearly condemned, among other things, the serious flaws 
of this bill and the phoney consultation process that took 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we rejected the amendment does not mean that we 
are prepared to support the bill since, on the face of it, it is 
just as unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see what this bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-48 is to provide a legal framework for the 
establishment and eventual development of 28 marine conservation 
areas, including eight in Quebec, representing each of the 
ecosystems identified to date in Quebec and Canada. 
The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is the 29th marine 
conservation area. However, this park is not included in this 
bill because it is covered by ad hoc legislation both in Canada 
and in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the preamble to the act, the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
states the reasons that led to the establishment of these marine 
conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants, first, to protect natural, self-regulating 
marine ecosystems for the maintenance of biological diversity; 
second, to establish a representative system of marine 
conservation areas; third, to ensure that Canada contributes to 
international efforts for the establishment of a world-wide 
network of representative marine areas; fourth, to provide 
opportunities for the people of Canada and of the world to 
appreciate Canada's natural and cultural marine heritage; and, 
fifth, to provide opportunities within marine conservation areas 
for the ecologically sustainable use of marine resources for the 
lasting benefit of coastal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, in order to enforce this legislation when it has 
obtained royal assent, the federal government would have to 
acquire the lands belonging to Quebec or to the other provinces 
affected by this plan to establish marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph (2) of clause 5 of the bill provides that the minister 
may create a marine conservation area “only if the Governor in 
Council is satisfied that clear title to the lands to be 
included in the marine conservation area is vested in Her 
Majesty in right of Canada, excluding any such lands situated 
within the exclusive economic zone of Canada”.  On the very face 
of it, this bill does not respect the integrity of Quebec's 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Government of Canada think for one moment that the 
Government of Quebec will hand over ownership of the ocean floor 
of marine conservation areas that it is thinking of developing 
within the territory of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Government of Canada be unaware, or pretend to be 
unaware, of paragraph (5) of section 92 of the Constitution Act, 
1867, which recognizes clearly that the management and sale of 
public lands is an area of exclusively provincial jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes the Government of Canada so ignorant, or so arrogant, 
that it fails to recognize that Quebec legislation on crown 
lands, passed by the Quebec National Assembly, applies to all 
crown lands in Quebec, including beds of waterways and lakes and 
the bed of the St. Lawrence River, estuary and gulf, which 
belong to Quebec by sovereign right?

</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the Government of Canada be so ignorant as to not know 
that under Quebec legislation the province cannot cede its land 
to the federal government?  It knows full well that, within this 
legal framework, all the Government of Quebec can do is issue an 
order permitting the federal government to use Quebec crown 
lands, including the marine floor, only when the federal 
government restricts its action to its own areas of 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the notes provided us by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage with regard to Bill C-48, marine conservation areas are 
planned for the St. Lawrence, the St. Lawrence estuary and the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence. These are three areas in which the marine 
floor is under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Government of Canada trying again with a bill to 
invade Quebec jurisdiction?  Why is this government, which 
should be acting for the good of the population, refusing yet 
again to follow the legislative process that worked so well in 
the establishment and management of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
park? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this government refusing to again use the bilateral 
agreement process that worked so well in  the case of the St. 
Lawrence? 
Why not sign an agreement like the St. Lawrence action plan, 
phase III, which was signed by all federal and provincial 
departments concerned, and which provides for an investment of 
$250 million, over a period of five years, in various activities 
relating to the St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Department of Canadian Heritage acting with such 
arrogance this time, by claiming to own the marine floor where 
it wants to create marine conservation areas, instead of 
resorting to bilateral agreements with the Quebec government and 
thus avoiding having Canada once again trample Quebec's areas of 
jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to follow the example of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
Marine Park Act and by making ownership of the territory an 
essential condition for the creation of  marine conservation 
areas, the federal government is behaving, as Robert Bourassa 
used to say, like a centralizing government that wants control 
over everything, regardless of recognized jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If ridicule killed, the government would be six feet under by 
now.  Members will want to listen carefully to this. Not 
satisfied with invading the jurisdiction of a neighbouring 
government—Quebec—with Bill C-48, the federal government is 
invading its own jurisdiction and creating overlaps within its 
own administration.  Let us look at how ridiculous that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Department of Canadian Heritage, the government 
plans to create marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, it has already 
created marine protected areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the Department of the Environment, it wants to create 
marine wildlife reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that a single site could find itself 
protected under more than one category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the federal government, which claims to have met all 
of Quebec's demands, and which states in its Speech from the 
Throne that it is putting an end to overlap and to interference 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction, has now found a way to 
divide itself into three components and to actually overlap 
itself, so as to be absolutely certain to meddle, in one way or 
another, in areas that come under the jurisdiction of Quebec and 
the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After looking at how Heritage Canada went about consulting on 
its draft bill and at the results of that consultation, the Bloc 
Quebecois concluded that the exercise was a miserable failure 
and that it was really too bad that, with all the resources at 
the minister's disposal, she did not see fit to conduct real 
consultations, which would have made all the flaws in the bill 
apparent to her.  Despite this disastrous failure, Heritage 
Canada boasts that it has public support for the bill.  What a 
sorry farce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If ecosystems are to be protected effectively, the Government of 
Canada must have the co-operation of coastal communities.  The 
Bloc Quebecois urges the government to find workable solutions 
to the economic woes of coastal communities, if it hopes one day 
to reach an agreement with them on protecting the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its partnership initiative with the Government of Quebec should 
have served as a model to the federal government for the 
creation of other marine conservation areas. Rather than 
demonstrating open-mindedness and co-operation, the federal 
government is still taking an arrogant, aggressive, invasive 
approach that overlaps other jurisdictions and that is hardly 
calculated to encourage us to work with them another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the Bloc Quebecois is against the bill, mainly for 
the following reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of relying on dialogue, as in the case of the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, the federal government wants 
to create marine conservation areas irrespective of Quebec's 
jurisdiction with regard to the protection of its territory and 
environment.

Environment Canada's protected marine areas.

throwing a wrench in the works, sometimes in the form of 
baseball bats or pepper spray. This government prefers to stir 
up trouble, ill feelings and even discontent in the population.

I am confident that the people will let them know that 
unequivocally on November 30.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to respond to statements made by some of my distinguished 
colleagues to the effect that Bill C-48 infringes on provincial 
jurisdiction, in Quebec and the other provinces, over the 
seabed. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to marine areas surrounding Quebec, there is one 
area where the seabed clearly falls under provincial 
jurisdiction and that is the St. Lawrence estuary. A special 
agreement and matching legislation have been developed for the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, which encompasses this area. I 
dare say this was a fine example of co-operation, both within 
this House and between our respective governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the other marine areas surrounding Quebec, jurisdiction over 
the seabed is either clearly federal or disputed by the two 
levels of government, that is the Canadian government and the 
Province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-48, we are proposing the establishment of marine 
conservation areas where the federal government has jurisdiction 
over the seabed, based on current possession or a 
federal-provincial agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jurisdiction over the seabed in a specific area may be disputed. 
But that is a different mater entirely. The purpose of this bill 
is not to resolve such disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no intention of acting unilaterally in an area under 
dispute. This must be clearly understood. Saying otherwise would 
be misleading the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ideally, any dispute concerning jurisdiction over the seabed 
should be resolved before a marine conservation area is 
established. 
We would have consultations to find a mutually acceptable 
solution. In some cases, it is possible that the marine region 
may be represented by another area where jurisdiction over the 
marine floor is not at issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, contrary to what was repeatedly claimed in this House by 
Bloc Quebecois members, we have absolutely no intention of 
acting unilaterally in a region where the marine floor is at 
issue. Let us be clear on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already using the model proposed in the bill. Following 
the federal-provincial memorandum of understanding signed in 
March 1997 with the Government of Ontario, we are now jointly 
looking at the possibility of establishing a marine conservation 
area in the western part of Lake Superior. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also working with the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador on a feasibility study for a marine conservation area 
in the Bonavista and Notre Dame Bay areas. 
That study was initiated following the signing of a 
federal-provincial memorandum of understanding, in February 1997. 
Moreover, the MOU on the Pacific marine heritage legacy signed 
with British Columbia in 1995 provides that the two levels of 
government must undertake a joint feasibility study for a marine 
conservation area in the southern part of the Strait of Georgia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following these studies, if the governments come to the 
conclusion that a marine conservation area can be established, 
the next step will be the negotiation of an agreement between 
the Canadian government and the province concerned. Such an 
agreement would include the terms and conditions under which the 
marine conservation area would be established, including 
provisions on the transfer to the Canadian government of all 
submerged provincial lands, if necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Such federal-provincial agreements are already in place for the 
creation of marine conservation areas in Fathom Five, Georgian 
Bay, Ontario and in Gwaii Haanas, Queen Charlotte Islands, 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows that a good number of provinces are collaborating in 
a concept of marine conservation areas that is compatible with 
the provisions in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The model underlying Bill C-48, that is ownership of the land by 
the Government of Canada, is clearly necessary when the 
Government of Canada already owns the land. 
That is the intent of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our experience with the agreements and feasibility studies on 
marine conservation areas already described shows that the model 
proposed in this bill is entirely reasonable and pertinent, 
whether those holding the contrary view like it or not.

motion that has been put forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We are debating the contents of Bill 
C-48.  The motion is for the previous question, which means that

will be immediately put and no further amendments are permitted.

was somewhat confused earlier but I am no longer, essentially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate having an opportunity to speak to Bill C-48, an act 
respecting marine conservation areas.  I want to say at the 
outset that the legislation establishes and manages a system of 
national marine conservation areas known as NMCAs which are 
representative of the 29 marine areas of Canada.  The 29 national 
marine conservation areas represent a unique biological and a 
unique set of oceanographic features. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These areas include fresh and salt waters.  The Parks Canada 
systems approach has identified the 29 NMCAs within Canada's 
Great Lakes, internal waters which are tidal and the territorial 
sea as an exclusive economic zone limit, which is the 200 mile 
limit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate through second reading stage has revealed many 
deficiencies in the legislation as presently proposed.  We in the 
New Democratic Party agree there are problems with the bill.  As 
parliamentarians it is our duty to correct errors as we see them 
and to act on behalf of Canadians to improve legislation.  It is 
in that spirit that I will make a number of comments.  We want to 
enhance the bill.  We are not opposing it.  We certainly approve 
it in principle with a great deal of enthusiasm.  It is in that 
context that I make my comments this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fitting year to begin the protection of Canada's 29 
representative marine areas since 1998 is the year of the oceans. 
As Canadians we know there are problems with our oceans which 
include such things as the impact of pollution in a variety of 
forms, the reality of overfishing, disappearing fish stocks and 
general fishing mismanagement.  We have witnessed the devastation 
of coastal communities on both the east and west coasts.  There 
are problems on the north coast and problems in the inland water 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with some regret that evidence suggests the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans has largely mismanaged this resource, which 
is indeed unfortunate.  I am not enough aware of the situation to 
comment on how this mismanagement occurred, but based on the 
report of the standing committee on fisheries it is well 
documented that mismanagement has led to some very serious 
problems on all our coasts including the waters within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know there are problems with our Great Lakes as well as 
with other inland waters in terms of pollution and mismanagement. 
This is reflected in the recent revelations of the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans in its freshwater fisheries 
report in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 is a step forward in securing coastal and inland 
waters for future generations and in ensuring they are in a 
relatively pristine state for future generations.  We agree that 
while there are deficiencies in the legislation—and I will point 
out some of them in a moment—this step toward marine area 
conservation is too important to dismiss simply for partisan 
purposes or rhetoric, as I am afraid to say we have heard in the 
previous debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 should be considered as an important step toward the 
next century.  Our country's present day grievous mistakes and 
mismanagement are recognized.  We can learn from them and, more 
important as the legislation may reflect, we can act upon them. 
As parliamentarians we must act on behalf of all citizens of the 
country to ensure this enabling legislation provides the best 
options for future generations and for Canadian communities in 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to support Bill C-48 in principle.  However I 
will make the following points which we would like to see 
addressed in the ongoing debate, in particular in committee, in 
terms of securing our support for the process throughout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation efforts so far must be explored in depth during 
the committee hearings.  These included 3,000 mail-outs and 
approximately 300 responses which were received by Parks Canada. 
Upon perusing these responses one recognizes there are serious 
concerns on the cost recovery aspects of the legislation.  There 
is a compelling need for a better definition of proposed cost 
recovery measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that access to national marine conservation areas 
for local communities and fishers must be maintained.  This is a 
crucial element.  We must recognize that consideration of and 
effective measures for ecotourism opportunities must be included 
in the final legislation.  It is fair to say that ecotourism is 
one of the leading edges of the tourism sector in Canada.  We 
feel strongly about recognizing the attractiveness of the 
national marine conservation areas for people interested in 
ecotourism.  We look forward to seeing that appropriate access 
included in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Better descriptions and delineation of core areas of the NMCAs 
regarding preservation, protection and regulation are important 
as is the need for a two year reporting period rather than the 
five years proposed. 
We are moving into a new area and reviewing this on a two-year 
basis makes more sense.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also feel strongly that first nations rights and a better 
explanation and delineation of “reserves” must include full 
participation of all first nations people.  This could perhaps 
follow the consultation and management design procedures used 
with respect to the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park.  We hold 
it as a good template for future consultations involving these 
kinds of initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of a joint provincial-federal management and 
jurisdiction group will require co-operative measures between 
parties and governments to ensure provincial land and resource 
rights are not compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect on proposed NMCAs in the Nunavut lands ought to be 
considered with seriousness.  We need to address the question of 
the use of NMCAs to include a reference to conservation methods 
and ecological principles.  Both are fundamental in terms of our 
support and I suspect they are reflected in the general thrust of 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commercial fishers must be fully involved in the designation and 
parks management design to ensure there is a working 
relationship.  On both our coasts this is obviously an issue of 
great sensitivity, but it is something we feel can be easily 
managed and incorporated into either the legislation or 
subsequent rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of river systems on the NMCAs will require adequate 
resources for marine sciences and ecosystem modelling.  There is 
also provincial co-operation and the degree that crown lands and 
subsurface rights may or not impact the success of the program. 
We want to be sensitive about that particular interface. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by my colleagues, the no-take zones must be clearly 
defined and allow for adaptation in future years. This must be 
written into enabling legislation which would be acceptable for 
future needs.  Mr. Speaker, I know you yourself feel strongly 
about the no-take zones issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional concerns were also mentioned in the various responses. 
In particular west coast concerns will require different 
considerations and much flexibility as compared to the east coast 
concerns.  We understand and I know my friend the secretary of 
state appreciates the differences between the east coast concerns 
and west coast concerns and the obvious differences between the 
two coasts when it comes to the central fisheries issues as well 
the conservation areas issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coastal co-ordination between the different departments 
involved must be defined.  A clear, and I emphasize clear, 
definition between Environment Canada's responsibilities for 
wildlife and ecosystems adjacent to the NMCAs, Parks Canada's 
authority to question and if necessary to veto Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans decisions in management of these areas 
resources and a clear delineation of the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans responsibilities are all requirements we ought to 
consider before the legislation returns to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may sound a little negative about the DFO.  Based on its 
past record on sensitivity in its involvement, it has not 
necessarily always been in a productive and positive way.  This 
explains some of the nuances and points that I am making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this has to be prolonged.  We support the 
legislation.  We certainly support the principle 
enthusiastically.  We hope that with the consideration of some of 
the points I raised in my presentation that we can see the rapid 
and expeditious movement of the legislation through the House as 
well as through the other place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Ottawa—Vanier did not seem to understand the 
opposition expressed by the member for Rimouski—Mitis with regard 
to Bill C-48. I will just say to him that we have good reason to 
get cold feet, and it is not even a play on words when we are 
talking about the St. Lawrence and the Atlantic because the 
water there has always been and will continue to be cold. The 
federal government has forced us to become more and more 
distrustful in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just consider the fact that three different departments are 
involved in marine areas. In this bill, the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage talks about marine conservation areas. 
We also have marine protected areas that fall under the 
jurisdiction of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and 
marine reserves that fall under the jurisdiction of the 
Department of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine areas, marine protected areas and marine reserves, which 
come under three different federal departments. They all have 
lofty goals, but it all depends on the attitude and the intent. 
The member for Ottawa—Vanier said a few moments ago that the 
Liberals brought forward this legislation to give the federal 
government some authority over marine areas, but they do not 
intend to intervene as they did in Mirabel and Forillon Park, 
for example. We know where that lead to in some cases in Quebec 
and elsewhere, particularly in the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government interferes in a particular area, it 
does so forcefully as if it were the superior government in 
Canada, whereas in the initial spirit of Confederation, the 
federal government was supposed to harmonize its policies with 
those of the provinces. At that time, it was not seen as a 
superior government that gave orders to other governments, but 
rather as a government that wanted to work with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier with the member for Chicoutimi about how we 
recently witnessed a good example of partnership.  Two levels of 
government worked together toward the same goal, namely the 
conservation and protection of marine wildlife and of the 
shores, since one has to go by land to get to a marine area. 
That partnership led to the creation of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mistrust on this side is based on the federal government's 
past behaviour. Give them a foot, they will take a yard. That is 
part of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Ottawa—Vanier said earlier “We will usually 
focus on land owned by the federal government or squarely under 
federal jurisdiction”. It would be hard to prevent it from doing 
so. However, jurisdiction over several areas is being disputed, 
mostly by the federal government, but also by provinces that 
wish to protect their territory from invasion. Section 92 of the 
Constitution clearly stipulates that the bottom of the river and 
other waterways are a provincial area of jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All the governments in Quebec, whether they were led by 
federalists or sovereignists, took the same position and said 
“We will not let our jurisdiction be infringed upon 
unchallenged”. Although, in this case, the goal is laudable, and 
we do support conservation, too often the federal government has 
taken this kind of opportunity to infringe upon provincial areas 
of jurisdiction, especially those of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What good is a statement of good intentions from a member who is 
not yet a minister, who represents a minister at some committee, 
and tells the House that they have no intention of doing that. 
Really. It is so easy for the government to make such statements 
and then try to pull a fast one on us. 
In Quebec we are very sceptical about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government should start its consultations all over 
again. I was not a member of the committee. The member for 
Rimouski—Mitis is more familiar with this issue since she is the 
Bloc critic in this area. She told us about the kind of 
consultations that took place. When only 5% of those invited to 
the consultation show up, when only 60 out of the 300 pages in 
the report are handed out, one has to wonder. From what we could 
see, there were very few witnesses from Quebec. There are very 
few submissions in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is premature, improvised or badly put together. It 
leaves too much room for interpretation and legal challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in this bill tells us the federal government is going to 
abide by the good intentions mentioned by the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier. This is simply not enough for us, in the House. 
Words are quick and vain, we will need to get that in writing. 
Laws remain and we know they are followed by regulations that 
clarify them. This is often how we can be had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At second reading stage, I too would like to say that we oppose 
the bill. We believe it is one more federal threat against 
Quebec. It is aimed at encroaching on Quebec's territory. As 
Quebeckers, we cannot allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a great pleasure to speak to this bill, especially since, 
as the Bloc Quebecois transport critic, this subject is of 
particular concern to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know—members of Parliament and viewers alike—that 
shipping and environmental protection are closely linked if not 
intertwined.  Immense container ships are now being built in 
Korea that can carry some 5,000 or 5,500 containers, I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two major container ports in Canada.  The port of 
Montreal and the port of Halifax. 
Halifax is number two.  It is not too happy about this, but the 
strategic position of the port of Montreal has made it, over the 
years, the hub of container transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will understand what I am getting at regarding this 
bill.  From the time the Bloc Quebecois arrived here in 1993 
with 54 members—there were nine founding members—we have supported 
mandatory pilotage in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, of course, talking about pilotage on the St. Lawrence and 
the Great Lakes, but also across Canada, because there are 
mandatory pilotage zones in the Pacific region and in other 
regions of the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Not because we wanted to be outrageous or for the pleasure 
of it, but we were wondering whether Canada could afford a 
second Exxon Valdez, given what had happened in Alaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With today's constraints in shipping, vessels are ever bigger 
and their cargo is ever more dangerous. 
If these foreign and Canadian vessels cannot be guided in by 
experienced pilots, the risks to the environment are 
considerable.  The shipping lobby in Canada is very powerful, 
financially speaking, because the major shipping companies 
contribute to the campaign funds of the Liberal and Progressive 
Conservative parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> So do the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Yes. My colleague just said that the banks 
do so, too. Ten minutes is not enough for me to get into that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The list is too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> That is absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B> You should move along; you only have 10 
minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> The government whip just reminded me that I 
have only 10 minutes and that I should move along. Of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Bloc Quebecois want to reiterate that, 
although we are against the bill—we have our reasons, and our 
colleague, the member for Rimouski—Mitis, expressed our party's 
position clearly—we want no misunderstanding, no misleading 
statements—we know that our neighbours opposite make such claims 
regularly—to the effect that the Bloc Quebecois is against 
protection of the environment.  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois reaffirms its position.  It is a clear one. 
We are in favour of measures to protect the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then are we against this bill?  We feel that the bill is not 
based on dialogue, as was the case with the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park.  My colleague, the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, pointed out quite rightly that there 
had been dialogue in that case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to digress briefly to say a few words about this 
dialogue. I am pleased to see that, in spite of the Canadian 
heritage minister's intransigent attitude and proverbial 
arrogance, it is the government led by Lucien Bouchard and the 
Parti Québécois that signed the documents establishing the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Thank you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> And it will be re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Yes, it will be re-elected on November 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows how, with a Quebec government that can hold its own 
against and is taken seriously by the rest of Canada, mutually 
satisfactory agreements can be reached. That is not 
confrontation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind you of what Jean Charest was saying in the early 
days of his campaign, when he was making very harsh remarks 
about the Prime Minister of Canada, the hon. member for 
Saint-Maurice; those were the words of a man who does not want to 
come to an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PQ government is willing to sit down and negotiate those 
agreements that benefit the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of relying on dialogue, as it did with the marine park, 
the federal government is trying to establish marine 
conservation areas in spite of Quebec's jurisdiction over its 
territory and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, let me come back to this. As much as it pains me, this is 
the style of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and member for 
Hamilton East; it is her pattern, her approach. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT13"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT13"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1105

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a person who should be acting like a lady, but uses 
abusive language instead and hurls insults left and right in 
this place. That is unfortunate. How can we have a dialogue and 
reach any agreement with a person who does not want to? It takes 
two to tango, as we say. It is hard to tango when your partner 
will not even step onto the dance floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is promoting confrontation instead of dialogue, as 
evidenced by Bill C-48. This is the pattern; nothing has 
changed, this is how it always is with this heritage minister. 
Therefore, we have no choice but to oppose this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill is 
because Heritage Canada is proposing to establish a new 
structure, marine conservation areas, which will duplicate 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada's marine protected areas and 
Environment Canada's marine protection zones. Simply put, the 
federal government is using three departments to infringe upon 
areas under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear from members of other parties who represent 
Quebec. The Bloc Quebecois has 45 members here, but there are 
another 30 or so from other parties who also represent Quebec. I 
would like to hear what the four remaining Conservative members 
from Quebec think of this bill, which infringes upon Quebec's 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Heritage Canada is clearly acting arrogantly by 
claiming ownership of the sea floor where it would like to 
establish marine conservation areas. 
We suggested that Quebec and Ottawa reach bilateral agreements 
to allow, among other things, Quebec to keep its jurisdictions. 
Why will the federal government not sit at the table and talk? 
It is possible to reach an agreement. The Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park is a model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government prefers to trample on Quebec's 
jurisdictions. The Bloc Quebecois will never support a bill that 
does not respect Quebec's jurisdictions. This is the reason why 
Quebeckers elected 54 Bloc Quebecois members in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days 
before the June 2, 1997 election, the current Quebec Liberal 
Party leader and former leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party had promised, with a hand on his heart, to get 40 
Conservative members elected in Quebec. He will have a hard time 
getting 40 Liberal MNAs elected on November 30. 
It is for these reasons that I am convinced Quebeckers will 
re-elect a PQ government on November 30.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to have an opportunity to participate in the 
debate and deal with some of the issues the Bloc has raised, 
particularly the critic who made the original intervention, the 
member for Rimouski—Mitis, who has worked hard with our 
department on a number of issues to try to enhance our protection 
of special places in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed to hear the Bloc's opposition to this 
bill. The previous speaker from the Bloc tried to suggest to 
Canadians and Canadians in Quebec that it is not opposing an 
environmental bill, legislation that will help protect our marine 
ecosystems. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People should be absolutely clear that they are opposing just 
that type of legislation, they are opposing the protection of the 
marine environments in that part of the country.  Why are they 
opposing it?  They are opposing it because they put up a 
situation that does not reflect the reality of what this bill 
would do or reflect the reality of the conditions as they exist 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Rimouski—Mitis said, there are eight 
potential marine conservation areas around the province of 
Quebec. I believe six of those areas are exclusively federal 
jurisdiction and the province of Quebec accepts that. There is no 
issue about infringing on provincial rights or provincial 
prerogatives.  Those are accepted by all parties, by the province 
and federal government, as being exclusively federal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When parks are established in that area, even though they are 
federal, as has been our practice in the past, we will consult 
with our host communities and the host province, but they are 
clearly federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are situations where the jurisdiction could be provincial 
and I think we should look at the record when that situation 
existed.  When we went to Ontario to establish Fathom Five, a 
marine conservation area, the first one in Canada, we worked with 
the provincial government and came to agreement with the 
provincial government.  We are working today in British Columbia 
in Gwaii Haanas.  Again we work with the province and have come 
to an agreement with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working in terms of some feasibility studies, one in my 
hon. colleague's riding of Gander—Grand Falls.  It is the same 
thing when we are working in the straits in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we worked in an area of the province of Quebec where there 
was clearly provincial jurisdiction, as we have with the other 
provinces, we developed a model to work in that area.  That model 
was reflected with the Sagenauy-St. Lawrence bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestions by the Bloc that this legislation is somehow a 
massive intrusion on provincial authority is just not consistent 
with the facts.  Not only is it not consistent with the facts, if 
one looks at the practices that have been carried out by Parks 
Canada one will find that is not consistent with what is actually 
taking place.  They are creating a controversy, a reason to 
oppose, and that reason is not based on the reality of the 
situation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very disappointing to see in the House that they are 
taking a piece of legislation which will help protect the 
environment, the special places of the marine ecosystems around 
that province, as they are around the rest of the country, and 
for parochial reasons that have absolutely no basis in fact they 
are going to throw away or oppose this very important piece of 
environmental legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really disconcerting to see them do that.  It is 
disconcerting to see them fighting a provincial election on the 
floor of this House and to find excuses for opposing an important 
piece of legislation.  They know full well this legislation does 
not infringe on provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know full well it has been our practice in the past to work 
with the provincial governments in establishing marine 
conservation areas.  The hon. member from Vanier made it very 
clear that was going to continue to be the policy of Parks Canada 
and of heritage Canada.  They are simply creating opposition 
based on something that is not a fact, that is not true.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that all Canadians understand that.  It is 
particularly important for those Canadians who live in the 
province of Quebec to understand clearly that Bloc members in the 
House are opposing a piece of legislation which will help protect 
the environment of that area of the country.  They are opposed to 
it for reasons that are simply not as they state.  This is not an 
infringement on provincial jurisdiction.  I thought that point 
needed to be made. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I generally say that I am pleased to speak on a 
bill, but today I must say the emotion I am experiencing in 
taking part in this debate is anger.  I hope that the hon. 
members across the way will open their ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who has just spoken claims we enjoy land 
squabbles, any old squabble.  He was unable to prove legally 
that what the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis says is untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give him two more good reasons for understanding common 
sense. I will try to avoid references to the provincial 
election, since I know that gives members opposite hives. 
The hon. member will, however, have a clear understanding, from 
the reasons I am going to give him, of why Quebeckers are going 
to choose a Parti Quebecois government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason, and this is indecent, is that they come here 
boasting of wanting to establish marine conservation areas via 
Heritage Canada.  We have been living through a fisheries 
crisis, one that is still going on.  Do members think the 
Liberal Party of Canada could be re-elected if it were to traipse 
around Newfoundland or Nova Scotia telling people “Well, 
gentlemen, we are going to protect your marine areas”.  But who 
is taking care of the fishers who have lost their livelihood? 
Who is taking care of the plant workers who have lost 
everything?  Who? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolute shame.  If I were a Liberal, I would be 
ashamed to show my face again in the maritimes on the weekends. 
I would be concerned for my safety. 
I can understand wanting to protect everything from the marine 
floor up. But in between there are no fishers, no plant workers. 
All this to protect one species or take tourists on a boat ride. 
This is all very well, but what tourists will see on their 
arrival on the coast will be hungry people with nothing to eat, 
people who will have lost the dignity work brings. This is 
unconscionable. What members opposite are saying is downright 
asinine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, when the government comes up with something intelligent 
I try to co-operate. We did it in the past. One of the most 
recent legislation we passed regarding fisheries and oceans was 
the Canada Oceans Act. One of the main thrusts of the bill was 
to put an end to the confusion in the management of fisheries; 
the fisheries minister was ordered to assume the lead role in 
managing all ecosystems. 
This bill, which has been enacted, ordered the ministers to talk 
to each other. However Fisheries and Oceans was still to be the 
lead department for everything concerning our waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not 
understand how the Liberal Party, the current government, can 
contradict itself by allowing the heritage minister to create 
more marine conservation areas. I remind the House of the 
existence of three different names. With have the Department of 
Canadian Heritage's marine conservation areas; the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans' marine protected areas, and Environment 
Canada's protected offshore areas. All of them talk about 
conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will easily understand why fishers and plant workers are so 
desperate since every single time the government attempts to 
protect or manage something, the results are disastrous. 
A case in point is the collapse of the groundfish fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government. If it is really serious about preserving 
marine resources, the heritage minister should keep her hands 
off it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO's biologists failed in their attempt to protect our cod. 
Imagine what the heritage minister's bureaucrats will do. I am 
scared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be ashamed if I were in the Liberals' shoes this 
morning. What will the Liberals from the maritimes do? I have a 
lot of respect for my colleagues who are not afraid to speak in 
the House, but I have not seen one member from the maritimes 
rise to defend this bill. I am telling them they should get out 
through the back door. It is ridiculous. There is no excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will they do when they go back home? Christmas is fast 
approaching. There are just two weeks left before we adjourn. 
Those people will go back home and say “Well, gentlemen, we 
protected your ecosystem and, thanks to us, everything will be 
fine”. But what will they answer when someone stops them on the 
street and says “Could I have a Christmas present like everybody 
else? Will I have something to eat this Christmas”? It is a 
shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 40,000 people who benefited from TAGS. The government 
abandoned 20,000 of them, and it gave a cash payment to the 
other 20,000 and told them to go home and shut up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the Liberals are saying that they want to 
protect marine resources, but nobody is protecting these 
workers, nobody is protecting our fishers. It is really a shame. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say some words in English because I have some 
friends in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.  I would like to address some 
comments to those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be sure that fishermen will call their members 
in their areas today and the next day to be sure that those 
members remember that nobody protects fishermen and plant workers 
now.  They have to make those calls.  It is incredible.  We 
cannot let the minister do this in the fisheries areas. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things never change. This is an unprecedented attack against 
provincial areas of jurisdiction. Despite what the parliamentary 
secretary may say, there is a conflict. When we want to solve 
problems, we need dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I liked what my colleague, the hon. member from 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, said 
earlier, namely that you have to be two to tango and that he had 
the feeling that he was dancing alone. I have the feeling that 
the heritage minister wants to tango, but she is stepping on our 
toes. This is much worse than someone who does not want to dance 
with a partner. She might do better sitting this one out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should the government have done? We saw the squabbling that 
went on last summer. 
If the minister really wanted to protect the resource, why did 
she not insist in cabinet that the government, through the 
fisheries minister, decide once and for all how the resource 
will be shared among the provinces? Because there were squabbles 
all summer long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that Canada is part of an international 
management system called NAFO. Under that system, once 
scientific data are received, since the method for calculating 
total allowable catches is already known, every country 
transmits its biological data and, in the end, quotas are 
established, because they are pre-established as a percentage, 
taking into account the history of each member country and 
proximity to the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such discussions would get things going between Canadians and 
Quebeckers and we would stop squabbling. Instead of doing that, 
the government introduces a bill that will turn everything 
upside down. 
No one here in this House is defending workers at this time, and 
this is unacceptable. I may have an opportunity to repeat again, 
because I do not recall what stage the bill is at right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Oh good, it will be coming back.

Islands and says “We will probably establish a conservation area 
in this region”. I truly hope that everyone on the islands is 
asleep on that day, otherwise I could not guarantee the 
minister's personal safety. After the whole industry has 
collapsed, it is unacceptable for the government to tell people 
that it intends to protect fish and that they have no say on the 
issue. This is utter nonsense. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise to speak at second reading of Bill C-48, an act respecting 
marine conservation areas, and the amendment proposed by the 
Reform Party.  We will not support the bill, and I will explain 
why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, instead of relying on dialogue, as in the case of the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, the federal government wants 
to create marine conservation areas, regardless of the fact that 
Quebec has jurisdiction over the protection of its territory and 
over environmental matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Department of Canadian Heritage is proposing the 
establishment of a new structure, the marine conservation areas, 
that will duplicate the marine protected areas of the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans, and Environment Canada's protected 
marine areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the federal government, which claims to have met all 
of Quebec's demands, and which states in its Speech from the 
Throne that it is putting an end to overlap and to interference 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction, has now found a way to 
divide itself into three components and to actually overlap 
itself, so as to be absolutely certain to meddle, in one way or 
another, in areas that come under the jurisdiction of Quebec and 
the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the conditions essential to the establishment of a marine 
conservation area is federal ownership of the land where the 
conservation area will be established. Bill C-48 fails to respect 
the integrity of the territory of Quebec and the other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another example of interference and duplication.  As my 
colleague from Berthier—Montcalm was saying, the situation is 
especially complex in Canada, and even more so when bodies of 
water are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you a story. A fisherman wants to go fishing on the 
St. Lawrence River. So far, so good. This fisherman has to ask 
the provincial government for a fishing licence. He will go 
fishing in a rowboat he bought in Quebec, on which of course he 
paid federal and provincial taxes. In order to launch his 
rowboat, he needs a federal registration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before launching his rowboat, he gets ready on the shore of the 
river. He is on a territory under Quebec jurisdiction since the 
shores come under provincial jurisdiction. However, the moment 
he launches his rowboat, he changes jurisdiction since his 
rowboat is now on water, which comes under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for clarity, I must say that the bottom of the river is 
still under provincial jurisdiction. The fish that swims in the 
water and that the fisherman will try to catch is under federal 
jurisdiction. 
But its friend, the crab, which is crawling on the bottom of the 
river, is under shared jurisdiction, even though the bottom of 
the river is still under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fish swimming in the water comes under federal jurisdiction. 
But, once it is caught and lying at the bottom of the rowboat, 
it comes under provincial jurisdiction. Due attention will then 
have to be paid to regulations, because there are federal quotas 
for that kind of fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, if this is commercial fishing, there are federal and 
provincial laws and regulations with regard to food, the 
environment, public health, equipment and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if things were not complicated enough, Bill C-48 creates 
overlap within the federal administration itself. This makes no 
sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three federal departments will drag their standards into an area 
of provincial jurisdiction, creating overlap in an already 
thoroughly complicated situation.  It borders on the absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Heritage Canada, the federal government intends to 
create marine conservation areas.  Through the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans, the federal government has already created 
marine protection zones.  Through Environment Canada, the 
federal government wants to create marine wildlife preserves. 
How can anyone make sense of this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part—there is more—Fisheries and Oceans is proposing to 
set up marine protected areas.  Following DFO's consultation 
meetings on marine protection zones in Quebec in June 1998, 
federal officials wrote the following in their minutes of these 
meetings: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still a great deal of confusion among stakeholders 
regarding the various federal programs on protected marine areas 
(marine protection zones, national marine conservation areas, 
wildlife marine preserves, etc.). The departments concerned 
should harmonize their actions and co-operate to create protected 
marine areas. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the Bloc Quebecois talking; these were the comments 
of federal officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, Environment Canada is proposing to establish marine 
conservation zones, that could also be called natural marine 
reserves, expanding the notion of the national wildlife 
sanctuary beyond the territorial sea to the 200-mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such overlap and duplication is ridiculous.  Who will know what 
belongs to whom?  But we know what this government wants.  It 
wants to get its hands on the St. Lawrence River.  This is how 
it hopes to invade our jurisdiction.  This is how it thinks it 
will bend us to its will, but we are not having any of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet an agreement could have been reached, as it was in the case 
of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park.  This initiative could 
have served as a model. 
In 1997, the governments of Quebec and Canada agreed to pass 
mirror legislation to create the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park. This resulted in the creation of Canada's first marine 
conservation area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This first partnership initiative should have served as a model 
to the federal government for the creation of other marine 
conservation areas. Rather than demonstrating open-mindedness and 
co-operation, the federal government is still taking an arrogant, 
aggressive, invasive approach that creates overlap and will only 
feed our desire to leave as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phase III of the St. Lawrence action plan could have served as 
another model. But the Government of Canada is not happy when 
everything is running smoothly. 
They prefer to stir up trouble and sow discord. They do not 
understand that Quebeckers have had it with their arrogant 
policies that cost a fortune, and the people will let them know 
unequivocally in a very short time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is an intrusion into the jurisdictions of Quebec and 
those of the other provinces, when they are concerned. Quebec 
cannot and will not work in this kind of system. We were very 
open with the federal government in dealing with the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park. It is unfortunate that the government has 
not learned its lesson.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have to 
take part in this debate. We have to, because enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will add that, fortunately, the Bloc Quebecois is here to see 
what is going on and to point out loud and clear that federalism 
as it is practiced here has nothing to do with what we learn, in 
political science books, about this type of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federalism as we see it here is becoming a continuous struggle 
between two levels of government, two departmental levels, while 
the federal government is using the surpluses that were taken so 
cruelly from the unemployed and from those who have suffered as 
a result of cuts in health care, in education and in welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes a great deal of arrogance, ignorance or insensitivity, 
or maybe all of these, to introduce such a bill at a time like 
this. My colleague, the member for Drummond, pointed out the 
federal government's inconsistency—it could almost be funny if 
the situation were not so sad—in wanting at all costs to have 
the final say on the environment. As if the government of Quebec 
and the other provincial governments could not take care of this 
adequately or were not reasonable enough to agree on a joint 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes completely against the spirit of federalism, but the 
federal government is convinced that it is the only one that can 
adequately defend or protect, with the taxpayers' money, health 
care or any other right of Canadians, Quebeckers and people in 
the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, these repeated attacks make so little sense that, when 
we talk about them, it looks like we are exaggerating. It looks 
like what we are saying does not make sense. It is, however, the 
plain and simple truth. That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we have to fight. Many times, I condemned the fact that 
Bill C-54, now before us, constitutes such an intrusion in areas 
under provincial jurisdiction that all the provincial and 
territorial ministers of justice of all provinces have asked 
that it be withdrawn. 
But the federal government seems to be carrying on as if this 
were unimportant.  They could not care less about the law of the 
land. They thumb their noses at constitutional interpretation. 
They just make laws or use their spending powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of concern to us here, the Bloc Quebecois has once 
again tried to get the bill withdrawn.  We find ourselves faced 
with a bill that looks innocuous, with its title of “an act 
respecting marine conservation areas”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its objective seems most praiseworthy: to ensure—and this was a 
promise, an international commitment, by the Prime Minister—the 
protection of natural, self-regulating marine ecosystems for the 
maintenance of biological diversity.  The problem is that the 
Prime Minister did not turn to the provinces to ask them how 
they could help to achieve this international commitment.  No, 
that is not what was done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They proposed a bill in which they say “We will look after this. 
We will pass a law.  We will establish marine conservation 
areas, and in order to ensure that they fit in with what we want 
to do, Her Majesty in right of Canada must have clear title to 
the lands in question”. This is what appears in clause 5(2). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clear title to the lands in question means three specific areas, 
three large and significant areas, as far as the St. Lawrence is 
concerned.  The present Government of Quebec, which it seems 
will also be the next one as well—and this will come as no 
surprise to anyone who has read this morning's papers—had already 
initiated consultations on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is outrageous, after having made an international commitment, 
to turn around and say “Now I am choosing the locations where I 
am going to create areas, and if I am going to invest in this, I 
have to have ownership”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something stands in the way, however.  The National Assembly 
passed legislation on crown lands which applies, and I quote, 
“to all crown lands in Quebec, including beds of waterways and 
lakes and the bed of the St. Lawrence river, estuary and gulf, 
which belong to Quebec by sovereign right”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fortunate that the Quebec National Assembly has passed 
this legislation.  It provides that Quebec cannot transfer its 
lands to the federal government. The only thing it can do under 
this legislation is to authorize, by order, the federal 
government to use them only in connection with matters under 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the protection of habitats and fauna is a matter of 
joint federal and provincial jurisdiction. 
The Government of Quebec plans to establish a framework for the 
protection of marine areas in the near future, as the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis reminded us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The identified areas are under Quebec's jurisdiction and Quebec 
has no intention of giving them away because, as the Bloc 
Quebecois critic for fisheries pointed out, the fishing industry 
is in dire straits. The only prospect villagers who are 
starving, young people who see no future and seniors who have 
difficulty making ends meet have is that bureaucrats will come 
swarming into this area to handle fish conservation, without 
co-operation and without preparation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heritage Canada and its minister may want to follow up on the 
Prime Minister's commitment, but they cannot do so without 
taking Quebec and Quebeckers into consideration. 
The only way to meet this international commitment, whose 
objectives the Bloc supports, is to do what was done when the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park was established, in other 
words, to have similar legislation passed simultaneously at the 
federal and provincial level and dealing with a joint 
management.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander—Grand Falls, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, after listening to several speakers from the Bloc, I 
have to say a few words about the inaccurate assessment of the 
second reading of this bill given by some of the opposition 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second reading is about the principle of the bill.  What is the 
principle of this bill?  The principle is a particular type of 
conservation, marine conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I went to the Iles-de-la-Madeleine and asked fishermen what 
was the most important thing affecting their livelihood, they 
would say marine conservation.  In what area were the greatest 
errors made by the federal government over the years? It was in 
the area of marine conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I went down to the Gaspé and talked to the people there they 
would say the same thing.  If I went up to Blanc-Sablon and 
talked to the people there they would say the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I able to say that?  I was part of a committee that 
travelled in the past year and held public hearings.  We had 
group after group telling us that the greatest disaster in their 
lives was created by policies of the federal government in the 
past that destroyed their livelihood. They were very specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Drummond stood in her place a moment ago and 
made a sarcastic reference to the fact that the Prime Minister 
was concerned about the marine resources from the land right out 
to 200 miles.  Let me correct her.  The Prime Minister is 
concerned about the resources that go right out to the end of the 
continental shelf, not just 200 miles but 350 miles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell this House why.  Go to the Quebec north shore and 
ask the fishermen there what happened to their mackerel.  It is 
the greatest spawning ground in the world for mackerel, as the 
Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
and the hon. member who represents Iles-de-la-Madeleine know, 
because they are very knowledgeable in the fishery.  The greatest 
spawning ground for mackerel is the coast of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to that resource?  In the 1980s licences were 
given.  To whom?  To Norway, Sweden and some other European 
countries.  It was to block the spawning run where the mackerel 
were headed to the coast of Quebec to spawn in late May.  That 
was poor fisheries management on the part of the Tory government 
of the day.  It was the most outrageous thing that destroyed the 
spawning ground of the mackerel.  In one year there were seven 
Norwegian vessels right between Sydney Bight and 
Port-aux-Basques.  The next year there were nine and the year 
after there were eleven. Why?  It was because of poor fisheries 
management of non-conservation of our marine resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we asked the fishermen what perhaps was the second worst 
policy of the government of Canada then, they would refer, as the 
parliamentary secretary knows, to the policies of former 
governments on squid where unfortunately squid cannot get to the 
Quebec coast if blocked by foreign nations off the coast of Nova 
Scotia. 
Why? Because of poor management of our marine resource.  If we 
ask fishermen on the coast of Quebec what is the third worst 
marine conservation measure ever taken by the government of 
Canada in the past, they would say the policy on capelin.  Why? 
Because that is perhaps the most important food of salmon that go 
up the rivers in Quebec and other provinces.  It is the food of 
northern cod and turbot that the people in Quebec need as 
fishermen.

I would like to give him the opportunity to come back to the 
issue, which is marine protected areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Gander—Grand Falls is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George S. Baker:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for your wise 
judgment that marine actually means something that is in the 
water.  Of course marine management means management of something 
in the water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the other things I mentioned that were missing prior 
to the advent of this government, if we ask the fishermen of 
Quebec what the next worst thing in marine management and 
conservation that affected their lives has been in the past, the 
biggest error ever made by a former federal government, they 
would say the non-protection of the sea bed.  They would say that 
for a very good reason. We have over the years allowed the 
massive destruction of our ecosystem and allowed intensive 
dragging of the ocean floor in our commercial fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of the importance of marine conservation. 
Last year there were 123 draggers that took part in the shrimp 
fishery on the continental shelf.  There were 6 Canadian vessels 
and 117 foreign vessels.  These were 350 foot vessels with huge 
plates on either end of a drag, 10 feet long, 8 feet high, 4 feet 
thick, iron and steel that drag the bottom of the ocean and 
create a virtual vortex of sediment in the middle like a sand 
storm on the bottom of the ocean, destroying everything in its 
path.  That is why the Government of Canada, in referring to what 
the member for Drummond said, is not only interested in what 
takes place inside the 200 mile zone, but is interested in 
extending our jurisdiction.  Before the next federal election the 
government is also intent on extending jurisdiction in order to 
stop this massive destruction of the bottom of the sea floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary was there when we had our public 
meetings in the province of Quebec, all along the shore from 
Blanc-Sablon down to the Gaspé coast.  These fishermen and fish 
plant workers want to make sure the Government of Canada stops 
the destruction of the food supply of our cod, salmon and turbot.

the former Progressive Conservative government which ruled the 
fishery in those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very unfortunate that the Bloc is not in favour of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are now at 
second reading of Bill C-48, an act respecting marine 
conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill seeks to define the legal framework for the 
establishment of 28 marine conservation areas, so as to protect 
and preserve natural marine areas that are representative of the 
oceans and of the Great Lakes, to promote public knowledge, 
appreciation and enjoyment of this marine heritage, and to 
preserve it for future generations. The Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park, which is the 29th marine conservation area and 
which was officially established on June 12, is not included. 
It is not covered by the bill, because Quebec has its own 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois finds it perfectly normal and legitimate that 
Quebec would apply its own legislation to the marine world. 
After all, our province has been assuming for 15 years already 
its legislative responsibilities regarding the land along the 
Saguenay fjord and a large part of the St. Lawrence estuary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always cared a great deal about 
environmental protection measures. I know what I am talking 
about, since I was my party's critic on the environment from 
1995 to 1997. The Bloc Quebecois supported the government 
regarding the establishment of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, my party will oppose this bill. 
We cannot support Bill C-48 which, instead of relying on 
dialogue, as was the case with the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park, does just the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the federal government is trying to unilaterally 
create marine conservation areas, regardless of Quebec's 
jurisdictions, particularly over the environment. This is the 
main reason the Bloc Quebecois will not support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that this legislation is an unacceptable infringement by 
the federal government on jurisdictions that are already under 
Quebec's strong and effective control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec has a proven track record and it has 
taken measures to protect the environment, particularly the 
marine floor. So why does the federal government feel the urge 
again to interfere in an area under provincial jurisdiction? It 
is always the same old story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Minister of Canadian Heritage to explain to me 
why she does not want to use the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine 
Park Act as a model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making ownership of the territory an essential condition for 
the creation of marine conservation areas, the federal 
government is behaving like a centralizing government that wants 
control over everything, regardless of Quebec's jurisdictions. 
This is no surprise coming from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of interference is nothing new. Paradoxically, the 
federal government has often used the environment as the perfect 
example of progressive, open and decentralized federalism.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On other occasions, this same government invoked the notion of 
national interest as well as international commitments stemming 
from the globalization of environmental issues, as if Quebec 
were incapable of facing this new reality on its own. Let us be 
serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are a few flagrant examples that show this government's bad 
faith and its insatiable appetite for interfering in Quebec's 
affairs, particularly with regard to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first example is the implementation of the ecogovernment 
policy in which Ottawa totally ignored provincial powers by 
favouring a partnership with representatives from industry, 
municipalities and agriculture. It deliberately ignored Quebec's 
involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second example is the implementation of the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, which infringes in an 
unprecedented way on provincial responsibilities and creates 
considerable duplication with Quebec's legislation in this area. 
Now we have Bill C-48, an Act respecting marine conservation 
areas, and there are many other examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of duplication, this bill tops it all. It is an 
unthinkable administrative mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48, proposed by the Department of Canadian Heritage, will 
establish a new structure, the marine conservation areas, that 
will duplicate the marine protected areas of the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans, and Environment Canada's protected 
offshore areas.  That does not take into account the overlap 
with the Quebec department of the environment and wildlife. 
What a fine example of federal bureaucratic inefficiency. 
Amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the bill disregards Quebec's territorial integrity. 
We need only look at the wording of the bill. 
Clause 5(2) specifically provides that the minister may not 
establish a marine conservation area, unless he, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—is satisfied that clear title to the lands to be included in the 
marine conservation area is vested in Her Majesty in right of 
Canada, excluding any such lands situated within the exclusive 
economic area of Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is not for sale.  Subsection 92(5) of the Constitution 
Act, 1867, recognizes that the management and sale of crown land 
are matters of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec legislation on crown lands applies to all crown lands in 
Quebec, including beds of waterways and lakes and the bed of the 
St. Lawrence river, estuary and gulf, which belong to Quebec by 
sovereign right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this same legislation provides that Quebec cannot 
transfer its lands to the federal government. It can, within 
this legislation, only authorize, by order, the federal 
government to use them under its federal jurisdiction. However, 
the protection of habitats and fauna is a matter of joint 
federal and provincial jurisdiction, and the Government of 
Quebec plans to establish a framework for the protection of 
marine areas in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To top it off, Heritage Canada intends to unilaterally launch 
three projects to establish marine conservation areas in the St. 
Lawrence River, its estuary and gulf, all three being areas 
under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What justifies such arrogance on the part of this government, 
which claims it owns the marine floor where it wants, to 
establish marine conservation areas? Why does the federal 
government not promote bilateral agreements between the Ottawa 
and the Quebec government instead, so that Quebec may maintain 
its areas of jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government loves to go it alone and show the rest of Canada 
that it is the one laying down the rules of the game, ignoring 
its own laws and those of the provinces in the process. 
This is another example of how unfairly Quebec is treated in 
this federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How stupid and ironic at the same time. Not only is the federal 
government duplicating what the provinces do, it is also opening 
the door to overlap in its own court.

the federation is the right thing to do.

on a predominantly provincial jurisdiction. It will result in 
duplication, challenge and the subordination of provincial 
processes, as well as large and unnecessary expenditures and 
many court challenges. These are becoming more frequent in the 
federal system and are becoming unbearable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, probably one of the problems in the country is that 
politics get involved in what would be considered a very good 
idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports the marine protection act, although we have 
some reservations about it.  Allow me to digress for a moment, as 
my critic area is fisheries and oceans and I would like to relate 
that to this argument.  There is a bank off Nova Scotia's shelf 
called the George's Bank, which by the way and for the public 
record is not named after the member for Gander—Grand Falls.  I 
mention that because I know he is watching and listening intently 
to every word.  The Americans have put an oil and gas moratorium 
on their side of the George's Bank to the year 2012. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a prime fishing area for all the east coast.  Although 
it has not been accepted and there will be hearings and reviews 
of it, Canada is considering the possibility of allowing a 
discussion of oil and gas drilling within the George's Bank, one 
of the prime fishing areas of the world if not off the coast of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us to even consider having a review, talking to companies 
like Shell, Mobil, PetroCan or whatever is unbelievable.  We 
should not try in any way, shape or form to destroy a resource to 
exploit another resources.  By the way, the resource we are 
talking about in the fishing industry is renewable.  If it is 
done sustainably with an environmental message behind it, it can 
be renewable and bring economic wealth not only for future 
generations but for generations to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we destroy that and allow oil and gas drilling on the 
George's Bank, we will have economic wealth for our generation 
and nothing for the future, absolutely nothing for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with part of the Bloc, Liberal, Reform, Tory and 
even our debate by allowing politics to get involved is that we 
can only see in four year terms.  I am a new politician.  I know 
that politicians are a reactive bunch.  They are not very 
proactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Churchill River in northern Saskatchewan is 
Metis.  His culture and his people look a lot further than the 
current generation.  The input they have on the land and the 
impact they have on resources is for future generations, not just 
their children or grandchildren but children hundreds of years 
down the road, so that they will be able to access and live with 
the species and resources we currently have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some particular reservations about the bill.  We would 
like to see some refinements, but it is not a bad bill in terms 
of what we have done with land.  The current Prime Minister is 
very proud to say that he has produced more parks in Canada than 
any other minister before him.  Unfortunately, as in the case of 
Banff National Park, we trumpet that success and then allow coal 
mining or strip mining on the border of that park for economic 
gains right now, but nothing for the long term future of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all parliamentarians and those people who are watching 
today that we are not the masters of the globe.  We share the 
planet with many other species.  For us to exploit a particular 
species to its extinction is a detriment to all mankind.  It is a 
disgrace that we have a list a mile long of species that used to 
walk on this planet which are now extinct because of our short 
term thinking.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine parks just add to the parks in Canada.  When the 
provinces get involved, they start introducing legislation which 
may allow discussions about entering into mining or development 
inside the parks.  Call me old fashion, but my interpretation of 
a park is a park that we can share in, walk around, canoe in and 
camp in.  It is not necessarily to play golf in, to have saunas, 
or to exploit mineral resources, fishing resources or to cut down 
all the trees.  I would like to think I could move myself in 
space 500 years and come back and find the parks just like they 
were before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will not happen because we are looking at these parks and 
areas of our country and our world as avenues in which to 
exploit.  There is a piece of pie out there and we will take 
every last bit of it and not share it with anyone else. 
Unfortunately we do not have enough parks and wilderness areas 
that are protected.  The marine parks act will just move what we 
have in Canada to our ocean coasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move the discussion to an area called the Gully 
off Sable Island.  Actually there is more than one gully, but 
this gully, for those who do not know, is a marine wilderness. It 
is an absolute explosion of marine aquatic life.  We are 
allowing, I do not think with much hindsight, oil and gas 
drilling in the vicinity of that gully.  They say environmental 
assessments and everything else have been done, but the fact is I 
do not believe they have done enough environmental assessments on 
the long term possible damage which may happen not only to that 
area of the ocean shelf, the Gully area, but other areas there as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area is the renowned area called the Flemish Cap.  As 
everyone knows, especially the hon. member for Gander—Grand 
Falls and the hon. member for Malpeque, the Flemish Cap is a 
prime, pristine area of fishing resources.  Currently, with 
acquiescence from our government and foreign nations, we are 
raping and pillaging that resource.  We are using long term 
draggers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is funny that a senior official of DFO actually said in 
committee on the public record that dragging could be good in 
some cases because it turns up the soil at the bottom.  I have 
never heard before that dragging a resource, where we exploit 
completely, rape and pillage the entire bottom, is actually good. 
It is good for very quick economic gains.  It is very fast and 
efficient but there is no long term thinking in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to protect the livelihood of fishermen in coastal 
communities, we require marine parks on all three coasts and 
within the Great Lakes waters so that fish and other species have 
a place to go to nurture and to grow.  If we do not, there will 
be nothing left for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it a disgrace that we as parliamentarians can allow 
politics to get involved in something of this nature.  We have to 
get it out of here.  We have to forget the party politics aspect 
and start concentrating on our children and our children's 
children so that they can enjoy seeing what we see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure, Mr. Speaker, being a very young man in age, you must 
know right now that things you saw as a child your children, your 
nieces and nephews and their children will not be able to see 
because we have exploited them.  We have altered it.  We have 
changed it for our specific short term benefit but have not 
thought about the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I are in support of the bill with some 
reservations.  Some changes need to be made and we are hoping 
they will be made.  We are hoping that the provinces, especially 
Quebec, would be very interested in doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it.  If we take away the provinces and the people, 
what do we have left?  We have the natural resources that were 
here long before we were ever here.  I do not know who gave us 
the right to exploit them and actually exterminate them.  If we 
do not look at this in the long term, future generations, if we 
have any, will look at this generation and say we were a bunch of 
spoiled brats who just took everything for ourselves and left 
nothing for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my comments.  I extend our support for the bill 
with some reservations and hope that all parliamentarians will 
look to the future and not just to themselves.

<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-48, 
an Act respecting marine conservation areas, provides for the 
establishment of 28 marine conservation areas in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises many serious questions on several issues including 
the division of powers regarding the environment—harmonization 
with the provinces—territorial integrity, the overlap among 
federal departments and the so-called consultations carried out 
by the government. I will go over each of these issues and 
explain why the Bloc Quebecois will vote against this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Bloc Quebecois environment critic, I can say that my 
party is in favour of any environmental protection measure that 
is efficient. 
However, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-48. Instead of 
relying on dialogue, as in the case of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park, the federal government wants to create marine 
conservation areas, regardless of the fact that Quebec has 
jurisdiction over the protection of its territory and of the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Department of Canadian Heritage is proposing the 
establishment of a new structure, the marine conservation areas, 
that will duplicate the marine protected areas of the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans, and Environment Canada's protected 
offshore areas. In short, the federal government is splitting 
responsibilities among three of its departments so it can meddle 
in an area that comes under the jurisdiction of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a different note, Bill C-48 fails to respect the integrity of 
the territory of Quebec. 
One of the conditions essential to the establishment of a marine 
conservation area is federal ownership of the land where the 
conservation area will be established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 5(2) of the bill provides that the minister can 
establish a marine conservation area only if he: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—is satisfied that clear title to the lands to be included in the 
marine conservation area is vested in Her Majesty in Right of 
Canada, excluding any such lands situated within the exclusive 
economic zone of Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that subsection 92(5) of the Constitution 
Act, 1867, recognizes that the management and sale of crown land 
are matters of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec legislation on crown lands, passed by the Quebec National 
Assembly, applies to all crown lands in Quebec, including beds 
of waterways and lakes and the bed of the St. Lawrence river, 
estuary and gulf, which belong to Quebec by sovereign right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this legislation provides that Quebec cannot 
transfer its lands to the federal government. The only thing it 
can do within this legislation is to authorize, by order, the 
federal government to use them only in connection with matters 
under federal jurisdiction. However, the protection of habitats 
and fauna is a matter of joint federal and provincial 
jurisdiction, and the Government of Quebec plans to establish a 
framework for the protection of marine areas in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the notes provided us by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage with regard to the bill, marine conservation areas are 
planned for the St. Lawrence, the St. Lawrence estuary and the 
Gulf of St. Lawrence. These are three areas in which the ocean 
floor is under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, co-operative mechanisms already exist to protect ecosystems 
in the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, and in the St. Lawrence 
River under the agreement entitled “St. Lawrence action plan, 
phase III” which was signed by all federal and provincial 
departments concerned, and which provides for an investment of 
$250 million, over a period of five years, in various activities 
relating to the St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The St. Lawrence Marine Park is a good model. In 1997, the 
governments of Quebec and Canada passed legislation to establish 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation led to the establishment of Canada's first 
marine conservation area, and one of the main features of this 
legislation is the fact that the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park is the first marine park to be created jointly by the 
federal and Quebec governments, without any land changing hands. 
Both governments will continue to fulfil their respective 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park is made up entirely of marine areas. It covers 1,138 
square kilometres. Its boundaries may be changed through an 
agreement between the two governments, provided there is joint 
public consultation in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to promote local involvement, the acts passed by Quebec 
and by Canada confirm the creation of a co-ordinating committee, 
whose membership is to be determined by the federal and 
provincial ministers.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee's mandate is to recommend to the ministers 
responsible measures to achieve the master plan's objectives. 
The plan is to be reviewed jointly by the two governments, at 
least once every seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any exploration, use or development of resources for mining or 
energy related purposes, including the building of oil lines, 
gas lines or power lines, is prohibited within park boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By means of regulations, the governments of Quebec and of Canada 
will be able to determine measures for protecting the park's 
ecosystems and resources and for protecting the public. 
More specifically, they will be able to define how each category 
of area will be used and for how long such use shall apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This first partnership initiative should have served as a model 
to the federal government for the creation of other marine 
conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to take the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park Act as 
an example, the federal government is acting as a centralizing 
government that wants to control everything, regardless of 
acknowledged areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois reminds the government that it supported the 
legislation establishing the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois knows the Quebec government is 
embarking on initiatives aimed at protecting the environment, 
particularly the marine floor. 
The Quebec government is also open to working with the federal 
government, as evidenced by the third phase of the St. Lawrence 
action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The involvement of several federal departments in environmental 
issues is a new trend that leads us to believe the government is 
trying to weaken the Department of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the federal government intends to establish 
marine conservation areas through Heritage Canada, marine 
protected areas through Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and marine 
wildlife reserves through Environment Canada. This means that a 
single site could find itself protected under more than one 
category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois thinks these different designations create a 
jurisdictional duplication problem that would be solved if the 
federal government designated one entity to oversee the 
objectives pursued by the various departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By taking three separate initiatives with very similar 
objectives, the federal government is creating jurisdictional 
duplication which will result in confusion among the coastal 
populations concerned and frictions not only between the federal 
government and the Quebec government, but also within the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show the severity of the problem, the Government of Quebec 
has refused to take part in the implementation of marine 
protected areas under the Oceans Act because it believes the 
federal government is not respecting Quebec's jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coastal populations, environmental organizations, all 
stakeholders must be invited to take part in the consultation 
process to express their views. However, that is not the way it 
is done in reality. We know the bogus consultation process 
conducted by Heritage Canada on the establishment of marine 
conservation areas was a failure, as was the one conducted by 
Fisheries and Oceans on the establishment of marine protected 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A background document was sent by Heritage Canada to 3,000 
groups across Canada. Less than ten of them responded by sending 
a letter, and about fifty simply returned the reply coupon 
included in the document. Of those responses, only one was in 
French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of this, it is impossible to talk about meaningful 
consultation. How can the government introduce a bill that 
supposedly has the support of all stakeholders if it is not 
aware of their concerns? 
This leads us to think that this was empty and unfounded 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suspect, moreover, that the organizations consulted were 
preselected.  By way of example, had the ZIPs, zones 
d'intervention prioritaire, and the CREs, the conseils régionaux 
de l'environnement, been consulted, we could have benefited from 
all their expertise.  In fact, some 30% of these organizations 
were consulted, and that is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois opposes the bill for the 
following reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of focusing on co-operation, as in the Saguenay-St. 
Lawrence marine park, the federal government fails to recognize 
Quebec's jurisdiction over it own territory and in environmental 
matters. Therefore, there is encroachment on Quebec's 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Canadian Heritage is proposing the 
establishment of a new structure, the marine conservation areas, 
that will duplicate the marine protected areas of the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans, and Environment Canada's protected 
marine areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak to Bill C-48, which, I must admit, did not make much of an 
effect on me when I first perused it. I figured everyone wants 
to do the right thing, and Quebeckers may be more sensitive than 
others to this kind of infringement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took a closer look at what the hysterical heritage minister 
who introduced this legislation had come up with. No matter how 
well-intentioned she is, it is obvious that the minister's 
attitude toward Quebec has not changed a bit and that she is as 
hysterical now as she was recently, when she asked the Canadian 
Olympic committee to postpone the announcement of the city 
selected to host the 2010 Olympic Games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True to herself, the current Minister of Canadian Heritage has 
never been keen on consultation, quite the contrary. As far back 
as I can remember, she has always acted imperiously to impose 
her vision, her ideas. Consultation is definitely not her cup of 
tea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will establish up to eight marine areas in the St. 
Lawrence estuary, but there is no indication of whether they 
will be located upstream or downstream and how far they will 
extend. We simply do not know. For the sake of argument, let us 
say they extend to the dividing line between fresh and salt 
water, somewhere between Rivière-du-Loup and Montmagny. That is 
where the marine conservation areas would be established. But 
have those involved been consulted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member for Gander—Grand Falls saying earlier that the 
spawning grounds for mackerel and other fish common to these 
regions are located off the North Shore in the St. Lawrence 
River. Can the inhabitants of the North Shore, particularly in 
the ridings of my colleagues, the members for Charlevoix and 
Manicouagan, be expected to foot the bill, without any 
compensation, for marine conservation areas in this sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were these people consulted?  Will these areas be open for 
certain periods?  Will there be more control over fishing?  Will 
they be given the chance not just to survive, but to make a 
living, when the bill is passed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should realize that this policy of refusing to give 
an inch will lead nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to digress briefly.  This morning, I had breakfast 
with someone I consider a friend, a minister from across the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was at a loss and had the following question for me: “What 
have the Liberals done wrong in Quebec for it to have come to 
this?  On November 30, we will take a beating in the francophone 
ridings in Quebec.  We will keep our strongholds, of course, but 
where did we go wrong?  What more could we do?  We sent you the 
saviour himself to rescue the nation.” 
I am referring, of course, to Jean Charest.  “What went wrong? 
What more could he have done?”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with the sort of arrogance we are seeing from the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, Quebeckers have learned over the years. 
This kind of attitude, sanctioned by the present Prime Minister, 
who was the leading force behind the unilateral patriation of 
the Constitution in 1982, leaves its mark on a people. 
Quebeckers have become fearful. 
Quebeckers are not prepared to trust a government that relies on 
remote control, as the Minister of Canadian Heritage is doing by 
imposing Bill C-48 on us, having consulted no one except perhaps 
a few of her friends on the receiving end of hard-to-trace grants. 
Anyway, she has friends in this community, of course. So she 
consulted her buddies, who are probably the ones who inspired 
the negative outcome we expect from application of Bill C-48. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister had been concerned about the federal 
government's image in Quebec, she would have first of all 
undertaken consultations with the Government of Quebec.  She is 
up to her neck now—never has the expression been more apt—in total 
interference in legislative jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the Fathers of Confederation were no fools.  They were 
people who set priorities, people who had believed, in good 
faith, that legislative jurisdictions needed to be divided, that 
some things were best attributed to one level and some to the 
other, according to which one had shown, historically, the 
greatest capacity to deal with those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government possesses huge taxation powers, far beyond its 
real needs. It also acts based on its spending power as well as 
its ability to appropriate funds, for example in the recent case 
of the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is now faced with a crushing debt, but, on the 
one hand, the additional economic input will enable it to do 
away with the deficit, while on the other, it dips into the 
employment insurance fund and has accumulated $10.4 billion in 
surplus over the first six months of the current year.  This is 
a  misappropriation of funds, nothing more and nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, Quebeckers are apprehensive, and the 
backing federal governments had 50, 60 or 70 years ago no longer 
exist. 
Everything the federal government does is closely scrutinized by 
the people, and by members representing Quebec and the other 
provinces in the House. My colleagues in the Reform Party look 
after the interests of western Canadians. They are more 
aggressive when we deal with the Canadian Wheat Board and other 
subjects more specifically related to the development of their 
own region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members have a responsibility to speak up and tell 
this hysterical minister who says all sorts of silly things when 
she is off the air that it is about time she opened her eyes and 
saw what is going on. It is about time she realized what is 
wrong in Quebec where the mere mention of the prime minister's 
name gives a rash to 35% of the population. There is something 
wrong, and it is high time the government, and more particularly 
this minister, realized it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask her to put on hold this bill which has the appearance of a 
commendable bill, because its goal is to protect endangered 
marine species. And who could be against motherhood and apple 
pie? Nobody, and certainly not in my party. But the bill also 
has the unwanted effect of using the federal spending power to 
intrude into jurisdictions that are none of the federal 
government's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is forcing things over which it has no 
jurisdiction. If it wants to spend so badly, why does it not use 
the $10 billion surplus in the EI fund, and spend a little extra 
money to help the unemployed, who now get only 43% of the 
benefits they deserve?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK46">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 16 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-49, an act providing for the ratification and the 
bringing into effect of the Framework Agreement on First Nation 
Land Management, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in my place today to speak to Bill C-49, the 
first nations land management act.  This bill ratifies a 
framework agreement that will enable 14 first nations to opt out 
of land management provisions of the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members whose constituencies include one or more of these 
first nations will attest that they have been leaders in land 
administration for many years.  This historic land management 
initiative is brought forward at their request.  It is the result 
of government to government negotiations that will enable these 
first nations to implement their own land management regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who have been following the negotiations of the framework 
agreement on first nations land management will be aware as well 
that the process has brought the 14 signatories together in a 
spirit of co-operation.  They will continue to co-ordinate 
activities through a land advisory board which they will have to 
establish to help them with the development of land codes, 
negotiation of individual agreements, model laws and monitoring 
of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations through the board will also establish a 
resource centre, develop training programs and maintain records 
in relation to the first nations land codes and amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land advisory board is a tool that first nations have 
developed to build partnerships among themselves and to build 
capacity in their communities.  This is a road to 
self-government.  It is a road to self-reliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When decisions can be made at the local level without 
departmental approvals, the first nations will be able to respond 
more quickly to economic opportunities.  The first nations will 
have the legal capacity to deal directly with banks to borrow, 
contract, expend and invest money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenues, profits and fees from reserve lands administered by 
these first nations will be available as security for loans from 
financial institutions.  These specific first nations will have 
the authority to enter into co-management arrangements with other 
jurisdictions to develop integrated land and resource use 
co-management systems that can serve as security.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the date a land code takes effect, moneys other than those 
derived from oil and gas activities will be collected and managed 
by the first nations.  Specific accountability mechanisms are 
being built into these land codes to ensure financial 
accountability to members. Capital moneys derived from oil and 
gas activities would continue to be held in accordance with the 
Indian Oil and Gas Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another benefit of this legislation for first nations is the 
limitations it places on alienation and expropriation.  These are 
important provisions.  They speak to the sacred bond that first 
nations hold for their land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian Act permits surrender and sale of reserve lands but 
has no provision requiring the replacement of sold lands.  The 
bill before us removes these provisions from first nations 
operating under the land code.  They would be able to alienate 
reserve lands but only if they were exchanged for other lands 
that would become reserve lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not remove the federal government's expropriation 
powers.  The Indian Act gives the governor in council power to 
permit expropriation of reserve land by provincial or local 
authorities for public purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill continues to permit the governor in council to 
expropriate land for the Government of Canada, provided such 
expropriation is justifiable and necessary for a federal public 
purpose that serves the national interest.  Certain minimum steps 
would have to be satisfied.  Compensation would have to be paid. 
This would include land of equal or greater size and of 
comparable value to the land expropriated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to emphasize that the 14 first nations 
that are taking part in the framework agreement are eager that 
this legislation be passed so that they can start managing their 
lands in accordance with this new regime.  The people of those 
communities have a great deal at stake in how we proceed.  It 
means jobs, economic growth and a secure livelihood for many 
people in those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is about much more than land management.  It is 
about self-reliance.  It is about economic opportunity.  It 
speaks to the new relationship that we are building with 
aboriginal people, one based on the principles of mutual respect 
and recognition, responsibility and sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January this government launched a new action plan for 
aboriginal people called “Gathering Strength”.  This plan set 
the direction for a new course that would bring real and 
practical improvements to the lives of aboriginal people. The 
spirit and vision of this plan is captured in the proposed 
legislation before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and the signatories to this agreement urge all members to 
support it.  I therefore move: 
<A NAME="LINK48">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the question be now put. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the parliamentary secretary.  He chose 
very nice words and I am sure some people might be persuaded by 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say up front that some aspects of this bill are 
certainly going in the right direction and we would like to 
support them, especially in terms of devolving land management 
away from Ottawa and to the reserves.  However, the fact is that 
the power to manage these lands is now going to be in the hands 
of band chiefs and councils rather than with the department of 
Indian affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  Is this necessarily a bad thing?  I would 
answer that it could be a very good thing if there were rigid 
requirements for accountability on reserves today.  We are 
becoming increasingly aware—and this is something the minister 
of Indian affairs has continued to try to downplay, conceal and 
deny for the last couple of years—that there are serious 
problems with accountability on many reserves.  We are not sure 
how many of the reserves have these serious problems, but they 
are certainly evident in a big percentage of the reserves in 
Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that this lack of accountability is not 
necessarily a failure of the band chiefs and councils.  It is a 
failure of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.  As much as the minister protests to the contrary, 
there are indeed very serious problems with fiscal and democratic 
accountability on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentary secretary or anybody else on that side of 
the House, or on this side for that matter, doubts this, I would 
draw their attention to an article that was printed in today's 
edition of the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> which deals specifically with 
this issue.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a season of badly handling some itsy-bitsy, teenie-weenie 
plaything scandals, the Chrétien government could soon have a 
real one on its hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Indian reserves there is alleged corruption involving 
countless millions of dollars.  There are police investigations 
in Alberta, there are media reports beginning to expose the story 
and there is acknowledgement in the highest power circles in 
Ottawa that the surface is only being scratch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers spend more than $4.4 billion in annual subsidies to 
native peoples.  It is the only government budget that never gets 
cut.  The allegations are that much of the money does not reach 
destitute Indians on the reserve.  Instead it is pocketed by 
native intermediaries in Armani suits.  The oversight department, 
Indian and Northern Affairs, doesn't seem to know where much of 
the money has landed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, Jane Stewart, said recently over lunch that while 
it is terribly unfair to tar all native peoples with the same 
brush on this issue, funding mismanagement is a serious issue. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important because it is the first time we have heard the 
minister actually acknowledge that it is a serious issue.  Up 
until now she has been trying to tell us that it has not been an 
issue at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is “serious issue” bureaucratese for major corruption scandal? 
Top policy makers in the government give that impression.  They 
cite examples of unbelievable graft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the case, why isn't the government moving on it? 
Getting out front on the controversy instead of waiting to be 
cornered by revelations in the media and by opposition parties? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Can't”, said one of the big men on Prime Minister Jean 
Chrétien's campus. “Racism.  We'd be accused of racism”.  The 
mere fact, he said, of suggesting the native peoples are 
incompetent at administering their finances would cause a 
terrible backlash.  For evidence, he could cite the Reform Party, 
which has raised the issue and which has been painted in 
prejudiced terms as a result. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus political correctness takes it toll again.  Great wads of 
public money go up in smoke, but owing to sensitivities involving 
minorities, a waiting game is played. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Senate committee on aboriginal peoples has begun hearings, some 
of which will delve into this issue.  Senator Janis Johnson, the 
deputy chairman, who is from Manitoba and who is well versed on 
the subject, said that while there is some terrific progress 
being made among native peoples through government programs, 
there is no underestimating the extent of the problem.  “If the 
general public knew what chaos this department was in and all the 
money that was flying around, they wouldn't believe it.  It is 
out of control”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what we have been saying for two years on this 
side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite Ottawa's always-escalating infusion of monies, up to 25 
per cent of the country's 600 Indian bands are in debt to the 
tune of hundreds of millions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is consistent with the kind of feedback we are getting from 
grassroots people on reserves and it is the issue that we have 
raised in the House of Commons since the summer of 1997, only to 
be ridiculed and castigated by the minister of Indian affairs and 
others on that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been told by the minister that only 3% of bands in 
Canada are in non-compliance, and yet we have departmental 
admission that 25% of the bands in this country are running 
deficits in excess of 8% which has required the department to 
step in and co-manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the House some examples of how this affects 
people on reserves; where the rubber meets the road, if I can use 
that expression.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding several years ago Gitksan band members came to me 
and said that the Minister of Health, who is responsible for 
aboriginal health in Canada, was considering signing a health 
authority or transfer agreement so that the Gitksan band would 
have primary responsibility in delivering health care to its 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people came to me because they were very concerned.  They 
did not want this to happen.  They said that their band, as it 
was then constituted, was not capable of administering health 
care and they did not want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote several letters to the minister of health of the day and 
explained the views of these people and asked that the minister 
reconsider and not proceed with the transfer of health authority. 
She reassured me in glowing terms—and I have all of the 
correspondence in my file—that there was nothing to be concerned 
about, that it was widely and publicly supported by the Gitksan 
people and that they would do a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two and a half years later the roosters are coming home to 
roost.  We found out, for example, in the spring of this year— 
and I raised it with the Minister of Health—that the Gitksan 
health authority had invested over $300,000 in the stock market 
in high risk stocks and had taken a $40,000 loss.  That is a 
matter of public record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we found out through front page headlines in the 
Smithers <I>Interior News</I>, a local publication in northwest 
British Columbia, that $695,000 was paid out in honorariums over 
a period of two and a half years to board members.  These are not 
people who work for the health authority, but just the health 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is that advancing the cause of health care in the Gitksan 
communities?  What is that doing for people in the Gitksan 
communities who tell me they have to sleep in their pick-up 
trucks because when they go to Vancouver to see a specialist they 
do not have money for a room? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a fellow who went to Prince George for a gallbladder 
operation and there was no money for transportation fare.  He 
hitchiked to the hospital and had the operation.  Nowadays when 
we have an operation they try to get us out of the hospital as 
quickly as they can, so he started to hitchike back to his home 
town.  He had to stop in Burns Lake because he was so sick.  He 
had to hitchike from his hospital bed to get back home.  There 
was no money for him, but there was $695,000 paid out in 
honorariums to board members and $300,000 was invested in the 
stock market.  That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do I blame the Gitksan band?  I blame the Department of Indian 
Affairs and the Department of Health for not ensuring that the 
people who were going to be responsible for these activities were 
well versed in ethical procedures, that there was a sound 
procedure in place for management and that there were sound 
reporting requirements in place.  Apparently those things are 
non-existent.  That is why we have the terrible situation we are 
faced with today.  That is why the Gitksan people have had their 
health care badly compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give another example.  The Nisga'a people have recently 
signed a land claim agreement, in principle anyway because it has 
not been ratified by this House.  It was reported that in one of 
their communities over $1 million in welfare payments was misused 
and misdirected.  These are small communities and over $1 million 
represents a tremendous amount of income for these bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have testimonials from grassroots aboriginals from right 
across Canada.  My colleague from Wild Rose has the files in his 
office, but I believe that well over 125 bands have expressed 
concerns to us and asked us to look into these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples in Ontario.  One band came to us and said 
that the band council had received money for a sewer and water 
project.  They hired a contractor.  The contractor was aware that 
the money was in place.  The contractor went to work.  The band 
received the money.  The contractor requested payment and found 
that there was no money because the band had spent the money on 
something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are allegations of a chief in Saskatchewan using band 
funds to buy used cars.  He brings those used cars back into the 
community, sells them to the individuals in that community and 
pockets the cash.  The list goes on and on.  I could provide 
example after example.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really not about aboriginal people.  It is about a 
failed system.  It is about the failure of the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development to ensure that this did 
not happen in the first place.  It has created an environment in 
which accountability is almost non-existent.  It has become a 
breeding ground for practices that can best be described as 
unethical and at worst corruptive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, all elected public officials in Canada, beginning 
with the Prime Minister and going right down to municipal 
officials, publicly report their salaries and expenses on a 
regular basis.  Everybody in Canada is entitled to know what I 
make as a parliamentarian, what my expenses are and how much my 
travel costs are.  That is all a matter of public record.  If we 
go onto a reserve, no way.  What we get is a financial report 
which is a glorified pie chart that gives us a percentage of the 
total revenue that the band has spent on administration, the 
global amount that is spent on health care and so on.  But we do 
not get a breakdown and we do know what the public officials are 
making. That is the reality that these people are living with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposes to transfer much greater powers for land 
management to chiefs and councils without first correcting the 
very serious deficiencies with accountability, both democratic 
and fiscal accountability, on the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the parliamentary secretary is aware of this, although I 
am sure he will not want to talk about it.  I would argue that it 
is no accident that the aboriginal women's association of Canada 
and the aboriginal women's association of British Columbia are 
opposed to this bill.  It is they who are most often the ones who 
pay the biggest price for lack of accountability.  They know full 
well that there is no accountability with this bill.  They know 
full well that they will be worse off as individuals with this 
bill in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not suggesting that the system, as it is, is great. 
They are saying that they do not want the responsibility for land 
management to be transferred until and unless there is a proper 
system of accountability in place so that their views will be 
respected in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have told us not to worry because provincial laws with 
respect to family issues—and this will come down to family 
issues—including the disposition of family assets in the event 
of marital breakdown, will still apply.  In other words, what 
they are saying is that there are provincial laws that govern 
marital breakdown and there are provincial laws that govern the 
disposal of family assets.  Even though the chief and council 
will have land management rights, the provincial laws will 
supersede or override in cases where there is a conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to that I give the House this example.  I may have 
used it before, but it is worth hearing again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election campaign I met a young native lady in 
Prince Rupert.  I thought she was interested in the campaign, but 
she was there to see me as a member of parliament.  She was quite 
distraught.  She was tearful.  She said “Mr. Scott, I need your 
help”.  I asked her to explain the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that she was 35 years old and a young mother with three 
young children.  Two of the children were not much more than 
babies.  The oldest was only seven years old.  Her children 
demanded a great deal of her time.  Her husband had left her and 
she had no means of looking after herself.  She was being forced 
to live on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She had some skills, but she could not work because she had to 
look after her children.  With what she was getting on welfare 
she could not buy the food and clothing which she thought her 
children were entitled to.  I understood her situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked where the father was.  She said that he had taken off 
with a new girlfriend and did not want anything to do with her. 
I told her that she had rights.  She could go to court and force 
the father to pay child support.  In essence, her problem was 
getting enough funds to support her children properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that she had tried that, but as soon as she got a 
judgment that required her husband to pay child support he moved 
back onto the reserve.  Guess what?  That court order requiring 
her husband to make child support payments was not enforceable on 
reserve.  Where are her rights?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government, the minister and the parliamentary 
secretary suggest that we put people in even more peril with this 
lack of accountability, putting more people like her at risk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, in the event of a marital breakdown on a reserve, who 
most often winds up with the family home?  In non-aboriginal 
society most often it is the woman because most often the woman 
ends up being the primary caregiver to the children after the 
marriage breaks down.  On reserves it is the other way around 
because the decision as to who ends up with the marital home is 
not in the hands of the courts, it is in the hands of the chief 
and council.  They effectively run the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These serious problems have to be addressed and in a manner 
which is acceptable to people living on reserve before we can 
support this kind of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the principle of the bill can be supported, and we would 
like to be able to support it, it is putting the cart before the 
horse.  There has to be accountability first before going to the 
next step and devolving more and greater powers to band councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The serious and persistent problems on aboriginal reserves must 
be addressed first in a manner which is satisfactory and 
acceptable to grassroots band members before the government 
proceeds with this bill and this kind of legislation.  To not do 
so is to once again fail some of the most vulnerable people in 
this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am extremely delighted that the Reform Party has come such a 
long, long, long way in the last five years and is now coming 
around to support aboriginal women and native rights in Canada. 
That is a great thing.  I want to commend the hon. member for his 
good, decent and necessary work in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a couple of points.  I will get to the questions 
of accountability with respect to the legislation before us and 
address the hon. member's concerns.  He is concerned, and I think 
rightly so, about the division of matrimonial property on divorce 
or separation.  I believe that he has missed the point entirely 
in this piece of legislation.  Hon. members who read it carefully 
will find that some of the member's concerns and objections very 
clearly will be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only two days ago the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs 
and Northern Development was discussing issues such as poverty on 
reserves in many first nations communities.  In that particular 
instance it was Inuit communities.  Members from the Reform Party 
requested that the minister come before the committee. We had 
arrived at this place because the Reform Party members had 
concluded through their own logic, and I followed it closely, 
that in this particular instance it was not the problem of the 
Inuit leadership that had caused these difficulties.  We brought 
in the department officials and they agreed at the end of the 
debate and two or three or four hours of discussion on it that it 
was not the department officials, that maybe it was the 
minister's responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps, just perhaps, one of the reasons there are difficulties 
in these communities that we are all concerned about or we ought 
to be concerned about is because there is not sufficient funds 
going to these communities to do the job.  The leaders who came 
before the committee made a compelling argument that they are 
doing their best with scarce resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the salaries of all the chiefs and councils across the 
country were cut in half and their flight privileges to go to 
meetings or whatever were taken away, do we honestly think that 
would clear up the problem in Canada?  Is our analysis so 
superficial that we would honestly believe and debate this kind 
of thing in the House and that we would think that would be an 
answer to these difficult problems?  I really do not think so and 
I do not think that any member can stand and say that with a 
straight face in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about representation, one of the signatories to Bill 
C-49 is a band from the area of the member from Prince George. 
The chief and council met with the member and said that surely if 
the Reform Party believes in the grassroots notions that its 
members always talk about, then a vote in the community involving 
the women of the community as well would hold some weight.  If it 
were true and if they held true to their own values and 
principles, then it would hold some weight in terms of swaying 
that particular member of parliament to support this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The vote was 381 to 51 for the community in Prince Albert to 
support Bill C-49.  The member from Prince Albert ignored the 
grassroots and stood in this House to say it was unconstitutional 
and all sorts of silly things which are not true.  Where is the 
grassroots there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another member from the Reform Party only two weeks ago found 
three aboriginal people.  Out of a community of some 30,000 
aboriginal people he found three in his entire constituency.  He 
equipped himself with a tape recorder and a camera and went about 
diligently looking under stones, trees, carpets and beds to find 
somebody in the community who would criticize the leadership so 
that he could come back to the House and say that he had 
discovered a great evil in Canada and he was going to lay it bare 
in front of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member if in fact his colleague from Prince 
George and that band had voted for this particular bill 380 to 
50, is that not grassroots representation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary 
jumped around from Prince George to Prince Albert, but I think he 
meant Prince Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that having one vote on one reserve is not 
sufficient.  We are aware that there are some reserves that are 
not suffering through the problems of accountability because they 
have progressive leadership which has ensured that they have 
proper accountability.  They largely have their membership on 
side. That is not the case in many bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about a plebiscite, then let us have a 
plebiscite of all the aboriginal reserves across Canada.  If the 
government can show us at that point that there is resounding 
support for this, I would agree to support it tomorrow.  I do not 
think that that support is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is thinking that we are picking and choosing and 
trying to create something out of nothing in terms of the 
accountability issue, which is what he seems to be suggesting, we 
have not suggested that anyone's salary should be cut in half. We 
have not suggested that people should not travel. We have 
suggested that the members of the band should know what the 
salaries are and they should know what the expenses are.  That is 
all we have said. We did not say to cut anyone's salary.  We do 
know that some of those chiefs are earning upward of $150,000 a 
year tax free.  I think their members would have a bit of a 
problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final answer to the member's question is there will be 
another meeting hosted by my friend from Wild Rose in Edmonton 
this Saturday.  I would really urge the member if he is concerned 
about the issue to please come and listen to these people.  My 
friend from Wild Rose will not be saying very much. He will be 
listening and I urge the member from across the way to do the 
same thing.

extensively with the Kaska-Dena council in that area.  Now I am 
working with northern fishing groups who are mostly aboriginal, 
first nations and Metis people in northern Saskatchewan and 
northern Manitoba for them to gain more control or access to 
their own resource in terms of the fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is a long question and deserves a long answer, but 
would the member and his party not agree that the government and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B> Mr. Speaker, we should certainly be doing 
everything we can as parliamentarians and as representatives to 
work toward improving the economic circumstances of aboriginal 
people.  We know that they face some of the most desperate 
circumstances in this country.  We know that is not acceptable 
when our Prime Minister lauds this country as one of the best in 
the world in which to live and we have people essentially living 
in third world conditions.  That frankly is wrong.  I agree with 
the member.  We have a responsibility and we should take it 
seriously.

parliamentary secretary seemed to allude to the fact that there 
really is not much problem in the way of accountability in these 
reserves. In the department's own report as reported in the 
Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> a couple of days ago, upward of 25% and 
probably more are in dire need in terms of fiscal responsibility 
and indebtedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been to the reserves and I have seen the conditions.  I 
have seen the people living in squalor.  A report came down 
through the department of Indian affairs that Canada is 
considered the number one country in which to live, which is 
great, but if we factored in the reserves, we would be about 
number 65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware of the reports coming through the department 
of Indian affairs and would he care to comment on them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Wild 
Rose for his question.  I am very aware of it.  As a matter of 
fact, we have been raising this issue as vociferously as we can 
for well over a year and a half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now finally starting to get the government's attention 
because there has been a lot of press on this lately. There have 
been front page articles in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> and stories 
appearing on CTV and CBC.  The government can no longer hide from 
it.  It has to admit that the policy of concealment is a failed 
policy and that the government will have to deal with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we will find that over the next year or year and a 
half this issue will occupy much more time on the part of 
government and certainly on the part of the Indian affairs 
minister and the parliamentary secretary than it has in the last 
10 or 12 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak on Bill C-49, the first nations land 
management act, on behalf of our caucus and our critic from the 
south shore of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know this act is not all encompassing.  We know it does not 
solve all the problems of our first nations, however our caucus 
will be supporting it because it is a step in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation has been almost 10 years in the 
making, beginning in 1989 as the lands revenue and trust review. 
That agreement encompassed a number of areas, of which land 
management was only one.  While that agreement fell through, a 
number of first nations persevered with negotiations for land 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A framework agreement on land management was signed by 13 first 
nations on February 12, 1996.  The 13 first nations were joined 
on May 12, 1998 by Saint Mary's in New Brunswick to bring the 
total number of first nations to 14.  I would like to commend 
these 14 first nations for taking the initiative to develop the 
framework agreement and to persevere with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, it is progressing through the legislative 
process.  It is being watched carefully not only by the 14 
signatories to the agreement who are eager to begin 
implementation, but by many other first nations as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement may become a model for other such 
agreements on land management once this legislation passes and 
the first nations are given the opportunity to implement it. 
Thirty or forty first nations have already expressed an interest 
in this framework agreement.  I expect many more will do so as 
they are able to see the benefits of such legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of the faults of the Indian Act.  This 
legislation will allow first nations to move out from under some 
of the restrictions of the Indian Act and provide opportunities 
for first nations to manage their own land and resources through 
land codes that they will develop specific to their own 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does this transfer authority from the federal 
government to the first nations, but through the land codes it 
also encourages stronger community participation.  Land codes 
must be ratified by the communities and voted on by those first 
nations people living both on and off the reserve.  This is an 
onerous job but one that the first nations felt was important 
enough to warrant the extra work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By providing votes to those people living on and off reserve, it 
broadens the process by including the experience and observations 
that all these individuals might bring to this process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is necessary to implement the framework 
agreement that deals specifically with land management.  This is 
not a treaty and has not changed the constitutional rights of 
first nation peoples or the powers of section 91 and section 24 
which state that reserve land is a federal jurisdiction.  The 
first nation land, which will remain reserve land as defined in 
the Indian Act, will provide the first nations with greater 
control and autonomy over these lands. It is a step toward 
self-government, something this Progressive Conservative caucus 
supports.  We will continue to support the first nations in this 
land management agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the New Democratic Party I am pleased to 
participate in the debate of Bill C-49, an act to provide for the 
ratification and the bringing into effect of the framework 
agreement on first nations land management and to offer my 
party's support for this important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be part of a party that has done so much to ensure 
the issue of aboriginal self-government has received its rightful 
attention in Canada.  I am proud to be part of a party whose 
provincial governments have done so much to ensure the 
implementation of our obligations enshrined in treaties long 
agreed to in the context of 1998.  These treaties have provided 
the rest of Canada with huge benefits. It is a privilege to be 
supporting Bill C-49.  I am glad the government has seen fit to 
agree with 14 first nations in this context.  I am pleased to see 
that two Saskatchewan first nations, the Muskoday and Cowessess 
are involved in this historical agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of the royal commission this bill honours a 
federal government commitment to aboriginal people and the 
implementation of new ideas oriented toward creating a new 
relationship between the Government of Canada and first nations 
peoples.  Bill C-49 is an act to implement an agreement between 
the federal government and 14 first nations.  It relates to the 
establishment of a new regime under which these first nations 
will finally be have the power and the right recognized by the 
Government of Canada to manage their own reserve lands and their 
own resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These 14 first nations are opting out of the Indian Act land 
management provisions but the act ensures that first nations 
lands are protected for future generations by prohibiting any 
surrender or sale or any expropriation by provincial or municipal 
governments.  It is a new partnership that increases the 
self-reliance of aboriginal peoples in the management of their 
own resources and their own futures.  For that we must all be 
very pleased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation must be viewed as a commitment by Canada to 
aboriginal peoples, to the political evolution of first nations 
and to the concept of self-government and self-determination to 
which surely we are all fully committed. The process needs to be 
linked to an orderly transition to a new relationship between 
Canada and the first nations peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations are plainly looking forward to obtaining the 
responsibilities for managing their own lands and resources 
contained in Bill C-49.  This is a good agreement that will help 
create employment and economic opportunities for aboriginal 
people.  It will also help to increase their own stewardship of 
their own environment. In renewing the partnership with first 
nations the federal government must implement policies and 
government to government relations at a pace that works for first 
nations and for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the idea that the framework agreement will be open to 
other first nations.  They may join if they feel ready and that 
it is in their best interest to do so.  We hope many more will do 
so.  We call on the government to ensure the right to 
self-determination for first nations peoples and to maintain the 
territorial integrity of each first nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation supports the capacity building initiatives for 
the implementation of self-government.  We must be sure the 
resources will be provided to facilitate the participation of 
first nation women in the governance process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been unfortunate that members of the official opposition 
have chosen to drive a wedge between Canadians and aboriginal 
peoples in their discussion of not only this piece of legislation 
but almost every other piece of legislation, policy or other 
issue dealing with aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that in the process members of the Reform 
Party, including the members for Prince Albert and Athabasca, 
have really attempted to accentuate any divisions that exist 
within Canada regarding Canadians of non-aboriginal and 
aboriginal descent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not helpful, as we build relationships and move forward, 
to accentuate the difficulties and to drive a wedge between 
decent minded Canadians who want to find a solution to this 
problem and aboriginal peoples.  It is doing a disservice to all 
of us as we see the incitement to disagreement, the incitement to 
disregard and the incitement to lessening respect perpetrated by 
members of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good to see first nations within the constituencies of 
Reform MPs pointing this out to their MPs in the hope that their 
MPs will be more accurate, truthful and better represent their 
constituents who are first nations. In particular the Muskoday 
First Nation has being explicit, clear and firm with regard to 
misleading comments by the member for Prince Albert, calling on 
him to clear the air and to make sure he rectifies the statements 
which he has made that give the impression that this is not an 
agreement accepted by first nations people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Muskoday First Nation in its referendum voted 309 to 40, an 
89% approval rating, for this agreement, almost as good as the 
last NDP byelection in Athabasca where the NDP candidate received 
94% of the vote.  Those approval ratings are not only significant 
but we do not see them very often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have both men and women in a first nations supporting 
overwhelmingly the opportunity to finally take control over their 
own resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the Reform Party stopped baiting and antagonizing 
Canadians.  It must stop focusing on the negatives and start 
building partnerships with aboriginal peoples.  Bill C-49 is a 
good example of this partnership between the federal government 
and the 14 first nations that will strengthen the first nations 
governance and support the development of strong communities and 
strong local economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is fully in support of Bill C-49.  We look forward to 
its implementation and expansion to other first nations.  We also 
look forward to it ensuring that first nation peoples will 
finally be able to express themselves in an appropriate way in 
Canada with the full support of the federal government and the 
Canadian people.

Bill C-49, the first nations land management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has special significance for the people of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla, as my riding is home to the West Bank 
Indian Band, one of the 14 first nations that will be affected if 
the legislation passes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will have a major impact on both native and 
non-native residents living on West Bank lands.  Currently the 
federal, provincial and West Bank First Nations have come to an 
agreement in principle that is even beyond the scope of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having reviewed both the first nations land management act and 
the West Bank First Nations agreement in principle, I have two 
very serious concerns that I would like to share with my 
colleagues today and with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the West Bank First Nation treaty process in principle 
was negotiated by federal, provincial and aboriginal parties 
without consulting the public.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact there was a veil of secrecy that surrounded the 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, preferential rights for certain Canadians to lands and 
resources are entrenched throughout the draft of this agreement 
based solely on race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two concerns are disturbing in a country such as Canada. 
Secrecy and preferential treatment based on ethnicity do not mesh 
with the spirit of democracy and equality before the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to look at these two issues more closely.  I 
believe the majority of the Canadian public and backbench Liberal 
MPs will agree these concerns warrant a rethinking of the way the 
government deals with land management issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first paragraph in the agreement in principle states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until otherwise agreed to by the parties, this agreement and 
supporting documentation shall be treated as confidential by the 
Government of Canada and the Westbank First Nation, subject only 
to release to Westbank First Nation citizens for their 
consideration. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is Liberal democracy in action.  While consent by the 
Westbank First Nation through a referendum is required, the 
remaining population of Westbank will not be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Indian affairs statistics the Westbank First Nation 
is comprised of 517 members.  Yet there are 7,000 non-natives on 
Westbank land.  They are voiceless on this bill and this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, the final Westbank agreement will be 
declared valid once approved by cabinet and the enactment of the 
legislation.  Once the needed legislation is passed by 
parliament, the federal cabinet can simply move an amendment to 
the agreement leaving no room for democratic review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By not consulting non-aboriginal residents, the resource 
industry and other interested parties, the Liberal government is 
demonstrating its Meech Lakian tendency to reject bringing 
democracy into the process of dealing with far reaching 
aboriginal land claim issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second concern is that this agreement compounded by Bill C-49 
creates inequality by granting special rights and privileges 
based solely on race.  The Westbank First Nation made up of 517 
individuals will be authorized to formulate its own constitution 
with sweeping powers.  The 7,000 non-aboriginal residents will be 
largely excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the law making power granted under this agreement, Bill 
C-49, undermine the Constitution?  Is the rule of law so little 
regarded by our political leaders?  From my reading of the 
agreement and Bill C-49, I would have to answer yes to both of 
those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take clause 37 in this bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between this act 
and any other federal laws, this act prevails to the extent of 
the inconsistency or conflict. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me it sounds as though the rule of law and the supremacy of 
the Constitution are being disregarded.  Bill C-49 will undermine 
the rule of law and the Constitution by granting to aboriginal 
people the right to create laws that will supersede those of the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Caught in the middle will be the 7,000 residents of Westbank who 
are non-native.  They will lose their rights to be governed by 
the laws of Canada, subject instead to the laws set by the 
minority based on race.  This is absolutely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debating legislation that grants special rights and privileges 
to a select group is not something I imagined I would be debating 
when I became a member of parliament in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land management powers given to the Westbank government will 
be extensive.  It will have jurisdiction to manage, administer, 
govern, control, regulate, use, protect and benefit from Westbank 
lands.  It will also be able to grant licences and control zoning 
in addition to controlling access to and trespass on Westbank 
lands. These are extraordinary powers given to a minority of 
people on Westbank land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law making process under Bill C-49 and the Westbank First 
Nation agreement also exclude the non-Indian majority living in 
Westbank.

those same laws.  It appears to be taxation without 
representation.

the government espouse democracy and equality abroad while 
cultivating undemocratic institutions within our own borders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 and the whole self-government process need to be 
brought back to the drawing table.  Canada has thrived as a 
nation that has garnered international acclaim due to our quest 
for the principles of democracy, equality and rule of law.  As a 
member of parliament with a number of Indian bands in my 
constituency I have worked hard to support economic development 
and educational development projects within natives communities. 
However, trampling the rights of the majority is not the right 
path to take and that is the path the Government of Canada has 
chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretive and piecemeal fashion in which we are approaching 
land issues is a recipe for future discontent among all parties 
involved.  The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development is part of the problem, not part of the solution.  We 
need to build a new and brighter future and a better relationship 
between aboriginals and non-aboriginals.  Aboriginal people need 
to be full and equal citizens empowered to manage their own lives 
without being marginalized.  Bill C-49 is not the answer to this 
problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest to my friend who represents an adjacent

views and appreciate all the work he has done.  I have been very 
supportive of a number of initiatives he has taken.  I suspect my 
comments may be somewhat in opposition to his.  On the other hand 
I acknowledge that many of the points he makes are the concerns 
of people certainly in the areas that he and I represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend indicated, I believe the issues surrounding the 
relationship of aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples will 
probably be the most crucial issue in the early part of the 21st 
century.  We are beginning the long process of enabling first 
nations peoples to take their rightful place in Canadian society. 
The sooner we see the demise and ending of the Indian Act, the 
sooner I will be happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always thought it was very ironic that a copy of the Indian 
Act has a longer title in brackets which reads “an act 
respecting Indian people”.  If ever there were a piece of 
legislation that did not respect Indian people, it is the Indian 
Act of Canada.  We all agree that the patronizing nature of the 
Indian Act should be replaced as soon as possible.  Replaced in 
what way is what this discussion and debate is all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>From my perspective and that of my party and of the hon. member 
for Yukon, our critic, Bill C-49 is a step forward in bringing 
self-government to a number of first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of misunderstanding surrounding the issue 
of self-government.  There is a great deal of misinformation 
being circulated about self-government.  I do not suggest for a 
moment that people are doing this or being motivated for anything 
but the right reason.  Sometimes I am suspicious of that. 
Nevertheless, it is a difficult issue to discuss because of the 
varying interpretations of self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When first nations' people are asked what self-government means 
there are many variations and definitions.  I do not expect we 
will ever find ourselves in a position where we will agree on a 
single definition of self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of moving to the principle of self-government and how 
it might be defined differently from place to place in Canada, 
this is a major first step.  It would replace the Indian Act and 
the minister's discretion under that act for these 14 first 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something rather insidious about a country where a 
minister of Indian affairs and northern development is asked to 
make decisions on probably an hourly basis about the lives of 
first nations people.  I just got off the telephone moments ago 
from talking to an individual who is doing business on an Indian 
reserve in the constituency of Kamloops, Thompson and Highland 
Valleys.  He asked me to intervene with the minister of Indian 
affairs to have her approve a certain element of economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it an odd situation that a minister or a bureaucrat 
sitting in Ottawa would be required to sign off on a small piece 
of economic development in a distant Indian reservation in 
British Columbia.  What kind of goofy system is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is an attempt to get away from that goofiness and to 
suggest that as smart as the minister Indian affairs is she 
probably does not know much about running a little economic 
development project on the edge of the Shuswap Lakes in British 
Columbia.  The fact that it requires her signature to begin this 
project reflects the sort of lunacy of the way the system 
presently operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a step in the right direction.  Others perhaps may not 
think so.  It gives first nations law making powers with respect 
to their land and resources, including the development, 
conservation, protection, management, use and possession of land. 
The first nations, however, will not be able to sell their land 
but may develop or lease it to others.  The first nations may 
acquire land for community purposes.  That is an obvious thing to 
do in a free country.  The bill sets out conditions for 
accountability between first nations and their various members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government retains fiduciary responsibility.  I appreciate 
fiduciary responsibility is something that the federal government 
has under the Constitution of Canada, but therein lies one of the 
problems.  I do not suppose this will change very much.  It is a 
redraft of Bill C-75 from 1996 which died in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations involved are from a number of provinces: 
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and 
New Brunswick.  If I were to identify two or three key points, 
the first would be that this is an important step in the building 
of self-government for aboriginal peoples across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A significant issue has been the status of women in the 
matrimonial home on reserve land upon the dissolution of 
marriage.  The B.C. Native Women's Society and other individuals 
are pursuing opposition to the framework agreement through the 
courts at this time.  Hopefully when the bill gets to committee 
we can find ways and means of addressing their concerns.  If not 
perhaps we have to relook the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is non-native people who lease homes on reserve 
land are unable to vote for those who will be able to make laws 
which affect them.  That is a reflection of the concern expressed 
by some of the previous speakers earlier today about the rights 
of non-aboriginal individuals who presently live on Indian 
reservations and therefore will not have an opportunity to 
participate in decision making of the band. This is a problem. 
There is no question about that.  It is something that needs 
serious examination once the issue gets into committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Saskatoon presented in a very articulate 
and clear way the reasons we support the bill and some of our 
very serious concerns at this point.  However I want to add one 
or two short points.  Contrary to some comments being made by 
some of my colleagues, section 15 of the charter which guarantees 
equality applies to reserve lands and first nation laws.  First 
nations are not above the Constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 protects the rights of women during marital breakdown. 
Clause 5(4) of the framework agreement and clause 17 of the bill 
require the 14 first nations in cases of marital breakdown to 
establish rules and procedures dealing with two basic rights: the 
right to possession of the matrimonial home and the right to 
division of property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a bone of contention for many years, particularly 
when it comes to women, and the legislation attempts to address 
the issue.  Whether or not it is adequate remains to be seen.  We 
will see what happens in committee when we hear from some of the 
witnesses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to talk about the particular issue for a few moments and 
would like to point out a couple of matters with regard to what 
some of my colleagues have said.  What Bill C-49 is trying to 
accomplish is honourable.  There is a purpose behind the bill 
which I am sure a lot of people would like to see happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out some things that have been said by 
grassroots natives across the land from whom I have heard in the 
last little while.  One comment that sunk deep into my thoughts 
was from an ex-chief of the Siksika nation in Alberta.  He said 
that before we could move to any of these kinds of agreements, 
before we could begin to establish any kind of self-government 
rule on native issues, we must make sure there are rules in place 
that will hold all parties accountable for what happens in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is basing that comment on his experience in his own reserve 
and a nearby reserve where his family members and grandchildren 
live, the Stoney reserve.  Members have heard many things about 
the Stoney reserve, which is presently under review by auditors 
and will continue to be until some answers are achieved.  We 
expect a report some day soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comments like those of Roy Littlechief are being said across the 
country.  Many grassroots people I have talked with everywhere 
are saying that accountability must be in place before we can 
turn over any kind of self-government to those in charge on our 
reserves.  That makes sense to me now, having visited many 
reserves and having seen the squalor many of these individuals 
are living in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are living on reserves where there is no running water 
and no electricity.  They have a path instead of a bath.  They do 
not have the conveniences we are accustomed to in a great country 
like Canada.  The reason is that the dollars do not seem to be 
there.  When we try to find out about where the dollars may have 
gone and what has happened there are no answers.  When we try to 
ask for an investigation because of the accusations of a number 
of grassroots people from many of these reserves it is denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one reserve I visited I carefully looked over some documents 
the grassroots people managed to get their hands on.  They 
concerned payments from the social department on the reserve. 
I looked down the list of these payments to the persons who were 
in receipt. There would be the band member's name for $320, 
another band member's name and perhaps $450.  Suddenly we came to 
a name and it was $9,500.  In the next month that same name 
reappeared only it was $8,000, several thousand dollars more than 
anyone else was receiving on welfare.  I asked the persons who 
were in possession of these documents why this individual was 
getting so much money on the welfare program and the others so 
little.  They reached into their files and brought out a death 
certificate. The individual who was receiving $9,500 and $8,000 
per month has been deceased for 13 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You do not have to be a rocket scientist to think that is a 
little strange and that it is something that ought to be checked 
into.  Yet when we question it through the department of Indian 
affairs, then we question it above that, and we go to the RCMP 
who agree that this probably should be investigated, it is all 
stopped with the common answer that I get continually from the 
Indian affairs department “it's an internal problem”.  In other 
words, let them solve it themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is more than an internal problem when these kinds of things 
happen.  There is accountability that we in this House owe to the 
taxpayers of Canada whether we like to admit it or not.  When we 
pour billions of dollars into the top of the department of Indian 
affairs, we should be accountable to the taxpayer where every 
dollar of that goes, how is it being used and is it effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not found one taxpayer yet who is not pleased to put 
money into a program such as Indian affairs providing it does the 
job of looking after the people in need.  Then there are reserves 
with 90% unemployment, which is not unusual, 40% drug addictions, 
not illegal drugs but medical, where alcoholism is running 
rampant, where they have schools which can educate the people on 
the reserves and only 16% of those eligible on the reserve are 
attending the school.  There is something wrong with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To jump into a bill like Bill C-49 and say we are going to do 
that, the biggest fear that Roy Littlechief and other grassroots 
people have is it will simply empower those who are in charge now 
to a greater degree and things are going to get a whole lot worse 
on an individual basis. He simply says deliver a message to 
parliament. Make sure the things are in place that will make the 
chiefs, councils and all the leaders right up the ladder 
accountable for every dollar that goes into that department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty wise thing to say.  A report from the 
department of Indian affairs says: “As many as 25% of Canada's 
500 Indian bands are broke enough that the federal government 
will either have to intervene or take over financial management 
this year”.  This is what the Indian affairs managers said: 
“The bands have made little headway in recent years to dig out 
from debtloads that are causing federal officials grave concerns 
even as aboriginals strive toward self-government.  The trend 
blamed on mismanagement, both by federal officials and Indian 
leaders, has continued for the past five years.  The problem is 
like a revolving door.  A dozen indebted bands get straightened 
out and another 12 sink deep into debt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those kinds of things are happening.  My wife and I took tours 
into reserves. We sat in tar paper shacks.  We were hosted by 
elders sitting on apple crates, doing the best they could to host 
us with what they had and happy as could be that a member of 
parliament for the first time in their history even dared step on 
to the reserve to that length. 
They have never had an opportunity to talk to a member of 
parliament.  They are crying out “What can you do to help us? We 
live like this”.

dollars.  Make sure all the mechanisms are in place, then bring 
Bill C-49 forward and she will probably find all kinds of support 
once all those things are there to make sure the right things 
happen on behalf of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Conservatives, New Democrats and Liberals think it is a 
shame that we are exploiting these people and that it is 
opportunism.  I will tell them what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people out there who are suffering, starving, living 
in squalor.  That is what it is.  It is a humanity issue.  Every 
member in this House ought to come aboard and help me to address 
these grassroots problems.  I invite members to do so instead of 
being so critical about opportunism and all that other hogwash.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is a pretty hard act to follow, but I will do my 
best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member for Wild Rose.  It seems with this 
bill we are putting the proverbial cart before the horse.  Some 
may ask why I have spoken so many times on bills that relate to 
natives? I speak on anything related to my constituency.  Because 
I have a lot of natives who live in the constituency on reserves, 
I am profoundly interested in them.  I am profoundly interested 
in what they say to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have received phone calls from people telling me 
something very loud and clear and no one can escape it.  Get your 
head out of the sand in the House of Commons.  Wake up and see 
what is out there in the real world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chief said to me the other day, how can we have an 
extension of a business arrangement with land management when we 
do not have a government to proceed with those affairs?  There 
are fancy terms like new partnership, but we will not have a new 
partnership until we have accountability.  The government has no 
business whatsoever in bringing forth bills like this until it 
establishes the basic ground rules for self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it not doing that?  Why do we have no self-government? 
What is it afraid of?  It simply does not want to face reality. 
Anyone can say we can have partnership, land expansion and all 
kinds of new businesses, but no one would be happier than Reform 
to see a business success survive on the reserve survive on new 
land.  We would all love that. But if they do not have the tools 
to establish that business and govern that business, what do we 
think will happen?  The member for Wild Rose stated it very 
clearly and saw where the money was going. There is no 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know Indians are worried about accountability and for the most 
part it is quite transparent.  How can members opposite put out 
well over $6 billion with no accountability for that money?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to establish a land venture and a business venture, if 
we are to bring in the people who want to come into line with the 
new millennium, we cannot expect them to do so until from the 
grassroots up they know about government and business and until 
they can walk with their heads high and know they can go to the 
office any time to get an accurate account of how the money was 
spent.  Until the government wakes up to the fact that it will 
continue to blow billions of dollars without having 
accountability, it should not expect a partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example from the House.  Here we have the Bloc 
that wants to separate from Canada.  When it does so, it will 
negotiate the terms.  It is completely backwards.  We should be 
negotiating the terms so intelligent people in Quebec and in the 
rest of Canada can know what the separation is about.  The same 
thing exists with Bill C-49.  We are creating land management. 
We hope we will create business associated with the land 
management but we have not provided the people who need it the 
most with a model for self-government. Shame on this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on this government for ever using the term partnership. 
This is the most important social issue facing Canada today. This 
issue is so profound that it is growing every day.  And what is 
the government doing about it?  Nothing.  The minister of Indian 
affairs says it is because we want a new partnership.  I know the 
Liberal Party wants to condemn me for being anti-native. Do not 
come to my constituency or talk to my natives and say that.  They 
want self-government and they want the leadership of this 
government to provide them with that.

off.  In a fashion befitting a person pandering to have his

foreign farmers continue to receive billions of dollars in unfair 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only new farm laws that the government has brought in are to 
initiate taxes on farm fuels and fertilizers and to make it a

<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

more specific as far as taxes on fertilizers and fuels are 
concerned.  They have always been there.  We know that.  As we 
know we would all like to pay lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recognized and we are recognizing the severity of the 
situation they are facing at present.  We are working with our

<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we can just see how much support there is for that.  He has to do 
more than just continue talking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has just pumped $6 billion more of new unfair 
subsidies into its farms.  That is on top of the already billions 
of dollars that they have.  Subsidies make up 30% of a farmer's 
income.  The Europeans are subsidizing unfairly $60 billion a 
year to their farmers.  It is impossible for our farmers to 
compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not start tackling and taking on the 
Americans and the European bullies for their huge subsidies to 
farmers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

the party that does not want to support agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate we had in the Chamber a couple of weeks ago they 
were continually questioned not only by members from this side

did not have any suggestions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it was our motion on agriculture that we debated in the House not 
long ago.  Perhaps he has had a little memory loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easier to arrest a farmer in Manitoba than to challenge 
the big U.S. department of agriculture.  It is easier for the 
government to increase user fees and fertilizer taxes in 
Saskatchewan than it is to talk to Americans and Europeans about 
lowering their subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the problem.  Foreign subsidies are too high and 
Canadian taxes are too high.  Why does the government not admit 
that its heavy handed tax collectors and the light weight 
ministers abroad that will not tackle this issue are the real 
problem?

with regard to the public complaints commission “I want the 
Canadian public to have the whole answer as soon as possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today a federal court judge ruled that the panel chair cannot 
continue in his job until another judge makes a decision as to 
whether or not he is biased.  That could take six months.  It 
could take a year.  That is not getting anything going.  The APEC 
inquiry is off until that is heard.

approach which is understandable.  It does not mean that the 
panel will not continue.  We do not know what the results will 
be.  Let us wait to hear what the court says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the government has no authority under the law to stop the

brought out into the light of day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

put more than $1.3 billion in this issue and $800 million to 
settle class action lawsuits.  We believe that people need care. 
We put $300 million and offered to do our share with the

people who have been infected with hepatitis C will get the care 
they need.

reports indicate that the government caucus and the minister of

ministers may not yet be on side.

Saskatchewan.

Mr. Speaker, today the noose got a little tighter around efforts 
to uncover the truth about APEC.  The federal court has placed 
the RCMP public complaints commission in a freeze mode and the 
process has taken so many blows that the only person in Canada 
that has confidence in the process is the Prime Minister and 
perhaps his deputy.  They prefer to hide behind any cover they 
can find.  First it was the solicitor general, now it is the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister 
have mastered the art of saying much but saying little, the test 
of integrity is performance, not Liberal talking points.  The 
pathetic broken record responses from the Deputy Prime Minister 
do nothing to improve the faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to get to the bottom of APEC, why is it 
sponsoring Bill C-44 which would allow the cabinet to fire the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

difficulties that some members opposite may have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us set the record straight.  Let us make absolutely sure 
that we are not disputing the right of Indians to honour their 
land treaties.  That is not the issue.  The issue that is before 
us today is how we are going to bring about accountability with 
this bill.  How are we going to change the conditions which the 
hon. member for Wild Rose mentioned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some questions that hang very heavily on the shoulders 
of elected officials on the government side of the House.  Why 
are we denying thousands of people the right which we enjoy of 
self-determination in government?  Why do we continue to do that? 
Why are we prepared to go ahead with massive land claims when the 
people at the grassroots want accountability?  The government is 
not helping them to attain that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those areas which have accountability, to a large degree, are 
areas in which we do not see what the member for Wild Rose saw. 
The more transparency, the more accountability, the better it is 
for everybody.  We have no right in this House to deny the term 
and the meaning in totality of self-government.  As we go into a 
new century we should not be considering legislation that puts 
the cart before the horse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deny shows that this government is not really looking at 
reality.  Government members can talk all they like about 
accountability and partnership, but until we put into place the 
machinery that brings about accountability, the machinery that 
brings about local grassroots governments, then we are going to 
continue with the mess that we have in many areas across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I ask of this government is to not keep putting forth bills 
with no end to them, but to look at the reality of what is 
happening in Canada.  Let us look at what we have to do to cure 
the biggest social issue facing Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can hide from it.  Obviously it does not want to 
take responsibility. 
Sooner or later the responsibility of what goes on from coast to 
coast without self-government and without transparency will rest 
on the shoulders of government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-49, the first nation 
land management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impetus to create this legislation came from the first 
nations which developed a workable land management system to 
enable them to manage and control their lands and resources.  The 
new land management regime outlined in this legislation is a 
government-to-government agreement that ends the authority and 
discretion of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development to manage these lands under the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new regime goes to the very heart of our efforts to try to 
make life better for aboriginal people across Canada.  It places 
control over the daily management of lands back into the hands of 
several first nations.  With this control they will have the 
tools to guide their own destiny and to support strong, healthy 
communities fueled by economic development and supported by a 
solid infrastructure of institutions and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new regime is a striking example of the kind of productive 
arrangement envisioned in the paper “Gathering 
Strength—Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government launched that paper in January, we 
committed ourselves to renewing our partnerships with aboriginal 
people and to finding new approaches to bring about real, 
practical improvements in the lives of aboriginal people.  This 
legislation leads the way in our efforts to give first nations 
greater autonomy and to strengthen their capacity and expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members may recognize much of this legislation.  It came 
before us in December of 1996 as Bill C-75.  It received second 
reading and then died when the House was dissolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those familiar with the legislation will know that it has a 
history that goes back even further.  The bill before us, as with 
the legislation of the last parliament, seeks to ratify a 
framework agreement signed by these first nations in British 
Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and New 
Brunswick.  This legislation would apply to 14 first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement provides authority for these 14 
signatories to govern their lands and resources under their own 
laws.  The first nations must first develop a land code that will 
set out their basic rules and procedures to govern lands and 
interest in land and resources after the land provisions of the 
Indian Act cease to apply to these communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land codes must be consistent with the framework agreement, 
which can only be amended by the parties to it.  The lands 
affected will be known as first nation lands and will continue to 
be reserve lands for the purposes of other applicable federal 
legislation.  For example, the Indian Oil and Gas Act will not be 
affected by this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each first nation will also enter into an individual agreement 
with Canada to determine a level of operational funding for land 
management and to set out the specifics of transition from the 
current to the new regime.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues across the way must understand that this framework 
agreement requires each first nation's land code to set out a 
whole series of requirements:  the requirements for 
accountability on management of lands and money to first nation 
members; the procedures for making and publishing first nation 
laws; the conflict of interest rules for land management; a forum 
for the resolution of disputes; general rules and procedures for 
granting or expropriating interests in first nations lands; the 
general authorities and procedures for delegating administrative 
authorities; and the procedure for amending its land code or 
approving an exchange in lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems from the discussion across the way that these 
requirements are not well understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that these provisions must be voted on by 
the community as part of their opting in procedure.  These 
measures ensure the participation of the community at the outset 
and seek its approval for the process.  In this way the first 
nations can be assured that their memberships are fully aware and 
fully apprised of all aspects of the opting in process and 
subsequent administration of the lands and moneys. In other 
words, this is an accountability process built to very high 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the land code and the individual agreements require 
community approval.  All members of the first nations who are 18 
years or older, whether resident or off reserve, would be 
eligible to vote in the community approval process.  At least 25% 
of eligible voters would have to approve those land codes and 
individual agreements for them to be valid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process of ratification is further evidence that the 
framework agreement will help build and strengthen aboriginal 
governance.  It will support strong communities, strong people 
and strong economies.  I would remind the House that these are 
the major objectives in the paper “Gathering Strength—Canada's 
Aboriginal Action Plan”. There is just so much that one can say 
in speaking to this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the bill provides for each first 
nation and the minister to appoint a verifier to confirm whether 
the proposed land code and community approval process were 
consistent with the terms of the bill and the agreement.  The 
verifier would also determine whether the land code and 
individual agreement had been approved by the confirmed process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us enacts a framework agreement that will 
benefit everyone.  The signatories will benefit from greater 
control over their lands and resources.  Neighbouring 
municipalities and affected provinces will benefit from economic 
development spinoffs.  The federal government will benefit from 
no longer having to administer certain specific sections of the 
Indian Act.  It can reduce its involvement in the day to day 
management decisions and activities of those first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other first nations will benefit from being able to study the 
effects on these 14 signatories and from using the framework 
agreement as a model for future self-government agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 is a good piece of legislation.  I urge all my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the member's comments that Bill C-49 is a good piece 
of legislation.  I would agree with her that it is a good piece 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address a couple of the fallacies in this 
legislation and a couple of what I believe are mistakes in some 
of the statements made by members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there are some difficult issues in this legislation 
but it is a very positive piece of legislation and one that will 
give control of land management to first nations, something that 
they do not have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to correct the member for Souris—Moose Mountain 
who stated that there was no accountability in this bill.  This 
bill is all about accountability. 
Perhaps there are parts of the bill the member did not read.  I 
will explain the accountability sections in this bill for members 
of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the Indian Act has given DIAND virtually all 
decision making authority regarding the use and disposition of 
reserve lands and resources. The minister has limited 
accountability to the members of the first nations for management 
of reserves and has limited accountability to the members of 
first nations for the management of land transactions, resources, 
environment and revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the law exists now, there is no accountability at all.  The 
14 first nations that have signed this agreement have made 
accountability to their members one of the main principles of the 
framework agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 does not deal with elections or other subjects such as 
governance which remain under the Indian Act.  There are a couple 
of important points that should be made about accountability in 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement ensures that a first nations council 
will account to both on reserve and off reserve members. First 
nations members both on reserve and off reserve must approve the 
decision to opt out of ministerial administration of reserves, 
the content of the land code and any amendments to the land code 
and the individual transfer agreement with Canada.  A first 
nations council must manage its lands for the use and benefit of 
the first nation. That sounds like accountability to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A land code must contain provisions to ensure accountability and 
transparency of decisions for lands and related revenues.  A land 
code must contain provisions for first nations law-making 
procedures and the publication of first nations laws. All land 
codes are public documents available to the members of first 
nations and the general public.  The land code must identify a 
local dispute resolution mechanism for land management decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about accountability and it is strictly about 
accountability.  I think it is time that some of those who are in 
opposition to this bill sat down and read the bill. Let me give a 
few more examples of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eligible voting members can introduce first nation land laws for 
consideration.  Proposed land laws must be publicly posted and 
distributed to members before being voted on by council. First 
nation land laws must be published. The public has access to 
those laws at the first nation office during business hours. 
Conflict of interest rules require that persons in conflict may 
not participate in making decisions on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eligible voting members must approve certain types of leases and 
licences of first nation land.  Council must adopt a budget, 
explain it to its meeting of members and make the budget 
available for inspection by any members who request it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expenditure and contract controls, books of accounts and records 
must be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles.  Any adult member can receive a copy of these 
financial statements.  The auditor has complete access to the 
financial records. It is an offence to restrict access to the 
financial records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community approval for a ratification vote is required before 
certain laws or land transactions can be made. At the annual 
meeting, first nation members are required to discuss land 
matters and to receive the auditor's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is about accountability.  That is what the bill brings to 
the nation. That is what the bill brings to the 14 first nations 
that have signed the framework agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that those 14 First Nations 
stretch from coast to coast in Canada.  There are five from 
British Columbia:  Westbank; Lheit Lit'en; Musqueam; N'Quatqua; 
and Squamish.  There is one from Alberta, Siksika.  There are two 
from Saskatchewan, Muskoday and Cowessess.  The one from Manitoba 
is the Opaskwayak Cree. From Ontario there are four: the 
Chippewas of Georgina Island; the Mississaugas of Scugog Island; 
the Chippewas of Mnjikaning; and Nipissing.  There is also Saint 
Mary's in New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are other first nations interested in joining this initiative? 
Yes, 40 or 50 first nations are interested in joining this 
framework accord for land management.  A number in my own 
province of Nova Scotia are interested in joining.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely nothing in this agreement that changes the 
Constitution.  There is nothing that changes the charter of 
rights.  This does not deal with the difficult issues before us 
in the House of Commons.  This deals with a very simple idea that 
all of us should be very familiar with and that is control of 
lands that one owns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For first nations to try to take their place in Canadian 
society, to share in the economic opportunities of this country, 
it is criminal that the Indian Act discriminates in the way it 
does.  The minister of the crown is responsible to tell a first 
nations individual living on reserve whether or not they can cut 
firewood on that reserve, whether or not they can cut timber on 
that reserve, whether or not they can have a gravel pit on that 
reserve, whether or not they have an opportunity for mining 
interests on that reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor does this bill exclude any other bills that have already 
gone through parliament.  The Indian Oil and Gas Act still 
pertains.  This does not change legislation. This simply gives an 
opportunity for us in the Parliament of Canada to allow first 
nations to have economic opportunities of their own upon reserve 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bothers me very much when I listen to the opposition's 
discussion of this bill.  I have looked at this bill.  I have 
read it backward and forward and frontward and sideways and I 
really cannot see the problem with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some discussion of first nations women and how they 
would be accepted under the aegis of this bill.  The fact remains 
that the bill deals with the breakdown of marriage.  It deals 
with the separation of husband and wife.  It deals with children 
after the breakdown of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with all the pertinent issues that are before the 
first nations with the ownership of land upon reserve.  It is 
incumbent upon us as parliamentarians to support positive 
legislation.  Certainly this is a piece of positive legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things that are difficult for us as members of 
parliament to do.  I addressed them before but I think it is 
important to point them out again, and that is what this piece of 
legislation does not do.  It does not change the Constitution of 
Canada.  It does not change the laws that govern the equality of 
rights under the charter of rights.  This bill allows first 
nations economic opportunity and control of their own land.  It 
is a good bill.  I support it and I would ask other members of 
the House to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with real intent and interest to my colleague who just spoke. He 
referred to clauses of Bill C-49 with regard to accountability 
which is very reassuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we all know that the requirements for accountability in 
every facet of expenditures of money in the interests of Indian 
people have always been there. Those requirements for 
accountability have always been there yet we hear from the 
grassroots people, Indian people, some of whom I have spoken to 
this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ask them about Indian self-government and what they think 
about it, they tell me they are concerned about it. I ask why 
they would be concerned about.  They tell me very clearly that 
they are concerned about granting their leaders greater powers 
and authorities over them.  When I ask what the problem is now, 
they go on and on at length to explain the problems. My colleague 
from Wild Rose and my colleague from Skeena have given examples 
of the problems the grassroots people have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is anyone in Canada who would not be 
willing to continue the direction of resources into the 
aboriginal community for the benefit of their standard of living, 
education and so on.  But if it is not reaching them, as the word 
is coming to us over and over again from all points on the 
compass, then we have to look at the whole area of 
accountability.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 will pass, but it is the duty and the responsibility 
of members in opposition to warn about the defects of the bill as 
we see them.  The whole area of accountability is of very serious 
concern to us and to all members who have talked to Indian people 
at the grassroots level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate problem is that there are aboriginal people at 
the grassroots who cannot take their concerns to their chief and 
council for whatever reason.  They cannot take their concerns to 
the minister because the minister will be criticized and attacked 
by the chief and council if she begins to meet with the 
grassroots.  She will be accused of going around the local 
elected representatives.  The minister is caught in a bind in 
this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the answer is other than to insist on 
accountability for 25% of those bands that are not acting 
responsibly even though there are guidelines for accountability 
in terms of the expenditure of money for the welfare of Indian 
children and in terms of schooling, education, health care and 
their standard of living.  There is a lack of accountability for 
the expenditure of funds at the band level.  There is a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are putting our warning voice on record in this regard.  No 
one in the House does not want to see aboriginal self-government. 
However it has not been defined yet.  Why has the government not 
defined it?  Why do we not have a model upon which to base it and 
allow the aboriginal people to take greater charge over their own 
lives and their own affairs?  It must be done on the basis of 
accountability to their own grassroots people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the answers are to many of the problems I 
have heard about.  They are not unlike those of the larger 
Canadian society.  We as the Reform Party are asking for populist 
principles which allow for the people to hold their elected 
representatives more accountable for the manner in which they run 
the affairs of the country, including plunging us into debt and 
having many of the children living in poverty after taxing us at 
the highest rate of the G-7 countries, after borrowing and 
spending $585 billion over the last 25 or 30 years.  Still one 
child in every five is reported to be living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be greater accountability in this place.  We want 
more free votes in the House.  We want the right of the people to 
recall us if we do not honestly and faithfully represent their 
views and concerns.  That is the kind of mechanism within any 
level of government which the people must have.  Perhaps it is 
the answer for aboriginal people and those answers must come from 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The degree of accountability in the bill looks good.  There are 
policies and regulations demanding and calling for accountability 
in the way moneys are expended, yet we still hear the cry from 
the grassroots.  Until that cry is listened to and the problems 
are addressed, the bill may be simply adding to the problems of 
the grassroots, not to the problems of the Reform, Bloc, NDP, PC 
or the Liberal members of the House.  It may be adding to the 
problems we hear coming from the grassroots in that it will grant 
greater power and authority over local government.  That is where 
there seems to be a lack of the accountability these people are 
requesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our duty is to place our concerns on record.  We hope everything 
works out well, as everyone does, but it has not so far.  We are 
saying that the bill is placing a greater degree of power and 
authority in the hands of the very same people the grassroots are 
concerned and complaining about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  Laura Deedza lives in my community but 
she is from one of the northern Alberta reserves.  She has been 
trying to get financial statements from her band.  For months she 
has had nothing but a fight on her hands as she has been trying 
to get even parts of those financial statements for the present 
year and for years past. 
She has nowhere to go except to the minister.  She is continually 
complaining to my office that she meets a brick wall at that 
level.  The procedures for access to these kinds of documents are 
clearly outlined in the bill.  They are outlined as well for 
financial statements to which every band member is supposed to 
have access.  Laura is just one of many.  She is continually 
asking us for help.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 16 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-56, an act respecting an agreement with the Norway 
House Cree Nation for the settlement of matters arising from the 
flooding of land, and respecting the establishment of certain 
reserves in the province of Manitoba, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
debate on the bill up to this point has been very interesting. 
Since the Norway House Cree Nation is part of my riding, I would 
like to add my own comments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1540

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill represents the end result of many years of negotiations 
among the Norway House Cree Nation, the province of Manitoba and 
the Government of Canada.  Any legislation introduced in the 
House of Commons to implement agreements negotiated with other 
parties, particularly when these negotiations take place for a 
number of years, is legislation that includes a great deal of 
delegated trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this specific case since the duly elected government of the 
Norway House Cree Nation signed the agreement and the people of 
Norway House ratified it in a referendum, we must trust that this 
agreement is satisfactory to the people of Norway House.  This 
does not mean we believe there to be unanimous support for the 
agreement.  Since the people of Norway House voted in favour of 
this agreement, it must be assumed that it reflects the opinion 
of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this debate some members of the House have questioned 
whether this agreement reflects the will of the people of Norway 
House.  Let us be clear about what these members are implying. By 
questioning the legitimacy of the referendum results, they must 
be alleging that some sort of electoral fraud took place. This is 
not the type of allegation that should be made lightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when first nations are finally able to regain control 
of their affairs, the department of Indian affairs and ultimately 
the Government of Canada must ensure that the democratic rights 
of every first nation member are not ignored.  Failure to do so 
is setting their governments up for failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any member of parliament who believes as I do that first nations 
have a legitimate right to self-determination knows that it is 
not parliament's place to tell first nations people what to do. 
Throughout the history of Canada's relationship with the first 
nations this kind of patronizing attitude has lead only to 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid repeating the errors of the past first nations must be 
free to make their own decisions and determine their own path. 
Thus, in the absence of unassailable proof that the referendum 
was fraudulent, I cannot in good conscience oppose what I must 
conclude is the desire of the majority of the people of Norway 
House and their democratically elected band government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help put this matter in context let us compare the Norway 
House Cree Nation with the nearby Cross Lake First Nation.  Both 
these first nations were among the five affected by the flooding 
in the 1970s and both signed the northern flood agreement.  Each 
has a democratically elected government and as is its prerogative 
the government of Cross Lake is following a different path in its 
fight for compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike Norway House, Cross Lake has not reached an agreement 
with the province of Manitoba and the Government of Canada.  The 
government of Cross Lake has not been satisfied with the 
compensation offered by the federal and provincial governments 
for the flooding of their land.  Thus they have decided to hold 
out for the compensation they were promised under the original 
northern flood agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is two first nation governments faced with similar 
circumstances choosing different paths to confront their 
circumstances.  Norway House has chosen to make a deal while 
Cross Lake has chosen not to do so.  Some have said that Norway 
House has made the wrong decision, but we as members of 
parliament have no right to tell these first nations what to do. 
I support their right to self-determination so the people who 
must make this decision are the people of those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The referendum result and the fact that they re-elected their 
chief and council indicate that the majority of the people of 
Norway House support this agreement, and I respect their 
decision. Likewise I support the democratically elected 
government of Cross Lake's decision to follow a different path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the position I am taking to support 
the self-determination of each first nation reflects the position 
of the first nations themselves.  At the last annual general 
meeting of the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, the chief of 
Norway House pledged his support for Cross Lake in their struggle 
for compensation.  Clearly even when they choose different paths 
for themselves first nations stand in solidarity and support each 
other's self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the Norway House master implementation 
agreement is bringing some resolution to the community.  Most if 
not all members who have taken part in this debate have never 
been to this fine community in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report to the House that economic development is 
moving forward in Norway House.  A new mall was opened this week 
creating dozens of new jobs in the community.  The community has 
embarked on many substantial projects including a new day care 
centre and a paving project last summer.  Virtually every road in 
Norway House is now paved.  In addition, there are also new 
tourism initiatives under way highlighting the community's long 
history and spectacular natural beauty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am upset and deeply disturbed by recent developments 
in Cross Lake which indicate that the Government of Canada and 
the department of Indian affairs are trying to leverage that 
first nation into signing the master implementation agreement 
against its will.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief of Cross Lake has asked me to tell the House about the 
pressure his government and his people are under from the 
department of Indian affairs and the Government of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cross Lake is the only first nation that has yet to sign the 
agreement.  Like any government in this day and age, the 
government of Cross Lake First Nation also carries a debt. 
Unlike most other governments Cross Lake needs the department of 
Indian affairs to underwrite its debt.  Now the department of 
Indian affairs is threatening to stop the underwriting of the 
band government's loans, meaning the band will go bankrupt unless 
it can immediately pay off its debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if Canada's creditors demanded immediate repayment of 
our national debt.  It would not be reasonable to expect this and 
neither is it reasonable to expect this from the Cross Lake First 
Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of Indian affairs has effectively put a knife to 
the throat of the Cross Lake First Nation.  If it signs a master 
implementation agreement the immediate cash payments will allow 
it to pay off its debt and avoid bankruptcy.  But the Cross Lake 
First Nation has made it clear that it does not want to sign a 
new master implementation agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Government of Manitoba has so far 
been unwilling to offer fair compensation so Cross Lake has 
chosen to continue with the more time consuming process of 
pressing for the compensation it was promised under the northern 
flood agreement.  It must be free to make this choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This blackmail by the department of Indian affairs is despicable 
and betrays the Liberal government's utter contempt for the 
principle of first nations self-determination.  I call on the 
Liberal government to end its blackmail of the Cross Lake First 
Nation immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that the Liberal government has the capacity to be 
unethical in its treatment of first nations.  However, there is 
no unassailable proof it has used these underhanded tactics with 
other bands such as Norway House.  In the absence of such proof 
we must assume the democratic process is legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the members who are opposing the bill have good 
intentions and they feel they are supporting what is right for 
Norway House.  There are members within the Norway House First 
Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for this agreement is not unanimous in Norway House and 
that is the democratic right of those who oppose it but I call on 
all members of the House to support the wishes of the majority of 
the people of Norway House by supporting the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also call on members to join me in fighting the terrible 
injustice that the government is currently perpetrating against 
the Cross Lake First Nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today on Bill C-56, the Manitoba claim 
settlements implementation act.  When we look at the bill we see 
that it has two parts.  The first part relates to the settlement 
of matters that arise from flooding of land and the second part 
is a means to facilitate the implementation of land claim 
settlements in Manitoba through the creation of new reserves or 
the addition of land to existing reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will highlight some difficulties with the second part that 
have arisen because of the treaty land entitlement process in 
Saskatchewan and that have been brought to my attention by rural 
municipalities and by people who are C-31 Indian people. There is 
some difficulty with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flooding of course occurred when the Churchill River was 
developed for hydro projects and Indians living along the river 
lost the land they had lived on.  They lived a hunting and 
fishing sustenance lifestyle.  I have been there because I was 
involved in the development of those hydro projects as a land 
surveyor and parked out on the Hudson Bay at the mouth of the 
Churchill River and met some of the people who probably have been 
affected by this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about almost 12,000 acres of reserve land and 
over half a million acres of bordering non-reserve land in this 
project.  That needs to be replaced so that the people can 
continue to make a life in the north. 
There has been some question about the method of arriving at 
agreement on the referendum raised by people from Norway House. 
They have charged there have been profound irregularities and 
vote buying.  I call on the government to look into their charges 
if they have made them to the minister as well, because we do not 
want any question left when this is over that the right thing had 
not been done for the people at the time it was done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the chief electoral officer should have 
authority over Indian governments in elections to ensure that 
they are fair and lawful so that there could be no question as to 
whether an election or a referendum had been held legally in all 
respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have any proof of the allegations but they are serious 
allegations that need to be looked into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty land entitlement history is that in the western 
provinces when the treaties were signed, the treaty commissioners 
had searched the countryside for Indians at that time to 
determine their status, to set aside land for them and get their 
names.  However, when the surveys were first done it was found 
that there was a shortfall in the number of acres that had been 
promised to each individual Indian.  So at a specific point in 
time funds were set aside in Saskatchewan for bands to purchase 
land for descendants of those people for whom lands were not set 
aside at the time of the purchase.  The amount they should have 
got at the first survey was 128 acres per person, which works out 
to 640 acres or one square mile for a family of five, more than 
sufficient for a family to earn a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the current problems with the treaty land entitlement 
process that have come to my attention by way of Indians 
themselves who have brought this up are that the Indian register 
was used to obtain funds to purchase land at this point because 
there is not enough crown land left in Saskatchewan to transfer 
to Indian bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The band list, on the other hand, has been used to deny access 
to benefits.  The band has control over membership of the list 
and has a safe list which is used to guard it from unwanted 
members gaining access to the band and to the benefits that flow 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That creates real difficulties for people who have a right to 
the benefits the band has obtained in their name.  We need to 
ensure those band lists are not closed when benefits have been 
given to the band using their names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has always felt that private ownership often 
should be made available for people who have a lifestyle 
different from the bands themselves.  Imagine someone growing up 
in a major city having to move to a band in northern 
Saskatchewan, to a reserve, to enjoy the benefits that should be 
theirs as a result of the treaty land entitlement process.  These 
people do not want to leave behind the schools, friends, 
relations, hospital services and all the services that are 
available in an urban community.  They have not grown up on a 
reserve and they do not see themselves as a part of that process. 
They need a way to take advantage of the benefits set aside for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out another difficulty that arises from 
the treaty land entitlement process.  In Saskatchewan bands are 
free to buy from any willing seller at a price agreeable to both 
of them.  The band then applies to have the land designated 
reserve status.  Immediately the rural municipality has a reduced 
capability to collect taxes.  I know there is an amount set aside 
which is supposed to generate enough interest to provide the 
services.  However, when we come to the business of building 
roads across reserves, we find out that when we build a road up 
to a reserve or if we have driven these roads that have been 
built up to reserves, they are a completely different lower 
quality from across the reserve because it is not in the band's 
interest to spend its money on a road which is possibly marginal 
to its operation. This is happening throughout Saskatchewan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Haul roads are being built across the province.  They are 
designated as haul roads and known as super grids.  They are 
necessary because railroads are being pulled up and rural 
elevators are being shut down.  Consequently haul roads are 
assuming greater importance to rural municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a budget is set up for a reserve an amount is set aside for 
road construction but there is no requirement for the band to 
spend the money as shown on the budget which is simply a document 
that states how the money has been given to the band on the basis 
of so many dollars.  For example, when a rural municipality 
builds a road it identifies haul roads in agreement with other 
rural municipalities and the provincial government and funds are 
set aside for their construction.  It receives 73% from the 
province.  The rural municipality taxes its ratepayers to come 
up with the other 27%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A rural municipality in Saskatchewan recently constructed a new 
haul road which crossed three miles of reserve land.  The band 
did not participate in funding for construction which made the 
costs as follows.  The federal government contributed 67%, the 
rural municipality contributed 33% and because the road was on 
the reserve, the province contributed nothing.  The band also 
contributed nothing.  This meant the rural municipality's portion 
rose from 27% of the total cost to 33% which represents an actual 
increase in taxes needed to build the road of 22%. That is a very 
large tax increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the proliferation of reserves due to the treaty land 
entitlement process, bands are buying land all over rural 
municipalities as they have the perfect right to do but the 
reserves begin to have a checkerboard effect throughout the rural 
municipalities.  Therefore when we are building roads we are 
continually coming across these sections with no tax base to 
support the construction of roads, never mind the maintenance of 
roads which includes gravelling, grading, snow clearing, weed 
control and that type of thing which falls under the road 
allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural municipalities have asked me to tell the government about 
the situation they are facing.  They are looking for the 
government to ensure that the money given to bands for road 
construction be used for road construction and not for other 
purposes as important and as laudable as they may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The band in question has agreed to supply gravel over the next 
few years until the value is arrived at, and that is a fairly 
enlightened viewpoint, but no band is required to do that.  Bands 
have the ability to make the rules for road construction when the 
rural municipalities are bound more by the province and more by 
their own needs of their ratepayers, the farmers who farm the 
land, and must get to a delivery point or a market on the other 
side of a reserve.  It is a very large problem that needs to be 
addressed and arises from the treaty land entitlement process.  I 
trust the Manitoba government will take up the farmers' position 
on this so rural municipalities will not have to bear 
increasingly high costs of road construction as the checkerboard 
effect of small Indian reserves throughout the rural 
municipalities takes effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the intent of the legislation that land taken for 
road construction purposes should be replaced.  The treaty land 
entitlement process is an historic process that is accepted 
policy in Canada.  As such there is no point in fighting it. 
There definitely needs to be some review of the method by which 
the tax income for a rural municipality is replaced.  Otherwise 
they will be taxed out of existence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to ask my hon. colleague, who made a very good analysis of the 
problem, if he could expand just a bit on this checkerboard of 
land that is purchased by the Indian bands in various parts of 
the municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not automatic that these lands become part of a reserve 
because it seems to me that the Indian band may purchase these 
lands and those lands are then held in fee simple.  If they are 
held in fee simple, then the tax base that exists for other land 
in that area is precisely the same on the land owned by the 
Indian band as would be the case if another person owned that 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the contention that what the municipality should be 
looking for is some sort of a shift in legislation or some 
predictable way in which the decision would be made by the 
federal government as to how these fee simple lands that have 
been purchased by the Indian bands from individuals will become 
part of a reserve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, bands that purchase lands 
under the treaty land entitlement act apply to the provincial 
government for reserve status, which takes it out of the tax 
system.  As I mentioned, there is a set-aside, an amount paid 
into a fund which is held in trust, the interest of which is 
supposed to pay for services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is another problem.  If the province grants 
reserve status to farmland, what happens is that the amount that 
is paid is based on the current assessment, which is quite low 
for farmland.  If they convert it to country residential, let us 
say, and it is subdivided into 20 acre parcels, on 160 acres that 
would be eight separate parcels.  That means that eight families 
may end up living there.  There would be more bussing costs, 
education costs and health related costs.  The costs would 
escalate and the rural municipality would still be left building 
roads for the extra people and making sure that services were 
delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The re-zoning is not subject to the rural municipality's 
objections.  That of course goes to the federal government 
because it is now federal crown land.  There is a definite 
loading of expenses onto this level of government in the rural 
areas of Canada without commensurate tax revenues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening to the answer of the hon. member for Prince Albert to 
the question of whether or not these fee simple lands were 
taxable and I am not sure what his answer was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the legislation states very clearly that it ensures 
that fee simple lands provided to Norway House as part of the 
compensation plan do not fall under the Indian Act as special 
reserve lands.  So they are fee simple lands, plain and simple. 
Members can draw whatever other conclusions they may want to from 
that, but they are fee simple properties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for South Shore.  He is right, they do purchase them in fee 
simple and they can be held in fee simple, but the fact is that 
because it belongs to a band it can apply for reserve status. 
Once that happens, then it loses its tax exempt status, as 
reserve land obviously does.  Fee simple lands held by a 
corporation or anything like that are obviously taxable at the 
going rate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
not my intention to take a long time to debate this bill today. 
Part of my problem with the bill is not so much what the bill 
contains, but how it contains it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real danger in approaching legislation in an omnibus 
fashion like this.  We have two quite different pieces of 
legislation in one bill.  Perhaps we should not be trying to 
hurry this legislation through the House.  We have a number of 
pieces of good legislation that we are trying to deal with.  We 
should take the time to examine this bill carefully and 
understand all of the pertinent issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-56, the Manitoba claims settlement implementation act, 
has two parts, the first part being the Norway House Cree Nation 
master implementation agreement to establish reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Norway House signed the master implementation agreement in 
December of 1997.  The legislation before us allows the 
government to affirm certain provisions of that agreement, 
although it is being implemented.  What this implementation does 
is to ensure that fee simple lands provided to Norway House as 
part of the compensation plan do not fall under the Indian Act as 
special reserve lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also ensures that money provided as part of the compensation 
agreement is administered by a trust for the first nation.  This 
prevents the money from becoming band money as defined in the 
Indian Act, thus it is at the disposal of the first nation to be 
used as it decides.  I guess the wording of that would be Indian 
money as declared under the Indian Act.  Otherwise they would 
have to continue with the time consuming and onerous 
administrative requirements of the Indian Act.  Instead, this 
improves their opportunity for self-reliance and is a step toward 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northern Flood Agreement sets out a means of providing 
compensation to the first nations affected by the flooding of 
their traditional lands.  The agreement was so poorly 
constructed, however, that the implementation never occurred. 
This legislation attempts to bring some form of closure to many 
of the elements of that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the legislation improves the process of 
establishing reserves.  The process could be faster and more 
efficient with the minister rather than the governor in council 
approving reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations also have the opportunity to improve their 
economic developments with this legislation, since it allows them 
to have third parties continue or begin developments while the 
process is ongoing to establish a reserve.  This has been a 
hindrance to both economic opportunities for first nations and 
the parties trying to develop interest on reserve lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a certain willingness to see this piece of legislation 
pursue the course of parliament and get to committee before 
Christmas, I have no problem allowing this legislation to 
continue.  I am not going to continue the debate at great length 
today.  However, I will say again that there is a danger in this 
type of legislation which deals with more than one issue. 
Actually, we are dealing with three issues.  There are certainly 
two big issues.  There is a certain danger in that.  I caution 
parliament that if we are going to continue to do this, in the 
long run we will end up slowing the process because we do not 
have time to study each separate issue in its entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Northern Flood Agreement consists of 155 pages. 
That is just one part of this bill.  I realize that all 
legislation is complicated and can be fairly onerous, but this 
legislation would be much better suited in two bills. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to say that I have had many conversations with members of the 
Norway House band over the last year and a half.  It is important 
for members to understand and agree that before parliament 
ratifies and passes this kind of legislation we understand where 
the members of the band are coming from and whether there is 
consensus.  There should be at least general consensus on the 
part of the people who are most affected by this bill that it is 
something they can support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about the referendum results.  I believe 
this is critical to this issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Norway House Indian band held a referendum to determine 
whether or not they wanted to proceed with the agreement that 
this bill represents.  I began getting calls to my office a 
little more than a year ago from band members who were making 
serious allegations over irregularities and improprieties 
surrounding the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first allegation made was that the initial referendum 
failed.  The Norway House band actually held a vote and the band 
council, I think in partnership with the department of Indian 
affairs, decided to hold a second vote on exactly the same 
agreement.  Nothing had changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second allegation that was made was that the second vote was 
conducted, but not before a liberal amount of money was used to 
buy votes.  I do not know if that is true, but that was what I 
was told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would caution the member in the debate on this bill in 
his use of language about buying votes.  These are serious 
allegations and I would caution the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I think in this 
particular instance the hon. member for Skeena was very aware of 
the nature of what he was saying and, as a matter of fact, made 
the statement that in fact these were assertions made to him and 
in his case he has the responsibility to follow up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I do not believe this to be a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very aware of the 
seriousness of the allegations.  Let me point out to the House 
and to the hon. member opposite who raised these concerns that I 
certainly did not start phoning Norway House asking for opinions. 
These people contacted me.  They were making these allegations 
and they asked me to look into them on their behalf.  They have 
asked me and other members of the Reform Party to go to bat for 
them, as it were, to try to get to the bottom of this because 
they are making some very serious allegations.  They made 
allegations that people were actually paid money to change their 
position with respect to supporting this agreement.  Since I was 
not there I really do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the government if this referendum was 
overseen by Elections Canada.  Was there a disengaged third 
party, as we have in all elections in this country?  Every 
federal election in which I have run has Elections Canada, a 
disengaged third party that oversees the election so that it can 
fairly determine at the end of the night the veracity of the 
results.  Without that, how can anyone ever say that they had a 
referendum and it passed or it failed?  No one can do that. 
Canadians, I submit, would never accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the people on these reserves are absolutely beside 
themselves.  They are asking why there is one set of rules and 
regulations for Canadians that ensures fairness and on their 
reserves people can do whatever the hell they want and nobody 
cares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it passing strange that the Liberal Party is trying to 
represent itself as the voice of aboriginal people when there are 
very serious allegations that it does not want to deal with.  We 
did not have this fairness.  We did not have an unbiased third 
party, Elections Canada or elections Manitoba or some responsible 
party, to oversee this referendum.  That did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was there a complete and proper enumeration done of all of the 
voters?  Do we know that?  Where is the evidence to support that? 
I have asked for that, but I do not have it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to have assurance and the people in that community have 
to have assurance that this was a fair representation of 
community support.  I submit right now that we do not have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to use another example.  It is more recent and it is in 
my riding.  The same principle is involved.  I do not mean to 
digress.  It is very important that we understand the issue. The 
principle here is whether or not these are fair and honest 
referendums that actually represent the consensus or the majority 
view of the people to be affected by these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the Nisga'a agreement for just a minute. We 
were told approximately 14 days ago that the Nisga'a people in 
northern B.C. had a referendum and that they ratified their 
treaty.  This is the first stage.  It has to be ratified by the 
B.C. government now and then it is going to be ratified by the 
legislature here.  Apparently without any free votes, the Prime 
Minister is going to ram it down parliament's throat like he does 
everything else, but I digress again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a people voted for two days.  The referendum started 
on Friday and finished on Saturday night.  I live in Terrace 
which is just south of the Nass valley where the Nisga'a treaty 
is going to come into effect. I waited on Saturday night with 
bated breath for the referendum results.  I did not get them 
Saturday night.  I waited all day Sunday and I did not get them 
Sunday.  I started waiting into Monday.  Monday morning there was 
an announcement on the radio saying that there should be some 
results that afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On election night Elections Canada counts approximately four 
million or five million votes, or maybe it is six million votes, 
anyway it is several million votes and we get the results within 
an hour and a half.  In two hours we know who the next government 
will be.  We know on an individual basis whether we were elected 
or re-elected as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a referendum where just slightly more than 2,000 cast a vote, 
it took two days to get the preliminary results.  They were not 
final results, preliminary results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what happened. On Monday afternoon we were told that the 
Nisga'a agreement had been ratified by 70% of the Nisga'a people. 
It hit the headlines and was carried right across Canada on CBC, 
CTV, et cetera.  The next day we were told no, that was not an 
accurate figure, it was really 51%. I submit there is quite a 
difference between 70% and 51%.  Again three or four days after 
that we were told that no, the final tally was actually 61%. That 
is supposed to be the final number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had three different results on one referendum involving 
2,000 people.  It is a little difficult to accept the veracity of 
those results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was concerned about this matter.  I started getting calls from 
some Nisga'a people who were not in support of the treaty and who 
felt that this referendum had some irregularities to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I phoned the department of Indian affairs in Vancouver and asked 
who oversaw the election.  They told me that the Nisga'a tribal 
council, the very people who had negotiated the agreement, were 
actually in charge of the referendum. If anybody across the way 
wants to submit to me that that is a fair process, I would like 
them to argue that out in public because I do not think the 
Canadian people would buy that for a minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found out that the department actually had only one observer 
to cover seven polling stations:  four in the Nass valley, one in 
Prince Rupert, one in Vancouver and one in Terrace. There was one 
observer for all seven polls over a period of two days.  No one 
can possibly persuade me or the Nisga'a people who are not in 
support of this treaty that that was a responsible way to oversee 
this referendum and to give assurances that the results are fair 
and accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people further made allegations that financial inducements 
were offered.  Again these are allegations and I have not seen 
the hard proof, but I am told by Nisga'a people who live in the 
Nass valley that they have seen it for themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I will say is that there was not something like Elections 
Canada, some disengaged third party that is responsible for 
overseeing the vote and doing a proper enumeration, making sure 
that people who have not been enumerated and who claim to have 
the right to vote are given a fair opportunity to state their 
case and cast a ballot with a provision that they would have to 
have their credentials checked.  I do not have a problem with the 
way Elections Canada does it and I do not think Canadians do 
either.  It could be done the same way in the Nass valley for the 
Nisga'a people or with the Norway House band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it difficult to understand how the Nisga'a government can 
say that 61% of its people supported this treaty in a referendum 
when slightly more than 2,000 people voted and it is a band with 
over 5,000 members. I did not get top marks in math at school but 
my math is a little better than that.  I do not understand how 
the Nisga'a tribal council, or the Liberals for that matter 
because they are totally in support of this, could have us 
believe that this represents 61% of the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we can get on with debating the merits of the bill, and I 
am not saying there are not some, we have to have a very clear 
and complete picture of what the level of support is.  I am 
concerned most that the people in the department of Indian 
affairs are aware of these allegations and may possibly be 
turning a blind eye because they have a vested interest in seeing 
these agreements supported and that they go through.  I would 
never suggest that they would be actively involved but they may 
be turning a blind eye to irregularities and downplaying 
irregularities and just doing what they think is the bare minimum 
to get these things passed rather than seeing that the right 
thing is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should show us the irrefutable evidence that this 
was a fair, open and honest referendum, free of influence or 
collusion and free of inducements so that it can come to the 
House and tell us that it was the will of the majority when it 
comes to Norway House. I submit there is no way the government 
can do that.  There is no way the government can come to 
parliament, come before the Canadian people, and say that this 
was a fair, open and honest referendum and that nothing 
disreputable or in any way reprehensible was done or engaged in. 
Until the government can do that, we do not have anything to 
debate in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly continue to hear from people from Norway House who 
are beside themselves.  They consider this is being rammed down 
their throats, that it was undemocratic, was not a proper process 
to follow and that they will have to live it.  They will be stuck 
with it and their children will be stuck with it. They do not 
accept that the referendum was in any way fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government to lay before us the irrefutable 
proof, if it has it and I know it does not, that this was a fair 
process, that it was overseen by Elections Canada or some 
independent third party, that there were observers, scrutineers, 
and that there was no undue influence being exerted at the polls 
by anybody and that what we have is a fair reflection of the will 
of the people of Norway House.  I am told that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say with authority that the allegations are true. What 
I can say is that in the absence of a process that guarantees a 
fair result, the Liberals across the way are just blowing hot air 
if they try to tell parliament and the Canadian people that this 
agreement was supported by the band members of Norway House.  I 
do not think they have any solid evidence to support that at all.

Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is looking for “irrefutable evidence” that 
fraud of some sort did not take place.  We have heard this talk 
all day.  We have heard it on many bills, on C-49.  The member 
again raises Nisga'a.  I am confused at this because each one of 
the members has said that they support C-56 but spend 10 or 20 
minutes of their precious time in the House pouring vinegar and 
ashes all over the deal.  I want to know whether they support it 
or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read something into the record for the member. I 
wish that he would do his homework before he speaks to these 
kinds of matters suggesting, and I say this respectfully, that 
there was some improper tampering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 25, the federal court, trial division dismissed a 
motion that was brought forward by some band members.  They had a 
right to bring these motions forward with respect to the second 
vote that took place on the Norway House agreement.  On this 
basis the court found “that nothing improper or illegal had 
occurred in holding the second referendum for the ratification of 
the master”.  The federal court has ruled on this matter.  It 
was open to the people to challenge it, as they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member had read the facts on this and investigated 
that side of the case, he probably would not have risen in the 
House and made those kinds of allegations and suggestions.  This 
has been through a proper court of jurisdiction which found that 
nothing occurred that was wrong, improper or illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think if my friend were to 
look at what the court actually considered and decided, it was 
whether or not it was improper to conduct a second referendum. 
That was the issue.  The court did not go into any of the 
allegations regarding process or perversion of process that were 
made by some band members simply because the court did not have 
the jurisdiction to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In turning to whether it was legal or proper for a second 
referendum to be conducted, I suppose we have seen cases where 
governments that disagree with a popular vote in a referendum, 
not only in Canada but in other jurisdictions, continue to bring 
the same question back to the people until such time as they get 
the answer they want.  Whether that is illegal is one question. 
Whether it is moral is quite another question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think if the parliamentary secretary checks his facts, he will 
find out that that was the only issue the court was ruling on. It 
was not going into the allegations of vote buying or any of the 
other concerns that were raised with regard to irregularities in 
the referendum process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do apologize in advance if this has already been 
discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Reform Party indicates there were many 
allegations of concern with the vote process that was going on. I 
am wondering if he has received any written confirmation of those 
allegations.  If he has, has he forwarded those allegations on to 
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes to both. I 
have received a substantial amount of written documentation and 
allegations from band members.  They have been forwarded to the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns people have in these communities is that 
once they stick their heads up, they are liable to get shot at. 
They are concerned about that.  They have to live in these 
communities.  These are small communities and oftentimes the 
people with whom they are in disagreement in their own 
communities could be friends or relatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my colleague would understand that unless band members 
give me specific instructions or specific agreement to distribute 
the information that I receive, I do not do it in a public 
nature.  I feel that I have to respect that confidentiality.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to make a comment in 
support of the bill that is before us at this time.  It is my 
hope that the bill will not only pass but will pass unanimously. 
We have a long history of trying to resolve our issues and claims 
with the aboriginal people.  It is one of the blemishes which I 
believe the bill will help to eradicate or erase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must act in good faith, sit down, negotiate and end up with 
an agreement that is supported, although we know negotiated 
agreements never have 100% support and approval.  I understand 
the view of the member opposite that he should be the voice for 
those who are the malcontents.  I doubt they would ever be 
satisfied with anything brought forward in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a time for us to set aside partisan attitudes.  It is 
time for Canada to move forward and treat aboriginal people with 
the kind of respect this claim settlement will achieve.  We can 
then move on proudly to a new era of Canadian history.  I hope he 
will join the government in this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the wonders of Liberal spin 
never cease.  Because we stand to voice the concerns of 
grassroots people who come to us asking for our help, the member 
across the way tries to turn that around and say that somehow we 
are against aboriginal people or that we are trying to set 
ourselves up in some kind of partisan way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is completely irrelevant to the debate we are having.  How 
can we have informed debate in the House when members opposite 
make those kinds of comments?  It is beyond me altogether. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened intently to my colleague from Skeena in this debate.  He 
raised the very important issue of making sure elections are 
conducted in a proper and fair manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian people have a proud tradition of fair elections in our 
democratic process to elect members of parliament, members of 
legislatures and members of councils across Canada.  We also 
travel to other countries throughout the world, countries such as 
the newly emerging democracies of eastern Europe and third world 
countries, to help them in the democratic process and to try to 
guarantee some kind of fair process.  At the same time we see 
that the Canada elections process is not applied to things like 
the Canadian Wheat Board ballots or in areas like the land claims 
my colleague has spoken about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it not seem contradictory to be going around the world 
telling people how to conduct elections when we are not doing it 
fairly at home? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent 
question.  We send observers all over the world, most recently to 
observe an election in Chiapas, Mexico.  In some cases we do not 
follow these rules within our own borders. That is reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a member of a municipality.  I have voted in 
municipal elections.  I have voted in provincial elections.  I 
have voted and participated in federal elections.  Otherwise I 
would not be here.  I have never had anybody in any municipal, 
provincial or federal election I have been involved in as a 
voter, observer or participant ever question the results at the 
end of the night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1993 election an Edmonton riding was decided on as little 
as four or five votes.  At the end of a judicial recount 
everybody went away satisfied that it was an expression of 
democracy.  Why can most Canadians have that sense of confidence 
but as far as members across the way are concerned people living 
on reserves do not have to abide by the same standards? 
I do not understand.  The people who live on those reserves want 
to have the same sense of fairness, justice and confidence in 
their systems as we have in ours.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-35, in Clause 15, be amended by 
adding after line 21 on page 10 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(3.1) In determining whether the complaint is properly 
documented, the Deputy Minister shall not take into account 
representations received from parties other than the 
complainant.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to 
Bill C-35, An Act to amend the Special Import Measures Act and 
the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Bloc Quebecois members have already indicated, we support 
this bill. 
However, since we have some reservations about certain aspects 
of this bill, we are proposing today in this House a number of 
motions in amendment to try to improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These motions result from a study of the Special Import Measures 
Act done by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade and by the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interventions of Bloc Quebecois members during this study 
have already led to a few important changes and substantial 
improvements.  We suggested, for example, concrete measures 
allowing small and medium size producers in Quebec and Canada to 
have fair and equitable access to the redress procedures 
provided by the current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also proposed improvements to the way the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also proposed that the cumulative effect be 
taken into consideration by the tribunal when assessing damages. 
Furthermore, the amendment of section 76 of the Special Import 
Measures Act, requiring the Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal to assess the cumulative injurious effects of dumping 
or subsidizing in the context of interim reviews was 
consolidated as the result of our interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore present to you the motions that we disagree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, Motion No. 1, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-35, in clause 15, be amended by adding after line 21 
on page 10 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(3.1) In determining whether the complaint is properly 
documented, the Deputy Minister shall not take into account 
representations received from parties other than the 
complainant”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of witnesses expressed concerns during committee 
deliberations. 
The Bloc Quebecois shares the concerns of these witnesses, which 
include the Canadian Steel Producers Association.  It is asking 
Revenue Canada to ignore the spontaneous presentations of 
parties other than the complainant before the start of an 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this measure, Revenue Canada would take into consideration 
only the information of the complainant and would not therefore 
be obliged to take unsolicited observations into account.  This 
measure seems reasonable, since it would apply only in the 
period preceding the initiation of an investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government does not seem concerned about our 
requests or those of an industry of such importance to the 
Quebec and Canadian economies as the steel industry.  It 
therefore rejected this proposal, which does not appear in the 
wording of the current bill.  This is why we propose Motion 
No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Churchill, Aboriginal Affairs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to participate in the debate on Bill C-35 at report stage. 
This has to do with Canada's Special Import Measures Act and the 
legislation that would represent.  Essentially it is countervail 
and dumping duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a perfect world I do not think we would require either of 
these, but as we know it is never quite perfect.  I think we 
simply have to keep this kind of legislation at our disposal if 
we need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the advent of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and then 
the expansion into NAFTA many integrated industries have 
developed.  The auto pact was one that developed prior to the 
free trade agreement but there are others now. 
The steel industry has become quite an integrated industry in 
North America.  I am thinking of the cattle industry where there 
are two way flows of product.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many of our industries there really is no dumping in the true 
sense. There is movement across the Canada-U.S. border every day 
with trucks bringing in products.  But there are other countries 
that dump into Canada.  In some cases it is shiploads of steel 
and other types of products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we want to keep this legislation at our disposal.  There 
has been an important development in recognition of a public 
interest component in Bill C-35 to be discussed today as well.  I 
welcome that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to look at public interest especially where 
Canadian industry sometimes is in a shortage situation for a 
period of time when Canadian suppliers cannot supply products and 
Canadian importers need to purchase on a short term basis in 
order to fill their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the public interest section as well I think we have to look 
at where Canadian producers are inefficient and do not supply 
much of the market. Perhaps dumping is not such a big problem 
because the Canadian public consumer can benefit a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular I want to deal with Motion No. 1 which we are 
discussing today. If a Canadian industry or company decides it is 
being harmed by a dumping action, the process starts by filing a 
complaint.  If it can document and prove its case there is a 
process that kicks into gear to determine whether there is injury 
as a result of that and whether there need to be duties applied 
to stop that dumping process. At the end of that process the 
public interest hearings could kick in if there is a requirement 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the case being made today is that only the complainant 
should provide the documentation material and the appropriate 
government department would consider whether it is adequate 
documentation.  No third party should be able to interfere in 
that process.  The Reform Party agrees with the motion being 
proposed by the Bloc to correct this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am speaking on behalf of our critic for international 
trade, the member for Winnipeg—Transcona, on Bill C-35, an act 
to amend the Special Import Measures Act, SIMA, and the Canadian 
Trade Tribunal Act, CTTA. Unfortunately my colleague is ill but 
he has asked me to speak on his behalf and I am quite honoured 
and proud to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to Motion No. 1, I wish to advise the House that 
we are in support of the Bloc's motion and to provide the 
position of the New Democratic Party on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We opposed the bill at second reading on September 25 due to the 
fact that in our opinion it may well weaken our anti-dumping 
system, in particular as it compares to our major trading 
partner, the U.S., the lesser duty provisions being the chief 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has repeatedly stuck its neck out and been hurt in its 
headlong embrace of trade liberalization measures i.e., support 
for our farmers, FDA, NAFTA, and the World Trade Organization. It 
is our belief this is not the time to do so again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we have been hearing in the media concerns about 
agriculture and why we find it so difficult to support our 
farmers in terms of any kind of subsidy because of what it may do 
to countervailing duties from the United States or other nations 
we currently trade with. I find that appalling and I am sure 
farmers in Canada would find that appalling as well, to know 
their government would be hesitant to help them because of the 
reaction from other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that is the last thing on farmers' minds as they see 
animals being shot because they cannot be looked after or the 
fact that we have grain and seed rotting away because there are 
no storage facilities.  Farmers are leaving their farms in droves 
as our fishing people have done in our coastal communities as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a party that opposed the MAI which is an extended 
version, we believe, of the NAFTA arrangement. Some European 
nations recently have denied the MAI's going further. 
Unfortunately the MAI is stalled at the present time. 
We would like to drive a stake through its heart because of the 
fact that it was modelled on the NAFTA. European nations are 
saying quite publicly who in God's green acres would sign the 
NAFTA deal.  Canada puts up its hand and says we did.  They found 
a lot of problems with it.  We in the New Democratic Party and 
our partners throughout the country have found a lot of problems

Speaker, because a twist in parliamentary procedure has my 
colleague from the NPD supporting a motion put forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois while opposing the bill. Or else this is an 
aspect of the NDP philosophy that escapes me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is clear: we are in favour of Bill C-35. I do not 
want to get into a long speech on this bill. As you know, we 
support any legislation that will provide better safeguards for 
Canadian industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are currently debating Motion No. 1, dealing with the 
possibility of initiating an investigation. 
When a complaint is received, it must be determined whether the 
information may be shared or not, for the purpose of 
establishing the validity of the complaint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a risk in checking, as the Bloc Quebecois pointed out 
in committee; it can alert competitors across the country and 
abroad. The Bloc Quebecois tried on several occasions to 
convince the committee to approve this recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have concerns. In the various laws and regulations 
governing the antidumping tribunal, there are two provisions 
outlining a number of safeguards designed to ensure that 
complaints will not be discussed too openly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have strong reservations about this. From the reports, I 
gather that the hon. member for Repentigny approved clause 15, 
albeit with dissent on this recommendation. I am not sure that 
this change will improve Bill C-35. 
We may be taking something away from the tribunal or the 
government to allow an investigation to go further. Still, the 
complainant would be protected under two provisions contained in 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get in touch with my colleague from Repentigny. We tried 
to reach him today, but unfortunately he too is very busy. For

Motion No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO requires that countries avoid publicizing the receipt of 
complaints until an investigation is actually launched.  As well 
when we look at what Canadian industry actually does, it also 
does not publicize its complaint.  From that perspective one can 
generally avoid third party submissions. In effect it is the 
industry that in some sense controls whether third party 
submissions actually appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada considers relevant third party submissions that 
it may receive consistent with its WTO obligations.  That is 
quite explicit in the anti-dumping and subsidy agreements. It is 
required to examine the accuracy and adequacy of information that 
may be contained in a complaint prior to initiating an 
investigation.  By following this process it can 
be advantageous in some respects to the complainants who can 
actually rectify any possible deficiency that one may have in the 
actual complaint they are putting forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department does not solicit such third party submissions 
before the initiation of the investigation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-35 be amended by deleting Clause 27. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois considers that Bill 
C-35 should not contain provision for the minimum duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it is premature to include the concept of a minimum 
duty in the Special Import Measures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the government should stop approving policies that 
reduce the protection afforded Quebec and Canadian businesses 
when our main trading partners are not doing the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade recommends including the concept of a minimum duty in 
section 45 of the legislation on public interest.  However, 
clause 27 of the bill incorporates the concept of a minimum duty 
by amending section 45 of the existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal may, on its own 
initiative, or on request, initiate a public interest inquiry if 
it is of the opinion that the imposition of an anti-dumping or 
countervailing duty, or the imposition of such a duty in the 
full amount provided for by any of those sections, in respect of 
the goods would not or might not be in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of a public interest inquiry, if the tribunal is of 
the opinion that the imposition of a duty might not be in the 
public interest, the tribunal shall without delay do two things. 
First, it shall report to the Minister of Finance that it is of 
that opinion and provide that minister with a statement of the 
facts and, second, it shall cause notice of the report to be 
published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in that same report, the tribunal shall specify 
either a level of reduction in the anti-dumping or countervailing 
duty provided for, or a price or prices that are adequate to 
eliminate injury, retardation or the threat of injury to the 
domestic industry. 
It is through this last measure that the concept of minimum duty 
is introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are moving Motion No. 2 to have clause 27, which 
introduces this concept of minimum duty, deleted.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say from the outset that Reform is opposed to this clause 
largely because it contains the public interest portion in the 
SIMA legislation that is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are cases before the panel right now that have to do with 
public interest perhaps not being served by duties that were 
applied to baby food supposedly being dumped into Canada.  The 
result of those duties essentially has made one company into a 
monopoly supplier of baby food.  We think it is important to have 
competition.  Therefore, we need the public interest section and 
the lesser duty aspect of it in order to maintain competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the lesser duty itself, the question is, why would 
we want a duty above and beyond what is required to actually stop 
the flow of goods when they are being dumped? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding in some cases is that duties as high as 40% are 
being applied when it would only take 5% to stop the product from 
coming in.  Therefore, we think the lesser duty idea is a good 
improvement and we would like to see the public interest portion 
of this bill actually reviewed after a few years to see if it is 
serving Canadian consumers to the extent that it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A joint committee of finance and foreign affairs and 
international trade reviewed the SIMA legislation.  They received 
a number of representations from companies that asked for a 
lesser duty.  This change is a result of those representations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While overall we are supportive of Bill C-35 and the need for 
some kind of rules regarding countervail and dumping, in this 
case the public interest component is a very important component 
and we would not want to lose it.  Therefore, we will not support 
Motion No. 2. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the consideration of the public 
interest was a key issue, as my hon. colleague mentioned, in the 
parliamentary review of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 27 essentially gives effect to the parliamentary 
subcommittee's recommendations which the hon. member mentioned. 
It gives effect, in a sense, to clarify and improve the public 
interest provisions that are presently in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, clause 27 is really a key component of the bill. 
It is really integral to the overall balance sought by the 
subcommittee.  The balance is struck by the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, among those Canadian industries that seek 
protection under this act and certainly other Canadian 
stakeholders that may be adversely affected by the application of 
duties are organizations like the steel producers and, if someone 
looks downstream, the auto parts manufacturers as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is really interested in ensuring that the 
interests of those who may be seriously affected by the 
application of SIMA duties are properly taken into account in our 
trade remedy system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  That is a really good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  I tend to agree.  I thank the hon. 
member for that intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure this is one of the few instances in which we agree 
with my colleague's previous statements, that in fact the public 
interest is a key component. We certainly would not want to in 
any way diminish that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that by going with the clause which exists in the bill 
we strike that balance.  It is very important to reiterate that 
the balance is struck between the industries and the 
stakeholders.  That is a great improvement to this act and 
something which we will look forward to supporting when it comes 
to a vote in the House.

Although I certainly sympathize with my colleague from the Bloc 
that the French part on material harm does not translate and 
therefore needs some clarification, material harm in English has 
a very precise meaning in law.  It is a stand-alone section.  It 
does not need to be defined any further.  Instead of material 
harm, it would now mean that material harm means more than harm 
that is negligible, immaterial or trifling.  It becomes almost 
silly in English.

the definition of material harm as it pertains to the disclosure

</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed by the member for LaSalle—Émard seems 
somewhat vague. Replacing the term “dommage sensible” by 
“dommage important” in the French version does not add anything 
constructive to the notion of harm itself. The new adjective 
used to describe the kind of harm is not defined, and we would 
like the member for LaSalle—Émard to give us some clarification 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also propose, in case our motion is defeated, that the

means.

United States whereas a similar case was judged differently in 
Canada. In fact, there was no conviction. That is why we want 
some clarification on this definition so we do not end up with a 
double standard.

assessment in cases where there will likely be sufficient 
fluctuation in prices or costs.  In such cases Revenue Canada 
could require cash deposits on incoming goods with the final 
liability to be determined on review.  The reason is that the 
U.S. employs this system for all cases, giving it a tougher 
overall regime on anti-dumping. It is not unreasonable to allow 
Revenue Canada similar powers which could be used in the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to present Bill C-382 to the House today as it 
attempts to bring democratic reform to the upper house of 
parliament or our Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my bill is to ensure that if a province has a law 
providing for the expression of the opinion of the electors on 
who should be summoned to the Senate to fill a vacancy, no person 
shall be summoned to fill the vacancy unless the electors opinion 
has been sought and the results transmitted to the Privy Council, 
or unless a year has passed since the vacancy was published in 
<I>The Canada Gazette</I>.  To break down the legalise, basically 
my bill allows for elected senators over appointed senators.  Our 
current system is to appoint them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This can be done without constitutional change.  Time and again 
the government has said it cannot be done, that it requires 
constitutional amendment.  My bill on the election of senators 
does not require any change to our current Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was shown in Alberta in 1989 when Stan Waters was elected 
and appointed to the Senate by then Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney.  I make it very clear to the House and to people 
watching that this does not require any constitutional change. 
The confusion comes when we want to change the numbers of 
senators that represent provinces.  That does require 
constitutional change, but to elect our senators does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister would simply be required to respect the 
wishes of the voters of any province with a senatorial selection 
act.  Two provinces to date have senatorial selection acts, B.C. 
and Alberta.  Alberta has chosen to use its act on two occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first senator, Stan Waters, was appointed to the Senate 
without constitutional change.  In 1989 hundreds of thousands of 
Albertans voted for the first democratically chosen senator in 
Canadian history.  This was an historic first in Canada and 
clearly demonstrated how easily democratic change can be done 
without changing the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill is significant.  Electing senators has been an issue 
that has been around as long as the House.  It has been debated 
over and over again and tossed back and forth.  It needs to be 
resolved, the key point being that Canadians do not want a 
government by appointment.  They want to have a say.  A senate 
going back to the last century and the thinking of the last 
century no longer works.  The world is moving ahead.  Canada is 
dragging behind.  It is time we caught up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally our Senate was meant to represent the regions.  A 
senator from B.C. would represent B.C.  A senator from Ontario 
would represent Ontario.  A senator from Quebec would represent 
Quebec.  However, as it now stands, the Senate provides little 
more than political representation for the party in power.  It is 
absolutely essential that we remove patronage appointments from 
the Prime Minister's hands and put them into the hands of the 
people.  That is what my bill would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month Canadians witnessed a Senate election in Alberta. 
There are now two senators in waiting.  The final results of that 
election on October 19 last were Bert Brown with approximately 
332,000 votes, Ted Morton with approximately 261,000, Guy 
Desrosiers with approximately 147,000 votes; and Vance Gough with 
approximately 131,000 votes.  Nearly a million votes is a 
significant number.  There were a million Albertan votes for an 
elected Senate.  Both Bert Brown and Ted Morton broke Stan 
Waters' record of 256,000 votes, which at that time was the 
largest number of votes ever received by any elected member in 
the history of Canada. These two senators beat that record.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly it is time for the government to acknowledge the 
democratic rights of Canadians and agree to appoint these elected 
senators to the Senate when vacancies arise.  As it now stands it 
is simply undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are governed by both houses of parliament, the Commons 
that we are in today and the Senate which is the other house of 
parliament.  In theory both houses have almost equal powers. 
Senators have powers similar to those of elected MPs.  They can 
write laws, vote on important motions and bills, sit on 
parliamentary committees and perform other government functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet most significant is the fact that senators can approve or 
veto legislation that comes from the lower house.  Any bill 
passed by the elected members of this House must also pass the 
Senate to become law.  It is completely unacceptable that this 
powerful part of our government is run by political appointees, 
not by elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senators must be held accountable.  Yet there is absolutely no 
accountability in the upper chamber and this must change. 
Canadians expect and deserve accountability in their public 
institutions, and the Senate is lagging far behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate is exempt from any accountability to the people. This 
was painfully demonstrated last year with the actions of former 
Senator Andrew Thompson.  Thompson demonstrated and showed that 
once appointed senators do not have to answer to anyone including 
the prime minister.  Once senators are appointed and are in 
place, if they so choose they are there until age 75.  If 
Canadians are to obtain an effective upper house we must give the 
Senate a democratic mandate similar to what we have today in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, Senate elections can be done easily.  They do 
not require a constitutional amendment.  Many changes to our 
country's government require complex constitutional changes but 
the Senate elections, as we have already seen clearly 
demonstrated in Alberta with Stan Waters, show that it can be 
easily done and without major change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is that many people say that it will cost too 
much.  Both the elections of Stan Waters and of the senators last 
month were done during municipal elections.  The cost is not 
great.  In fact it is quite minimal because people are already 
going to the polls in municipal elections.  It simply means 
printing another ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are impatient with this issue and with the government 
of the day that has failed to change this system.  The national 
Angus Reid poll conducted last April shows that the public is now 
divided between reforming the upper house and abolishing it 
entirely.  Very few Canadians want to leave the Senate as it is. 
There are three options:  leave the Senate as it is, which very 
few Canadians want; reform the Senate; or abolish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A poll taken last May shows that Manitobans overwhelmingly want 
the province's next senator to be elected, not appointed. This 
survey found that 86% of Manitobans believe that the people, not 
the prime minister, should fill vacancies in the upper house. 
Only 7% were in favour of having the prime minister appoint 
senators and 7% were undecided.  In a similar poll in B.C., 84% 
of the residents want to elect their senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are two separate and independent polls, one in Manitoba and 
one in British Columbia with 86% in Manitoba and 84% in British 
Columbia saying they want their senators elected.  This is not a 
wishy-washy issue.  As demonstrated by the polls and by Canadians 
they want this to happen.  Senators such as Senator Gerry St. 
Germain have acknowledged an elected Senate would be more 
democratic.  He said that it was realistic to hope this would be 
achieved one day. 
Clearly an elected Senate would be far more representative, 
responsible and democratic than what we have today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me list the record because to date the current Prime 
Minister has made more patronage appointments to the Senate than 
his predecessor, Brian Mulroney.  This is the same Prime Minister 
who severely criticized the past prime minister for his patronage 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Prime Minister has riddled the Senate with political 
patronage appointments, including eight former Liberal members of 
parliament which include four former Liberal cabinet ministers; a 
former Manitoba Liberal leader and long time ally of the Prime 
Minister; a former Alberta Liberal leader; a former P.E.I Liberal 
leader; a former deputy premier of Quebec; a former candidate for 
Liberal leader in New Brunswick who managed the Prime Minister's 
leadership campaign in 1990; a failed provincial Liberal 
candidate and loyal Liberal worker; a former Liberal riding 
president and Liberal Party worker;  a prominent B.C. Liberal 
organizer, golfing and business buddy of the Prime Minister; a 
Quebec Liberal organizer; the wife of the son of former Liberal 
Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson; and the list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we have a Senate that is unbiased when the Prime 
Minister loads it up with Liberals who rubber stamp legislation? 
This was done in reverse with the former government.  They loaded 
it up with Conservatives.  This simply does not serve the 
interest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To whom are senators accountable?  Originally they were supposed 
to be accountable to the provinces, accountable to the regions. 
However, because of the political appointment system, they are 
accountable only to the political party that appoints them.  That 
is absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent changes to the House of Lords in Britain demonstrate 
democratic reform is long overdue.  This week Queen Elizabeth 
removed the hereditary voting privileges of the House of Lords. 
This was historic, democratic reform.  What remains to be seen in 
Britain is if the election of senators will now become a reality, 
or whether they would unfortunately go into our system of 
appointment.  It is time to bring democracy to Canada's upper 
house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as members of parliament answer to our constituents.  When we 
do well, as we all hope to do, we go back to the polls and 
hopefully get re-elected.  If we do not do well, we are thrown 
out as we should be.  This is the system that occurs not only in 
lower houses but in upper houses in many parts of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not have our senators elected and answerable to the 
provinces and the constituents that sent them there so that they 
are accountable to the people who sent them there instead of 
accountable to the political party that appointed them?  This is 
the real wrong in our Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people are becoming jaded because they have a Senate they 
feel simply does not work.  We get wrangling and haranguing, no 
change.  In my view as a politician this is why many of us are 
held in low esteem.  We simply do not have an upper house that is 
accountable to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the 1993 election the Prime Minister proposed an elected 
Senate when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform of the Senate is extremely important.  I believe in it. We 
must look for a division of powers that best serves the interests 
of the people, all the Canadian people. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister also said in the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To meet the hopes and dreams of those who live in the west and 
the Atlantic, a reformed Senate is essential.  It must be a 
Senate that is elected, effective and equitable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is long overdue for the Prime Minister to give Canadians what 
he promised, an elected Senate.  It is my hope that my bill will 
give the Prime Minister the prod that is required to allow him to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise tonight to speak on this issue.  It is an issue 
that I have thought long and hard about during the 10 years that 
I have been elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put the remarks I want to make tonight in context, I am 
reminded of a poster that a friend of mine has on the wall of his 
office.  It says for every complex problem there is a simple 
answer and it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem I have with this bill. Reform of the Senate 
is a very important issue. It is one that members on this side of 
the House have been wrestling with for decades.  It is one that 
the Senate has wrestled with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really find it very difficult when I see Senators depicted in 
the way the Reform Party chooses to depict them.  I am not 
certain what cause is advanced by slandering honest, hardworking 
Canadians who choose to serve their country.  I do not understand 
how that furthers the cause of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of very talented Canadians who work in the other 
place.  They do good work on behalf of the country and they want 
reform.  When hon. members read the joint Senate reports of 1984, 
1987, 1992, Senators were calling for reform of the Senate, 
calling for election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a little confusing in the Reform's approach to this is 
that the very election cited, the appointment of Stan Waters to 
the Senate by former Prime Minister Mulroney, was done out of 
respect for section 4 of the Meech Lake accord which called for a 
process of appointment upon the recommendation of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the example the Reform Party would put forward of how 
this should work.  It was an example that was part of Meech Lake 
and yet, as I recall, it was the Reform Party that campaigned 
against Meech Lake and fought for its demise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> And the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  I as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 with the Charlottetown Accord we moved to a point in 
this discussion that we have never been able to get to before. We 
actually had a proposal for a triple E Senate.  We actually had 
the agreement of all the provinces that the Senate would be 
equal, 6-6-6; 62 members.  We made provisions for aboriginal 
representation.  It was something that I think many people who 
are seized with this issue would never believe we would get to, 
but we got there.  What did the Reform Party do?  The Reform 
Party had a proposal for an equal, effective and democratically 
elected Senate.  It opposed it.  It fought against it.  In the 
end it was voted down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Meech Lake accord failed, so the process that was used under 
that failed along with it.  It was rejected.  I supported the 
Charlottetown accord for those very principles.  I think a triple 
E Senate is a very good thing, particularly for western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are into this debate that sort of capitalizes on people's 
desire to make fun of the Senate or to continue to denigrate a 
group of people who I think do marvellous work on behalf of 
Canada and put forward what they say is an important improvement. 
I am astounded, frankly, that the Reform Party would support 
this bill or even think of proposing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two provinces the Reform Party is most populous in, Alberta 
and British Columbia, represent 23% of the population. They have 
11.5% of the Senate seats.  The Reform Party is proposing that we 
enshrine that, that we give that inequality legitimacy.  I do not 
understand why it would want to make legitimate a process that 
contains a real inequality for the west. 
There seems to be no particular advantage to be gained from that. 
It is true that the Senate needs reform but if we want to have a 
democracy, a democratically elected Senate, the member himself 
said part of the functioning of a democracy is at the end of the 
term that we are elected for we go back and stand in front of the 
people again and ask for a renewed mandate. A one time election 
of a senator into a position until he or she is 75 does not allow 
for any ability to go back in front of the people.  On the issue 
of how the rest of the Senate functions, we have a few who are 
elected democratically and a few who are living out their terms 
in the Senate.  How does this lead to a competent, functioning, 
well organized approach to improving democracy?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the goal.  The goal is laudable. But the approach 
taken by the Reform Party to produce a reform of the Senate is 
simply too glib and I think somewhat misses the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want a Senate that gives true balance to the 
disproportional rep by pop that we have in this House, one that 
becomes a true house for the regions or the provinces, which I 
would like to see it become, surely we need to reform the entire 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too complex an organization to play around with one little 
item, to change one or two facets of it.  We need to sit down and 
reform the Senate.  We need to do it in the way we have been 
trying to solve all the problems we face right now, piece by 
piece, looking at the problem, coming together with the 
provinces, with our partners, having the discussions, arriving at 
a consensus and acting on that consensus.  That is the way we 
will get to true constitutional change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way, working through and carefully solving problems 
one at a time, we have managed to get from the very difficult 
financial circumstances we were in when we came to government in 
1993 to today.  That is a process I hope all members would 
support. But to jump into this debate to change one small facet 
of this I suspect makes the problem worse, not better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the member in his desire to continue this debate on 
the reform of the Senate.  I certainly will be among members of 
the House who will spend a lot of time and energy attempting to 
produce a more effective parliament for Canadians.  But I cannot 
support this particular approach.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my turn 
to speak on this bill introduced by a member of the Reform Party 
on the method of appointing senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must confess that I have not spent hundreds of hours preparing 
for such a debate and my constituents will surely forgive me, 
because many in Quebec believe the Senate to be an obsolete 
institution they could quite happily do without. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion, any change to the way senators are appointed, or 
any other Senate reform, will meet with considerable skepticism 
among Quebec voters, who attach little importance to this 
institution, and most certainly have no emotional attachment to 
it. 
I understand that attitude, and fully share it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether rightly or wrongly, people often express much cynicism, 
and skepticism about the role of elected representatives, and 
politics in general, and generally discredit it.  Seeing an 
institution like the Senate, I believe people's considerable 
cynicism is justified.  It is an eloquent example of how 
outdated and obsolete some institutions are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at it from the ordinary citizen's point of view, one may 
well wonder what use the Senate serves, period.  What concrete 
or useful effect has it had on our lives?  And you could go as far 
back as the day of your birth, Mr. Speaker.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are serious reservations about the fact that we spend 
close to $50 million per year on such an institution. That is a 
lot of money. Fifty million dollars is a lot of taxpayers' money 
which, year in and year out, is wasted on an institution to 
which friends of the Prime Minister are appointed. Whether it is 
the Grits or the Tories, the party in office appoints its 
friends to the Senate, as a reward or to crown a career of one 
kind or another. It is not necessarily needy people who are 
appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, I can understand why some, who want that institution to 
be effective and play a specific role, would like to change the 
appointment process. I can understand that. 
If indeed we must have a Senate, people should wonder about the 
appointment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When decisions are made in a democratic system, there must be a 
minimum of accountability. What is being proposed is to allow 
the provinces, and ultimately the public, to decide who will 
represent them in that institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not in any way change my firm belief regarding the 
role of that institution. The proposed system would at least 
have the merit of being much more respectful of the public. But 
of course, we should first ask the public if it wants a Senate 
or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer I travelled outside Quebec and I realized that many 
people, particularly in British Columbia, share my opinion that 
the Senate should be abolished. In Alberta, there is a very 
strong movement in favour of a new appointment process. 
Elsewhere, people are less concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the issue is basically settled. In my own riding, 
during the previous parliament, we had a petition circulated in 
convenience stores and other locations. In just a few weeks, 
close to 8,000 people signed that petition to abolish the 
Senate. Some even asked me where they could sign that petition. 
We had limited time to circulate the petition, but we still got 
8,000 signatures. This is a lot in a riding like mine or, for 
that matter, in any riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the Senate, we immediately realize that it is 
a sensitive issue with the public. People say we are wasting 
money for no good reason. They are absolutely right, 
particularly in the current context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is never any excuse for wasting money.  But when people 
are asked to tighten their belts, when they see the federal 
government reducing provincial transfer payments, in the health 
sector, for example—payments to Quebec were cut by several 
billion dollars in recent years—and at the same time $50 million 
is squandered on the Senate, people do not think their tax 
dollars are being put to good use, and they are right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It costs $50 million a year.  Think about it.  Over the last 20 
years, that adds up to $1 billion.  Since the government did not 
have that money, because it was spending more than it was taking 
in, it borrowed $1 billion over the last 20 years to pay for 
this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anyone in the House who will tell me this makes sense? 
How could we get rid of the Senate? 
Of course, those who want another Senate, or another 
institution, could hold a debate, but I think the first thing 
would be to get rid of it.  Then, those who want such a body or 
who want another level of political intervention, a level of 
wise individuals overseeing the government, could hold a debate. 
In the meantime, we would at least not be throwing $50 million 
down the drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing to do would be to hold a vote in parliament, but also 
in each of the provincial legislatures.  I am sure this would 
meet with widespread approval.  Ultimately, and this is where 
the problem arises, the senators themselves would have to vote. 
One wonders how willing they would be to vote themselves out of 
a job when they have such a comfortable arrangement.  They are 
hardly killing themselves working.  There is not a lot to do. 
They have no duties in the various territories they represent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The senators have an assigned designation, except the last eight 
appointed by the Conservative government, which ran into some 
deadline problems with senators blocking the GST.  So eight new 
senators were added.  The Prime Minister can add positions in 
the Senate as he likes.  There is a problem there too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other senators have designations.  Are there people among 
our audience who recall having seen their senator?  Do they even 
know who their senator is?  I assume not.  Certainly, had they 
been elected, people would recognize them and know them better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I am really not in favour of electing these 
people for, once elected, will claim that legitimately they 
should have more of a say in managing things. We will end up 
with—and here I return to my role as a voter in any one of the 
provinces—a municipal, a provincial, a federal and, on top of 
it all, a senatorial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point accountability gets a bit thin.  We are familiar 
with the federal government's knack of meddling in jurisdictions 
not its own—a very strong tendency here in Ottawa.  There is 
nothing to indicate that things will be any different in an 
elected Senate.  We can therefore appreciate that nothing is 
going to simplify the efficiency of the political system from a 
Quebec or a Canadian point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the other hand are working hard to eliminate one level of 
government.  We would like the federal level to disappear, and 
Quebeckers will decide to do so, I hope. 
We are not for adding more levels, on the contrary. We are for 
streamlining the process and giving more power to the local 
levels, which are much closer to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something of a waste of time to be dealing with 
strengthening their role, the selection process and so forth. 
The first thing to do is to abolish the Senate, sending the 
clear message that this kind of institution and the $50 million 
a year it costs are no longer government priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could get things moving. Interested provinces might pass 
similar legislation and, eventually, the senators would be alone 
to assume the blame for preventing the will of the people to 
abolish the Senate, as expressed by their elected 
representatives, from being acted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the renovations under way on the Hill at this time are 
costing a fortune. 
Some work is being done to accommodate our friends in the other 
place, who were complaining last year about not having access to 
the parliament buildings through a tunnel, something they want. 
The public has a problem with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members to focus, within reason, on a single resolution, 
which could be passed, stating that there will be no more 
Senate. This would be better than making cosmetic changes that 
will change very little to the fact that the Senate is a 
completely obsolete institution that no longer serves any 
purpose in our modern political system and in the real life of 
ordinary citizens, the people of Quebec and Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to enter into the debate.  I have enjoyed the two previous 
speeches.  I learned a little bit and much of what I heard was 
easy to agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform of the Senate has been a goal and objective of most 
political parties that come to this place.  I was doing some 
reading prior to coming here tonight.  As early as 1919 the 
Liberal Party had Senate reform as part of its platform.  Prime 
Minister Mackenzie King was in power. With our own party and its 
founding convention in 1933 the CCF was adamant that Senate 
reform would be a real priority.  Again when the NDP was formed 
in 1960 that found its way into the priorities of our political 
platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flaw I find in the bill we are debating is that we would not 
see any serious reform.  Even if it may be achievable to put in 
place an elected Senate through this piece of legislation, it 
would not be the triple E Senate the member's party is usually 
promoting. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equal side of the triple E is where the real barrier is. 
Even though we may institutionalize or help to formalize the 
institution through the democratic process of voting senators in, 
if we do not have the other aspects of Senate reform, we have not 
made things any better at all.  To this day, after all the 
constitutional wrangling and all the best laid plans of political 
parties coming and going, no one has managed to implement true 
Senate reform, especially in terms of equalization of 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg South is quite right that we came very 
close in the Charlottetown accord.  That is one of the reasons I 
was happy to work for the Charlottetown accord. I went to the 
five meetings across the country as an ordinary Canadian.  I 
learned a great deal and I was very enthusiastic about the 
opportunities Canadians had within their reach with the 
Charlottetown accord, a real reformed triple E Senate.  That I 
could have supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have chucked that away.  We chose not to avail ourselves of 
that opportunity.  It is no longer there for us.  I do not have 
any optimism that we will see it back in the national forum in my 
lifetime.  Most Canadians would rather poke themselves in the eye 
with a stick than go through another process like the 
Charlottetown accord and all the constitutional wrangling and 
frankly, I am one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party member from Nanaimo cited a number of polls and 
surveys that they have done which indicate broad support for an 
elected Senate.  I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of those 
polls.  What we did not hear was that some of those polls gave a 
number of options:  Do you want an elected Senate?  Would you 
rather see an abolished Senate?  Would you rather leave the 
Senate exactly the way it is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an interesting trend in the most recent and the 
largest nationwide poll which was the Angus Reid poll in April. 
The real trend to watch on the graph in that survey is the 
growing support for abolition.  From the polls in 1987, 1989 and 
now in 1998 the number of people who want an elected Senate is 
almost equal to those who want the Senate abolished. Forty-five 
per cent say they would like an elected Senate.  I believe most 
of those voters are really thinking of a triple E Senate, not 
just elected.  In a scientific poll across the country, 41% now 
say abolish, abolish, abolish.  That is the camp I am in and I am 
happy to promote that position on behalf of our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find that the current situation cannot be fixed.  Some things 
are irretrievably broken.  Tampering and fooling around with it 
in a minor way is not going to give us the satisfaction we need. 
We believe the abolition of the Senate could actually become the 
next unity issue, just as the Charlottetown accord was supposed 
to pull the country together finally and let us get passed the 
differences we have.  I think the abolition of the Senate will 
become the single one issue we can all agree on and move forward 
together on in a very united front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Angus Reid survey shows much higher levels of support for 
abolition in the province of Quebec than in the rest of Canada. 
The figure is 57% or 59% for abolition.  The member from the Bloc 
who just spoke points to a petition that was recently circulated 
in that province.  He was talking about the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer a petition was circulated broadly across Canada.  I 
know one member of the Bloc took a copy of this petition and got 
11,000 signatures.  I believe that is the figure.  We have not 
seen the tally yet.  Again, that was done in the course of a 
couple of weeks. I will read some of the preamble from the 
petition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what Canadians are signing in droves across the country 
and presumably this is what they believe: “We the 
undersigned”—etcetera—“that the Senate of Canada is an 
undemocratic institution composed of non-elected members who are 
unaccountable to the people; and that the Senate costs taxpayers 
some $50 million per year;”—another sore point certainly—“and 
that the Senate is redundant, given the roles played by the 
supreme court and the provinces in protecting minority rights and 
providing regional representation; and that the Senate undermines 
the role of MPs in the House of Commons; and that there is a need 
to modernize our parliamentary institutions; therefore, your 
petitioners call upon parliament to undertake measures aimed at 
the abolition of the Senate”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petition is getting a lot of support right across the 
country. There is multiparty support.  An NDP MP and a Liberal MP 
put this petition together.  We have quotes from a Reform MP 
saying he would like to abolish the Senate.  We have members from 
the PCs saying that Reform would have to modify some of its 
policies on the united alternative, one being its position on the 
Senate. We have the Reform Party quoted in articles saying that 
would be something it would be willing to do.  It would be 
willing to back off its position on the Senate in order to allow 
the united alternative to go forward.  I would be happy to share 
the quotes with the member from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find that no single issue has galvanized Canadians quite as 
much as this one lately.  It is a very tangible, visceral issue. 
Although I am not going to dwell on this, isolated cases of abuse 
have brought the issue to the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the first one to recognize that there are many fine people 
in the Senate of Canada doing valuable work right across the 
country.  I have had the pleasure to meet a few since I have been 
here. I do not think those fine people would stop doing the fine 
work they do if they were no longer senators.  I know they got to 
be senators because they were fully engaged and seized of these 
issues.  They are not going to drop them because they are no 
longer housed in that building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, with the $50 million we would save, who is to say that 
the Prime Minister or the government of the day would not make 
people special emissaries on certain issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one senator I had the pleasure of working with on the 
child labour issue. She is a champion of social justice in that 
regard.  Who is to say that if she no longer sat as a senator 
that the Prime Minister would not put her in charge of a task 
force on child labour and be our representative overseas at the 
international forums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all within the realm of possibility.  Canadians would 
see that as money well spent because we would not have the same 
issue of the undemocratic and in fact a barrier to democracy that 
exists on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to spend just one minute on the numbers. The 
province of Manitoba was cited in the Reform Party's speech.  The 
actual figures in the province of Manitoba according to the Angus 
Reid poll as of April 1998 were that 45% said to reform the 
Senate and 41% said to get rid of it.  We were exactly on the 
national average for getting rid of it and we were one or two 
points higher in terms of reforming it.  Those are the real 
numbers.  It was not 87% want an elected Senate and it is 
intellectually dishonest to craft the figures in that way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, 
previous speakers dealt more with whether the Senate should be 
abolished or maintained than with Bill C-382.  I would like to 
get back to focusing on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin with a few comments.  There has been much 
talk of the polls on abolition of the Senate and on Senate 
reform, but I would like to cast some doubt if I may on them 
because, in any poll of Quebeckers and Canadians on politicians, 
the terms “abolition”, “lack of confidence”, “not credible” and 
“dishonest” keep recurring. 
If a poll offers Canadians the opportunity to show how little 
they trust the entire political machinery, they will take 
advantage of it and say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, if time is taken to explain to Canadians why the Senate 
exists, then we can initiate a period of reflection and a far 
more positive debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member of the Reform Party has spoken of polls.  The 
one I have looked at often these days is the poll that shows 
Reform dropping and the Progressive Conservatives rising.  It

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the bill, a bill that unfortunately 
lacks credibility.  The Reform member told us that the bill 
could come into effect without any constitutional change.  That 
is absolutely false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it is worded, Bill C-382 would require a constitutional 
amendment. The member should look further into this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changing section 42 of the Constitution Act requires a close 
look at sections 38 and 41 which stipulate that, if the method 
of appointing senators is changed, there must be a 
constitutional change using the 7-50 formula: 7 provinces and 50% 
of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may want to look into this, particularly in 
light of his clause 4, which provides that neither the Queen's 
Privy Council for Canada, the Prime Minister nor any other 
minister of the crown in right of Canada can appoint someone to 
the Senate, contrary to what is provided in the Constitution. 
Therefore, this bill is unconstitutional and out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have something interesting to propose. Bill 
C-382 does not solve anything. The Reform member told us about 
the context in which the bill was introduced. It was on the eve 
of an election to elect a senator in Alberta. It was merely to 
put more emphasis on the election of an Alberta senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But again, considering what the Reformers are proposing in this 
bill, a constitutional amendment would be required: seven 
provinces with 50% of the population would have to agree. So, 
the Reform Party has to go back to the drawing board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, while waiting for a constitutional amendment such as 
the abolition of the Senate, a change or whatever else Canadians 
may want, we could start working here in this House and make 
certain changes. First, we propose to limit a senator's term of 
office to 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would not be a precedent. Yes, it is a constitutional 
amendment, but it is a change that was done through an act of 
parliament. For example, the first change regarding the number 
of years that a senator can sit was brought about under Lester 
B. Pearson, who added a clause (b) providing that a senator 
could only sit until age 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could adopt a similar procedure and decide that a senator can 
sit for a period of ten years, through an act of parliament and 
a constitutional amendment. However, such a constitutional 
amendment would not be subject to the 7-50 rule, that is seven 
provinces accounting for at least 50% of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be the first step. 
Of course, this measure would not be retroactive, but it would 
send a message that parliament is ready to make changes and to 
open the debate on the Senate and the whole parliamentary 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Senate were abolished, the role of this House would 
change automatically. It would be a major change. Would the 
number of members be increased? Would it be written into the 
Constitution that a specific number of members must come from a 
particular region? That is how Quebec protected itself in 1867. 
The number of senators from Quebec is protected under the 
Constitution. Would the number of members from a particular 
region, western Canada, Atlantic Canada, Quebec or Ontario, be 
protected under the Constitution? Maybe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop using senators as a political currency. Let us be 
serious. The first serious step would be to limit the term of 
office of senators to ten years. 
I am sure most of the senators will agree and will ask for 
greater changes in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the Reform members have a problem with the Senate 
and they are trying to make use of it.  However, they are going 
about it in a negative fashion.  Even in their document on a new 
Canada, it is incomplete.  Perhaps there should be a review of 
the way the Reform Party works on the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They often discredit the Senate, but when Reform Party or other 
members propose such things they are not helping the senators, 
the Senate or Senate reform.  They add even more to the lack of 
credibility of the people in the Upper House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could take the time to explain why the Senate exists, then 
good ideas and the positive side of parliamentary reform could 
take effect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be interesting, but I would like people, before sweeping 
changes are made to the country from one end to the other, to 
look at what we can do here, as in the matter of denominational 
schools for Newfoundland and Quebec, for instance.  We did that 
here.  We did not need the rule of 7 provinces and 50% of the 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could take a step forward in the case of the Senate.  It 
could be 10 years, 7 years or 12 years.  I think that if the 
current government is serious about sending a signal on Senate 
reform, if all opposition members are serious about the Senate 
as well, this initial step could be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be abolitionists in the Senate.  We abolished its 
equivalent in Quebec, the legislative council, at the end of the 
1960s. We had reasons to do so. 
My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois has said that, for them, it 
was not just a question of eliminating the Senate, but rather of 
eliminating a level, the federal government.  I would just like 
to remind the House that Premier Bouchard has said that, 
regardless of the outcome, there will be a type of European-style 
federal government to manage Quebec-Canada relations, if Quebec 
becomes sovereign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An in-depth change is being made, but in the end an important 
level is still being maintained, a federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate is important.  It must be changed, must be amended, 
must be improved.  We also need to take a look at what is 
happening in the House as far as parliamentary representation is 
concerned.  This must, however, be done with credibility, and 
this the Reform Party lacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Credibility is needed with respect to the role played by the 
Senate, and there must be credibility in particular with respect 
to analysing polls.  As I said at the start of my speech, any 
time a reference made to a politician, it is always a negative 
one, and this is wrong.  Let us stop fiddling with polls and let 
us tell it like it is.  Let us inform people about the history 
of their country, because, unfortunately, they do not know it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot 
help but hear what the Liberals are saying about this.  During 
the election campaign in 1993 the Prime Minister said that he was 
going to revise the Senate.  He was going to reform it.  The 
Prime Minister said, and I know this almost by heart, “Within 
two years of forming a government we will have an elected 
Senate”.  Then he went on to say, and I have memorized this, 
“As Prime Minister I can make that happen”.  It is a broken 
promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to respond to the member from Winnipeg who said that 
Reformers were against the Charlottetown accord, which shows 
somehow that we have waffled on it.  The answer is no.  We have 
many reasons to be against the Charlottetown accord and the one 
little carrot it gave us regarding the Senate was not one of 
those reasons.  If that was all there was in the Charlottetown 
accord, of course we would have supported it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate that was proposed was not equal and its election 
would have been by the provinces.  It was not to be by the people 
of the province, it was to be by the legislatures of the 
province, if they so chose.  So it was not a truly elected 
Senate, nor was it an equal Senate.  Furthermore, there were a 
number of inequities in the accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the real reason this government wants to keep the Senate 
is for a haven for its buddies when it wants to give them a bit 
of a reward.  That is the way it looks.  That is the perception 
of many people.  I strongly think that we have to revise it.  We 
have to redesign the way the Senate is selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not?  I have no problem with the fact that I am elected and 
accountable to the people of Elk Island.  If my constituents do 
not like what I am saying or what I am doing, they can get rid of 
me.  In fact, with a Reform government, they would not have to 
wait until an election because we are in favour of more 
democratic control by the people.  We say that our constituents 
could recall us between elections if they were really offended by 
what we were doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But with senators Canadians can never do anything.  Senators are 
appointed by someone else.  Canadians do not have any say in who 
gets appointed and there is never any accountability.  There is 
no reason in the world for a senator to pay attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly have that example right now in a senator from 
Alberta who is totally misrepresenting what the people of Alberta 
believe and want.  At the same time this senator is collecting 
his salary he is working full time as the election campaign 
manager for the Conservatives. 
He is their Alberta campaign manager and he gets a full Senate 
salary while he is doing that.  Our people find that offensive. 
There is no way we can ever get rid of him because he is 
appointed for life.

stop. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as is often the case, the Liberals missed much of the point of my 
bill.  They were talking about a triple E Senate.  I was talking 
about one of the Es of a triple E Senate, the elected part.  That 
is the part that can be done today without any constitutional 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was amazed at the Conservative member who said that it cannot 
be done without a constitutional change.  It has been done.  It 
was done with Stan Waters.  It is doable.  But for the Liberals, 
basically, it is all or nothing.  We have seen the nothing part. 
We have seen the nothing part for basically 100 years from 
consecutive governments on that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill addresses only the elected part.  It means that senators 
would be elected and accountable to the people who sent them 
there, instead of the political party that sent them there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not fix all of the problems.  As the member from the NDP 
said, most Canadians would rather get a stick in the eye than 
have constitutional change.  I understand that.  Canadians are 
not ready for constitutional change.  I agree with that.  But 
this part, the elected part, could be done today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us fix it in short bursts, rather than wait to do it all at 
once.  We have seen that it was not done by the accord, and it 
will not be done by this government.  Let us do it in bits and 
pieces and fix it, so we are crawling before we move.  Fix it bit 
by bit, but at least we should have some political will in this 
House to attempt to fix it, rather than the rhetoric that we have 
been hearing from members across the floor.  The bottom line is, 
they do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe my bill is doable.  It has been proven to be doable by 
elections already held in Alberta.  I would suggest that we move 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would ask for unanimous consent that my 
bill be deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to follow up on a question 
concerning the Shamattawa First Nation which I asked in the House 
on November 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shamattawa is facing horrific social problems.  There have been 
over 120 suicide attempts since 1992 and 80% of the first 
nation's youth are addicted to solvents.  This level of solvent 
abuse and the personal and social consequences of it represents a 
health and humanitarian crisis that cannot be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current efforts to deal with this problem have proven to be 
inadequate.  The poverty that has led to these problems is a long 
term issue that desperately needs to be properly addressed. 
Addiction treatment is not available in most first nations, 
including Shamattawa, so addicts have to leave their homes to get 
treatment.  They are then returned to their communities, back 
into the poverty and desperation that caused their problem in the 
first place, without support.  There is a desperate need to 
improve social conditions in remote first nations and to provide 
ongoing support for recovering addicts when they return to their 
communities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples recognized this 
problem and the need for long term solutions.  It called for 
healing centres in troubled communities like Shamattawa to 
provide the ongoing support that recovering addicts need to keep 
from relapsing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over two months ago the chief of Shamattawa personally delivered 
a proposal for a healing centre to the minister of Indian 
affairs.  The lack of response from the minister prompted my 
November 5 question asking why the government was ignoring the 
appeals of the Shamattawa First Nation.  The answer I received 
was the sort of empty, evasive reply we on this side of the House 
have become all too used to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that the government is 
concerned about the level of poverty, in particular in the 
community of Shamattawa, and that it is very aware of the 
problems in the first nation.  He said that the government was 
working diligently on these problems.  This is all very easy to 
say, but the people of Shamattawa have yet to see the benefits of 
this concern and diligence.  While the government ponders what it 
can do about this crisis, in Shamattawa children as young as four 
are becoming addicted to solvents and homeless people are being 
left outside to freeze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six days ago Indian affairs officials in Winnipeg met with the 
chief of Shamattawa and would not commit to any help whatsoever. 
While this meeting was going on there was another solvent related 
death in Shamattawa.  A teenage boy, high on solvents, shot and 
killed another boy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal for a healing centre in Shamattawa would cost the 
government less than $1 million.  Recently we heard that the 
government is giving $10 million to alleviate the poverty being 
suffered in northern Russia.  I am not against foreign aid, but 
Shamattawa has asked for less than one-tenth of what Russia got 
and received nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many remote first nations with social problems as 
desperate as those of Shamattawa.  It is criminal that in a 
country of Canada's wealth such conditions are allowed to 
persist.  All that is needed is a relatively small amount of aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government now commit itself to administering 
meaningful aid to to Shamattawa First Nation and to other 
northern communities at the earliest possible opportunity? 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to respond to the hon. member for Churchill on 
behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
concerning the urgent social problems at the Shamattawa First 
Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the government is very concerned and deeply disturbed 
about the conditions facing the Shamattawa First Nation and is 
taking action.  We have been meeting with the Shamattawa First 
Nation over the past few months to formulate long term solutions 
to improve life for residents of this community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the most recent meeting of November 20, officials from the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Health 
Canada met with the chief of the Shamattawa First Nation and 
Grand Chief Francis Flett whom I know personally of the Manitoba 
Keewatinowi Okimakanak.  They discussed ways to improve 
conditions for youth in the community to address the high rates 
of solvent abuse and suicide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One proposed solution is for the first nation to build an arena 
and recreation facility that would address these social problems 
and combat boredom among youth.  The Department of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development is pleased to commit $400,000 toward the 
construction of this complex, and the first nation anticipates 
starting construction in the spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department has also identified $33,000 to assist first 
nations in the development of their own long term human resource 
strategy.  This strategy will target education and employment 
opportunities for youth, giving them more opportunities for a 
brighter future.  We did not stop there or our efforts will not 
stop there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1996-97 budget for the Shamattawa First Nation, in 
addition to the regular capital outlays for such things as 
housing which affects the social conditions and the psychological 
conditions of the people on reserves, we have committed $2.86 
million to housing, which will provide 33 additional houses for 
the Shamattawa community, and $4.73 million to a water treatment 
facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, we are working very diligently in this regard.  I 
thank the hon. member for her questions.  We are working on these 
very serious problems in a number of communities across Canada 
with the aboriginal leadership.  We want to resolve them as much 
as the hon. member for Churchill does.
