UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-258, an act respecting the establishment and award of a 
Canadian volunteer service medal and clasp for United Nations 
peacekeeping to Canadians serving with a United Nations 
peacekeeping force, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Canadians take great pride in the 
Canadian forces record of peacekeeping throughout the world, a 
record which has brought praise from many quarters and has 
established Canada at the forefront of nations doing their part to 
foster a peaceful world; a world in which human values and 
needs are not only respected but also supported.
<P>
	Bill C-258 is an act respecting the establishment and award of 
a Canadian volunteer service medal for peacekeeping to 
Canadian peacekeepers having served with a United Nations 
peacekeeping force. It also incorporates a clasp to be attached to 
the medal ribbon if the individual qualifies for the Nobel peace 
prize won by Canadian peacekeepers in 1988.
<P>
	Recognition would not be limited to Canadian forces 
personnel but would also include Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police and other Canadian citizens who qualify.
<P>
	At the moment there is no means to provide distinctive 
Canadian recognition for the risks they have taken and the 
contribution they have made. Thus, there is a deficiency in our 
honours and award system.
<P>
	Peacekeepers do receive United Nations medals for such 
service. The United Nations medal awarded to Canadian 
peacekeepers is proclaimed by His Excellency the Governor 
General in Council on the recommendation of the Prime 
Minister as a Canadian medal and therefore in the order of 
precedence in the Canadian honours system.
<P>
	Canada does not have its own peacekeeping medal. According 
to our honours and awards committee, the United Nations medal 
adequately fulfils Canada's obligation to recognize our 
peacekeepers' contribution to our country.
<P>
	However, the Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans Association 
does not agree, and after substantial consultation with many 
other interested individuals and organizations, nor do I.
<P>
	Indicative of this feeling, a request for distinctive Canadian 
recognition submitted to the Canadian honours and awards 
committee by the president of the Canadian Peacekeeping 
Veterans Association was endorsed by many members of this 
house, a goodly number of whom now sit on government 
benches. However, the committee denied the submission, 
deeming the United Nations medals to be sufficient recognition.
<P>
	The honours and awards directive reads: ``In Canada today 
granting honours is a gracious, tangible, and lasting way to pay 
tribute to people whose achievements are exceptional, who have 
performed outstanding acts of bravery or who have benefited 
Canada or humanity in general''. To be completely up front, it 
also states: ``Not more than one honour should be given for any 
specific achievement, act or service''.
<P>
	I assure you that I have no wish to dilute the justification, 
meaning or stature of a Canadian medal, but there is a Canadian 
precedent. In addition to the 1939-45 war medal, and the 
1939-45 star, if they served in any area of conflict, those who 
served outside Canada during the second world war were 
awarded the Canadian volunteer service medal as well as any 
campaign medals for which they qualified.
<P>
	Also, in June 1991, some 40 years after the fact, a Canadian 
volunteer service medal for Korea was approved by the Queen's 
Privy Council for presentation to Canadian military personnel 
who participated in the Korean war in addition to the United 
Nations medal won by veterans of that conflict.
<P>
	It is this same recognition I now seek for our peacekeepers. 
Other countries like Belgium, Ghana, Ireland, the Netherlands, 
and the United States already have distinctive national medal 
awards for their UN peacekeepers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10046"> 10046 </A></B>
<P>
	In introducing Bill C-258, I acknowledge that similar private 
members' bills have been submitted in previous Parliaments 
but unfortunately were not drawn for debate.
<P>
	During the last Parliament the Standing Committee on 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs recommended that a 
Canadian volunteer service medal for UN peacekeeping be 
established to recognize the service of Canadian military and 
non-military personnel who have served on peacekeeping 
missions. Parliament was dissolved before the government was 
able to respond to that recommendation.
<P>
	There are Canadian awards for bravery and valour at home in 
peacetime, awards for bravery, valour and service in time of 
war, but despite the discomfort, dislocation, family disruption, 
danger and sacrifices made by our peacekeepers, we have no 
Canadian medal for peacekeeping. Regarding sacrifice, 
according to records maintained by the Canadian Peacekeeping 
Veterans Association 147 Canadian peacekeepers have made the 
supreme sacrifice for our country.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	On June 11, 1984 a special service medal was authorized to 
recognize service under abnormally difficult conditions for an 
extended period. The medal is always awarded with one of four 
bars on which is engraved the nature of the special service. One 
of these bars is designated peace<I>paix and humanitas. The other 
bars approved and awarded with the special service medal are 
for service in Pakistan, 1989 to 1990; service with the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization since 1951; and Canadian forces 
station Alert in the Northwest Territories.</I>
<P>
	What the special service medal does in the case of the peace 
bar is recognize those who participated in peacekeeping or 
humanitarian activities which for a number of reasons, but 
normally for length of service, did not qualify for a United 
Nations medal. According to award criteria this medal may not 
be awarded along with another medal recognizing the same 
service such as the United Nations medal.
<P>
	While the special service medal properly fills one gap in our 
recognition of service, it does not provide that distinctive 
Canadian recognition for our peacekeepers who have been 
awarded United Nations service medals. Thus, their 
contributions around the world with the attendant honour and 
stature they have brought to our country remain 
unacknowledged by Canada.
<P>
	Yet as I said at the beginning, Canada and Canadians take 
great pride in the contributions that we as a country have made 
to peacekeeping operations throughout the world. 
Unquestionably most Canadians know and are proud that these 
efforts have added to our stature in the world community.
<P>
	In September 1988 Canadians took pride in their 
peacekeepers' having been awarded the Nobel peace prize. The 
clasp proposed in addition to the peacekeeping  Canadian 
volunteer service medal would recognize those people who won 
that honour for Canada.
<P>
	A peacekeeping memorial monument has been erected here in 
Ottawa to honour our peacekeepers and that is important, but a 
monument does not provide individual recognition.
<P>
	We Canadians should take more pride in ourselves, in our 
institutions, our history and our heroes. In this vein there is 
widespread support for unique Canadian recognition of our 
peacekeeping forces. We ask them to leave their friends and 
families to face harsh conditions, difficult situations and are 
consistently rewarded by their excellent responses to these 
challenges.
<P>
	We tend to be slow to recognize our deserving citizens. It 
seems to be a Canadian trait: 40 years to recognize Korean 
veterans, 50 years to recognize Dieppe veterans, 55 years and 
still counting for Hong Kong veterans. A peacekeeping 
Canadian volunteer service medal and the clasp for the Nobel 
peace prize can be one of our unifying symbols. Its recipients 
would come from all walks of life, from every province, from 
Canadian citizens who represent most if not all our broad variety 
of ethnic backgrounds, the common denominator being their 
shared loyalty to and willingness to serve our country.
<P>
	I want to quote from a 1943 directive issued by General Guy 
Simonds to his commanders in the First Canadian Division. In it 
he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The final criterion of a good or bad award is the reaction of the troops. If the 
troops feel it is a good award, it is a good award. If awards are criticized by the 
troops, they are bad awards. Before forwarding any recommendation, at each 
level the commander should ask himself the question: ``Would the front line 
soldier, if he knew the facts, consider this well deserved?''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bill C-258 is supported by the Canadian Peacekeeping 
Veterans Association, by the Canadian Association of Veterans 
in United Nations Peacekeeping, by serving and retired 
members of the Canadian forces, by many members of this 
House and by many Canadian citizens who have written or 
called my office.
<P>
	We need only think back to the comments made by His 
Excellency the Right Hon. Romeo LeBlanc, Governor General 
of Canada, at his installation on the eighth of this month.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	Addressing the media in his remarks he said: ``There is 
wonderful news out there and some of it you have covered 
magnificently. I recall the story you told us of Canadian 
peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia who put down their 
weapons to pick up and comfort orphan children, abandoned by 
their terrorized caregivers. This is Canadian compassion in 
uniform and we have seen it many times and in many places, 
from Gaza to Cyprus to Rwanda''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10047"> 10047 </A></B>
<P>
	Going on, he said: ``It is for this reason that I requested that 
former Canadian peacekeepers be among today's guard of 
honour, the first guard of honour I shall inspect as Governor 
General and as Commander in Chief.''
<P>
	Thus it would seem that despite the reluctance of our honours 
and awards committee to agree, if we use General Simonds' 
criteria as a measure, a Canadian volunteer service medal for 
peacekeeping would qualify as a good award. It would seem 
obvious from what our Governor General has said, that he too 
supports the need for Canadians to recognize our peacekeepers.
<P>
	As a Reform member of Parliament it would be inappropriate 
for me to recommend an award without considering the cost it 
will entail. It is estimated that the medal will cost between $5 
and $7 a copy and added to that will be the cost of administration 
and postal charges. As of January 31, 40,594 Canadian forces 
personnel have served or are serving as peacekeepers. They have 
fulfilled a total of 52,577 tours of duty.
<P>
	Additionally, since this recognition would also be extended to 
members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian 
civilians who qualify, their numbers must also be considered. I 
am unable at this time to determine how many they might be, but 
I believe it would be reasonable to project that the total qualified 
recipients, including the Canadian forces, are unlikely to exceed 
50,000 in number.
<P>
	If we double the maximum estimated price for the medal, to 
account for administrative and postal charges, we come to a 
maximum probable expenditure of $700,000; a lot of money, but 
it seems a small price for Canadians to pay to properly recognize 
those of our citizens who have brought lifesaving intervention, 
compassion and assistance to so many, and such great honour 
and credit to Canada.
<P>
	I understand that when the private members' bill committee 
was considering the status of this bill, it might have received 
some erroneous information which, in turn, may have 
influenced its decision not to make this bill votable.
<P>
	We have an obligation to conserve that which is most noble in 
our past, to respect the wishes of those veterans who have 
sacrificed so much, to maintain an honour system that both 
reflects our Commonwealth traditions and establishes uniquely 
Canadian symbols.
<P>
	I want to repeat the honours award directive I quoted earlier: 
``In Canada today granting honours is a gracious, tangible and 
lasting way to pay tribute to people whose achievements are 
exceptional, who have performed outstanding acts of bravery or 
who have benefited Canada or humanity in general.''
<P>
	Too often in today's society we are slow or fail to give 
recognition which is due. If we, as parliamentarians, are to take 
action to afford appropriate Canadian recognition to our 
peacekeepers, it is important that we give this bill a status which 
will enable us to exert the maximum  influence to achieve that 
aim. Therefore, I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to 
designate Bill C-258 as a votable item.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I might seek 
some clarification from the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands who brought this motion to the House.
<P>
	In his closing remarks he asked for the unanimous consent of 
the House. I want to be certain that, in fact, that request was 
being made by the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I may, I would like to enter that 
motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion. The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands is asking for unanimous consent to make this motion 
votable. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
offer my comments on Bill C-258, an act which would establish 
a Canadian volunteer service medal for peacekeeping.
<P>
	We on this side must sincerely congratulate the hon. member 
for Saanich-Gulf Islands for his diligence in bringing this 
important matter before the House. We share with him a strong 
desire to give fitting recognition to Canadians who serve in 
these vital and often dangerous operations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, I regretfully cannot support this initiative and I 
want to use the time allocated to me today to explain my position 
to my hon. colleagues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The first and most fundamental reason is that to create a 
decoration in this manner would run counter to the customs, 
traditions and procedures by which honours are granted in 
Canada.
<P>
	As hon. members know, the powers of the crown in this 
country fall into two classes. The first are the powers that the 
crown exercises under statute law subject to the approval of 
Parliament. The second class of powers are those that are 
encompassed in what is called the royal prerogative.
<P>
	These powers, which have their ancient roots in history, are 
not exercised with reference to Parliament. This is not to say 
that they are applied arbitrarily. Normally they are exercised by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10048"> 10048 </A></B>
<P>
the crown acting on the recommendation of the governor general 
in council. That is the way it is done in this country.
<P>
	There are problems of substance and application with respect 
to this bill, not with respect to the spirit. The bill proposes a 
volunteer service medal. This terminology echoes the second 
world war. A special medal was created then to recognize those 
who had volunteered as opposed to those who were conscripted 
for service. Today all Canadian military personnel are 
volunteers.
<P>
	The bill is also retroactive to the first UN mission in 1947. 
This means that more than 150,000 persons would be eligible. 
But there is a more basic difficulty. This approach to the creation 
of honours would confine us to a narrow, tunnel vision view of 
needs and options. This is a serious practical drawback.
<P>
	In order for medals, decorations and other honours to be 
meaningful, decisions about their creation and criteria must be 
made in context. For that reason many nations have established 
carefully crafted systems for the creation and award of honours. 
Canada has done that.
<P>
	We have a Canadian honours system. That system was put in 
place in 1967. It includes a committee which advises the 
government on how the system should work. The honours policy 
committee has a broad mandate. It looks at the whole roster of 
occasions for honours and decoration, peacekeeping operations 
included.
<P>
	It surveys the total population of potential recipients of 
honours. The committee makes its recommendations on the 
basis of certain clear principles. One is the requirement that 
people be honoured equally in relation to their contribution and 
that no one be overlooked. Another function of the honours 
system is to avoid debasing the coinage of honours by 
duplication or by the indiscriminate authorization of awards.
<P>
	The honours policy committee can live up to these principles 
because it is able to see the whole picture. It is a proactive body. 
It seeks to search out and eliminate any inequities in the system. 
Periodically it surveys the honours scene in Canada to make sure 
that all Canadians who contribute to peacekeeping are treated 
equally and recognized publicly.
<P>
	The committee makes it its business to consult with veterans 
and other groups. It looks at these matters in an international 
context. It is important, as we consider these matters, to 
remember that peacekeepers, ours and everyone else's, are 
honoured not only by their nations but by the international 
community.
<P>
	The obvious example, but not the only one, is the United 
Nations which has created 28 medals to recognize the service of 
women and men from many lands who take part in various UN 
actions. Medals have also been struck by organizations other 
than the UN and many Canadians wear them proudly as their 
own.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think that, in a way, these decorations are the most eloquent. 
Sooner or later, after serving side by side in peacekeeping 
operations, these men and women return to their units in their 
respective countries.
<P>
	By wearing these decorations on their uniforms, they 
celebrate a comradeship in arms that transcends the differences 
among nations. These decorations proclaim that we are all 
serving the common cause of peace.
<P>
	No award system, whether national or international, is 
perfect.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	It is therefore quite possible that, for technical reasons, some 
Canadian peacekeepers would not meet established criteria, 
thus missing out on awards recognizing their contribution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One common example is air crew who quite often fly missions 
related to UN peacekeeping operations without becoming 
officially attached to those operations. The Canadian honours 
system recognizes these anomalies exist and precisely for that 
reason we have the Canadian special service medal with 
peacekeeping bar.
<P>
	To sum up, this bill, worthy though it is in objective, would 
not in my opinion succeed in the goal of honouring equitably the 
contribution of Canadians. Indeed it would work counter to that 
goal. For that reason, with great regret and with very great 
respect for the spirit in which it has been brought forward by the 
hon. member, I am unable to support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-258 put forth by the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands 
respecting the establishment of a Canadian Volunteer Service 
Medal and Clasp for United Nations Peacekeeping is a way to 
recognize our military volunteers for their contribution to 
peacekeeping missions around the world.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to salute the courage and 
dignity with which our servicemen and women carry out their 
difficult task on peacekeeping missions abroad. They deserve 
our admiration and full support. I also have a thought for their 
families who also go through difficult times worrying about 
them.
<P>
	Our forces are not new to this kind of operations. A leader in 
peacekeeping, Canada has gained in this area experience and 
expertise that has earned it respect worldwide. It should be 
noted that since the end of the cold war, regional conflicts and 
thus the need for restoring and maintaining peace have been 
increasing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10049"> 10049 </A></B>
<P>
	While a general war is highly unlikely in the present 
circumstances, we must recognize however that a high level 
conflict could erupt from any given regional confrontation, 
should it escalate.
<P>
	The end of the cold war brought about a new world order 
characterized by a degree of uncertainty, instability as well as 
some new tensions. The democratization process under way in 
Eastern Europe is a good example of the ongoing changes. The 
instability caused by this transition is rekindling national 
vitality because of newly rediscovered collective identities.
<P>
	So, in the context of a security policy, we must help countries 
such as those of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union 
that choose to become democratic. It must be pointed out that 
the emergence of new States did not result in chaos everywhere. 
National emancipation movements carried out though 
legitimate institutions materialized peacefully.
<P>
	For example, the Czech and Slovak republics peacefully 
severed their federative ties. Similarly, Slovenia and the Baltic 
States achieved independence in an orderly and democratic 
fashion. That is how they were able to have their sovereignty 
readily recognized by the international community.
<P>
	Another case in point is the Ukraine, the independence of 
which Ottawa was the first capital to recognize after the 
referendum won by the sovereignists.
<P>
	We have no intention of burying our heads in the sand and 
ignore the constraints and challenges that come with the new 
world order.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Thus, Canada, as well as an eventual sovereign Quebec, must 
continue to actively promote democracy. It should be pointed 
out that, before being perceived as a thorn in our diplomatic 
efforts and commitments abroad-I am referring of course to 
the unfortunate events which occurred in Somalia-the 
contribution of our military personnel to peacekeeping missions 
made Canadians and Quebecers very proud of their forces.
<P>
	The situation in the former Yugoslavia, in Bosnia, in Rwanda 
and in Somalia was unprecedented and here is why. The apparent 
futility of our efforts, the risks involved for our soldiers, the 
astronomical figures which circulated regarding the costs of 
these operations, as well as the complexity of the political and 
military situations in these countries undermined the public 
support which, until then, was enjoyed by such operations. 
While in line with previous similar commitments, our 
peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia quickly took on 
a very different nature.
<P>
	The operation in Slovenia and in Croatia was truly a 
peacekeeping mission. In that sense, our troops had the 
responsibility to ensure compliance with already concluded 
peace agreements. However, their role in Bosnia, Rwanda and 
Somalia had very little to do with traditional types of 
intervention. Canadian troops found  themselves in a theatre of 
war, caught between belligerent factions. How can you maintain 
peace in a country where peace does not exist in the first place, 
where a political settlement has yet to be reached, and where 
every ceasefire is violated? That is when things started to 
deteriorate, particularly after the whole world was able to see on 
television unbearable atrocities which we thought no longer 
existed, but which are indeed very real.
<P>
	There are lessons to be drawn from these operations. Canada's 
future interventions will have to meet more specific criteria. For 
example, the costs and complexities of modern-day 
interventions require the emergence of a new culture on the part 
of the strategists and the troops which will participate in future 
peacekeeping missions. Moreover, the recent events in Haiti 
reminded us of the need to base our interventions on democratic 
legitimacy and careful planning.
<P>
	It is important to clearly define, with the United Nations, 
specific objectives and tasking orders. The Bloc Quebecois feels 
that one of the primary duties of Canadian forces on the 
international scene must be to support, through participation, 
peacekeeping operations. In the future, our troops will have to 
be disciplined, trained to face the rigours of armed conflicts, 
adequately equipped, professional in their approach, and under 
good command.
<P>
	I will support Bill C-258, but I want to point out that the 
candidates who served with a UN peacekeeping force and are 
eligible to receive the medal and clasp must meet criteria which 
are still not known and which will have to be clearly defined.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in speaking in support of Bill C-258 I have to ask the 
basic question of why a medal, or for that matter, why a 
Canadian medal. I would like to cover the ground here by trying 
to describe what is happening to our country in relation to this 
medal as an example.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	Medals generally are a reflection and a record of our history 
as a country, of our independence and of our associations. The 
key word is independence. Looking at our history as a country 
over the last 100 years we find we have ties to the United 
Kingdom. In times of war these ties have been rather firm and 
very loyal. That does not necessarily change over the years but it 
does in another sense. The loyalties are still there but other 
loyalties are built up.
<P>
	We can look at the issue of wartime service in World War II, 
the creation of a Canadian army, the creation of the third largest 
navy in the world, and the expansion of the Royal Canadian Air 
Force. This gives us a good measure of the emergence of Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10050"> 10050 </A></B>
<P>
as a nation on its own without defaulting what has happened and 
what the ties are to the United Kingdom.
<P>
	In looking at our history we have to look at our loyalties. We 
certainly have had a loyalty to Great Britain. We have had a 
loyalty to our other allies, be it the United States or France. We 
have developed over the years new and greater loyalties to the 
United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
However, among all of these loyalties, associations and services 
we have a greater basic loyalty which is to Canada. We must 
allow our basic loyalty to ourselves to emerge.
<P>
	The proposer has mentioned, and I would like to bring it out 
again, that this bill in no way attempts to usurp the royal 
prerogative of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada or the 
Prime Minister or the honours policy committee to establish 
honours and awards. Rather, it gives the government the 
opportunity to respond to the report of the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs 
which recommended that such a medal be established to 
recognize the service of the Canadian military in peacekeeping. 
That is the nub of it all.
<P>
	A committee of this House is saying that we are Canadians 
and that we must do something to recognize what Canadians are 
doing. I did hear the words from the hon. member for Halifax 
explaining that there are entanglements and we should not 
remove this royal prerogative. I agree with this to a degree, but 
our greatest loyalty once again must be to ourselves.
<P>
	We are moving in the direction of being our own authority in 
this country. From the Statute of Westminster back in 1933 and 
over the years we are continuing to move in that same direction.
<P>
	When it comes to the issue of medals we have already heard 
that we are coming up with belated recognition for things such 
as Korea. When I came back from Korea in 1952 I was awarded a 
United Nations medal and a British Commonwealth medal for 
service in that country.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Forty years after the fact Canada belatedly decided it should 
issue its own medal for this service. Several years ago it came up 
with the Canadian volunteer service medal for Korea. It has now 
also come up with other awards in recognition of Canadian 
service which include: the 1983 special service medal; the 
Dieppe clasp, Dieppe occurred over 55 years ago and we have 
only come to provide belated recognition of it; and for the 
merchant marines. Service by the merchant navy took us 50 
years to recognize.
<P>
	We have received belated and sometimes no recognition at all. 
Hong Kong has been mentioned. This country has not yet 
recognized the service of our people in Hong Kong 55 years ago. 
There is no recognition of what I believe was called the ferry 
command. Civilians and military alike were ferrying aircraft 
from Canada and the United States over to the war zone in the 
U.K.
<P>
	We are moving in that direction but we are dragging our feet. 
To give another illustration of moving somewhat in the same 
direction, I participated in a non-United Nations peacekeeping 
effort in 1973. We went to Vietnam to replace the old, almost 
useless international commission for supervision and control. I 
should not say useless; it was hamstrung. Its hands were tied as 
to what it could do.
<P>
	In any event in 1973, Canada along with Indonesia as another 
representative of the western world and Poland and Hungary 
sent a non-UN commission, a quadripartite commission to 
Vietnam to oversee whatever peace we could muster out of that 
sad country. As a result of that I was asked to head up a 
committee to strike a medal. It was a very interesting 
experience.
<P>
	A committee of four got together, one representing each of the 
four countries. We designed a medal. We designed a ribbon 
incorporating the colours of the four countries involved: 
red-white, red-white, red-white, and red-white-green. We 
came up with a unique medal. It was certainly unique in its 
execution because it was hand forged in a back alley of Saigon. 
Nevertheless we came up with a medal of our own for issue to 
the 1,000-plus members of that specific commission.
<P>
	The illustration of this is that you can do things on your own 
or in concert with others. We did it quickly. We did it 
inexpensively. We came up with a unique medal in observation 
of that specific enterprise.
<P>
	I see that other countries have issued their own medals. 
Ghana, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States, and Ireland 
are issuing their own UN medals. Canada is first among equals 
in United Nations service. Surely if there is any country in the 
world that must have its own UN service medal, it is Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, since my colleague was unable to get 
unanimous approval to designate Bill C-258 as a votable item, I 
would ask that we unanimously vote to refer the bill to the 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs. 
Let us get together and at least refer the bill to that committee so 
that it can assess the merits of the bill in proper time. Therefore I 
move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-258, an act respecting the establishment and award of a Canadian 
Volunteer Service Medal and Clasp for United Nations Peacekeeping to 
Canadians serving with a United Nations peacekeeping force, be not now read a 
second time but that the order be discharged, the bill withdrawn and the subject 
matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee on National Defence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to speak today in favour of the bill put forward 
by my colleague from Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>
	We hear everyone praising our peacekeepers. We talk about 
our peacekeepers everywhere we go. It is a Canadian tradition. 
Every high school student in Canada is taught that the Right 
Hon. Lester B. Pearson invented peacekeeping in the 1950s to 
defuse the Suez Canal crisis. Yet it seems to me at times that we 
certainly as governments over the last number of years have 
been ashamed of that fact. We have never seen fit to give a medal 
to our own Canadian peacekeepers, as was mentioned so 
eloquently a moment ago by the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan.
<P>
	I have listened to the debate over the last five years in the 
House and when we brought the matter before the Standing 
Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs. There has 
to be a better way of recognizing our military people. Canadians 
have served in practically every peacekeeping effort since the 
Suez crisis from Cyprus to Cambodia and from Pakistan to the 
Israeli withdrawal from Egypt.
<P>
	Our peacekeepers have served Canada and the United Nations 
well. They have brought honour to our country and they should 
be appropriately recognized. For a country with our tradition it 
is only fitting that a government strike a volunteer service medal 
for those Canadians who served in peacekeeping operations.
<P>
	We are not talking about special treatment of privileges. We 
are talking about honour. Right now, as has been mentioned 
many times here, our peacekeepers receive a medal from the 
United Nations for their service. However they do not receive a 
medal from their own country. That is a shame.
<P>
	Some people have suggested that such a move is 
unprecedented. That is not so. As has been said today, the 
volunteers in Korea have received a Canadian medal to 
commemorate their service to peace. Granted, they waited 40 
years and probably would never have received it except that we 
committed troops at the time of the gulf war in 1991. At that 
time it was deemed to be a special area and a medal would be 
struck for that. It was pretty hard for the government not to come 
through with a medal for the Canadian people who served in 
Korea.
<P>
	We tend to play down this business of giving medals to our 
troops who serve in various areas. Maybe that has some merit at 
times. There are countries that some people think give too many 
medals. I have come to know a lot of the people who participated 
in peacekeeping efforts around the world in the last number of 
years. We have come into our own as a country. We have served 
in every conflict in this century. I believe the time has come to 
change the rules if that is what we have to do.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	No one has said anything about the royal prerogative, but 
maybe it is time that we took a look at the way things are done. 
We are great people in the House of all political parties for 
saying it is time for change. I found last summer as we travelled 
the country looking at our defence policy that sometimes it was 
hard to change things. Sometimes it is hard to change minds, 
even though we all go in with grandiose plans for making things 
work differently.
<P>
	It would be a shame if we fail to provide recognition of our 
peacekeeping veterans, the same recognition we gave to people 
who served in the Korean war and the first and second world 
wars. I do not think these people should have to wait 40 and 50 
years for the government to give them credit where credit is due.
<P>
	Canada is a country that is called on. We have more missions 
going now than we have had for many years. We are always 
ready to do our part even with dwindling resources and not the 
best equipment that our people should have out there. We do not 
hear them complain about it. We see letters from organizations 
across the country urging us to support the bill that we bring 
forward a peacekeeping medal and clasp for our peacekeepers.
<P>
	We have not gone far enough in this age. We talked about it, as 
I said, in 1990 in the Standing Committee on National Defence 
and Veterans Affairs. Perhaps, as has been suggested, it should 
lie with this committee to bring forth a way of doing it without 
having the wrath of the government against us or the wrath of 
those in Parliament who do not believe these things are noble or 
necessary.
<P>
	We should be ashamed of ourselves as governments and as 
parliaments for not having done something sooner. The gulf war 
had to come along before the Korean veterans were recognized 
with their own distinctive Canadian medal. I see nothing wrong 
with the soldiers getting the United Nations medal and one from 
our own country.
<P>
	At the end of the day I hope there is some resolve that we can 
send the matter to committee and have some recommendations 
come forward. I do not believe for a moment we are doing 
anything wrong by recommending that we give this medal to our 
peacekeepers. It would be a great day in our country if we could 
do that. We can sit here and talk about all the rules to stop this 
legislation. They are there, but I do not see why we cannot come 
up with some way to change them and make this medal a reality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to rise in the House today to speak to the bill 
presented by the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10052"> 10052 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill which I strongly support has as its main purpose the 
establishment of a volunteer service medal for members of the 
Canadian Armed Forces who have served in peacekeeping 
missions under United Nations command. In my view and that 
of many others this is a long overdue idea that deserves to be 
considered very seriously by the House and by the Canadian 
government.
<P>
	As we all know Canada has been involved in UN sponsored 
operations since the 1940s. Canada has also been the most 
constant and faithful contributor of troops to peacekeeping 
missions. In return our involvement in areas like Lebanon, 
Cyprus, El Salvador and Cambodia has truly been a source of 
pride for all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	While we have taken pride in this heritage of service abroad, 
we have failed to adequately recognize the efforts and the 
courage of thousands of servicemen and women who have 
answered without question the call of the Canadian government 
whenever it has sounded.
<P>
	Under present guidelines Canadian peacekeepers do not 
receive a distinctively Canadian medal. Ever since 1949, the 
year of the first UN sponsored military observation mission in 
India-Pakistan, Canadian service men and women have not been 
formally honoured by the Government of Canada by the 
awarding of a Canadian medal. The medals awarded to date have 
been issued by the United Nations thereby making them foreign 
awards. This oversight, which hopefully cannot be interpreted 
as a lack of gratitude, must be remedied.
<P>
	In the words of a former peacekeeper, now a member of the 
Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans Association, the adoption of 
Bill C-258 is ``an opportunity to help right the wrong''. 
Canada's reputation as a country concerned with peace around 
the world is in large part attributed to the professional ability 
and courage of past and present peacekeepers. The role that 
Canadians have taken in UN peacekeeping is recognized 
throughout the world. It is now time for the Canadian 
government to do the same.
<P>
	Today I will try to explain why in my personal view this is 
such a timely initiative. The idea of establishing a Canadian 
volunteer service medal for United Nations peacekeeping has a 
great deal of merit, not the least of which is to bring Canada up 
to par with other peacekeeping contributing nations such as 
Belgium, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom and the 
Republic of Ireland which already award their own 
peacekeeping medals in addition to those awarded by the United 
Nations.
<P>
	The new medal would also give visual recognition of the great 
honour that was bestowed upon Canada by our peacekeepers 
when the United Nations peacekeeping operations won the 
Nobel prize in September 1988. Indeed the idea has a great deal 
of merit. However it appears all the more relevant in light of a 
certain number of developments both on international and 
national levels that in recent years have demonstrated the need 
to seriously question ourselves on what peacekeeping  
represents to us and, in that light, what level of commitment we 
are prepared to live up to.
<P>
	In the course of the debate that has been going on in Canada 
over the past few years on these issues it has appeared quite clear 
that Canada's involvement in peacekeeping operations is a 
reflection of its internationalist approach to world affairs.
<P>
	The recent defence white paper concluded:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Multilateral security co-operation is not merely a Canadian tradition; it is an 
expression of Canadian values in the international sphere. We care about the 
course of events abroad and we are willing to work together with other countries 
to improve the lot of all manner of peoples.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Reform Party has repeatedly echoed this international 
commitment. We believe that Canada's ability to play a role on 
the international scene rests to a large extent on our continued 
dedication to the principles of international co-operation and 
collective security.
<P>
	Furthermore Canada is not blind to the lessons of history. Our 
historical experience has underscored the need to develop and 
maintain effective multilateral institutions that can confront as 
effectively as possible any challenge to international security 
and stability and, if all other means fail, respond to aggression 
with determination and leadership.
<P>
	In so reflecting Canada's global values the Canadian forces 
have contributed incessantly to international security. Over the 
past few years the sheer number of UN sponsored interventions 
requiring Canadian participation has dramatically increased. 
The result has been to stretch Canada's peacekeeping resources 
to their extreme limit.
<P>
	The nature of multilateral operations has also changed 
enormously. The range of activities these operations involve has 
expanded to encompass the complete set of military activities 
from preventive deployment and observation to enforcement 
and reconstruction.
<P>
	This has spurred a debate at the international level about the 
need to more clearly determine the nature of any multilateral 
operation, whether peacekeeping, peacemaking or 
humanitarian, before deployment actually takes place.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	In Canada we have become more sensitive to the need to 
define the conditions under which our forces will be deployed in 
areas of conflict.
<P>
	From the perspective of those Canadian men and women who 
serve or who have served under UN command, and on whose 
behalf I speak today, these developments have meant more 
intensive training, increased stress and wider responsibilities. 
Although most of us do not have an immediate knowledge of 
what a soldier's job entails, it must be clear to all of us that the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10053"> 10053 </A></B>
<P>
political and military trends in the nineties have made the 
soldier's job considerably more difficult than in any other era.
<P>
	Not since the Korean war have Canadian servicemen and 
women been burdened with such a wide array of responsibilities 
at home and abroad. Increasingly these people are asked to move 
beyond their traditional role of seeing to the nation's defence 
into non-traditional areas such as the delivery of humanitarian 
aid and the reconstruction of war-ravaged societies.
<P>
	The physical and psychological strains associated with 
immersing oneself in an alien culture and with meeting stringent 
performance criteria are necessary so that both the individual 
and the group can withstand the ultimate test of combat. While 
they must be ready to endure the most difficult and unfriendly 
working conditions, the soldiers of the nineties must also be 
flexible. They are asked to be diplomats, aid workers, law 
enforcement officers as well as warriors. They are expected to 
exercise an unprecedented level of self-discipline by constantly 
adapting to fit the prevailing situation.
<P>
	In wartime, roles and objectives are clearly defined. In 
operations other than war, the soldier is often forced to change 
roles from day to day, even moment to moment. The 
peacekeeper must draw on his combat infantry skills if a fire 
fight breaks out, and then revert to his diplomatic or 
humanitarian self. The soldier of the nineties must be more 
educated than ever before. He must be acquainted with political, 
military and sociocultural dynamics of the crisis area in which 
he has been deployed. That is not an easy feat, if we consider the 
intractable nature of some of the conflicts which Canada has 
helped to monitor.
<P>
	The complex security problems which confront the 
international community today defy easy solutions. Often those 
solutions, for which a multilateral response has been deemed the 
most appropriate, are also the most complicated. Some 
conflicts, such as the ones in the former Yugoslavia and 
Somalia, are ones for which it is very difficult to define 
objectives that reflect a clear sense of perspective.
<P>
	Moreover, soldiers are asked to perform to the best of their 
ability, even in the most ambiguous and uncertain situations. 
They are expected to be sensitive to political, social and cultural 
realities on which even their superiors are unable to provide 
information and leadership.
<P>
	It is also important for the Canadian government to recognize 
this state of affairs. Peacekeepers have served Canada's 
interests well since the end of the second world war. This 
contribution from our servicemen and women has become more 
and more costly in terms of personal commitment and loss of 
life.
<P>
	A Canadian volunteer service medal would not compensate 
for the sacrifice and deprivation, whether physical or emotional, 
nor can it constitute a form of restitution for the families of 
those who have given their lives in the search for peace. The 
Canadian volunteer service medal must be seen as a token of our 
collective appreciation, as a formal recognition by the people 
and the Government of Canada of the increasingly perilous  and 
arduous role demanded of peacekeepers and, as my colleague 
said, of ``their continued display of courage and dedication to 
their assignments, which have been the hallmark of Canadian 
peacekeepers''.
<P>
	I certainly support this bill.
<P>

consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from February 24 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act 
and the Criminal Code, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have the 
opportunity to speak on third reading of this bill. I begin by 
reviewing the highlights of the bill and after that I would like to 
put special emphasis and focus on that part of the bill which has 
to do with rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	For those who have come to the debate recently, the minister 
announced, when tabling the bill on June 2, the highlights would 
include sentences for teenagers convicted of first and second 
degree murder in youth court to 10 and 7 years respectively. 
Sixteen and 17-year olds charged with serious personal injury 
offences would be dealt with in adult court unless they can show 
a judge that public protection and rehabilitation can both be 
achieved through the youth court. It includes extending the time 
that 16 and 17-year old young offenders who have been 
convicted of murder in an adult court must serve before they can 
be considered for parole.
<P>
	It also includes improved measures for information sharing 
between professionals like school officials and police, and with 
selected members of the public when public safety is at risk, as 
well as retaining the records of serious young offenders longer. 
Finally, it includes provisions to encourage rehabilitation and 
treatment of young offenders in the community when this is 
appropriate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10054"> 10054 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to focus on the last point. I am happy to see that the 
very first clause of the bill deals with the whole point of 
underlying causes and rehabilitation. I would like to read 
directly into the record clause 1(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) Crime prevention is essential to the long-term protection of society and 
requires addressing the underlying causes of crime by young persons and 
developing multi-disciplinary approaches to identifying and effectively 
responding to children and young persons at risk of committing offending 
behaviour in the future;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a.1) while young persons should not in all instances be held accountable in the 
same manner or suffer the same consequences for their behaviour as adults, 
young persons who commit offences should nonetheless bear responsibility for 
their contraventions;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clause 1(2) says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The protection of society, which is a primary objective of the criminal law 
applicable to youth, is best served by rehabilitation, wherever possible, of young 
persons who commit offences, and rehabilitation is best achieved by addressing 
the needs and circumstances of a young person that are relevant to the young 
person's offending behaviour;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to talk about this part of the bill because I believe 
it is an area where we in the community are not putting enough 
emphasis today.
<P>
	I go back to a book that I had a chance to review this morning 
before I came to the House. It is <I>Father Flanagan at Boys Town</I>. 
Boys Town is situated about 10 miles outside of Omaha, 
Nebraska.
<P>
	I can remember one night flying in from Toronto with a 
colleague from Saskatchewan. We were talking about Notre 
Dame in Saskatchewan, but the subject of Boys Town came up. 
What has been going on for many years now at Father 
Flanagan's Boys Town in the United States of America is 
something that we as legislators should take time to revisit.
<P>
	For those who do not know, Father Flanagan started this 
environment many years ago when he took in homeless boys, 
young boys without parents. However he also took about 20 per 
cent of the number, young offenders.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	The rehabilitation record of Boys Town has been described by 
some of the best psychiatrists and doctors as to being almost a 
totally mysterious phenomena. Father Flanagan worked with 
these young men in developing their character. He exposed them 
to apprenticeship and athletics. It did not matter what their 
religious background was. The boys could be Jewish, Protestant 
or Catholic, but he made sure that a portion of their life each 
week had some sort of religious training.
<P>
	I tell this story because the track record of the Boys Town 
situation applies just as much today. It is just as relevant as it 
was many years ago when this institution started. There are just 
as many young people today who are involved in situations 
where their family life is under great stress and strain. I believe 
that many of these homes that we have in our communities do 
not have the same sophistication as that institution has.
<P>
	As we go through the process of putting more emphasis on 
rehabilitation, we should also be reviewing the types of 
institutions we have to make sure they are relevant and that we 
are getting the maximum impact.
<P>
	So often today a young offender is put into an institution 
where some of the values that a Boys Town has are just not 
present; the values of caring and sharing with one another and 
being a little bit more sensitive to character building. The 
institutions are just not sensitive. I am not saying that our 
institutions should be totally ignored but that they should be 
re-examined.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice made the following statement in his 
press release, which I want to emphasize: ``That legislation is 
only one part of the answer to violence among young people. 
Poverty, alcoholism, family violence, racism, illiteracy and 
many other factors may lead to criminal acts by young people 
and adults alike and must be tackled as a whole''. The minister 
said this when he issued his press release. Those words are very 
important.
<P>
	When we go through this bill I am hoping that the whole area 
of rehabilitation can be given very special review and emphasis. 
We should look at some of the rehabilitation systems and centres 
that exist all over North America. I would like to refer very 
specifically, as I said, to the Boys Town example in the United 
States where the track record of rehabilitation is apparently 
second to none anywhere in the world. If a Boys Town 
environment can happen in the United States why can we not 
have similar institutions in Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member who just spoke could also have looked at the 
system we have in Quebec, a system that was put in place a 
number of years ago and that, as far as we are concerned, has 
proved its worth. Unlike the bill to which the hon. member was 
referring, our system is not based on the premise that young 
people can be rehabilitated through repression.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this bill leans towards repression. It gives the 
public the impression it will be better protected because young 
offenders who are 16 or 17 years of age and are tried in adult 
court will get longer sentences.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	The public is being deluded. It has yet to be established in the 
literature that increasing sentences acts as a deterrent in such 
cases. I do agree wholeheartedly with a number of points the 
hon. member made. We must look at what causes crime, and 
even more important, we must ensure that when young people 
have committed a crime, they are given, considering their age, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10055"> 10055 </A></B>
<P>
every opportunity,-this is important for society as well-to get 
out of the kind of life that they have chosen or into which they 
have been led, not perhaps altogether voluntarily, considering 
the problems many of them have had.
<P>
	This bill is even more offensive in the case of Quebec, where 
we have set up a system I would urge the hon. member to come 
and see, and not just in the large urban centres. We really had to 
put a lot of work into this system; we had to call on 
multidisciplinary resources and take a more 
community-oriented approach based more on compensation for 
damages or on the actual rehabilitation of the young person.
<P>
	The federal legislation, which will have to be administered by 
Quebec, will have a very disruptive impact on this system. This 
is true in other provinces and it is also true in Quebec. The 
government ignores existing systems that work well and 
imposes or adds a system based on repression, a system that 
does not connect with systems that already exist and have 
proved to be effective.
<P>
	This is outrageous, and does not bode well for the future. I 
think this is just one more reason to say that as far as guidance, 
social justice and equity are concerned, we are perfectly capable 
of doing the job ourselves.
<P>
	The Quebec Bar Association submitted an extensive brief to 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, in which it 
accurately summed up the situation in Quebec. It said that young 
offenders in Quebec are eligible for alternative treatment of 
their case, which involves a referral to the Youth Protection 
Branch, proposals for an arrangement and the use of alternative 
sentencing such as reimbursing the victim or doing community 
work. In fact, almost 47 per cent of the cases are handled this 
way. Where alternative sentencing is not a possibility, all such 
cases in Quebec will be tried by a special youth court. Once the 
court has handed down a sentence, it will be up to the health care 
and social services network to see that it is carried out.
<P>
	The choice that Quebec has made to entrust young offenders 
to institutions that come under the department of health and 
social services illustrates its philosophy in this matter. The 
ultimate aim is rehabilitation in the medium and long terms 
rather than a panacea of repression, which at best offers society 
only short term protection.
<P>
	The crime rate among adolescents in Quebec is one of the 
lowest in the country, in fact, the second lowest. The adoption of 
Bill C-37 will upset all of our institutions whose role so far has 
been to promote rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I might add that imprisonment, by itself, while appearing to 
protect society, and which, even in the bill, is of limited 
duration, often ends up making criminals out of those who were 
initially only unfortunate or unlucky young individuals. If you 
want to be sure to turn 16 and 17 year olds into criminals, send 
them to prison. The longer the sentence, the better your chances 
of achieving that effect.
<P>
	We are strongly opposed to this bill. We believe that the 
minister, who, in any case, had said he wanted to review all the 
legislation to do with young people, should have examined the 
overall situation before tabling this bill. Having done so, he 
could have offered Canadians and Quebecers, not a comforting 
short term system, but a medium and long term one, which 
would prove less costly and permit the building of a society 
where people would really feel safe, because young people 
would have the opportunity to reintegrate into society rather 
than risk being handed another prison term.
<P>
	We will oppose this bill vigorously. We hope Canadians will 
appreciate our arguments. During our tour on social program 
reform, I heard it said everywhere in Canada, except in Quebec, 
that people were looking to Ottawa for an answer and for social 
justice through strong national standards.
<P>
	It seems to me that the adoption of a bill like this one casts 
doubt on Ottawa's ability to show the way to social justice, 
fairness and hope for all Canadians and Quebecers, and 
particularly for young people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
is one statement that is factual about the justice minister's 
attempt at dealing with young offenders: He is blindly following 
a political policy that became extinct the last time his party was 
in power.
<P>
	The justice minister is trying to convince Canadians that his 
proposed legislation, Bill C-37, is dealing with justice. This 
legislation is another attempt by this government at social 
manipulation and social engineering. It is not legislation to deal 
with justice.
<P>
	The justice minister should be concerned in dealing with 
those who have ignored and broken the established laws. The 
minister should be concerned in dealing with legislation that 
forces youth law breakers to understand that law-abiding 
members of society will not tolerate, condone nor accept the fact 
that criminal behaviour will go unpunished.
<P>
	I know punishment is a foul word to the opposite side, but it is 
a concept that is expected by the citizens of Canada. What we 
have here is legislation that outlines more reasons why 
offending youths should not expect punishment for crimes 
committed on law-abiding members of society. This legislation 
offers youth even more reasons to believe that the justice system 
will find reasons to excuse their criminal behaviour.
<P>
	This justice minister's first idea of justice is crime 
prevention. As good as that sounds, this legislation was 
supposed to deal with crimes already committed by young 
offenders. Instead, this minister wants to bypass his ministry 
and put the blame for violent antisocial youth on provincial 
social service 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10056"> 10056 </A></B>
<P>
agencies that are not fulfilling their mandate to provide youth 
with an alternative to criminal action.
<P>
	Canadians desired and demanded that this minister address 
the problem of increasing violence by youth. There is an 
epidemic of youth who commit crimes and laugh at the justice 
system's inability to show them that crime does not pay. Instead 
of putting teeth into the criminal justice system, this minister is 
continuing on a path designed by his government to present high 
sounding words that do not change anything.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Canadians want change. Canadians want their concerns 
addressed. And once again, this government offers excuses as to 
why change is impossible.
<P>
	The existing Young Offenders Act has the proper first 
priority. The first declaration of principle in the existing act 
states: ``While young persons should not in all instances be held 
accountable in the same manner or suffer the same 
consequences for their behaviour as adults, young persons who 
commit offences should nonetheless bear responsibility for their 
contraventions''.
<P>
	What does this minister offer? An excuse that because 
offending youth have committed crimes, that it is a failure of 
crime prevention policies administered by provincial agencies. 
The minister just does not get it. He does not understand that 
until his ministry becomes interested in justice and not 
downloading the responsibility for his failure to do his job to the 
provincial agencies, violent youth will not bear the 
responsibility for their antisocial actions.
<P>
	Canadians are not asking for excuses from the justice 
minister; they are asking for justice that condemns violent 
behaviour by antisocial youth. Canadians demand that the 
justice minister remove the loopholes in the Young Offenders 
Act which allow violent youth to kill or maim Canadians with no 
consequence of justice affecting the violent criminal. Instead, 
what do we get? Legislation that says crime prevention methods 
failed so we must blame crime prevention.
<P>
	May I remind this minister that the consequences of death or 
maiming cannot be changed. Canadians expect that justice must 
make the accountability for violent crimes swift and sure. 
Instead, Canadians are offered excuses why this justice minister 
would rather find causes for violent crimes than offer justice for 
victims of violent crime.
<P>
	Before this minister gets on his high horse and states that we 
on this side of the House are only interested in locking up all 
who break the law, let me remind him that I am talking about 
violent youth. This side of the House fully supports alternative 
measures for non-violent first offenders.
<P>
	Another question is, where does the funding for these 
facilities come from? It is very noble of the minister to talk 
about crime prevention. His party has been doing so since the 
last time they were the majority in the House. Rather than 
putting tax dollars into preventing crime, the Liberals preferred 
then just as they do now, to waste tax dollars on dubious 
expenditures benefiting friendly special interests such as, 
blueberry jelly, a study of Christmas lights, or the effects of 
lullabies on babies.
<P>
	The recommendations for social service expenditures by the 
provinces that this minister disguises as justice will cost his 
government nothing. However the citizens of the provinces that 
this minister will coerce into buying this bill of false goods may 
not be so lucky.
<P>
	The justice minister has seen the studies that state provincial 
social services now in place to assist youth at risk of crime are 
under-resourced and understaffed. This justice minister knows 
that provincial social workers trying to prevent crime by youth 
are and have depended on the Young Offenders Act to provide 
the services they cannot afford. This justice minister knows that 
provincial crime prevention will not receive federal funding 
because his government foolishly squanders tax dollars on 
programs of limited benefit to all Canadians rather than crime 
prevention for youth.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this minister and government are again using 
window dressing to try and convince Canadians that what is in 
the store is worth buying. As we all know, not only is the store 
empty, but the management of the store is empty of new ideas as 
well. Canadians will not buy this government's line that it 
knows best and Canadians know nothing.
<P>
	The chair of the justice committee asked in the House why we 
on this side of the House oppose spending money on social 
programs that will reduce crime. May I remind those opposite 
that this legislation was intended to address justice. This side of 
the House believes that crime prevention is cost effective and 
beneficial to both the future criminal and victim. However, this 
bill is supposed to address how the justice system must deal with 
those who have already committed violent crimes against 
society, not outline the failings of provincial social services.
<P>
	It is obvious we have reached the crux of this government's 
ability to govern. Seeing through all the flowery words and 
smoke and mirrors, Canadians will realize this government does 
not even understand the role the justice department must play in 
making justice mean something to violent youth.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Instead of justice this government offers a social service 
review. As we know, this government has already stated that 
reforming social services, just like changes that bring justice for 
victims of youth crime, is impossible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10057"> 10057 </A></B>
<P>
	In his last report the Auditor General took a bold step. The 
Auditor General said that it is time this government took a look 
at the legislation that was passed to see if the tax dollars are 
achieving the purpose of the legislation.
<P>
	We have social programs that hurt society, family programs 
that destroy families, aboriginal programs that keep Canada's 
aboriginals from ever gaining self-sufficiency and expenditure 
control legislation that allows government spending to spiral 
out of control as it has. Every time one of these programs fails 
we spend more money. These changes to the Young Offenders 
Act will not deter one violent youth from crime but will cost 
more money.
<P>
	This justice minister has neglected to answer several 
questions important to this legislation: What is the Young 
Offenders Act supposed to do? Will this legislation do it? How 
can we tell the difference? No one in this House will disagree 
that the Young Offenders Act is intended to separate hardened 
adult violent criminals from youth. It is further intended to 
separate hardened violent youth from the non-violent kid who 
got in with the wrong crowd and made a foolish mistake.
<P>
	No one will disagree that the youth making a non-violent 
mistake deserves a second chance. The problem with this 
legislation is the same as what is rampant in the adult justice 
system. No one is held accountable for their violent crimes. A 
day hardly goes by without discovering that a violent adult or 
youth who should have been separated from society is back on 
the street and has taken another victim.
<P>
	This government did not take justice seriously in the past. 
This legislation clearly shows the Liberals still do not take 
justice seriously today. Canadian society wants violent youths 
separated from potential victims, not reasons from this 
government why crime prevention fails.
<P>
	Let me serve notice here and now. If the Prime Minister and 
his justice minister ignore public demand that violent crime by 
youth be addressed, the good old days for the Liberal Party will 
end anytime before the next election. This Liberal government 
must apply the auditor general's recommendation to the Young 
Offenders Act. It must give value for tax dollar by protecting 
society from violent youth, not spending more tax dollars on a 
failed policy of social engineering. This government must hold 
violent youth accountable for their violent crimes.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say how disappointing it is to 
see that after much input from Canadian citizens and many other 
organizations throughout the country what we have come up 
with is Bill C-37. In the long run it will change nothing. It is 
change that Canadians are looking for. It will not come through a 
legislation that does not get serious about violent crime.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise again in the House to share my views on Bill 
C-37, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois agree that youth crime is a very 
serious problem. The media regularly inform us of specific 
crimes that are so violent that no one can remain indifferent.
<P>
	Examples abound and remind us constantly that violence 
pervades all levels and all aspects of our society. Our task is to 
ensure that our laws put a stop to such heinous crimes while 
clearly demonstrating that we have no tolerance for crime.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the amendments to the Young Offenders Act 
tabled by the justice minister will in my opinion worsen the 
present situation by virtue of the repressive approach taken.
<P>
	Bill C-37 proposes three fundamental amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act. Firstly, the bill proposes longer 
sentences. Secondly, it would send to adult court young 16 and 
17 year olds accused of offences involving serious bodily harm.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Thirdly, the bill would improve the methods of sharing 
information between the police, the judiciary and certain 
members of the public. These three amendments to the act are 
fundamental and alter certain basic principles of the present 
legislation. To begin, then, longer sentences clearly demonstrate 
that the principles of prevention and rehabilitation, although 
mentioned in the first paragraph of the new bill, are no longer 
government objectives.
<P>
	The proposal regarding greater accessibility of information is 
somewhat similar. What the minister is proposing is to make the 
offender realize that he is a criminal. As a constant reminder, 
authorities will inform the offender's community, classmates 
and teachers, as well as his neighbours. Instead of encouraging 
rehabilitation to any degree, this approach will, on the contrary, 
etch in the young person's mind that, from that point on, he is 
considered a criminal, a public enemy. This approach is like 
branding young offenders and dangerously compromises their 
chances of rehabilition.
<P>
	Also, transferring 16 and 17 year olds who have committed 
``violent'' crimes to adult court raises many concerns. Firstly, 
this amendment is futile since most violent cases are already 
being transferred to adult court at the request of crown 
prosecutors. In addition, these amendments go against the grain 
of Quebec's system.
<P>
	Over the years, Quebec has developed a structure that strikes 
a real balance between protecting the public and rehabilitating 
delinquents. This structure also ensures that young people are 
taken in hand from the moment that they begin to exhibit 
behavioral problems or to compromise their health or safety. 
Also, under the Quebec system, young people are referred to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10058"> 10058 </A></B>
<P>
establishments run by the Department of Health and  Social 
Services, not by the Department of Justice. This shows that 
Quebec focuses its efforts on rehabilitation. In this sense, Bill 
C-37 undermines the very spirit of Quebec's current system.
<P>
	This bill is repressive. As I pointed out at the bill's first 
reading, there are two competing schools of thought regarding 
juvenile delinquency: one that centres on the young criminal, 
emphasizing arrest, referral to a court, sentencing and 
punishment, and one that centres on reintegration, focusing on 
the causes behind delinquency and attempting to put juvenile 
delinquents back on track, without increasing the likelihood of 
their becoming repeat offenders.
<P>
	It seems obvious to me that the second, which fosters 
prevention and rehabilitation, is the better school of thought. 
Criminologists recognize that criminal behaviour stems from 
more than one cause. It is most likely that crime results from a 
combination of related factors such as education, family 
situation, poverty, drug abuse, promotion of violence, 
unemployment or injustices. When this bill was tabled, the 
Minister of Justice told us that reintegration, prevention and 
rehabilitation would be integrated into his reforms.
<P>
	Yet, after reading this bill several times, I do not see a single 
measure reflecting this concern. Of course, there is the policy 
statement in section 1 of the bill, but not a word about it in the 
substantive sections. Section 1 is a smokescreen that tones down 
the repressive aspect of this bill. It becomes obvious that the 
federal government must review its approach to youth crime. 
We need a more realistic review, which would first address the 
social and economic realities behind crime and implement 
social development programs and initiatives focused on 
rehabilitation and prevention.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	This bill raised serious concerns in Quebec, not only among 
social and correctional authorities but also among politicians 
and academics. After Bill C-37 was tabled, Quebec's National 
Assembly gave almost unanimous support to a motion sending a 
very clear message to the federal Minister of Justice: ``Let us 
continue to address our problems in our own way''. There was 
also a general outcry from experts such as psychoeducators, 
criminologists, specialized lawyers and social workers.
<P>
	Quebec has often been a leader in the treatment of young 
offenders. As early as 1942, Quebec brought to 18 years the 
minimum age for assuming responsibility, a move that some 
other provinces followed only in 1982. Over the years, Quebec 
developed a whole structure, a system to maintain the right 
balance between protecting the public and rehabilitating young 
offenders, which is just as commendable a goal.
<P>
	It must be recognized that Quebec gave itself an innovative 
penal and social system to treat juvenile delinquency. For 
almost 15 years, Quebec has emphasized rehabilitation over 
mere repression. Our system strives to go beyond the surface to 
identify the underlying causes of delinquency and rejects the 
idea that life imprisonment is the only solution for delinquents 
with serious family and social problems.
<P>
	The young offender is quickly placed under the care of the 
Ministry of Health and Social Services and the youth protection 
directorate, with surprising results. According to several serious 
studies, society recoups its financial investment in the 
rehabilitation of a young murderer in less than five years 
through the young adult's productivity, through his work, his 
taxes and his purchasing power.
<P>
	In conclusion, we in the Bloc Quebecois strongly believe that 
rehabilitation and prevention are the only acceptable way to 
address youth crime. That is why we do not support Bill C-37.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak again on this bill to amend the Young Offenders 
Act, enacted in 1984 to replace the Juvenile Delinquents Act, 
and the existing federal legislation governing matters related to 
juvenile crime and justice in Canada.
<P>
	This bill sets a new legal framework to guide society's 
response to young people who contravene criminal law, 
basically. Many of its provisions are based on a legalistic 
approach with an emphasis on fair application of the law and the 
necessity for young persons to assume responsibility for their 
actions. However, because of their age and degree of maturity, 
young offenders obviously have special needs that require a 
level of assistance that just does not exist in the adult system. 
But the bill does not reinforce this aspect of assistance to young 
offenders.
<P>
	In this bill, a young person is no longer a person between the 
ages of 12 and 18 but one between the ages of 10 and 15, which 
means that anyone over sixteen will now be tried in adult court, 
while it will still be possible to transfer a young offender under 
sixteen to adult court.
<P>
	Essentially, this bill is driven by an arbitrary and unjustified 
wave of repression, promoting more heavy-handed judicial 
measures against young offenders, rather than effective 
preventive and rehabilitation measures.
<P>
	On this subject, like my colleagues, I will quote from the 
conclusions set out in the brief presented to the standing 
committee on justice by the Quebec Bar Association. In essence, 
it said: ``It is very clear that Bill C-37 was introduced in 
response to pressures by citizens demanding to be better 
protected through a more effective fight against serious crimes 
but repression did not appear to be the solution, and for good 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10059"> 10059 </A></B>
<P>
reasons we might add. Quebec found its own way of dealing with 
the problem and wants to continue using the successful approach 
of rehabilitation, or reorientation. All we are  asking for is to be 
able to maintain the good results we have achieved so far with 
respect to juvenile crime''.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Since 1984, the Young Offenders Act was amended twice, that 
is in 1986 and in 1992.
<P>
	In 1986, amendments were made to allow public disclosure of 
the identity of a young person accused or found guilty of a 
crime, when that person is a threat to the public, and when such 
disclosure is necessary to facilitate the arrest of that person.
<P>
	In 1992, the act was amended to increase the maximum 
sentence for murder from three to five years, that is three years 
in detention and two under mandatory supervision. However, if 
the young offender is considered to be a threat to public safety, 
he can be kept in custody for a period longer than three years.
<P>
	Also in 1992, the provisions regarding referrals to an adult 
court, in the case of serious crimes, were clarified. A young 
offender aged 14 or more must be referred to an adult court when 
the penalty that can be imposed by the youth court no longer 
ensures public safety, nor the rehabilitation of the offender.
<P>
	Consequently, since 1984, the provisions of the act have 
become stiffer.
<P>
	However, since the increase in crime rate for the year 1992 
only went up two per cent, compared to an average of five per 
cent in previous years, does this not confirm that the current act 
is sufficiently harsh and that there is no need to make it more 
repressive?
<P>
	Why not wait to see the results of the amendments made in 
1992? Since these amendments are relatively recent and also 
because of the statistical lag, it is difficult to evaluate their 
impact.
<P>
	In its brief, the Quebec Bar Association deplored this decision 
to proceed, first with the amendments and only then with a 
thorough review of the legislation and a study of the youth crime 
rate. Reversing the procedure would have made it possible, in 
addition to what Quebec has been able to bring to this area, to 
identify the mechanisms needed to make the system efficient 
and effective. Furthermore, a preliminary study of the youth 
crime rate would have made it possible to establish the impact of 
the amendments adopted in 1992 and find out whether their 
objective had been achieved, as would seem to be the case 
according to the latest judgments of the Appeal Court.
<P>
	The bar association concluded that Bill C-37 should be 
withdrawn. It goes on to say that if this is not politically 
feasible, the minister should at least postpone his review until he 
has examined the youth crime rate.
<P>
	Bill C-37 does nothing to deal with the problem of youth 
crime, and I think that is the crux of this debate. Until effective 
measures are put in place to prevent crime, we will go on 
amending our laws to make them more severe and repressive. 
We must look at the whole picture. Of course, penal laws are 
necessary, but they cannot deal with the factors that lie at the 
root of crimes against persons and property.
<P>
	Dealing with crime is not just a matter of sanctions but above 
all a matter of prevention and effective social reintegration.
<P>
	In a study for the Research Branch of the Library of 
Parliament, Patricia Bégin writes that it is becoming 
increasingly obvious that the methods traditionally used to keep 
crime in check do not suffice to eliminate crime and the fear it 
inspires. There is growing support for the concept that considers 
the social and economic environment that leads to criminal 
behaviour and for implementing programs and social 
development measures aimed at eliminating situations that are 
conducive to crime.
<P>
	In fact, the problem lies with the administration of justice and 
the application of the provisions of the Act. It seems that most 
violent crimes covered by the Young Offenders Act can be dealt 
with effectively under the existing legislation.
<P>
	Everything is in place: the provisions and the means to apply 
them. But the persons in charge either refuse to use them or get 
bogged down in unacceptable backlogs.
<P>
	In a story run by <I>La Presse</I> on June 8, 1994, Normand Bastien 
of the youth section at the Montreal community legal centre said 
that the long wait until sentencing is what really causes the 
problems. In Valleyfield, the average is 266 days, in Montreal, 
180, in Joliette, 163. Another major contributor to the problem 
is that only 29 per cent of the cases are resolved.
<P>
	Mr. Doob from the University of Toronto published a report 
called ``Beyond the Red Book'' following a workshop to 
identify amendments which should be made to the Young 
Offenders Act. In it he stated that there is no crisis among youth 
that would warrant fundamental or immediate changes to the 
Young Offenders Act. Amending the Young Offenders Act 
would probably have no significant effect on crime, he said.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, he implied that if the federal and provincial 
governments really were serious about protecting the public, 
they would invest more in crime prevention and in public 
awareness of juvenile delinquency. According to him it is 
cheaper and more effective to prevent crime than to keep young 
offenders in custody.
<P>
	Lastly, I would like to comment on the part of the bill on 
divulging information on young offenders. One of the underly-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10060"> 10060 </A></B>
<P>
ing principles of the Young Offenders Act is that  any 
information connecting a young offender to a crime is not to be 
divulged.
<P>
	This reflects a desire to prevent an individual from being 
labelled as a habitual offender at an age when he does not 
possess adult judgement. Repeated breaches in confidentiality 
in respect of a young offender's record will make it more 
difficult for him to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to point out that the former Quebec 
justice minister would have preferred the status quo and 
expressed concern and disappointment over Bill C-37. This 
reaction clearly shows that overlaps in the area of justice carry a 
high price, both administratively and in respect of the system's 
efficiency.
<P>
	In fact, Ottawa is venturing into a dead end for Quebec, but 
Quebec will be responsible for administering the system. Once 
again, the recommendations made by Quebec and by the bar 
association have been wholly forgotten.
<P>
	Recent statistics concerning average daily incarceration 
records for young offenders in 1992 appearing in the Statistics 
Canada publication <I>Juristat</I> indicate a rate of incarceration of 
10.4 per 10,000 young persons in Quebec. This is much lower 
than the average Canadian rate of 21.3. At 32 per 10,000 young 
persons, Saskatchewan has the highest rate of incarceration. 
What do these disparities mean?
<P>
	Similarly, in regard to cases heard before youth court ending 
in convictions, broken down by type of custody for 1992-93, the 
March 1994 issue of <I>Juristat</I> reports a total of 10,259 cases in 
Quebec with its population of nearly seven million, and 19,882 
in Alberta with a population one sixth the size. What can 
account for such a great difference, almost twice as many as in 
Quebec?
<P>
	As for cases before youth courts with guilty verdicts, broken 
down by province and territory, the January 1994 issue of 
<I>Juristat</I> reports a rate of 83.1 per cent in Quebec. In Yukon, the 
rate is 53 per cent, in Manitoba, 54 per cent and in Ontario, 61.2 
per cent. Are these provinces too eager to go to trial? I think this 
issue merits further reflection before new amendments to the act 
are passed into law. We will vote against this bill.

	The House resumed from February 16 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and other 
weapons, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to speak on Bill C-68. If only the people in the 
west could understand a little more French, they would hear the 
words of a Bloc member on a subject of considerable concern to 
them: the registration of firearms and other measures. This bill 
is extremely complex and has a lot of parts to it.
<P>
	My first reaction, in examining the bill, was to say that I never 
want Quebec to become a Florida or a Texas. I am not talking 
about the weather, but rather the matter of carrying arms. I do 
not want us to do what they do in Florida or Texas, where people 
head out on a Saturday evening with a gun in their pocket and 
often end up having the misfortune of settling accounts with a 
gun or some other firearm.
<P>
	This situation promotes violence. There is a good reason why 
statistics indicate a much higher rate of homicides and violent 
crime in the States than in Canada, even with the difference in 
population size. This, I feel, is one cultural difference that 
should be promoted in Quebec, perhaps in Canada as well. In my 
ideal society, with a sovereign Quebec, there will be fewer 
reasons for and causes of violence. I dream of a tolerant country, 
one that respects human values. I dream of a country where 
people can talk freely and democratically and where they will 
not need to use firearms to settle accounts.
<P>
	For me, the point of supporting a sovereign Quebec, is to keep 
the difference, for various reasons. This is just one of many 
reasons, because there is a very big difference between the 
position taken by most Canadians and that taken by most 
Americans when it comes to firearms. But a similarity now 
seems to be arising between the two countries when we listen to 
the Reform  Party. In their push for no restrictions on the right to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10061"> 10061 </A></B>
<P>
carry firearms, they have advanced certain American 
arguments, such as the one whereby mandatory registration of 
firearms or limited access to them would be an attack on 
personal freedom. This is utter nonsense.
<P>
	It is not at all difficult to understand the Americans' point of 
view. The right to carry firearms is part of their culture, as it 
were. The West was won with guns. Far more Americans carry 
guns than do Canadians and, if I am not mistaken, the use of 
firearms is a right in the States. In fact, I wonder if it is not 
enshrined in the American Constitution and if Americans will 
therefore be obliged to live with much wider access to firearms 
than is permitted here in Canada.
<P>
	When the statistics on homicides and violence are compared 
for Canada and the United States, they are, not surprisingly, 
much higher for the United States.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	In 1991, there were 753 homicides in Canada, compared with 
24,000 in the United States. These statistics are mind-boggling. 
They moved the judicial committee of the American Senate to 
declare that the United States was the most violent and 
self-destructive nation in the world.
<P>
	Being a reasonable person, I cannot rule out the fact that the 
very large number of firearms in the United States contributes, 
in some degree, to this difference, to this very high level of 
violence and murders in that country. When we see, for example, 
in Florida or elsewhere, people using rifles to shoot at drivers on 
the freeway, I would rather do everything in my power to build a 
country where people do not have to experience such extreme, 
absurd violence. I would rather encourage the development of a 
country where violence is being reduced. I know that it is no 
easy task. The bottom line is that we must create an environment 
where people feel safe and comfortable.
<P>
	People who support the free movement of or access to 
weapons argue that pistols or rifles provide better protection 
against violence. This is a frequently used argument in the U.S., 
where the murder rate is extremely high. There are 
proportionally three times as many murders in the U.S. as in 
Canada. Again, I do not think that getting a weapon is a good 
way to protect oneself. On the contrary, I think that arming 
oneself is an incitement to violence. All human wisdom since 
the beginning of western civilization demonstrates that violence 
begets violence. All the evidence shows that those who arm 
themselves are getting ready for violence.
<P>
	To reduce violence in society, it would be quite reasonable to 
try to restrict access to firearms. After all, what are firearms for, 
if not for killing? Firearms are designed to shoot and kill. 
Firearms are extremely dangerous weapons and their access 
should be restricted. It is normal and reasonable for a 
self-respecting country to want to reduce violence in society.
<P>
	Of course, sportsmen who use weapons for hunting, farmers 
who use them to put down sick animals or for other reasons, all 
those with specific reasons to use firearms should have access to 
them. I am not arguing with that. But, in general, firearms 
should be abolished or access to them should be restricted at 
least. Handguns have no place in the cities. No one should have 
access to firearms without sound reasons.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The problem is that Bill C-68 does very little in that regard. It 
may be a step in the right direction, but it does not do what the 
public wanted it to do.
<P>
	Surveys have been conducted on the registration and 
possession of firearms. They show clearly that more than 80 per 
cent of Canadians and 91 per cent of Quebecers wish that access 
to firearms were made more difficult, that it not be so easy to 
acquire firearms. They also wish that military assault weapons 
and handguns be banned and that stricter controls be imposed on 
the sale of firearms. That is what one public opinion poll after 
another has shown.
<P>
	The vast majority of Canadians and Quebecers are against 
unrestricted access to firearms in Canada. Apparently, the 
government failed to represent this view in Bill C-68. We know 
that many interests are involved.
<P>
	Besides the public at large, there are manufacturers, 
associations promoting the use of firearms, a number of 
individuals who are particularly fond of firearms, which they 
think are symbols of strength and power. These people seem to 
have a rather major influence on the government. While being in 
the minority, they have pressured the government into making 
this bill not as stringent as it could have been.
<P>
	If the intent had been to come up with a serious, progressive, 
forward-looking bill aimed at looking after the interests of the 
majority, the bill would have had more teeth. I should add that 
Bill C-68 is not a bad piece of legislation. It contains some good 
provisions, while others are definitely bad.
<P>
	However, it is an improvement over the current act. The intent 
of the bill is good. If it is felt that registering firearms will limit 
access to such weapons, assuming that is the underlying 
principle of the legislation, then it is a good thing. However, it 
remains to be seen whether this will indeed be the case.
<P>
	This is an improvement over the old system which was 
absurd. In the past, anyone could buy a firearm. The buyer had to 
register the firearm, along with his name and address, in an 
inventory which was checked by the Quebec and Ontario 
provincial police, or by the RCMP elsewhere in the country. 
That was a summary verification to see if the names, addresses 
and serial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10062"> 10062 </A></B>
<P>
numbers were properly indicated. However, if the register got 
lost or was destroyed by fire, that was it. No trace of its contents 
was left.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	That registration process was really a joke. It was a mere 
formality which had little impact and which was useless in terms 
of monitoring who had access to firearms.
<P>
	I should point out that, along with this very limited control 
over the sales of firearms, the current legislation also provides 
for the delivery of permits to carry and store guns. However, the 
existing law is essentially inadequate.
<P>
	Bill C-68 contains some good and some not so good 
provisions. If I have time to do so, I would like to make a few 
suggestions to improve its content.
<P>
	First of all, Bill C-68 proposes to establish a licensing system 
for persons wishing to possess firearms. In other words, it 
establishes a system for the registration of all firearms. Controls 
in this bill include a check to confirm the absence of public 
safety concerns before the transfer, transport, import or export 
of a firearm. It imposes restrictions on other dangerous articles 
such as cross-bows, certain knives and silencers. It revises the 
Criminal Code to impose stricter sentencing, and it includes a 
scheme for prohibiting, as a result of criminal conduct, a person 
from future possession of firearms.
<P>
	I think we can say that this last restriction, which would 
prohibit access to firearms by criminals, is entirely acceptable 
and desirable.
<P>
	I think that any legislation that prohibits a criminal from 
having access to a firearm is a boon to the general public.
<P>
	As far as stricter sentencing is concerned, there might be a 
little more to say. There are certainly some positive aspects. I 
will not have enough time to discuss the firearms registration 
mechanism as such. I would have quite a few questions about the 
system for the registration and storage of information and 
whether the proposed system is better than what we have now. 
There would be a lot to say about this, but unfortunately my time 
is limited.
<P>
	There are some very good points, and I am thinking, for 
instance, of the obligation to register all firearms. At least the 
police would have a way to enforce a court order prohibiting an 
aggressor from possessing firearms. In addition to criminals, 
this would also apply to the guy who beats his wife every 
Saturday night. He may not have a criminal record as a bank 
robber or murderer, but it seems to me he should not have a 
weapon, at least not a firearm, in his home. He should seek 
treatment if he beats his wife, of course, and at least, he should 
not have access to a firearm. So this bill would allow the police 
to prohibit certain people from possessing firearms-
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see you are signalling that my time is almost 
up. I thought I had twenty minutes. Are you sure I have only one 
minute left? I thought I had five or ten minutes left.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I may be of assistance, 
the hon. member started his speech at 12.55 p.m., almost twenty 
minutes ago.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Thank you for that information, Mr. Speaker. 
I shall therefore conclude very quickly by saying that this bill 
contains both good and bad. In my opinion, this system will be 
expensive. Once again, registering weapons is not a bad thing, 
but in looking at this bill the following questions come to mind. 
Will it prevent someone from registering his weapon? Will it 
prevent someone from killing his neighbour if he so wishes? 
Will it prevent a young person from committing suicide with a 
gun? Will registration be truly beneficial for society in the long 
term? Will it reduce crime rates? I rather have my doubts, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to the speech and I have heard remarks like violence 
begets violence, firearms are meant to kill, and access should be 
limited.
<P>
	I do not know how much of the hon. member's speech related 
to the issue we are wrestling with in Bill C-68, that is bringing 
forward a bill that enhances the safety of our communities, 
homes and society.
<P>
	If the member honestly believes the registration of rifles and 
shotguns will reduce the criminal use of these firearms, would 
he tell the House how that will do it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> How will registering arms reduce the level of 
criminality? I do not believe it will necessarily. Bill C-68 has a 
great number of flaws. I really do not believe it will necessarily 
reduce criminality.
<P>
	On the other hand registration is not such a bad thing. We 
register practically everything. Our cars are registered. We are 
registered when we are born. We are registered when we get 
married. Every important element and tool of one's life is 
registered. It is a normal fact of life. The problem is that not 
registering arms is abnormal. There is a certain abnormality in 
not registering arms particularly because arms are very 
dangerous tools. They are weapons.
<P>
	Normally they are used to harm or kill people. I am not talking 
about sportsmen who hunt or farmers who use arms to protect 
themselves from predators. Those are very special cases. How-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10063"> 10063 </A></B>
<P>
ever there are other uses. I am talking about the Saturday night 
special, the AK-47 and other arms that are ascribed within the 
atmosphere of violence, protection, rights, liberty and so on. 
They should certainly be limited.
<P>
	If registering arms could help reduce the number of arms 
circulating in Canada, that would be a positive step. I do not 
think it is harmful to anyone, even collectors who have arms or 
who love arms, to suggest that their arms should be registered.
<P>
	As I say there are a lot of flaws in the bill, but there are 
positive points in the sense that the government is trying to go in 
the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member commented that he was not sure whether or not 
registration would reduce crime in Canada. I would like to pose 
a proposition to him and possibly he might consider whether or 
not crime would be affected.
<P>
	Statistics have shown that since 1974 some 16,000 firearms 
have been reported lost, missing or stolen. We can imagine how 
many guns are lost, missing or stolen that have not been 
reported. These guns are out of the control of the legal owner. 
They are now out there most probably in the hands of the 
criminal element in society.
<P>
	Certainly we can imagine that the registration of firearms 
brings to bear a greater responsibility on the careful gun owner 
and should do something to ensure that gun owners take a 
greater level of care.
<P>
	The member may also wish to know gun clubs are now 
reporting that many gun owners are getting rid of their guns. 
Many of them report that something like 60 per cent of gun 
owners have not fired a gun in the last year and some 40 per cent 
have not fired their firearms in the last five years.
<P>
	In that regard, because fewer guns would be available to the 
criminal element, would the member not agree that registration 
of firearms would reduce crime in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not opposed to the 
legitimate use of firearms for those people who have good 
reason such as sportsmen and farmers, to use two examples. 
However I have questions about whether registration would do 
anything to help reduce criminality.
<P>
	I have a hypothetical example. If the system worked perfectly, 
in other words there was a control system somewhere in Ottawa 
where all firearms would be listed in a little computer and we 
would have a complete list of all firearms everywhere in the 
country, does the member think those people who have illegal 
projects in mind might be able to get their hands on that list and 
determine that Joe Schmoe living on such and such a street has 
an awful good collection of firearms? It would incite a certain 
number of people to go to Joe Schmoe's house and steal all his 
firearms. It is a way of possibly encouraging the illegal use of 
firearms. Registering the firearms does not necessarily have an 
effect on criminality.
<P>
	There is another flaw in this law. If we register firearms it will 
not prevent Joe Schmoe from shooting his neighbour on a 
Saturday night. It is not because his firearm is registered that he 
will not kill his neighbour. It being a registered firearm will not 
prevent his son or daughter from killing himself or herself. It 
does not prevent anything at all.
<P>
	However, if the minister had been conscientious and had gone 
the limit, he would have demanded from the moment a firearm 
was sold in Canada that it had a control mechanism, in other 
words one needed a key to be able to use it. It can be done. 
Technically we can control the use of firearms in the sense that a 
key would be needed to open it and use it. As long as it is locked, 
whether it is sitting on the back seat of the car or in the living 
room, it could not be used as readily. One would need the key to 
use the firearm. At least that measure would limit the misuse of 
firearms.
<P>
	Many other suggestions could be made, but I do not believe 
registering firearms would necessarily have an effect on the 
reduction of criminality in Canada in spite of the fact that I think 
this measure is a step in the right direction. Despite the fact that 
the Bloc will suggest improvements for the proposed law we 
will probably support it.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to 
debate Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons. 
The debate before us is a complicated and highly emotional one 
for all those involved and implicated in the bill.
<P>
	Aboriginal people, for instance, are worried about the 
potential infringement on their treaty rights. Shooters are 
concerned with the restrictions placed on their sport and 
outfitters are worried about the impact the legislation will have 
on their business. These are all serious concerns which if not 
addressed could pose some serious hardships in the north and of 
course in other parts of Canada.
<P>
	The potential infringement the legislation could have on 
treaty rights and its impact on traditional aboriginal way of life 
are threats that aboriginal people have sought to prevent since 
the signing of their treaties. Treaties were signed to ensure the 
protection of aboriginal rights that were then entrenched in the 
Constitution under section 35 of the charter.
<P>
	As treaty rights go or as rights go in aboriginal country, rights 
are considered and treated as absolute but in the reality of the 
political world and in the name of concessions, compromise and 
goodwill we are looking at some half-measures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10064"> 10064 </A></B>
<P>
	According to the Sparrow decision of 1990 hunting and 
fishing rights have been recognized by the Canadian 
government. It would appear to be damaging to the fragile 
relationship being forged between the aboriginal people and the 
Government of Canada if the bill infringed on these rights.
<P>
	This is the concern being expressed. However I have 
assurances that the legislation will not infringe on these rights. 
Special considerations have been given to sustenance hunters 
and in particular aboriginal hunters who make up a large portion 
of all sustenance hunters.
<P>
	Let me, for instance, express the concern brought forward by 
Mr. Sam Gargan, member of the Legislative Assembly for the 
Northwest Territories for Deh Cho, who said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have an uncle who cannot read or write. He cannot tell you what muzzle 
velocity means. He cannot tell you how calibres are determined. He can 
however tell you that you need a .303 to shoot a moose, that it is best to use a 
shotgun to shoot ducks, that a .22 is the best for rabbits and upland birds. He can 
tell you not to carry a loaded gun with a live round in the chamber. He can tell 
you how to safely transport a gun in a truck or a boat.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The same would apply to a skidoo. He continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Gun ownership is not rocket science. It is a matter of common sense. In the 
NWT the vast majority of gun owners have been taught gun safety at a very 
young age and I sincerely believe that any program on gun safety to be offered 
in the NWT has to be changed to fit the realities of the situation both fiscally and 
morally.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Gargan went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I also believe that the legislation, as it now stands, violates treaty rights as 
guaranteed in the Charter of Rights and may well be in contradiction of the 
Sparrow decision-To this end I can virtually assure you that should this 
legislation proceed as written, there would be a court challenge from Canada's 
aboriginal community.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are the words of a member of the Legislative Assembly 
of the Northwest Territories, the majority of whose constituents 
are aboriginal.
<P>
	In the north the aboriginal people hunt to eat, not to harm 
other people. Many northern people living in isolated or remote 
communities cannot afford the inflated northern prices of meat. 
We cannot just go out and order half a side of beef at southern 
prices. The cost of living is 40 per cent higher.
<P>
	Today in southern stores such as Loeb a kilogram of ground 
beef costs $3.95.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	The same kilogram of beef in Deline in a community is $6.80. 
This makes hunting and owning a rifle not only a right but an 
economic reality. Hunting in an aboriginal community is also a 
community event. Food that is caught or that is hunted is shared 
with everyone. Hunters donate food to those who are unable to 
hunt for themselves such as elders and widowers and people who 
are disabled. Without firearms many in the north could not 
afford to eat.
<P>
	My experience with firearms has been since I was a child, 
since as long as I can remember. In my family we learned gun 
safety. It was absolutely paramount. The camp where my parents 
go on an annual basis is in grizzly bear country. In grizzly bear 
country you do not just have a .22 rifle. You must have a high 
powered rifle. I must say if you are going to have a key 
mechanism to use, please do not do it when you are in grizzly 
bear country if you want to live to see another day.
<P>
	The realities are very different around this country and I 
understand the intent of this bill. I understand the complexity. I 
understand the difficulty the minister has had to deal with this 
bill across the country.
<P>
	I cannot imagine having the fortitude to go out there to meet 
the masses on such a complicated and emotional bill. I would 
like to say that I admire this man for having done that. However, 
the debate rolls on and the bill has gone to committee. The bill is 
being debated today. There are a number of special things that 
will happen.
<P>
	My hon. colleague across the way from the Bloc Quebecois 
indicated that most times the use of firearms is intended to hurt 
or kill another person. That has not been my experience. It has 
allowed us to live. It has allowed us to overcome difficulties.
<P>
	During the war, during the depression and during recessions 
in Canada our people were able to survive because we have 
instruments that allow us to exercise the right to be able to fend 
for and feed our people. Those instruments in most cases in 
modern terms are not bow and arrows. They are firearms. That is 
one of the instruments we use to exercise that right.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice in his commitment not to impact 
treaty rights has struck a team of officials who will travel and 
meet with aboriginal groups across Canada to discuss how this 
bill can be implemented without negatively impacting treaty 
rights and the traditional way of life.
<P>
	These consultations have been directly mandated in this 
legislation. Section 110 allows for the governor in council to 
make regulations on aboriginal people and to adapt the 
regulations for the purposes of that application.
<P>
	Michell Adkins, a Haida lawyer, was recently hired by the 
Department of Justice to consult with aboriginal people. Along 
with other departmental officials, she will be travelling to 
communities to explain the legislation, to listen to their 
concerns and make recommendations to the minister on how to 
amend this legislation with respect to treaties and traditional 
life.
<P>
	There are many issues that need to be addressed in the 
consultations. The Minister of Justice has suggested the 
necessity of finding a better definition of sustenance hunter to 
reflect the aboriginal way of life.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10065"> 10065 </A></B>
<P>
	He is also committed from what I am being informed by 
departmental officials to decentralize the role of the firearms 
officer and provide community control of the implementation 
of this new firearm strategy, ensuring aboriginal participation.
<P>
	I would like to encourage all of the First Nations, Metis and 
Inuit people to take full advantage of these consultations to 
ensure that the registration of firearms can be done in full 
consideration of their treaty rights, especially with respect to 
Sparrow and section 35 of the charter.
<P>
	Some of the issues which have already been brought to the 
minister's attention will be addressed and among the 
consultations is the cost of registration. Currently under Bill 
C-68 there will not be a charge for sustenance hunters to obtain 
a firearms licence. However, there are no clear guidelines on 
how fees will be applied in registering firearms and the 
transferring of ownership of guns.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	Through consultations with First Nations, Metis and Inuit, it 
is my hope that an amendment can be made to eliminate the cost 
of transferring and registration of firearms by sustenance 
hunters, as these costs would be an economic hardship on people 
who cannot afford to buy their food and use their firearms as a 
tool to feed themselves and their communities.
<P>
	It is felt that it would be an additional economic hardship in a 
community that already has quite a large group of unemployed 
people who rely on other sources to continue living and 
surviving.
<P>
	Borrowing and lending firearms is another very important 
issue for the northern and aboriginal communities across this 
country. Under Bill C-68 there is the provision for lending a 
firearm as long as the person involved lends the borrower the 
registration certificate for the firearm. Through consultations it 
is hoped that alternatives to this option can be sought. In many 
communities firearms are seen as a collective instrument for 
hunting passed on to those who need them.
<P>
	Hunting rifles are commonly loaned to relatives and friends in 
aboriginal communities on a regular basis. Through 
consultation I hope that the registration program will be flexible 
enough to allow this practice to continue without undue and 
unnecessary hardship.
<P>
	We understand that in the context of harvesting and hunting it 
is very difficult in isolated and remote communities to acquire 
registration and firearms acquisition certificates. When you are 
in a boat and you see a caribou it is very difficult to resist the 
opportunity to get the kill for the community or for the family, 
relatives or the elders. There is a general lending of firearms. It 
is a very big issue in the communities in terms of their 
traditional harvesting and hunting rights.
<P>
	The transfer of ownership is another area which is of much 
concern. The gift of a firearm is very common in the north. 
Under Bill C-68 a gift of firearms can only be given once all the 
necessary papers are filled out and both the recipient and the 
donor have licences and neither one is a safety risk. Again, 
through detailed consultations provisions should be made to 
reflect the culture of First Nations, Metis and Inuit where the 
gift of a firearm is considered a great honour, especially when 
given to a youth for his or her first hunt. It is an honour and it is 
something that is protected, keeping in mind all the issues about 
safety that go along with the responsibility of owning that gun. It 
also entails using it safely and bearing in mind the safety of 
others.
<P>
	On penal sanctions for people who accidentally find 
themselves on the other side of the law, through consultation I 
hope that alternatives can also be found to some of the penal 
sanctions for offenders who have committed an offence out of 
ignorance. Summary convictions are available in Bill C-68 to 
first time offenders which would not require that a person 
develop a criminal record on a first time offence.
<P>
	I am also encouraged by the partial prohibition provision in 
this legislation. A sustenance hunter who has been charged with 
an offence involving a firearm may apply to a competent 
authority to allow for the hunter to use his or her firearms for 
sustenance as long as the hunter returned it to the authority, 
which could be the chief on returning from hunting. A great deal 
of trust and a great deal of respect would have to be in place and 
a great sense of responsibility under those conditions.
<P>
	Another aspect is the purchase of ammunition. I am amazed 
that I have not run out of time yet because this a very emotional, 
very complicated and a very important matter. I do not think I 
can undersell the importance of this legislation to people across 
this country, not just in my own riding but in other parts of the 
provinces and territories.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	In many communities those who cannot hunt will provide 
ammunition to hunters as a gift in hope of meat and other kinds 
of game when the hunters return. That is a common occurrence. I 
hope through consultation with aboriginal groups an 
amendment can be entertained allowing aboriginal people to 
purchase ammunition when they do not have a licence to give as 
a gift.
<P>
	It is not uncommon for a senior citizen on pension who cannot 
go hunting, who does not have a skidoo, who does not have the 
physical stamina to go on the hunt anymore, to give to a younger 
person the gift of ammunition for the sake of a hunt. It is very 
reasonable and it is good economics for the people in the 
community.
<P>
	These are only some of the concerns about how Bill C-68 
would impact the aboriginal way of life. I am encouraged by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10066"> 10066 </A></B>
<P>
minister that these and other concerns  will be dealt with through 
consultations with aboriginal people.
<P>
	Northerners have also brought several questions to my 
attention which have either been addressed in Bill C-68 or the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs has been 
mandated to review. I would also like to outline their concerns 
here.
<P>
	First of all, there is always the question about why the 
government is attacking law-abiding gun owners. Many legal 
owners feel that the government is attacking law-abiding gun 
owners with this new legislation. However, Bill C-68 creates a 
new act for firearms. This new statute, the Firearms Act, 
removes legal gun owners from the Criminal Code. This 
consideration to gun owners demonstrates the government's 
intention not to treat legal gun owners as criminals. This new act 
will create a licensing system for the ownership and use of 
firearms and a national registration system for all firearms. As I 
mentioned before, special provisions have been made for first 
time offenders who have not used a non-registered firearm in a 
criminal offence.
<P>
	The next concern is equipment outlawed from the Canadian 
Olympic shooting team. Others have asked why equipment used 
by the Canadian Olympic shooting team has been prohibited. 
The minister has acknowledged that amendments or exceptions 
should be made for certain handguns in the prohibited class 
which are used and recognized in target shooting competitions. 
The minister has specifically requested that the standing 
committee on justice deliberate on possible solutions to this 
current problem.
<P>
	Restriction to non-residents is another major one. There are 
many hunting, outfitting and tourist businesses in the north and 
other parts of Canada that depend on hunters from other 
countries for their business. They have voiced several concerns 
that Bill C-68 will impose further restrictions on the entry of 
those foreign hunters and are concerned that they will choose to 
go to another country to hunt where the laws are not so 
restricting.
<P>
	I have reviewed the requirements of the entry of any foreign 
hunter into Canada and I do not see a problem as such. A person 
coming from another country must declare their firearm at 
customs. They will be required to complete a temporary 
firearms licence and a registration certificate to bring the 
firearm into Canada.
<P>
	A customs firearm declaration will act as a 60-day licence 
and certificate and will be validated at the border. The Minister 
of Justice and his departmental officials assure me that these 
forms will be as simple as possible. These declarations will be 
readily available to visitors through Canadian tourism offices 
abroad, outfitters, shooting clubs and hunting organizations. 
There will be opportunities for non-residents to apply in 
advance to speed up the process at the border.
<P>
	In the case of sporting clubs, as has always been the case the 
requirements can be met before crossing the border through 
Canadian clubs and associations. An authorization to transport 
will be issued at the same time. Should a hunter lose his 
ammunition he will be able to present his customs firearms 
declaration which will act as a temporary license, enabling the 
hunter to purchase ammunition.
<P>
	I suppose I could go on but I must be close to being out of 
time. Within two minutes I will attempt to deal with this really 
important issue.
<P>
	I am going to deal with people's concern about prohibited 
antique gun collection. A common question is how to pass on or 
sell an antique gun collection. Individuals who now have a 
grandfathered firearm which falls into a specific prohibited 
category will be able to buy from and sell to individuals with 
firearms in the same category.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Also, the minister has asked the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs to deliberate on the special 
significance possession of firearms as relics or heirlooms may 
have on a family and what opportunities there will be for owners 
to leave such firearms to their children as part of their estate.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to take the opportunity to thank the 
numerous members of shooting clubs, such as Barry Taylor from 
my riding, who have devoted thousands of hours to teaching 
firearms safety. Their work in the north ensures the safe 
handling of many guns.
<P>
	I would also like to thank all of those people who have brought 
their concerns on gun control to my attention. We have the 
minister's assurance that there will be special efforts to look at 
these concerns. I encourage all aboriginal people and northern 
people to participate in the consultations to ensure the 
protection of their rights. It is my hope that through these 
consultations a mutual respect and understanding can be forged 
between the consultation team and aboriginal people.
<P>
	I also encourage all northerners to participate in the 
deliberation of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs and to write to the chair of the committee, the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, or myself with their 
opinions on how to improve the current piece of legislation.
<P>
	I would like to thank the House and you, Mr. Speaker, for 
giving me an opportunity to speak to the very special, emotional 
and complicated matter of Bill C-68.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the hon. member's speech on 
Bill C-68. I share some of her concerns about northerners, how 
they will react to increased regulation, universal registration, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10067"> 10067 </A></B>
<P>
and in particular her comments on how aboriginal hunters will 
view the added regulations and restrictions being placed upon 
them.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member deals with Bill C-34, the 
Yukon self-government bill, which was passed in this House 
last June. It was my understanding that Bill C-34 gave control 
and prohibition over firearms and explosive devices to the new 
levels of native governments in the Yukon.
<P>
	Has the hon. member researched that at all? If so, does it mean 
they are in effect exempt from the new regulations in Bill C-68 
once it is passed? If they are exempt because of the clauses in 
Bill C-34 which give control over firearms to the native 
governments, does she feel it right that some Canadian citizens 
should be exempt from Canada's laws based strictly on race?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, the unique legal and 
constitutional rights of aboriginal people have nothing to do 
with race. They have to do with a legally and constitutionally 
binding arrangement between the Government of Canada and 
those said peoples.
<P>
	As for the Yukon legislation, I am not a lawyer nor am I a 
self-government specialist. I have raised a number of issues 
today regarding rights and I do not think they have anything to 
do with any kind of racial overtones. They have to do very 
specifically with the traditional way of life which has been 
exercised and practised for hundreds of years. Perhaps the 
instruments to exercise those rights have changed. In 
contemporary terms we are talking about firearms.
<P>
	I resent what the hon. member across the way is alleging. He 
is insinuating that aboriginal people have something which is 
exempt, unique and special and which nobody else can have. 
That is not the case. It is unique to aboriginal populations.
<P>
	I am aware of the position the Council of Yukon Indians has 
taken and it can speak best for itself. I cannot speak for the 
aboriginal people of the Yukon, except that I know they have a 
grave concern. They will have the opportunity to speak to 
Michell Adkins and also present their concerns to the standing 
committee. They can adequately speak to that. I would probably 
under-represent their views.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, many of the concerns 
expressed by the hon. member apply not only to aboriginal 
people but to rural people in general.
<P>
	For example, she spoke of that first rifle. One of the proudest 
days of my life was my 11th birthday when I received my first 
firearm. Like the hon. member I was a sustenance hunter for a 
period of time. We were hard up. We ate the meat we killed.
<P>
	These laws that are going to come in will be just as restrictive, 
just as oppressive on non-native rural people as they will be on 
the people who live for example in the Northwest Territories. I 
would hope that rather than taking up the cudgels against the rest 
of us who oppose this bill that she would join with us on behalf 
of the people of the north, on behalf of aboriginal people and 
realize that we are all in this together. We are all facing 
unreasonable restrictions in legislation here. It is not just the 
natives.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the 
same offer to the members of the Reform Party. Instead of just 
beating their breasts about their own rights and how hard done 
by they are, perhaps they would take up the issue of aboriginal 
rights and for a change support aboriginal people on the question 
of their rights which they know are legitimate and legally and 
constitutionally binding.
<P>
	I make this offer because since I have been in this House I 
have never on any occasion, not on land claims, on services for 
aboriginal people, on programs for aboriginal people and never 
on self-government have I heard an expression of support for 
aboriginal people by that group. I am making them the offer to 
come and support the aboriginal people as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to compliment the hon. secretary of state on her 
eloquent representation of her people. I have two native reserves 
in my riding of Bruce-Grey, the Saugeen and Cape Croker. The 
member quite eloquently represented the position they find 
themselves in.
<P>
	As a rural member I must also speak on behalf of the hunters, 
trappers, farmers and other rural people whose lives are 
different from most people. They have needs. In this case they 
are a minority. If we took a poll perhaps the majority of people 
would be against guns, but rural people have a different 
orientation, a different history, a real need. This bill in its 
current state could constitute some hardships for them.
<P>
	I must compliment the minister on the smuggling penalties 
and the penalties for the use of a firearm in the commission of a 
crime. I hope that somehow the concerns of rural people can be 
accommodated in this bill.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not feel that rural people do have 
similar needs to aboriginal people, particularly in ridings such 
as Bruce-Grey?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10068"> 10068 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I never disallowed the 
fact that members opposite or my hon. colleague here have 
legitimate concerns on behalf of their rural constituents or 
those people who hunt for sustenance and are non-aboriginal. 
I never disallowed that fact.
<P>
	When I speak, the perspective I am speaking from is one I am 
very familiar and intimate with. It is one that I know inside out. I 
know the living situation, the personal experiences and human 
struggles of these people. I want to speak from that experience. I 
cannot speak as well for other groups. I can go out there to 
represent them if they ask me.
<P>
	These are very specific issues, specific to a number of 
northern constituents. It could be northern provinces. It could be 
aboriginal people across the country. I can speak most expertly 
about what I know. That is the perspective I am speaking from, 
not to the prejudice of other groups.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
spoke quite eloquently about hope for change in this legislation. 
I too hope for change in this legislation, but I listened to the 
justice minister make a very specific comment when he 
presented this legislation. That comment was that the 
consultation was literally over.
<P>
	Does the member know something that I do not about the 
consultation process? Is it wide open? Are we in fact subject to 
significant change in this legislation? I would be very interested 
in knowing that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish the hon. member 
would not be so suspicious and so cynical. It does not help the 
whole issue of national unity or anything else for that matter.
<P>
	The hon. member knows, as all members know, that there is a 
standing committee. The chairman is sitting in this House today 
as he well can see. Also, Michell Adkins and a group of officials 
are travelling across the country. Perhaps the members of the 
Reform Party will take it upon themselves to ensure that the 
groups in their ridings have access to both the standing 
committee as well as to the special group of officials travelling 
across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
has raised a couple of interesting points that I would like to 
address very briefly.
<P>
	First, there are two groups of aboriginal people in my 
constituency and I work very closely with them. My most recent 
meeting with the chief was on Thursday night. I object to the 
innuendo that we are not working with these people and that we 
do not treat them as equals. I take exception to that.
<P>
	In terms of consultations, I do have a letter from the minister 
in response to my request to come to my riding for further 
consultation. Thousands of people would have attended. Of 
course I was turned down because the consultations are over.
<P>
	Also you mention in your speech about rights-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker:</B> I am sure the hon. member was referring to me 
but I did not make the speech. He must refer to the Chair. My 
colleagues, I am going to give the hon. member for Red Deer the 
floor right after question period. However, it being 2 p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to 
statements by members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
scientists have predicted that global temperatures could 
increase 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius over the next century. The 
cause is greenhouse gases from human activities and in 
particular, increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide. 
Greenhouse gases produce shifts in climate, in forest growth and 
agricultural patterns.
<P>
	Led by Alberta, Canada is among the highest per capita 
producer of carbon dioxide emissions. Yet ignoring the large 
problems coastal provinces would face because of rising sea 
levels and the further disruption of fisheries, the province of 
Alberta is adamantly opposed to comprehensive carbon dioxide 
reductions.
<P>
	The federal government repeatedly asked the provinces to 
co-operate and introduce mandatory carbon dioxide reductions. 
So far however, Alberta's inflexible position makes any 
meaningful reduction impossible and weakens our international 
reputation.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last Friday, instead of announcing the creation of 
homogeneous French-language school boards in Ontario, the 
provincial education minister once again chose to put off that 
decision. In fact, he created a committee mandated to rationalize 
the governance of education in Ontario. This committee is to 
deliver its report next December, that is after the Ontario 
provincial elections. Moreover, this committee with a majority 
of anglophones has been made responsible for the future of 
French-language school boards.
<P>
	Instead of taking action, Ontario goes on violating the 
Canadian Charter, which it signed of course, a charter which 
grants francophones the right to manage their schools.
<P>
	Instead of taking action, Ontario is letting the situation

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, government officials, whether municipal, provincial or 
federal, are elected to represent their constituents. Both the Parti 
Quebecois and Bloc Quebecois do not seem to agree with this. 
Their idea of a referendum is not to find out what the people of 
Quebec want but rather how to force them into accepting 
separation.
<P>
	Now the PQ and BQ want to water down the question so the 
issue remains unsettled. This presents a problem for all 
Canadians, including those in Quebec. Uncertainty is causing 
interest rates to rise, the dollar to fall and international credit to 
be re-examined. It is also likely to be partly responsible for the 
Liberal's failure to properly deal with the deficit for fear of 
upsetting Quebec.
<P>
	If the Parti Quebecois does not call the referendum with a 
clear question on separation within its own 1995 timetable, I call 
on the Prime Minister to hold a federal referendum in Quebec to 
settle this issue by year's end. This uncertainty must not 
continue.

	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to commend the Minister of Justice for his speed in 
tabling a bill on the subject of intoxication as a defence.
<P>
	All Canadians were outraged last autumn when a man 
convicted of rape had his conviction overturned by the Supreme 
Court on the grounds of extreme drunkenness. Many residents of 
my riding were concerned that this decision would be seen by 
some as a licence to commit offences while under the influence 
of drugs or alcohol.
<P>
	Allowing individuals to justify their acts of violence by 
blaming intoxication will hamper efforts to end violence in our 
society and cause further victimization.
<P>
	I am sure that all members of the House will join me in 
supporting the efforts of the Minister of Justice to eliminate this 
loophole in the criminal justice system.

Speaker, on March 31, 1993, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
declared in <I>La Presse</I> that all those who live in Quebec are 
Quebecers.
<P>
	The fine words of the leader of the official opposition do not 
seem to have been heard by his peers, since, in recent weeks, 
racist remarks by Quebec separatists have been on the increase.
<P>
	This weekend, Pierre Bourgault accused anglophones in 
Quebec of wanting to exercise a blatantly racist vote, while the 
Bloc Quebecois member for Louis-Hébert wanted ethnocultural 
communities to withdraw from the referendum debate and let 
old stock Quebecers decide the province's future.
<P>
	These statements are unacceptable in a democratic society 
such as ours, and we invite all Quebecers to refuse to participate 
in a sovereignty debate that is based on intolerance and racism.

	In the past few months, Irish and British officials have been

of violence in Ulster a thing of the past. Many Canadians, 
particularly those of Irish descent, wish the people of Northern 
Ireland well in this crucial transition period.

<P>
	There is one Michel Bélanger, a true statesman, a man of 
imposing presence and influence, who can inspire in Quebecers 
a healthy confidence in themselves.
<P>
	At the time he co-chaired the commission on the political and 
constitutional future of Quebec he was impervious to the

These days, Michel Bélanger has become the bogeyman.
<P>
	This man, who had raised the debate on the national issue to 
the level of pragmatism and a people's belief in itself, has been

MPs' pension plan but in reality has just changed troughs and 
given it a new look.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	This new plan is still much more lucrative than what a person 
in the private sector would receive. Basically it is nothing more 
than smoke and mirrors.
<P>
	The new package is still fully indexed to inflation, something 
78 per cent of the public does not enjoy. The accrual rate is twice 
the amount allowed for under the Income Tax Act and is 
therefore illegal.
<P>
	How can the government in good conscience ask overtaxed 
Canadians to tighten their belts while doing exactly the opposite 
itself?
<P>
	I ask every MP in the House to join hands with the rest of 
Canada and make a sacrifice by opting out of this hideous MP 
pension plan which still says to Canadians: ``We will line our 
pockets and tough luck to you''. I also applaud every MP who is 
opting out, especially my colleagues in the Reform Party.

government is trying hard to stifle discussion of its gun control 
legislation.
<P>
	The interest in, and demand for, copies of Bill C-68 is 
overwhelming. Initially the Minister of Justice limited MPs to 
just 15 copies. If that was not bad enough, we now find that the 
chief government whip has further ordered the House 
distribution centre to limit that number to five copies per 
member. Five copies among 75,000 or 100,000 citizens is hardly 
the open and honest government of the Liberal red book.
<P>
	Canadians are being denied their most basic democratic right; 
the right to understand and discuss the laws of the land.
<P>
	The last time such anti-democratic action was taken by a 
federal government was by the Conservative government of 
Brian Mulroney. The legislation-you guessed it-was gun 
control, Bill C-17.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the Saskatchewan Association of 
Responsible Firearms Owners that has been making copies of 
this legislation available for $5 each. Surely important issues 
deserve open and informed debate. Surely Canadians are 
entitled to access proposed legislation that affects them. Why 
does the Liberal government want to deprive Canadians?

<P>
	The Ontario Special Olympics are part of a worldwide

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a study 
published by an employee of the Department of National 
Defence found that Quebec is getting literally gypped out of 
$650 million per year in regional allotment of defence spending.
<P>
	It is simply scandalous to see that, over the past 15 years, 
Quebec has received 27 per cent less than its fair share of 
defence spending. To add insult to injury, the study confirmed 
that francophones are under-represented in the higher ranks of 
the army. For example, there is only one francophone 
lieutenant-general out of nine and three majors-general out of 
31. There has been no change on this front for at least 10 years.
<P>
	This sheds some light on the government's decision to close 
the only francophone military college. We are tired of seeing 
that, year in, year out, Quebecers have remained so poorly 
served by the federal system in Canada.

make the taxation system fairer by increasing taxes on the rich. 
Here is a Canadian tale that contradicts him.
<P>
	Two students did equally well in high school. One went to 
work at age 18. He had a good time, attended the rallies of the

university and graduate school, worked during the summer, 
lived frugally and invested wisely. He held his first full time job 
as a professional at age 28.
<P>
	Both men are now 50. The first makes $30,000 and pays 14 per 
cent of it as income tax. The second makes over $51,000. He 
belongs to the top 10 per cent of Canadians who pay 50 per cent 
of all income taxes.

less income taxes, not more as the minister suggests. I agree.

Awareness Week, March 5 to 11.
<P>
	For the second year in a row the CAO is focusing on its theme 
of vision connection to literacy. Although good vision is an 
essential building block for acquiring good reading skills, the 
linkage has not as yet been made prominent. For example, one in 
six children has a vision problem which makes it difficult to 
learn and read.
<P>
	Through the events organized this week through the CAO 
Canadians will come to see that the attainment of full literacy 
skills depends not only on proper instruction but on good 
eyesight as well. A study has shown that 75 per cent of adults 
with low literacy skills also have vision problems.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, according to a spokesperson for the White House, 
President Clinton plans to send American soldiers to Croatia and 
Bosnia to protect UN peacekeepers during their withdrawal, if 
they are to withdraw, now that the president of Croatia has 
refused to extend the peacekeeping mission after March 31.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell us whether, when the U.S. 
president was in Ottawa, he discussed with the president the 
plan to send massive numbers of American troops to allow the 
withdrawal of UN peacekeepers from Bosnia and Croatia?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is yes, we did discuss this problem, because 
I think NATO has an obligation to ensure that troops now on duty 
as peacekeepers in Croatia and Bosnia are able to return safe and 
sound. The Americans have already made a commitment to 
ensure secure withdrawal, and we hope they will, if Croatia asks 
UNPROFOR troops to withdraw from Croatian territory and 
such measures are necessary.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to know whether the Prime Minister 
intends to put pressure on the Croatian president and persuade 
him to reconsider his present position which, as the Prime 
Minister himself indicated, is to demand the withdrawal of UN 
peacekeepers from Croatia, once the deadline has expired?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is the option Canada has chosen, and we said so 
two weeks ago when a delegation of parliamentarians from 
Croatia came to Canada. I had the pleasure of meeting them, and 
I told them clearly I thought it was a mistake to ask the troops to 
withdraw at this point, because the risk of war was imminent 
once UN soldiers had left.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Prime Minister for clarifying 
his position on continuing the peace mission in Croatia.
<P>
	As far as Bosnia is concerned, I would like to ask him whether 
he would agree that in this case as well, the mission of Canadian 
peacekeepers should be extended as well beyond March 31, 
since a withdrawal of UN peacekeepers at this time will merely 
allow the conflict to escalate, while the civilian population and 
refugees will be totally deprived of humanitarian aid?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there will be a decision made about the continuation of 
the presence of our troops in Bosnia and  Croatia. We have to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10073"> 10073 </A></B>
<P>
make a decision this month and we will make it known to the 
House of Commons very soon.
<P>
	We are of the view that it would be an error for the Croats to 
ask for the withdrawl of UN troops to get out of that situation but 
they have explained to us that they are afraid the presence of UN 
soldiers will create a de facto division of Croatia. They are 
afraid it might be another Cyprus. That seems to be their 
political reason to move. The danger is that if troops are out of 
Croatia by the end of the month there will be a direct 
confrontation with the Serbs which we think will cause a lot of 
deaths.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a study 
conducted by a National Defence researcher shows that Quebec 
and Western Canada are largely disadvantaged in the 
distribution of defence expenditures. In Quebec in particular, 
the shortfall is at least $650 million per year.
<P>
	How can the minister of defence explain that, with only 3 per 
cent of the population of Canada, Nova Scotia alone has more 
military personnel and as many civilian employees as Quebec, 
which is eight times bigger?

<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, military 
installations were not built as part of some kind of infrastructure 
program to benefit various regions of the country. They were 
built to serve the real needs of the Canadian Armed Forces in 
two world wars. Since we fought two wars in Europe and since 
most of the troops left by ship it is natural that there would be a 
big military presence by virtue of the navy headquarters being in 
Halifax.
<P>
	With respect to Quebec, obviously if the port closest to 
Europe is Halifax troops would not be dispatched from Montreal 
or somewhere else farther inland.
<P>
	However, I should point out that later this year we will be 
opening the naval reserve headquarters in Quebec City. We have 
been opening a number of small naval operations along the St. 
Lawrence River and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence so that Quebec 
does have a naval presence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, all 
excuses are good to justify inequity. The strategic position of 
Ontario, for example, is completely different from that of Nova 
Scotia; yet, Ontario receives its fair share of military 
investments.
<P>
	Does the minister of defence not think that it would have been 
wise to go along with the proposal made by the official 
opposition last year and keep the military college in Saint-Jean 
open, in order to help correct the unfair treatment of Quebec 
with respect to the Canadian Forces?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
been through this argument a number of times before.
<P>
	We felt that with the declining numbers of the armed forces 
we only needed one military college in Canada, located at 
Kingston.
<P>
	This government is very eager that Royal Roads in B.C. and 
St-Jean in Quebec, those military colleges, have their facilities 
used for the ongoing betterment of the citizens in the region. It is 
for that reason that my colleague, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, negotiated a very successful 
agreement with the local people in the St-Jean region over the 
objections of the Bloc Quebecois and the government in Quebec 
City.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today, budget day, represents a test of character for the

has the courage to reduce spending and the courage to hold the 
line on tax increases. More important, we will find out whether 
it has the courage to lead by example.
<P>
	If the budget contains significant spending cuts it is obvious 
to Canadians that the first of these must be made at the top with 
respect to MPs' pensions.
<P>
	My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. Which 
members of the cabinet will be setting the example of spending 
cuts at the top by opting out of the obscene MPs' pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

members will have to consider that, including hon. colleagues in 
the third party.

million, and we are showing leadership in expenditure 
reduction.

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the test of the courage of these remarks is not whether 
they make sense in this House but whether they will make sense 
in the constituencies.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan, according to the government's own 
report, will be wiped out in 20 years unless there are significant 
increases in contributions. While Canadians' pensions are being 
put at risk the financial security of senior ministers and MPs is 
assured by this pension plan-business as usual at the MP 
pension trough.
<P>
	How can the minister stand here today knowing that many 
ordinary Canadians are in danger of getting no Canada pension 
at all and still defend pension provisions for senior ministers 
like the Deputy Prime Minister who will be collecting millions 
in retirement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I think was pointed out in the consultant's report that 
was tabled last year at the Lapointe commission, when it comes 
to compensation levels overall, and it must be looked at in this 
context, members of Parliament are lower than the equivalent in 
the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	This particular reduction in MP pensions will make them even 
further down the scale in terms of that comparison. On top of 
that, members of Parliament contribute twice as much to the 
pension plan in many cases as private sector plans.
<P>
	The hon. member still has his RRSPs and his clothing 
allowance, all of which he can-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to date at least 48 of the 52 Reform MPs in this House 
have confirmed they will opt out of the MP pension plan.
<P>
	If the minister cannot tell the House which ministers will be 
opting out can he at least give us an idea of the number of 
members of the Liberal caucus who will be opting out of this 
pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a personal choice and one that members will have 
an opportunity to make over a 60-day period once the bill has 
passed through Parliament.
<P>
	I want to reiterate that there is a reduction in this plan. There 
is no retroactivity to the plan but I noticed that the head of the 
National Citizen's Coalition does not think that is a good idea. It 
is fair that members should continue to earn what they have 
earned up to the point where the pension bill is passed.
<P>
	Overall, every member of this House, cabinet or non-cabinet, 
faces a reduction in the pension benefit, an overall reduction in 
the compensation package. I think that is showing the leadership 
that we need going into this budget today.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	According to a study done for the Department of National 
Defence, francophones are grossly underrepresented among 
senior officers in the armed forces. The study shows that 
French-speaking officers are concentrated in nursing and 
chaplain services.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that, in the top military ranks, 
francophones account for only one out of nine 
lieutenant-generals and three out of 31 major-generals, when 
his government has closed the only French-language military 
college in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I must point out that the Canadian Forces better reflect the 
Canadian reality of two official languages.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the armed forces is probably the one institution 
in this country that reflects the duality of Canada's linguistic 
constitutional reality more than anything else. Thirty per cent of 
the armed forces personnel are francophones, about 25 per cent 
at the officer level. There is room for improvement and that is 
why when the postings and promotions for general officer level 
are made public shortly we will see francophones in very 
significant positions within the hierarchy of the armed forces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that the minister has just confirmed that francophones are 
overrepresented in the junior ranks and underrepresented in the 
senior ranks.
<P>
	How can the minister of defence justify such 
underrepresentation of francophones in the Canadian Forces, 
where there are almost no French-speaking officers in personnel 
selection, security and intelligence?

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal two-tier pension reform is inadequate, unfair and in fact 
illegal in the private sector. The MP accrual rate of 4 per cent is 
double the legal limit allowed for the rest of Canadians under the 
Income Tax Act.
<P>
	How can the President of the Treasury Board justify this 
blatant double standard in light of the job losses that will have to 
be announced this afternoon in the budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the basic pension plan in accordance with the Income 
Tax Act is 2 per cent. As in the case in the private sector, there 
are many supplementary plans where additional moneys are put 
aside. It is quite common for that to happen in our community.
<P>
	Let me also point out that what is not common is that in this 
case members of Parliament pay double what is normal in the 
private sector in terms of their own contributions. In spite of all 
that, we are reducing the amount of the taxpayers' contribution 
to the MP pension fund by a third, by 33 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
solution to a fair and proper pension plan is simple: Pass a bill in 
the House that would make MPs subject to the same laws as all 
other Canadians. That way an MP pension plan would be no 
better than that of any other Canadian or as good as any plan that 
is out there in the real world.
<P>
	Why will the minister not consider abolishing his ill fated, 
inadequate, still gold plated, two-tier pension plan and make it 
the same as those in the private sector?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Parliament is a very unusual occupation. We do not come to 
Parliament to be here for 50 years. That is very rare. There are 
only two of us who have been here pretty long: the Solicitor 
General and myself. The average stay in the House is less than

of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is true that the court 
of appeal dismissed the interim order issued by the Minister of 
the Environment, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean.
<P>
	The court decided that the interim order he issued following 
the incident in Saint-Basile-le-Grand was improper. The court 
decided not to rule on specific sections of the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act. The interim order issued by the 
hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean was declared unconstitutional.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, even 
though the decision ends double regulation of toxic products, 
will the minister confirm the statement by her parliamentary 
secretary for the environment that the federal government will 
study the possibility of appealing this decision to the Supreme 
Court?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to clarify, the Court of 
Appeal ruled that the interim order put in place by the then 
Minister of the Environment, the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean, was unconstitutional.
<P>
	It ruled on the PCB interim order that has subsequently been 
replaced by chlorobiphenyl regulations. It specifically did not 
rule on the constitutionality of the application of CEPA. It 
protected the integrity of CEPA.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	I think the majority of Canadians would support the notion 
that the federal government has a very specific role to play in the 
cross-border transportation of toxic materials. It did, however, 
rule that the interim order put in place by the then Minister of the 
Environment was unconstitutional.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur, Lib.):</B> Mr.

They may not take global warming seriously but we do on this

and that inefficient use of energy is a contributing factor.
<P>

federal government has initiated a very important program 
called the federal buildings initiative, or otherwise known as 
the FBI program, that operates throughout the federal 
government in all departments. It is fully operational now. It 
speaks to increased energy efficiency through the retrofitting 
of all federal government buildings and installations.
<P>
	Let me update the House on the success of the program to 
date.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> As the hon. member for 
Restigouche-Chaleur has indicated, while the hon members of 
the third party may not be interested in energy efficiency and 
climate change we on the government side are.
<P>
	Let me say very briefly that we have initiated 80 projects 
involving over 2,400 federal government buildings.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you are doing a good job. The Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions reported that the Canada pension plan 
fund would be broke in 20 years and the projected premiums 
paid by workers and employers would have to more than double 
to keep the fund afloat. The contingent liability in the plan is 
estimated at $500 billion, about as big as our whole government 
debt.
<P>
	I did not give you a compliment, Mr. Speaker, just so that I 
could ask a long one. Could the Minister of Human Resources 
Development-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am always flattered by these comments and I 
know the hon. member will want to do as good a job as I do by 
putting his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
asking my question.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> My apologies. Could 
the Minister of Human Resources Development tell us why his 
review of social security programs did not deal with this 
looming crisis?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very glad the hon. 
member got to put his question, but it is a question that does not 
make an awful lot of sense or have relevance.
<P>
	He should know that the Canada pension plan is subject to the 
five-year annual review of federal-provincial finance ministers 
as part of the statutes or the legislation itself. That review will 
take place this fall.
<P>
	One thing we have to look at, because it is a matter of some 
concern, is that over the past year or two there has been a 
substantial rise not in the income security portion but in the 
disability portion of the Canada pension plan, which is one of 
the fundamental causes for the increased outflow during the past 
year and a half.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to look at this matter. It is a consequence of other 
jurisdictions taking decisions on things like workers' 
compensation that as a result people become part of the CPP 
regime. We will be looking at this. It will be part of the review. I 
can assure the minister that once again, the government is in 
good hands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not a minister yet.
<P>
	The Liberal Party looks after its own pensions. I wish it would 
do this with as much enthusiasm for the rest of Canadians. Not 
only will this rate increase force an increase in payroll taxes that 
will kill jobs, but younger Canadians will also question whether 
CPP is even a good investment.
<P>
	MPs will be given a choice to opt out of the MPs pension plan. 
Will younger Canadians be given the same opportunity to opt 
out of this bankrupt pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a very strange and 
curious question. It comes from a member of a party which just a 
week ago tabled its own so-called budget proposal.
<P>
	That proposal recommended the total abolition of all parental 
or maternity benefits. This would have totally denied any kind 
of fiscal support for close to 200,000 mothers in this country. It 
would have denied and abolished disability benefits for close to 
200,000 Canadians. It would have taken over $3 million out of 
the OAS.

	Are we to understand that, by virtue of this measure which 
serves to increase requirements made of individuals in social

sustainable and would in fact generate revenue.
<P>
	Right now stumpage fees are 20 cents as compared to $60 in 
northern B.C. That is one-third of 1 per cent of what the

cents per cubic metre and $30 per cubic metre elsewhere. Indian

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. On February 20, 1995 I brought a point 
of order pursuant to Standing Order 39 regarding a question that 
I placed on the Order Paper on September 30, 1994.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands was gracious 
enough to respond to my request. He indicated that I would have 
the answer to my question by the end of last week. It is 150 days 
now since I have placed my question on the order paper with no 
result.
<P>
	Also, with all due respect to the member for Kingston and the 
Islands who chastised me for not going to the Library of 
Parliament for the information, may I tell the hon. member that 
the annual reports to which he referred me are bordering on 
useless they are so vague.
<P>
	Once again I would like to place these questions on the Order 
Paper for 1992 and 1993: What was the total amount of funds 
received by individuals and groups from the Canada Council? 
Who were these individuals? For what specific projects did they 
receive funding? How much did they receive?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have a serious problem. I also placed a question on the Order 
Paper on October 19, 130 days ago. This question had two parts: 
a) and b). Finally, last Friday, after a little more than a hundred 
days, I received an answer to the first half of my question. You 
can see my problem.
<P>
	I wonder if there is any hope of getting the second part of my 
question answered. I find this somewhat unfortunate because, 
frankly, the information requested in that part is simpler, 
shorter, yet more important to me. Can I appeal to someone to 
ask for some justice and get this answer?

	Would the hon. member be so kind as to answer the question 
regarding federal government properties in Quebec?

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will recognize the hon. parliamentary 
secretary first on the two points of order just raised, and then to 
answer questions on the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with respect to the first point of order that was raised 
by the hon. member for Calgary Southeast, I indicated last week 
that I hoped I would have an answer by the end of the week and I 
am still optimistic. It obviously was not last week, but as soon as 
an answer is available I will provide the hon. member with an 
answer.
<P>
	As to her allegation that reports to the Canada Council are 
vague, I have had occasion to look at the reports and have read 
them from time to time. My recollection is that there are 
substantial lists and no vagueness about them. They simply say 
who got grants. Perhaps the hon. member regards that as vague. 
Her question does ask who received grants. I would have 
thought that there was a pretty good source in those annual 
reports. I urge her to have a second look.
<P>
	In any event, I will do my best to provide an answer for her at 
an early date.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member for Québec-Est, my 
recommendation is that he go through that box of materials I 
tabled in the House on Friday in response to his question.
<P>
	I cannot say that I looked at all 1,200 pages before I tabled the 
documents, but I think he will find the answer in there. If he does 
not, I will take his representation as one I am prepared to raise 
with the minister involved. I will see if the additional 
information can be provided to the hon. member with dispatch.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wonder if the parliamentary secretary 
might also make the usual observation that he does on these 
occasions.

permanent and part time jobs were created and (<I>d</I>) how many contracts have

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am informed 
by the department of human Resources and the Federal Office of 
Regional Development-Quebec, FORD-Q, as follows:
<P>
	In so far as Human Resources Development Canada, HRDC, 
is concerned:
<P>
	a) b) and c) The Centre de l'interprétation de l'industrie de 
Shawinigan Inc., CII, is administered by a council of 
community workers, comprised of a variety of citizens. The 
building it is operating in at the moment is owned by 
Hydro-Quebec. Presently funding for this building is provided 
by five groups: ALCAN, Stone Console-Division Belgo, pulp 
and paper mill, Hydro-Quebec, the city of Shawinigan and the 
city of Shawinigan-South.
<P>
	In the last four years HRDC has been providing the centre 
with local employment development projects, indirect funding. 
The centre acts as the sponsor for these training programs.
<P>
	To date Human Resources Development Canada has 
committed a total of $1,212,359 toward the Centre de 
l'interprétation de l'industrie de Shawinigan Inc.
<P>

<IMG SRC="tables/nen1605x01_r0.gif"  ><BR>
<BR><BR>
*The program is just beginning and at this time it is too early to 
estimate the number of people who will be employed during the 
next three operating years.
<P>
	The guidelines followed can be found in the ED component of 
the employment manual, which inculdes several volumes. 
However, all Canada employment centres are equipped with 
these manuals.
<P>
	In so far as the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, (FORD-Q), is concerned:
<P>
	a) b) and c) FORD-Q has awarded a contribution of $3.5 
million to the Centre de l'interprétation de l'industrie de 
Shawinigan Inc., CII, under the regional development program, 
RDP. This CII project is eligible for assistance as a facility that 
will foster regional economic development and should create 
300 jobs during the construction phase.
<P>
	In addition, the centre will generate 40 direct jobs for its 
operations and 200 indirect jobs among concession holders, 
subcontractors and other firms in the region once it is up and 
running.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10084"> 10084 </A></B>
<P>
	In the short term the centre will stimulate a variety of other 
tourism investments, particularly in the accommodation sector, 
in addition to helping to consolidate regional economic 
infrastructure. As well, it will contribute to preserving regional 
industrial heritage.
<P>
	d) The responsibility for the different contracts lies with CII.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The questions as enumerated by the 
parliamentary secretary have been answered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions 
be allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Shall the remaining questions stand?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thought they were going to continue with questions 
from before question period. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, I missed the question 
because I was speaking with the clerk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
referring to the procedure in which we were going to complete 
the questions that occurred before question period, before 
debate ceased. Are we going to continue with debate?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is continuing with debate because 
the secretary of state has not returned to the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, a little 
over a year ago the Minister of Justice was quoted in a number of 
newspapers as saying that he believed that only the police and 
military should have guns.
<P>
	We have been through Bill C-68 and it is clear to me and will 
soon be clear to all Canadians that the minister has taken the 
first step toward achieving this personal objective.
<P>
	After reading this legislation it is also clear that the Minister 
of Justice and his cabinet colleagues have confused gun control 
with crime control. Anyone who studies this issue for more than 
a couple of hours will realize that there is no connection between 
controlling the legal use of guns by law-abiding gun owners and 
reducing crime.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice cannot tell us specifically how 
controlling guns and registering guns will reduce crime, and the 
Bloc has made that similar observation.
<P>
	The minister keeps saying that chiefs of police have asked for 
it. The minister cannot hide behind that answer forever. Sooner 
or later he has to be responsible for answering his own 
questions. He has to defend his legislation with reasoned 
arguments and not expect others outside this House to come to 
his rescue.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	If I start to sound angry during my remarks it is because not 
only am I expressing my own dissatisfaction, disappointment 
and disgust with the Liberal government's costly, intrusive, 
bureaucratic and ineffective legislation, but I am also 
expressing the outrage I read in the more than 1,000 letters I 
have received and the outrage that I hear in the hundreds of 
phone calls we receive, and the outrage I hear when I walk the 
streets of the communities in my constituency, and the absolute 
outrage I hear when I attend rally after rally of responsible, 
law-abiding citizens, whether in Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, 
Alberta or Nova Scotia. The outrage that these people express to 
me wherever I go is something this government must consider.
<P>
	I support some of the provisions in the government's 
proposals calling for tougher sanctions for violent criminals and 
its proposed attempts to control the smuggling of firearms. I 
support some of these measures because they will really help 
control crime. Laws do not make people good but they do help to 
restrain evil.
<P>
	On the other hand, because there is no evidence or convincing 
argument to show that public safety will be improved I will 
oppose ineffective proposals to register rifles and shotguns and 
the banning of firearms or any measures which would further 
restrict the ownership of handguns, scary looking guns, 
semi-automatic rifles, crossbows, and the banning of firearms 
or any measures which would further restrict the ownership of 
these, even replica toy guns.
<P>
	If the Liberal Party can demonstrate how registration of all 
firearms is the most cost effective way of improving public 
safety, reducing violent crime and saving the most lives I and 
most Canadians will support the minister's proposals if he can 
show that they are the most cost effective method. This he has 
not done. He fails to answer this challenge and therefore we 
must oppose this legislation.
<P>
	I repeat my personal position. I support cost effective gun 
controls which improve public safety and reduce the criminal 
use of firearms and if elected I will work to repeal ineffective 
gun controls which do not meet these objectives.
<P>
	Another Reform principle from our party constitution says 
that it is the duty of all members of Parliament to their 
constituents that should supersede their obligation to their 
political parties. Reform MPs are duty bound to represent their 
constituents' wishes on this issue. I only  hope that the Liberal 
government has the courage to let their members of Parliament 
do the same.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10085"> 10085 </A></B>
<P>
	If the Liberal Party would allow a free vote on this bill I think 
we would really see whether there is broad public support for 
this. We would see whether that is true, as the minister claims.
<P>
	I think it would prove that the Liberal Party believes in true 
democracy between elections as well as during them. I wish it 
would come clean on this issue and allow that free vote to take 
place.
<P>
	Whether a Canadian is a gun owner or not here are some 
principles on which this legislation should be judged. I 
encourage every voter to inform themselves, to judge this 
legislation against their own personal beliefs, not what the 
government, not what the media, not what the politicians are 
telling them. This is one nasty piece of legislation. It will affect 
not only our lives but also the lives of our children and our 
grandchildren.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is right, the legislation is about the 
kind of country we want to live in. Canadians owe it to 
themselves and the next generation to get it right. Their safety, 
the safety of their families, their friends, their homes and their 
properties is at stake.
<P>
	If Canadians believe in less government and less bureaucracy 
then they will not support this gun control bill. If Canadians 
believe in less government spending then they will not support 
this bill. If Canadians believe in lower taxes, they will not 
support this gun control bill. If Canadians believe in personal 
freedom and personal responsibility, then they will not support 
this gun control legislation. If Canadians believe in every 
citizen's right to private property, then they will definitely not 
support this gun control legislation.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	If Canadians believe in true equality and that the law should 
be applied equally regardless of their race or where they live, 
then they will not like what they read in this gun control bill. If 
Canadians believe in every citizen's constitutional right to life, 
liberty and security of the person, then they will oppose this gun 
control bill with every ounce of energy they have.
<P>
	If Canadians believe in everyone's right and responsibility to 
defend themselves, their family, their property and their home, 
as described in the Criminal Code of Canada, then they will not 
like what they read in this gun control bill. If Canadians believe 
the federal government should not interfere in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, then they will not support this gun 
control bill.
<P>
	A recent survey conducted by Simon Fraser University 
learned that support for the Liberal Party's firearm registration 
system drops significantly as the respondents' knowledge of 
existing gun control laws increases and the full cost of the 
measures is understood.
<P>
	In his attempts to confuse the issue of gun control with the 
issue of crime control, the minister has included  some things in 
his legislation which I support. I maintain that if the Minister of 
Justice is really interested in public safety he will divide this bill 
into two parts. Part one would be crime control and part two 
would be gun control. Even though there are some monumental 
flaws with the crime control provisions of the bill, I think we 
could fix those and ensure easy passage through the House so 
that the police could use these tools to put real criminals behind 
bars where they should be.
<P>
	Here is a list of measures in the bill which I think could be 
modified and amended and which I could support because they 
truly concern crime. I would support the four-year mandatory 
minimum sentence for the 10 violent offences committed with a 
firearm as long as the word firearm was replaced with the word 
weapon. More people are murdered with knives and other 
weapons than with guns. I think any criminal who uses a weapon 
in the commission of a crime should be subject to the same 
mandatory jail term.
<P>
	I support using section 85 of the Criminal Code effectively, 
but again this mandatory sentencing provision should be 
extended to any weapon used in a crime, not just firearms.
<P>
	I support the lifetime prohibition from possessing a restricted 
weapon for the conviction of violent crimes. I also support the 
inclusion of replica or imitation firearms under section 85 of the 
Criminal Code. I support the new offences for large scale 
smuggling and trafficking of firearms. I support the new 
offences for possessing stolen or smuggled firearms of a 
one-year minimum jail sentence. I support adding firearms 
trafficking to the list of enterprise crime offences.
<P>
	I oppose the banning of 553,000 handguns. I oppose the 
banning of 19,000 restricted firearms. However, I support the 
proposed firearms possession certificate, in principle anyway. I 
support the offence for failing to report a lost or stolen firearm. I 
support the 10-year prohibition on possession of firearms to 
those convicted of serious firearms offences. I support the 
prohibition on possession of firearms for those convicted of 
stalking and drug offences. I support the tighter border controls, 
the inspection procedures by Canada customs. Also, I support 
the forfeiture of vehicles used in smuggling contraband and the 
proceeds of smuggling activities. I support the requirement for 
import-export permits for firearms moving across the border for 
commercial use.
<P>
	I also support the requirement to record the entry or exit of 
firearms to or from Canada by tourists and outfitters. I add that 
these people bring hundreds of millions of dollars into our 
country, creating thousands of jobs and tourists should not be 
needlessly harassed at our borders.
<P>
	I support the provision of minor's permits for persons 
between 12 and 18 to acquire firearms. I support the extension of 
authority to approve firearm safety courses to the provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10086"> 10086 </A></B>
<P>
	I also support the creation of a separate safety course for 
handgun users and I support the use of valuable police time and 
scarce tax revenues on cost effective crime control.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	This is a list of the things I support. Because gun control 
measures will do next to nothing to deter real criminals from 
obtaining or using firearms, and because these measures are not 
a cost effective way of improving public safety, I will vote 
against the bill unless they are changed.
<P>
	Here is a list of reasons why I am opposed to the gun control 
legislation. I oppose the mandatory registration of all rifles and 
shotguns and the provision that would make failing to register 
them a criminal offence. This will do nothing but make 
criminals out of law-abiding people.
<P>
	Here are a few reasons why I oppose mandatory registration 
of all rifles and shotguns. It will cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars. It is not a cost effective way of improving public safety 
or saving lives. It will not help police investigate and prosecute 
violent criminals. It will not alter police procedures for dealing 
with domestic disputes. It will not reduce the use of firearms in 
violent crime.
<P>
	It will keep the police off the street and in the office, not 
where they should be. It will require more government 
bureaucracy, not less. It will require an increase in taxes in the 
form of registration fees. It will also require other members of 
society to pay those taxes because the initial registration fees 
will be waived. It will target law-abiding responsible gun 
owners, not real criminals. It will help trace firearms but tracing 
will serve no real useful purpose.
<P>
	Gun smugglers can already be identified without a 
registration system. Handgun registration has been in effect 
since 1934 and has not reduced handgun crime. Registration has 
been tried and failed in Australia and New Zealand. Hundreds of 
millions could save more lives if spent elsewhere.
<P>
	It will have a negative effect on a billion dollar economy. It 
will undermine respect for the law. I cannot emphasize this 
more. There are jokes going around. There are ads in the 
newspapers in my province showing people how to hide their 
guns. They openly advocate that this law will not be complied 
with.
<P>
	We have a huge problem when we put in place a law that 
everyone regards as being useless. It undermines respect for the 
law, and we must take that into consideration. We need to 
maintain that respect. People know this will do nothing to make 
society safer. In fact it will do the exact opposite. I do not have 
time today to go into them but there are very valid reasons for 
opposing the legislation because it will actually increase the risk 
for most people.
<P>
	I am particularly opposed to the extreme penalties for persons 
failing to register their rifles and shotguns: a one-year 
mandatory jail term and up to 10 years in jail if one fails to fill 
out that little card the minister says is so easy. Denis Lortie 
killed three people and only spent 10 years in jail. Where is the 
justice in this legislation? It defies common sense.
<P>
	I also oppose the added tax burden on law-abiding citizens, 
the responsible gun owners, through registration fees, permit 
fees, and renewal fees. Like I said before, I oppose the banning 
of legally owned handguns, scary looking semi-automatic rifles 
and so on, and the banning of all replica toy guns. I oppose those 
kinds of measures.
<P>
	I oppose the restrictions on crossbows, the banning of 
one-hand crossbows and the additional restrictions on air guns. 
I oppose the prohibition and confiscation of guns without fair, 
just and timely compensation. I oppose the confiscation of 
thousands of firearms without compensation when the owner 
dies.
<P>
	I oppose the use it or lose it provision which requires 
law-abiding handgun owners to re-establish their reason for 
owning a handgun every five years. I oppose the proposed controls 
on the purchase of ammunition and the additional and unnecessary 
controls on legitimate gun collectors. I oppose the prohibition of 
entire households from having firearms because of the actions 
of a single resident.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	I oppose the exemption of certain Canadian citizens from 
firearms prohibition orders. All Canadians should be treated 
equally under the law and in this case under this law. I oppose 
the requirement of an import-export permit for bringing a 
personal use firearm into Canada.
<P>
	I oppose the expanded use of orders in council to restrict or 
prohibit firearms. I oppose the different application of the 
firearms laws for remote and aboriginal communities. 
Canadians should be treated equally regardless of where they 
live, regardless of their race, and regardless of their occupation. 
I oppose the waste of valuable police time and scarce tax 
revenue on useless, ineffective gun controls.
<P>
	I have 28 amendments here. At this time I will not read them 
all out. I have gone through a lot of things already. I think we 
need to have a debate because there are many things that need to 
be addressed. I will hold this up at a later date.
<P>
	In closing, I make five recommendations to the government. I 
recommend holding separate votes for crime control provisions 
and gun control provisions. We should separate those.
<P>
	I recommend early passage of crime control provisions with 
consideration of Reform amendments to really get tough on 
violent criminals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10087"> 10087 </A></B>
<P>
	I recommend a free vote on all gun control provisions in the 
bill, especially the sections relating to implementation of the 
universal registration system.
<P>
	I recommend a delay in implementation of universal 
registration systems to see if increased sanctions and new 
criminal offences, that is the crime controls proposed by the 
Liberal government and Reform, are effective in reducing 
violent crime.
<P>
	I recommend the inclusion of a sunset clause amendment that 
would automatically repeal any gun control provision that is not 
effective in reducing violent crime or approving public safety.
<P>
	Finally, I have a message for seven million gun owners in 
Canada. They should not give up. The fight for the kind of 
Canada we all want to live in has begun in earnest. I encourage 
them to write letters to both federal and provincial politicians. 
They should send petitions to their MPs, write letters to the 
editor, phone in to hotline radio and television shows, get 
involved in a political party that best represents their views and 
help to organize and attend rallies. Whatever you do-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The member may have 
forgotten that all his remarks are supposed to go to whoever is in 
the Chair. I would invite him to do so for the remainder of his 
talk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
apologies. I get involved and forget.
<P>
	My advice is not to break the law of the land but to work to 
change it by all legal means possible. Bad laws can be repealed 
if a truly democratic party is in power. If we have the support of 
the majority of Canadians we can do it.
<P>
	I fear a government that will not listen to the people a lot more 
than I fear a law-abiding citizen with a gun. In conclusion I 
would like to move the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words after the word ``that'' be deleted and the following 
substituted therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This House decline to give second reading to Bill C-68, an act respecting 
firearms and other weapons, because the principle of establishing a system for 
licensing and registration of all firearms and the principle of creating a variety 
of offences are two unrelated issues that should be addressed separately.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I submit this motion to the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair will reserve on the motion 
while it is being brought forward. We will deal with questions 
and comments while the motion is being looked at.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
Lib.):</B>
<P>
	<I>[Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.]</I>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have a few comments before asking a question of the 
member opposite who just spoke. He made some reference to 
aboriginal people being treated exactly the same as the rest of 
Canadians, with which I agree on certain issues. However the 
hon. member will understand that the aboriginal people in the 
country are the only people who hunt as a way of life. They have 
always hunted.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I would like to quote Voltaire who said: ``Prejudice is what 
fools will choose for reason''. That is basically what the hon. 
member is saying in refusing to recognize the fact that we have 
always been here, longer than anybody else, and we have always 
hunted. We still hunt to this day. When people arrived after us 
we helped them to settle in.
<P>
	As an aboriginal person I have some very strong feelings 
about the issue of hunting and about the issue of gun control. I 
think by and large Canadian people as a whole support some 
form of gun control. I believe, unlike the hon. member, that the 
majority of Canadians support the gun control measures being 
put forward by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	As an aboriginal person I view guns and rifles as having one 
use other than military and law enforcement, that is hunting. I 
have absolutely no use for handguns. Nobody can convince me 
that we need handguns. Basically they are used to kill people. 
Nobody can convince me that there is a useful reason for 
automatics. We are not going to hunt with automatics. Some 
semi-automatics may be used for hunting, but by and large most 
semi-automatics should not be used for hunting. If persons are 
using semi-automatics for hunting it means they do not have 
enough confidence in themselves to use a bolt action rifle which 
shoots one bullet at a time and then they have to reload.
<P>
	It has been proven through various polls that most Canadians 
support some form of gun control. I read in the paper some time 
ago that a member of the Reform Party conducted a poll and 
found that 67 per cent of his constituents supported the gun 
control measures being put forward today. However that hon. 
member would still vote against gun control.
<P>
	Reform members have been shouting from the rooftops that 
theirs is a grassroots organization. They find that the grassroots 
support gun control but they will not listen to the grassroots; 
they will vote their conscience even against the grassroots 
people. That seems to be hypocrisy if we are talking about 
democracy and grassroots. The majority of the grassroots 
people say they want gun control measures put in place but 
Reform members do not think that way.
<P>
	Reform Party members should come clean and decide whether 
they will vote in favour of what the majority of Canadians want 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10088"> 10088 </A></B>
<P>
or vote for their individual interests rather than the collective 
interests of the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	As an aboriginal person I have some concerns. As a member 
representing per capita probably the largest number of gun 
owners, I have some concerns. I will convey them to the 
Minister of Justice to ensure that they are heard.
<P>
	I think the people in my riding of Nunatsiaq are ready to 
support the Minister of Justice to ensure that Canada is a safer 
place to live. Canada can be made a safer place to live.
<P>
	I suggest that hon. members listen to their constituents. If the 
majority say to support the gun control measures then they 
should listen to them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
strongly object to the allegations made by the hon. member with 
regard to prejudice. I would ask that he withdraw them. Because 
we say all Canadians should be treated equally, I do not think 
that is prejudice. I would ask him to withdraw that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is welcome to say that as a 
response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not say that the member was 
prejudiced. I said that the attitude put out by some members is 
prejudicial. When I quoted Voltaire that prejudice is what fools 
use for reason, an awful lot of things can be hidden under some 
words. I did not say that the member was prejudiced. If I did not 
say that the member was prejudiced, then I have no reason to 
withdraw my comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
do not want to pursue this any further.
<P>
	Is the hon. member going to vote for or against this 
legislation? Has he consulted his constituents as we have? We 
have done surveys. We found that initially, over 80 per cent of 
the people surveyed knew virtually nothing about this 
legislation. As they became more informed, opposition to this 
bill rose to as high as 90 per cent.
<P>
	They realized how this was going to put society more at risk. 
They realized how this was going to give criminals access to 
firearms that they did not previously have. They realized how 
this was going to tie up the police in some useless paperwork. 
They realized how this was going to be a tax imposition upon 
them, how it would destroy more jobs and would put more young 
people out on the streets who probably would get into more 
trouble and put us more at risk.
<P>
	They began to see that this was a useless bureaucratic political 
manoeuvre to try to put something across on the Canadian 
people. It would make them think the government was doing 
something to make society safer when in fact it is not.
<P>
	As the member quotes these polls, he had better go back and 
find out exactly what he is doing. A very narrow view is being 
expressed here.
<P>
	The hon. member just said that only some people of certain 
race subsistence hunt. That is not true. It is absolutely false. 
Many people in this country appreciate nature. They use 
handguns in many ways besides killing people. The allegation 
he made that guns are only for killing people is absolutely 
ridiculous. I do not know where this member is coming from. 
There are many other uses for guns. I do not accept that 
argument.
<P>
	The member made many other statements that were not true. I 
ask the Canadian public to really look at this question in depth. 
Examine what this government has put forward. It is a 
convoluted complex bill and cannot be supported in its present 
form.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time for questions and answers has 
expired. The member has not had a ruling on the validity of his 
motion. It will be provided as quickly as it can. It is being 
studied very carefully.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Brandon-Souris.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	I rise today to speak to Bill C-68, legislation which addresses 
the fundamental right of all Canadians to a safe, non-violent, 
non-threatening society. I am speaking in support of legislative 
reforms carefully crafted and presented by the Minister of 
Justice involving amendments to the Criminal Code and the 
creation of a new firearms act.
<P>
	For many years Canadians have watched in horror the 
increasing use of handguns, assault weapons and rifles in the 
commission of crimes. In recent years our North American 
society has become increasingly immune to daily doses of 
violence, death and injury. Television newscasts and videos feed 
Canadian viewers a steady stream of carnage. Some of us are 
shocked; many have become numb as we grow accustomed to 
the daily onslaught.
<P>
	In the United States thousands of people are killed each year 
by handguns. Hundreds of thousands are injured and many are 
permanently disabled. Yet Americans strangely cling to the 
notion of a frontier mentality and the right to settle arguments 
with a gun. A new handgun is produced every 20 seconds in the 
United States to feed a voracious demand.
<P>
	Our society is awash in American imagery and attitudes. The 
U.S. media has slowly changed our long established tradition of 
law, order and peaceful tolerance. The locked doors and barred 
windows of the United States have crept north as has the 
American fascination with handguns.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10089"> 10089 </A></B>
<P>
	Thirty years ago a domestic dispute in the city of Toronto 
would rarely if ever involve a handgun. Now police approach 
every situation as potentially lethal. Thirty years ago police 
officers did not need SWAT teams, bullet-proof vests or 
increasingly powerful service revolvers against suspects who 
are routinely better equipped with the latest weaponry. Just this 
past week metro Toronto police received permission to carry 
shotguns inside their cruisers instead of in the trunks of their 
cars.
<P>
	There is no doubt whatsoever that our society is becoming 
more violent than Canadians will tolerate. But how are we 
different from our friends to the south? What makes us want to 
take charge of this situation and return order to Canadian 
streets?
<P>
	Fortunately, the vast majority of Canadians continue to abhor 
violence in all its forms. We are still shockable. We can still be 
touched. We are still willing to fight back. We are not ready to 
install metal detectors in our schools or huddle behind locked 
gates and barred windows after dark. From across Canada, this 
government and every member of this House has heard the 
message: Get the guns off the streets.
<P>
	Ninety-six per cent of Canadians support increased penalties 
for the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime. This bill 
addresses those Canadians. Ninety per cent favour the 
registration of all firearms. This bill addresses those Canadians. 
Fully 70 per cent want tighter gun control laws, restricted access 
to ammunition and a complete ban on civilian ownership of 
handguns. This legislation addresses those Canadians.
<P>
	The issue of violence affects each of us in a profound way. My 
late father, Ed Janozeski, was a sharpshooter, a gun instructor 
and a dedicated metro Toronto police officer for 37 years. He 
watched the use of firearms increase, especially in his last years 
on the force. He grew increasingly frustrated as legislators 
seemed unwilling to do anything about it.
<P>
	Each member of this House knows of an instance where 
friends, family or acquaintances have been devastated by the 
misuse of firearms. Every year 1,400 Canadians die as a result of 
gunshot wounds and another 1,200 are injured. Sadly, the 
majority are suicides, impulsive acts committed by those who 
have easy access to guns. Fifty women are killed each year, shot 
in their own homes by a family member.
<P>
	Surprisingly, homicide rates from firearms are 50 per cent 
higher in rural Canada. One hundred persons die accidentally 
each year while hunting or otherwise handling a firearm. Some 
of these people are children.
<P>
	Three million Canadians own seven million firearms, 1.2 
million in the restricted category. Vast numbers of illegal, 
smuggled and unregistered guns add to this arsenal. Between 
1974 and 1993, 65,000 firearms were reported missing, lost or 
stolen and have never been recovered.
<P>
	Even with all legal weapons registered, criminals will still 
find handguns. Accidents and suicides will still occur. Are these 
sensible, rational arguments for doing nothing?
<P>
	Acceptance of the status quo is acceptance of defeat. The 
enormity of the task cannot freeze us into inaction. If we start 
today the net result over time will be significantly fewer 
handguns in private hands. Those handguns will be in the safer 
hands of legitimate sport shooters, hunters and collectors.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	A highly efficient computerized system will distinguish legal 
from illegal firearms and will track them. Police officers when 
approaching a reported domestic dispute will know if there are 
weapons in the house. Responsible safe storage by registered 
gun owners will become a necessity.
<P>
	Will violent crime cease immediately? No one is foolish 
enough to believe that. Criminals will not register their firearms 
or produce a licence to purchase ammunition. But the 
underground market fed to a great extent by smuggled and stolen 
firearms will begin to dry up. Registration will permit tracking 
of imported guns and seizure of unregistered ones. Registration 
will also encourage safe storage and the availability of fewer 
stolen firearms.
<P>
	Through a series of new hard hitting penalties this 
government is also saying loudly and clearly: Use a weapon and 
you will face the stiffest penalties in the western world, a 
minimum of four years in jail for the use of a firearm in any of 10 
specific offences.
<P>
	Police will have a law with teeth enabling them to lock up 
criminals in possession of stolen firearms before a crime occurs. 
Those attempting to use replicas to intimidate and terrorize will 
face a minimum one year sentence.
<P>
	Our border, the longest unprotected border in the world, will 
no longer be an easy entry for those trafficking in firearms. Now 
you will face 10 years in jail and forfeit all vehicles used in the 
commission of this crime.
<P>
	The new legislation will outlaw 60 per cent of all handguns 
currently available for purchase in Canada, all assault-type 
military and paramilitary weapons, many of which are designed 
for concealment and terrorist activities. They have absolutely no 
place in Canadian society.
<P>
	To acquire and keep handguns, owners will have to provide 
one of only two valid reasons for doing so: to add to a legitimate 
collection, or to use in sport or target shooting. This would have 
to be justified every five years. The single most objectionable 
requirement in the eyes of the gun lobby is simple: all firearms 
and all owners of firearms will have to be registered. Contrary to 
popular myth, the registration of weapons is not new to Canada.  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10090"> 10090 </A></B>
<P>
The first nationwide permit system was introduced in 1892, the 
registration of handguns in 1932.
<P>
	Of 1.2 million handguns registered to 560,000 Canadians, 
only 10 per cent have applied for a permit which allows for 
transportation of a handgun to and from a shooting club. 
Canadians are apparently more interested in owning than in 
using these firearms.
<P>
	The registration of 5.8 million firearms will be phased in over 
seven years. Frankly, the tired old argument that registration 
failed in New Zealand does not hold. Modern computer 
technology will make this task efficient, simple and cost 
effective. We routinely register automobiles, mortgages, 
driver's licences, building permits and dogs. To argue that a 
national registration system would be onerous is to ignore the 
electronic advancement of our generation.
<P>
	Registration should not pose any threat to legitimate, 
responsible gun owners. In fact, they should welcome it. Only 
the most paranoid of individuals have expressed the fear that big 
brother is watching.
<P>
	In reality, orderly registration will deter theft and smuggling 
and will assist police. Ultimately, registration will bring the 
responsible gun owner into a partnership with the enforcement 
agencies. It will be a partnership based on trust, competence, 
access to information and accountability.
<P>
	I know much has been said of the opposition to this 
legislation. Change is not always easy to accept. We live in an 
increasingly hostile and violent society. We cannot abandon it to 
the spiral of violence that will fundamentally change Canada for 
generations to come. We must take the strongest and most 
effective measures possible to respond to those of us who want a 
peaceful, safe and tolerant society.
<P>
	My colleague from across the floor, the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre recently said in the House that if you identify 
your problem correctly, 60 per cent of your solution is before 
you. I believe Canadians have identified the problem. This 
legislation is an effective and necessary beginning, moving us 
well on the way to a 100 per cent solution.
<P>
	It is a great honour for me to speak today. I have had a rather 
motley political career because I have always been labelled an 
idealist. Sometimes things happen in politics because it is 
doable rather than because it is right. I am very proud of our 
minister and to be part of this Liberal government because I 
believe today we are doing what is right.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, some moments ago the House received a motion 
asking that the bill not be read the second time.
<P>
	I want to submit very briefly that it is my feeling, and I am 
sure that of many hon. members, that this motion is out of order 
because it does not state that it is against the principle of the bill, 
nor that the principle of the bill is defective. It does not address 
that issue.
<P>
	It merely addresses the fact that because the bill deals with 
two separate issues we should not deal with it at that time. If the 
bill were dealing with two separate issues, the argument would 
be that the bill is omnibus or omnibus like, if you will, and that 
the Chair has consistently dealt with that issue in the past by 
agreeing that such legislation was in order. In any case, this bill 
would not be omnibus even if that argument were made.
<P>
	The argument here has to do with two conflicting principles 
being in the bill and that being a justification for the substantive 
motion brought to the attention of the Chair. Those are not, in 
my submission, grounds that would enable a member to make 
the kind of motion which was brought to the floor of the House 
this afternoon.
<P>
	Therefore I would ask the Chair to rule at the earliest 
opportunity that this particular motion is out of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair would appreciate hearing all 
representations on the validity of the motion and therefore I 
would call on the Reform Party to make submissions on the 
issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it was with a great deal of thought and 
consideration and also with a great deal of consultation with the 
legal counsel of the House that we did present this amendment to 
the motion being debated before us today. Very simply the 
wording is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words after the word ``that'' be deleted and the following 
substituted therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This House decline to give second reading to Bill C-68, an act respecting 
firearms and other weapons, because the principle of establishing a system for 
licensing and registration of all firearms and the principle of creating a variety 
of offences are two unrelated issues that should be addressed separately.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is a reasoned amendment and we have been informed that 
according to the legislative counsel of this House it is in order. It 
is a reasoned amendment and therefore I would put to you, Mr. 
Speaker, that the amendment be allowed to stand.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does a member of the official 
opposition wish to be heard. I have been given indications that 
no one wishes to do so. Therefore, this concludes the debate on 
this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Chair will reserve on that matter and will bring back a 
decision as quickly as a reasoned conclusion can be brought 
back to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am interested in some of the comments by the member for 
Mississauga West. Certainly having been raised in a family in 
which the father was a police officer would give her some 
insight into the concerns police officers express when it comes 
to criminal activity. Seeing if nothing else the breakdown in our 
laws and the effectiveness of what a police officer can or cannot 
do any more is a story in itself.
<P>
	I am also interested in the comments relating to the smuggled 
weapons and the use of illegal weapons, that the illegal gun 
market would literally dry up once we have a good registration 
system in place and some supposed criminal sections that would 
deal with that.
<P>
	I do not believe the member has ever been over to the Fort Erie 
border crossing to look at the extent of what we have as security 
at the border crossing. There is a joke among the customs 
officers and the people who live in that area. If a boat comes 
across from the American side and it rides low in the water, it is 
full of alcohol. If it rides halfway down in the water, then it is 
full of guns. If it rides high in the water, then there are drugs in 
that particular boat. When it gets over to the other side to the 
Canadian shore there is no one there to stop it to see what really 
is in the boat because our border security is at a minimum.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Resources at the front line have been cut back to the nth 
degree. Police departments right across the country are 
suffering now because of a lack of being able to hire the 
adequate number of police officers to look at it.
<P>
	How will the illegal gun market dry up through a registration 
system when the front line cannot even stop the smuggling 
problem in this country, which is way out of hand and our police 
departments do not even have a finger on it? Even if they did 
they could not do anything about it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member opposite and I am sorry that customs officers joke about 
such serious things as gun smuggling, drug smuggling and 
alcohol smuggling.
<P>
	I do not think smuggling is a joking matter and I do not wish to 
correct the hon. member opposite but I did not say it would dry it 
up literally and immediately. I think it is a step in the right 
direction.
<P>
	I think if we do not begin somewhere we might as well all 
throw our hands up and say open the borders and let everybody 
bring whatever they want in.
<P>
	The President of the United States visited here on Thursday 
and congratulated us on an amazing start in the direction of 
cleaning up illegal guns. I am very proud to be part of a team that 
is doing this.
<P>
	My father on his deathbed talked about guns. He talked about 
the danger. He came home one night very sad because a rookie 
cop had gone up the stairs ahead of him to a domestic dispute 
and a shotgun blast had come through the door. It did not kill 
him. It knocked his eye right out. My father has always believed 
that if you register guns you can at least make the people who 
have lost them or have allowed them to be stolen out of their 
homes responsible for that loss.
<P>
	Again, I believe this is a beginning. No one has the perfect 
solution. I will reiterate what I said. We cannot be frozen into 
inactivity by the overwhelming concern of the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
impressed by what the member had to say and the concerns she 
expressed for a safer society. I think that is what we are all 
looking for. I wonder if the member would address the 
possibility of changing existing laws that allow violent 
offenders to enter society after serving only two-thirds of their 
penalty. That is something we could do right now.
<P>
	Melanie Carpenter, for all intents and purposes, was murdered 
by someone who was released because of a mandatory 
requirement included within the statute and the laws that this 
Parliament has created. We can change that.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would be willing to support that kind 
of legal initiative in this house that would prevent violent 
offenders from being automatically released into society before 
they expend their full sentence within prison to at least protect 
society to that extent.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Parrish:</B> Mr. Speaker, I always find it amusing that 
Reform members opposite tend to turn the conversation away 
from what we are trying to deal with and into their favourite 
locations.
<P>
	I believe that violent criminals in this society will be dealt 
with in a reasoned and planned fashion by the minister, as he has 
done with the gun legislation. I think you cannot look at one 
incident or one piece of legislation and keep it separate from 
others.
<P>
	I have absolute faith in the Minister of Justice that in the 
course of his term he will address all of your concerns and all of 
my concerns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank you and for that warm applause across the way. 
My friend and colleague from Crowfoot was a police officer at 
the time of my younger years, still living  in the area where he 
was serving. I respect him very much since those days and even 
today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10092"> 10092 </A></B>
<P>
	It is an honour to make the point that I am speaking on this bill 
with the desire to pursue a fair and equitable bill that permits 
reasonable and equitable use of firearms in our society.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Having said that, I do feel that the bill the minister has 
presented goes a long way in achieving those types of social 
goals. Therefore, I deem it an honour to rise to speak on this bill 
respecting the use of firearms and other weapons.
<P>
	The extended discussions and debates have waxed and waned 
throughout this country. Western Canada is certainly no 
exception. The first meeting I attended was with the minister 
and the executives of most of Manitoba's firearm associations 
coming together in Winnipeg in July, 1994.
<P>
	In a short time thereafter I had what I cannot say was 
necessarily a pleasure. I have never been yelled at by 2,000 
people at the same time before, so it was a unique experience. 
There was a rally in the Keystone centre in Brandon at which 
time the organizations in favour of not producing any more 
firearm controls brought together a number of people and we 
heard their concerns. Fundamentally they were persons who 
were trap shooters, recreational pistol shooters, but in the main 
they were ordinary hunting members of the public just like some 
members in this House.
<P>
	After attending these forums I visited several clubs and 
ranges. I continued to meet with concerned individuals on an 
individual basis as well as in small groups. Any new regulations 
concerning firearms have deep cultural implications, gender 
bias and some rural-urban division of support. As well, many 
citizens did not wish to see our nation reach a situation where 
they feel we must have access to a firearm in order to feel safe.
<P>
	We have had some information coming forward. I will quote a 
couple of excerpts. One is from the <I>Western Producer</I>, January 
26. It was entitled ``Most women for gun control: pollster''.
<P>
	The Saskatchewan Women's Agricultural Network had an 
annual meeting on January 21 and debated a resolution to 
oppose gun control. The resolution was not passed. The director, 
Elaine Kacsmar, said they were not totally against the 
registration of guns but that they were against having to pay an 
enormous amount of money to register guns.
<P>
	The second point I would like to raise is that the now famous 
Alberta poll done by the present Government of Alberta is 
registered in opposition to gun control. It in turn did not believe 
the federal polling that was done in that province. I am sure the 
member for Yorkton-Melville was possibly thinking of these 
results when he made his remarks earlier.
<P>
	On February 2 the data seemed to indicate in Alberta that 
there were different pockets and regions but rural Alberta was in 
some regions as high as 72 per cent in favour of registry. Central 
Alberta was about 50 per cent; we will even drop a couple to 48 
per cent. Northern Alberta was 56 per cent. Overall the data 
would indicate at that snapshot of time that over 65 per cent 
were in favour.
<P>
	I have enjoyed many open and frank discussions with the 
Minister of Justice and my caucus colleagues as well on the 
entire issue of the firearms proposals. Throughout these caucus 
discussions, some formal, some not so formal, at no point was I 
ordered, threatened or instructed to vote in favour of or against 
this bill.
<P>
	Unquestionably I will be voting in favour because I sense it 
does show some movement to allow for a middle of the road 
position for all members of society.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe that our caucuses, regional and national, provided 
every member on our side of the House every opportunity to 
contribute and develop those components that were of concern 
to them.
<P>
	Bill C-68 reflects the November 30 action plan but has been 
changed to accommodate some legitimate handgun owners' 
concerns. Like all other owners of prohibited firearms, 
individuals who possessed handguns on or before February 14, 
1995 will be able to buy and sell in the same class those firearms 
which are now listed as prohibited.
<P>
	Owners will be able to use the handguns for the purpose of 
which they were originally obtained whether target shooting or 
collecting. Might I comment that to the very avid target shooters 
in my riding that is the same as golf is to me. They fire off 300 
rounds in a very controlled, safe environment. They tell me that 
they feel great. I wish them well and I hope it continues. I am 
sure it will.
<P>
	The bill is the outcome of consultations with many 
individuals, groups, organizations across Canada. It is intensive 
work involving the justice department, Revenue Canada and the 
Department of the Solicitor General, among others.
<P>
	Owning a firearm is a privilege. It is not a right. As such, it is 
subject to regulation by government because firearms can be 
dangerous and it is only sensible to have some degree of 
regulation. People can lose a privilege. In fact I am informed 
that 40,000 Canadians for sundry reasons have lost the right to 
own firearms, about 700 in Manitoba and about the same 
number in Saskatchewan. Of course, it will vary with the level of 
population from coast to coast.
<P>
	It has been my desire to see that reasonable guidelines are put 
in place where hunters will continue to hunt, recreational and 
competitive programming will continue to produce world class 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10093"> 10093 </A></B>
<P>
competitors and collectors will be  able to trade, buy or sell with 
reasonable guidelines in place.
<P>
	In the end the thrust of this bill is to achieve a safer Canadian 
society. I hope that my hon. colleagues will bear with me while I 
explain the background from which I speak today.
<P>
	My twin brother and I, who I am sure my colleague across the 
way will remember, grew up on a farm in central Manitoba. For 
whatever the reasons my parents saw no need to own firearms.
<P>
	However rummaging in the attic one day-of course it is my 
twin brother who did all these nasty things-we located two old 
firearms. One was a shotgun with absolutely no trigger action 
left and the other one was an old Snider rifle which was used in 
one of the wars, the first world war or earlier.
<P>
	We played with those for a number of years. I do not know 
what has become of them but obviously they were relics. If we 
had the same rules then that we are going to have, we would be in 
some legal difficulty.
<P>
	I do recall however that my friends purchased .22 calibre 
firearms for their use when they ``came of age''. I would go 
hunting with them. The admonition from my parents at that time 
was to be careful.
<P>
	The point that I make is that for most cases, that was enough. 
Most of us were. In the 1940s and 1950s, one could acquire 
firearms by mail order, could use them without training, could 
will them without any inhibiting regulation.
<P>
	Those of us who survived without regulatory interference feel 
that we have somehow lost some freedoms and privileges in the 
intervening years, as we have moved into an era where because 
of societal difficulties we have developed a system of regulation 
for the training, acquisition, sale and storage of firearms.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would have to say that my age group can look 
back to a very idyllic time where responsibility was a given, care 
and caution was expected. It is these memories that tend to anger 
the firearm owners of today.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to refer the hon. member to a number of 
reasons for which there is such growing opposition across the 
country to more regulations for law-abiding gun owners.
<P>
	One reason is that it is costly. The minister indicated that it 
would cost $85 million to implement this legislation. Other 
estimates reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars. People 
on this side of the House, certainly at this time of budgetary 
constraint, would question why we are spending this money on 
the registration of firearms. The money would be better spent on 
health care or other social programs.
<P>
	The second reason is that it is a non-secure system. If a hacker 
can break into the Pentagon's computer list, it will certainly 
make a shopping list for criminals once the information is out.
<P>
	The third reason-and members opposite will say that only 
those who are paranoid will say this-is that this is another step 
toward confiscation. The minister has repeatedly said that he 
believes only law enforcement officers and armed forces 
personnel should have firearms. When he makes those 
statements is it any wonder that Canadians are paranoid that this 
is another step toward confiscation of their legally acquired 
firearms?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not really hear a question, 
so I will comment on his comments.
<P>
	At the present time we do have a registration system. A 
firearm can be tracked: where it was manufactured, through the 
distributor, wholesaler, retailer, to the end purchaser. However, 
to do that requires hundreds of hours to go through the ledgers of 
various organizations.
<P>
	The kind of system that I envision would be almost like a 
charge card. All the rifles would be shown in black print. We 
would instantly be able to locate a rifle by running it through the 
network, which would reduce the cost and time which is now 
required.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have always 
found the hon. member to be very reasonable.
<P>
	Has he done a poll in his constituency? If he has not, will he, 
and will he follow his constituents' advice on this issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, no, I have not. Yes, I am 
reasonable. I will pursue the same privileges as the hon. member 
from Edmonton; I will follow my conscience.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-68 respecting firearms. I am 
somewhat surprised with what I heard in this debate, which I 
have been following from the beginning. I noticed antagonistic 
positions. I noticed, coming perhaps a little more often from our 
colleagues from the Reform Party, arguments that seem 
disproportionate and highly questionable to me. I will get back 
to this in my remarks.
<P>
	Let me tell you right away that I agree with the principle of the 
bill introduced by the Minister of Justice. I will start with a brief 
outline of the bill, and then move to the basis for my supporting 
it.
<P>
	Bill C-68 establishes a licensing system for the carrying and 
use of firearms.
<P>
	This bill also establishes a Canada-wide firearms registration 
system. I raise these two points immediately because, from what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10094"> 10094 </A></B>
<P>
I could see in the debate so far, these are two aspects of the bill 
that prompt people to oppose it, often fiercely.
<P>
	Moreover, the bill calls for stricter controls on the import, 
trafficking and smuggling of firearms in Canada. It provides for 
stiffer sentences of imprisonment for individuals who commit 
serious crimes with firearms. The current minimum sentence of 
one year, under section 85 of the Criminal Code, would be 
increased to four years with this bill.
<P>
	At last, certain types of handguns would now be prohibited in 
Canada. The bill prohibits the import or sale of handguns using 
.25 or .32 cartridges as well as handguns with a barrel equal or 
less than four inches in length. This provision applies to 
approximately 85 per cent of handguns in Canada.
<P>
	Finally, the bill makes any violation of the provisions 
regarding licensing and registration a criminal offence.
<P>
	There are perhaps seven million firearms in Canada today. 
This is an estimate, as any round figure, because no one knows 
for sure. Some people have had firearms for many, many years 
in their closets or basements. I personally have two: a small .22 
calibre rifle and a 12 gauge shotgun. They are in a closet. I have 
not used either of these firearms in over ten years, but I think I 
have owned them for 20 years. No one knew that I owned 
firearms. Like many other Canadians, I fall in that statistical 
category.
<P>
	It is also a fact that Canadians are in favour of firearms 
control. I will continue next time, Mr. Speaker.

	Pursuant to an order of this House, I will introduce today a bill

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, a lot of people 
think I should sit down now.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, there are times in the progress of a people when 
fundamental challenges must be faced, when fundamental 
choices must be made, and a new course charted. For Canada, 
this is one of those times. Our resolve, our values, our very way 
of life as Canadians are being tested.
<P>
	The choice is clear. We can take the path, too well trodden, of 
minimal change, of least resistance, of leadership lost. Or we 
can set out on a new road of fundamental reform, of renewal, of 
hope restored. Today we have made our choice. Today we take 
action.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is a window of extraordinary opportunity. Thanks to the 
hard work of millions upon millions of Canadians, our economy 
is now stronger than it has been for years.
<P>
	Last year, economic growth in Canada was the highest of any 
G-7 country. We are projected to lead again this year. In the past 
year, 433,000 jobs have been created, and Canada's exports have 
never been higher. As a result, our balance of payments has 
improved dramatically.
<P>
	Productivity has surged. Our cost competitiveness is at its 
highest level in more than 40 years. Canada remains one of the 
lowest inflation countries in the world.
<P>
	Canadians want to keep it that way, and so does this 
government. The targets that we set with the Bank of Canada 
will make sure that happens.
<P>
	These statistics tell a story of an economy in bloom; an 
economy of growth and new jobs. However, there are two clouds 
that loom over our country's horizon.
<P>
	The first is the uncertainty that some would create over the 
future of Quebec. Let there be no doubt-that challenge will be 
met. Quebecers do not want Canada, their country, torn apart. 
The second cloud is the debt and deficit. Dealing with that 
challenge is our purpose today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10095"> 10095 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This government came into office because it believes that the 
nation's priority must be jobs and growth. And it is because of 
that, not in spite of that, that we must act now to restore the 
nation's finances to health.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister has said: ``The time to reduce deficits 
is when the economy is growing. So now is the time''. Not to act 
now to put our fiscal house in order would be to abandon the 
purposes for which our party exists and this government stands: 
competence, compassion, reform and hope.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	The debt and the deficit are not inventions of ideology. They 
are facts of arithmetic. The quicksand of compound interest is 
real. The last thing Canadians need is another lecture on the 
dangers of the deficit. The only thing Canadians want is clear 
action. Therefore let me go directly to the bottom line.
<P>
	Last year, in our first budget, we laid out a firm course of 
action. We said that we would reduce the deficit in this fiscal 
year, 1994-95 to no more than $39.7 billion. We now estimate 
that the underlying deficit for the current fiscal year will be 
about $35.3 billion, or $4.4 billion below our target.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will still be well under the target, even after booking 
certain one-time charges related to some of the major reforms 
contained in this budget.
<P>
	Looking ahead, we pledged in our last budget that the deficit 
in 1995-96 would not exceed $32.7 billion and would be 
reduced to 3 per cent of GDP-now estimated to be $24.3 
billion-by 1996-97. It is now evident that unless we take 
further direct action, those deficit targets will not be met.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is because interest rates are higher today than anyone 
thought they would be. Therefore based on prudent economic 
assumptions and with very sizeable contingency reserves in 
place, we could face shortfalls of $5 billion from our deficit 
target in 1995-96 and $10.6 billion the year after. Those gaps 
must be closed. With this budget, we are closing them.
<P>
	We will hit our deficit target for 1995-96. We will hit our 
target for 1996-97. And of equal importance, the downward 
track established by the actions taken in this budget will 
continue in the years thereafter.
<P>
	Taking the next two fiscal years together, this budget delivers 
cumulative savings of $15.6 billion, with spending cuts for 
$13.4 billion. Going beyond to 1997-98, the reforms we are 
introducing today will continue to pay off with further savings 
totalling $13.3 billion.
<P>
	Over the next three years, the actions in this budget deliver 
almost seven dollars of spending cuts for every one dollar of 
new tax revenue. This budget will deliver cumulative savings of 
$29 billion over the next three years, of which $25.3 billion are 
expenditure cuts. This is by far the largest set of actions in any 
Canadian budget since demobilization after World War II.
<P>
	These measures will have a very significant impact on the 
level of government spending in the future.
<P>
	By 1996-97 we will have reduced program spending from 
$120 billion in 1993-94 to under $108 billion. Relative to the 
size of our economy, program spending will be lower in 
1996-97 than at any time since 1951. The impact of these 
measures on the fiscal health of this country will be significant 
and substantial.
<P>
	By 1996-97, our financial requirements, that is, what we 
actually have to borrow from the markets, will be down from 
$30 billion last year to $13.7 billion, or 1.7 per cent of GDP. 
That percentage is lower than what is projected for the United 
States, for Germany, for Japan. In fact, it is lower than what is 
projected for all of the national governments of every country of 
the G-7.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps most importantly, in that same year the debt will no 
longer be growing faster than the economy. The debt to GDP 
ratio will have begun to decline and we are committed to 
keeping this ratio on a permanent downward track.
<P>
	We face a historic challenge in this country and this is a 
historic response. We have always said that meeting our targets 
was the least we could do, not the best we would do. That is why 
it is so important that this year we will have beaten our deficit 
target by a substantial amount. And looking ahead, building on 
the advice of the finance committee of this House, for which I 
am very grateful, we have deliberately chosen economic 
assumptions that are once again more cautious than those of 
most private sector forecasters. Once again, we are backing up 
our assumptions with substantial contingency reserves of $2.5 
billion in 1995-96 and $3 billion the year after.
<P>
	This means that even if interest rates go up next year by 
almost one and one-half percentage points, more than our 
already cautious assumption, our fiscal position will be fully 
protected. But it means something else which is very important. 
If we do not need our contingency reserve, it will not be spent. It 
will go to reducing the deficit further. This is what happened in 
1994-95. And because of our prudent economic assumptions, 
one should not be surprised if it happens in 1995-96 and 
1996-97 as well.
<P>
	If interest rates and income growth conform to the average 
private sector forecast, the deficit in 1996-97 could be brought 
down below $19 billion, in fact some $5.5 billion less than this 
budget projects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10096"> 10096 </A></B>
<P>
	We have always said that our 3 per cent interim target was 
a station on the way, not our ultimate destination. Interim 
means interim. Canadians want more than temporary fiscal 
remission. They want full fiscal health. It is absolutely essential 
that once we meet our interim target we do not stall. We will 
continue to set firm, short term deficit goals, rolling two-year 
targets until the deficit is erased.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said two days ago that balancing the 
books is our goal. In government short term targets are the surest 
way to zero. They are the most effective spending control 
anyone could impose on a government. They keep our feet to the 
fire. They make it impossible to postpone needed action and 
they prevent fanciful, foolish forecasts.
<P>
	The government wants Canadians to be able to judge it not on 
its rhetoric but on its results.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The targets we set are crucial. But how we get to our targets is 
every bit as important. Because the fact is that if we are to ensure 
durable fiscal progress, building towards budget balance-that 
can only happen if we redesign the very role and structure of 
government itself.
<P>
	If we secure that reform, it will continue to pay off in 1997-98 
and every year thereafter. Indeed, as far as we are concerned, it 
is this reform in the structure of government spending-in the 
very redefinition of government itself-that is the main 
achievement of this budget.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	After extensive review this budget overhauls not only how 
government works but what government does. We are acting on 
a new vision of the role of government in the economy. In many 
cases this means smaller government; in all cases it means 
smarter government.
<P>
	We are dramatically reducing subsidies to business. We are 
changing our support systems for agriculture. We will be putting 
government activities on a commercial basis wherever that is 
practical and productive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will be overhauling the unemployment insurance system 
as part of our social security reform, and reforming the system 
of transfers to the provinces-putting it on a basis that is more in 
line with the actual responsibilities of the two levels of 
government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is essential that our effort be guided by clear principles and 
values. First, we believe it is crucial that the government get its 
own house in order. Our budget must focus on cutting spending, 
not raising taxes.
<P>
	Second, government must define its role in a way that mirrors 
our priorities as a people. Blind cuts are bad cuts. Canadians 
need a budget designed to promote growth and jobs.
<P>
	The third principle is frugality. Governments do not have 
money. They are given money, money from the pockets of 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and so government must 
behave as if every dollar counts because every dollar does.
<P>
	Finally, we must never, ever lose sight of the need to be fair, 
fair among our regions and fair among individual Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If our purpose is to get the economy right, we need to redesign 
the role of the government in the economy to fit the size of our 
pocketbook and the priorities of our people. What is that role? It 
is to provide a framework for the private sector to create jobs, to 
see an aggressive trade strategy as central to Canada's industrial 
strategy. And it is initiatives such as the Prime Minister's, in 
Asia and Latin America, that will create opportunity for 
thousands of Canadians here at home.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What is the role of government in the economy? It is to ensure 
that the nation's finances are healthy. It is to do what only 
government can do best and leave the rest for those who can do 
better, whether they are in business, labour or in the voluntary 
sector.
<P>
	This budget puts our priorities into action. It does so after a 
top to bottom review of all departments of government led by 
the Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal. As a result 
we will be able to reduce departmental spending dramatically 
over the next three years while maintaining the services that are 
truly needed by Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, between this fiscal year and 1997-98, annual 
spending will go down by $1.6 billion at Defence, $550 million 
for international assistance, $1.4 billion at Transport.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over the next three years spending will be cut by more than 
$600 million at natural resources, almost $900 million at HRD, 
over $200 million at fisheries, almost $900 million in the 
industry portfolio, more than $550 million in the regional 
agencies, nearly $450 million at agriculture. In short, overall 
departmental spending will be cut by almost 19 per cent in just 
three years.
<P>
	Let me emphasize, this is not a slowdown in the increase of 
spending max as cuts. These are not the cuts of yesteryear. These 
are real cuts in real dollars.

<P>
	In the last recession every household, every business, every 
volunteer group in this country was forced to face up to hard 
choices and real change, but the Government of Canada did not. 
In this budget we are bringing government size and its structure 
into line with what we can afford.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As a result of the cut-back and reform of programs, the 
President of the Treasury Board has announced that the public 
service will be reduced by some 45,000 positions over three 
years, with 20,000 being eliminated by the summer of next year.
<P>
	Because so many of those affected have given so many years 
of valuable services to Canadians, we are committed to 
downsizing the public service as fairly as possible.
<P>
	In some departments the scope for savings has been less than 
in others. For example, we are responding to Canadians' 
concern about public safety in their communities by 
strengthening gun control and largely maintaining existing 
levels of support for law enforcement, the justice system and 
correctional services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a second example, the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration has made clear our commitment to a fair, 
affordable and well-enforced immigration policy. Therefore, a 
form of financial guarantee will ensure that sponsors of 
immigrants meet their obligations.
<P>
	In addition, a $975 fee will be charged all adults immigrating 
to Canada to offset the costs of immigrant services.

	The measures in this budget share a common foundation and 
philosophy. For example, across government, we are taking 
major action in this budget to substantially reduce subsidies to 
business. These subsidies do not create long-lasting jobs. 
Nobody has made that case more strongly than business itself. In 
this budget, total spending on business subsidies will decline 
from $3.8 billion in this fiscal year to $1.5 billion by 1997-98. 
That is a reduction of 60 per cent in three years. Remaining 
industrial assistance will be targeted on the key engines of 
economic growth-trade development, science and technology 
and small and medium size business.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Transportation and direct agricultural production subsidies 
are being eliminated or substantially reduced. This is historic 
change. Decades ago, even into the last century, those subsidies 
were put in place to respond to Canada's transportation and 
agricultural needs then existing. As time has passed, those needs 
have evolved but the subsidy structure has not. For years 
governments have known about the need for change but they 
have  hesitated to act. But we cannot postpone action any longer.
<P>
	To that end, subsidies under the Western Grain Transportation 
Act are eliminated effective 1995-96, resulting in savings of 
$2.6 billion over the next five years. This subsidy evolved from 
the Crow rate established in 1897. It has played a pivotal role in 
the development of the prairie economy, but in more recent 
years it has come to restrict the ability of prairie farmers and 
their industry to adapt and to compete.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	To facilitate this change we will make a one time payment of 
$1.6 billion to prairie farm land owners to be provided for in this 
fiscal year 1994-95.
<P>
	We will invest a further $300 million over several years to 
facilitate a more efficient grain handling and transportation 
system. We will provide new credit guarantees to help Canadian 
farmers sell to non-sovereign buyers abroad.
<P>
	Next, the Atlantic freight subsidies are also being eliminated, 
effective in the upcoming fiscal year. This will result in savings 
of $500 million over the next five years alone.
<P>
	The elimination of this subsidy will contribute to a better 
transportation system. To help ensure this, the government will 
set up a five-year, $326 million transportation adjustment 
program that among other things will help modernize the 
highway system in Atlantic Canada and eastern Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Consistent with the recent decision of federal and provincial 
ministers of agriculture, a core national ``whole farm'' 
stabilization program will be developed, together with crop 
insurance and province-specific programs.
<P>
	The costs of these initiatives will be shared between the 
federal government, the provinces and farmers themselves. This 
will replace current programs based on individual agricultural 
commodities. It will therefore encourage innovation and 
diversification, as well as resulting in a 30-per-cent reduction 
in federal contributions to agricultural safety nets. Next, the 
subsidy paid to industrial milk producers will be reduced by 15 
per cent in 1995-96 and by a further 15 per cent the following 
year. The future of this program will be reviewed, in 
consultation with industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10098"> 10098 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, the feed-freight assistance subsidies are being 
discontinued and the Livestock Feed Bureau will be wound up. 
A portion of the resulting savings will be redirected on a 
transitional basis to help adjustment in the livestock industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Financial support to business should only be provided if there 
is no alternative and a valid national need clearly exists. That is 
why we have made a clear public commitment that new funding 
for mega projects will not take place.
<P>
	In the last year I have had numerous requests for the funding 
of such projects cross my desk and every one of these has been 
turned down.
<P>
	In addition, with this budget we are eliminating the Public 
Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act. It can no longer be justified 
in today's fiscal circumstances.
<P>
	Small businesses are the primary creators of new jobs in this 
country. Removing barriers to their success is a core priority for 
the government and for Canadians, as is providing practical 
assistance for them to survive and to grow.
<P>
	Last year we announced that we would review the $500,000 
lifetime capital gains tax exemption for small business and for 
farmers. As a result of that review, we are announcing that no 
changes to it will be made.
<P>
	We see our regional agencies as playing an important role in 
the creation of opportunity and long lasting jobs. However, we 
do not believe that handouts are the way to do it. Therefore, 
consistent with our new policy to sharply reduce business 
subsidies, assistance to firms will be provided primarily through 
repayable loans on terms tailored to foster genuine opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	This government is determined that small businesses will 
have access to the financing they need to continue being our 
number one creator of jobs. While some progress has been made 
there continue to be very large gaps in the system. We believe 
that Canada's banks have a special obligation to help close those 
gaps. That is why between now and the fall we have told the 
banks that we will be working with them to hammer out 
meaningful performance benchmarks for small business 
financing. Progress during the following year will be monitored 
against those benchmarks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is ideas today that will generate the products and the jobs of 
tomorrow. That is why science and technology will become a 
predominant focus for our business support. In the future, our 
science and technology efforts will be concentrated more 
strategically on activities that foster innovation, rapid 
commercialization and value-added production.
<P>
	As only one example, the Medical Research Council has 
mounted a promising initiative to bring together private sector 
capital and leading academic research  efforts. That is the kind 
of imagination we will encourage as a government in order to 
stretch government's science dollars further and more 
effectively, so that Canada's new economy may prosper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government is committed to privatizing and 
commercializing government operations wherever feasible and 
appropriate. Our view is straightforward. If government does 
not need to run something it should not, and in the future it will 
not.
<P>
	Today we are announcing that the Minister of Transport will 
initiate steps this year to sell CN. He will also commercialize the 
air navigation system. When market conditions are favourable 
the Minister of Natural Resources will sell our remaining 70 per 
cent interest in Petro-Canada. The Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services will examine divesting all or parts of the 
Canada Communications Group.
<P>
	Let me be clear. This is not a one shot exercise. Our effort to 
identify other candidates for privatization will continue. This is 
not ideology, it is simple common sense.
<P>
	Let me say one thing before leaving program review. We have 
accomplished a great deal over the last year. We have also 
confirmed something. Getting government right does not end 
with this budget or any other, for the essence of good 
government is in fact permanent ongoing program review, and 
we are going to provide good government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians make ends meet by watching their dollars every 
day. It is time government did the same. Last month, the 
government introduced a new and much tighter system to 
manage its spending. Departments will have to find the money 
for their new initiatives from existing budgets.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As another example of new and better management, in the 
future for the first time government departments will have to 
prepare three-year business plans. These plans will be subject to 
parliamentary and therefore public scrutiny.
<P>
	Our approach to interest group funding will change as well. 
Some groups will continue to be funded as is. For others in a 
position to secure financial support from outside government, 
we will move toward a system based on the provision of 
matching funds. For still other groups, continued funding will 
not be possible due to our financial situation.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is no more important task than to do everything we can 
to help Canadians get jobs, keep jobs or find better jobs. But the 
fact is that the existing structure of programs does not do that 
nearly well enough. That is why the Minister of Human 
Resources Development will be announcing the details of a new 
human resources  investment fund. Many of the department's 
existing programs that foster employability will be combined 
under the umbrella of that new fund. A sharper focus on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10099"> 10099 </A></B>
<P>
priorities, together with more efficient, streamlined services 
will yield substantial permanent savings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must also continue to improve the unemployment 
insurance program, building on the substantial reforms that 
were introduced in last year's budget.
<P>
	As has been emphasized so often by the minister of HRD, we 
need to move away from passive support, away from 
dependence, toward active assistance, toward independence. In 
essence, a key job for UI in the future must be to help Canadians 
stay off UI.
<P>
	Later this year the minister intends to table legislation that 
will build on the best elements of unemployment insurance to 
create a fundamentally reformed program that addresses the 
needs of our population. It is Canada's workers and Canada's 
businesses that pay for UI. The program of the future must be 
one they can afford.
<P>
	Canada's strong economic performance and the UI reform 
which the government intends to have in place no later than July 
1, 1996 will reduce the overall size of the UI program by a 
minimum of 10 per cent.
<P>
	This overall reform combined with improvements in the 
administration of the UI program will secure savings for 
taxpayers of $700 million in 1996-97.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Improved employment conditions are rapidly eliminating the 
deficit in the unemployment insurance account which had 
reached almost $6 billion in 1993. With no increase in premium 
rates, the surplus in the account will be allowed to rise above $5 
billion through to the end of 1996. This surplus will be 
maintained and used as a buffer to mitigate unemployment 
insurance premium rate increases during periods of slow 
economic growth. The result of these measures will be an 
unemployment insurance program that does much better at 
investing in people, and will lead to lower, more stable 
unemployment insurance premium rates that will encourage the 
creation of jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will never secure the kind of structural change that we 
need without reforming the system of transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	This budget sets out some key parameters. Let me be very 
clear. As we go forward, we are unequivocally committed to a 
co-operative approach. That is why, to provide predictability, 
we said in last year's budget that we would not change the 
system of major transfers before 1996-97. That is a 
commitment this budget maintains.
<P>
	It is also why in March of last year, as one of the first acts of 
this government, we renewed the equalization program for five 
years. We are not changing it now.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	However, some changes in other transfers are needed, 
changes that will address two fundamental requirements. The 
first is a system of transfers that is more effective in meeting 
contemporary needs. The second is a system that is financially 
sustainable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Concerning the first requirement, we believe that the 
restrictions attached by the federal government to transfer 
payments in areas of clear provincial responsibility should be 
minimized.
<P>
	At present, transfers under the Canada assistance plan come 
with a lot of unnecessary strings attached. The provinces are 
clearly responsible for designing and delivering social 
assistance programs. The current cost sharing method no longer 
helps us to implement these programs as effectively as possible 
and in tune with local needs.
<P>
	So we are prepared to address those issues by funding CAP in 
a similar way as we fund the existing EPF transfers for health 
and post-secondary education.
<P>
	As a result, the core rationale for the present segregation of 
the three transfers into separate categories disappears. 
Therefore, we are combining all three into a single consolidated 
block transfer, called the Canadian social transfer, beginning in 
1996-97.
<P>
	Provinces will now be able to design more innovative social 
programs-programs that respond to the needs of people today 
rather than to inflexible rules.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However, flexibility does not mean a free for all.
<P>
	There are national goals and principles we believe must still 
apply and which the vast majority of Canadians support. Our 
goal must be to combine greater flexibility with continued 
fidelity to these principles.
<P>
	The conditions of the Canada Health Act will be maintained: 
universality, comprehensiveness, accessibility, portability and 
public administration. For this government, those are 
fundamental.
<P>
	In addition, we will maintain the existing principle that 
provinces must provide social assistance to applicants without 
minimum residency requirements.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
will be inviting all provincial governments to work together on 
developing, through mutual consent, a set of shared principles 
and objectives that could underlie the Canada social transfer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10100"> 10100 </A></B>
<P>
	This reform deals with the requirement for a better 
functioning system of transfers. But equally we need a system 
that can be financially sustained.
<P>
	Our major transfers to the provinces currently amount to $37 
billion in cash and tax points. The cash portion alone represents 
about 21 per cent of our total program spending.
<P>
	Addressing our fiscal challenge simply does not allow us to 
leave that spending untouched. We must establish the fiscal 
parameters of a new system. However, as a matter of fairness 
and balance, we believe that the provinces should not be 
expected to bear more of the fiscal burden than we are prepared 
to impose on ourselves. This budget meets that test.
<P>
	As we have said, no changes in major transfers are being made 
for next year, 1995-96, even though we are taking substantial 
action that year to reduce our own spending.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	For the following year the new Canada social transfer will be 
$26.9 billion, cash and tax points combined. This will be about 
$2.5 billion less than the projected transfer would be under the 
present system.
<P>
	This means that the total of all major federal transfers to the 
provinces in 1996-97 will be 4.4 per cent lower than they are 
today. That compares favourably with the reduction in spending 
in our own backyard, that is to say, everything except transfers 
to the provinces which will be down 7.3 per cent by that same 
year.
<P>
	In 1997-98 the Canada social transfer will be $25.1 billion or 
about $4.5 billion less than what would have been transferred 
under the existing system. To keep that in perspective, such a 
reduction in transfers would equal about 3 per cent of aggregate 
provincial revenues.
<P>
	To ensure that everyone shares in fiscal restraint it will also be 
necessary to subject territorial financing to reduced limits.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We believe these measures respond to the need for a more 
affordable and effective system of transfers. But our challenge 
and our commitment do not end here. With this budget, we are 
saying yes to the provinces' desire to sit down for a bottom-up 
review of the financing of both levels of government. If there are 
ideas to make the fiscal side of federalism more efficient, let's 
hear them. And if there are ways to make this federation 
function better, then by all means let's do it.
<P>
	One of the greatest reforms ever introduced by a Canadian 
government has been the provision of decent support for elderly 
Canadians-who have given, and continue to give-so much to 
their families and to their country.
<P>
	In recent weeks and months, there is probably no member of 
this House who has not received letters or had conversations 
with elderly Canadians who are worried that the protection their 
country has provided them will be eaten away.
<P>
	Because of that, this government is absolutely committed to 
providing a fair and <I>sustainable</I> system of protection for 
Canada's seniors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are two pillars of the public pension system. One is the 
Canada and Quebec pension plans. The other is the old age 
security and the guaranteed income supplement.
<P>
	Canadian seniors deserve to know that those public pensions 
will be there for them. That in turn requires reform to ensure that 
the pension system is sustainable in the long term.
<P>
	Concerning the CPP the most recent actuarial report was 
released last week and it leaves no doubt that we will have to 
take steps to ensure that the plan continues to be sustainable. 
This we will do when we sit down this fall with the provinces to 
review the CPP.
<P>
	Let me now turn to the second pillar, the OAS and the GIS. 
Clearly it is necessary to make these pensions sustainable as 
well.
<P>
	To ensure that our approach to the public pension system is 
comprehensive, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
and I will be releasing later this year a paper on the changes 
required in both pillars of the public pension system to ensure its 
affordability. The focus will be on fairness and sustainability. 
Consultations will take place once the paper is released. It is our 
intention that the reforms be legislated to take effect in 1997.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	In the meantime, we are announcing today a change in the 
method of payment of the OAS to high income seniors who are 
subject to the so-called clawback rules.
<P>
	Beginning July 1996, monthly OAS payments will be 
calculated and paid with the clawback amount subtracted, based 
on the prior year's tax return. This will yield one-time savings 
of about $300 million.
<P>
	Finally, to ensure fairness, we will be requiring Canadians 
who are non-residents of this country to file a statement of their 
worldwide income in order to continue to receive OAS benefits.
<P>
	Let me turn now to the question of revenues. There is not one 
solitary Canadian who likes taxes. As we speak millions of 
Canadians pay their fair share of taxes and do so on time. 
However there are those who do not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10101"> 10101 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On a priority basis, the Minister of National Revenue will be 
taking the following measures to step up his department's 
efforts with regard to taxes that are owed. For example, the 
interest rate charged on over-due taxes will be increased by 2 
percentage points.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Next, we are announcing steps to make the tax system more 
fair.
<P>
	The tax deferral advantages for investment income earned by 
private holding companies will be taken away.
<P>
	The current film incentive will be changed. Rather than being 
a tax shelter for high income investors, a new refundable credit 
will be provided directly to producers of Canadian films.
<P>
	Those who earn business or professional income have a tax 
advantage over many other Canadians. Because of special rules 
that allow them to select their own year end for tax purposes, 
those individuals are given an ongoing tax deferral. That 
advantage is being eliminated subject to a 10-year transition 
period.
<P>
	We are concerned that the rules regarding the resource 
allowance for the mining and petroleum industries are not 
working as originally intended. We will be meeting with the 
provinces and both industries on possible improvements to or 
replacement of this allowance.
<P>
	We will be evaluating the entire R and D tax inventive 
program to ensure its effectiveness.
<P>
	While this review is under way no bank or other financial 
institution will be eligible for these incentives related to 
information technology.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Concern has been expressed about tax advantages that may 
exist as a result of the establishment of trusts, trusts which 
largely benefit high-income Canadians.
<P>
	Therefore, for foreign trusts-and indeed for taxpayers who 
invest in foreign holdings generally-we are introducing more 
stringent reporting requirements.
<P>
	Second, this budget eliminates all tax advantages that flow 
from the establishment of family trusts. That involves 
eliminating the potentially unfair income spliting advantages 
that exist. And we are repealing the previous government's 
amendment that allowed deferral of the 21-year rule.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Providing tax assistance to encourage Canadians to save is an 
essential part of our retirement income security system. We are 
not prepared to compromise the integrity or the purpose of that 
system. But equally, we must ensure that the benefits of tax 
assistance are shared fairly in these times of restraint, while also 
adhering to the key principles and purposes of pension reform.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	One of those principles is that tax assistance should be 
provided for contributions to registered saving plans based on 
earnings up to two and one-half times the average wage and no 
more. Therefore, we will be reducing the upper limit on 
deductible RRSP contributions to $13,500 for 1996 and 1997. 
That limit will then be allowed to progressively increase to 
$15,500 by 1999. The maximum pension limit for registered 
defined benefit plans will be frozen at its current level through 
1998.
<P>
	We are also introducing measures to improve the overall 
fairness of this system by tightening some existing provisions. 
For example, beginning in 1996, the over contribution 
allowance for RRSPs will be reduced from its current $8,000 to 
$2,000.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our effort to ensure an effective and fair system of taxation 
does not begin-or end-with this budget.
<P>
	We want to make absolutely clear our ongoing commitment to 
tax-reform.
<P>
	If we must constantly scrutinize government spending-as we 
must-then let it be clear we must also constantly scrutinize the 
fairness and effectiveness of the tax system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Despite the size of the savings we must secure, this budget 
focuses almost entirely on reducing the spending of 
government, not increasing taxes for Canadians. That being 
said, spending cuts themselves get us very near to our targets, 
but there is a small gap we must close. Therefore, we have found 
it necessary to do four things.
<P>
	First, the existing large corporations tax will be increased by 
12.5 per cent effective immediately in order that big companies 
contribute more to help bring the deficit down.
<P>
	Second, we are raising the existing corporate surtax from 3 
per cent to 4 per cent.
<P>
	Third, effective midnight tonight, the federal excise tax on 
gasoline will be increased by 1.5 cents per litre, raising $500 
million annually. This will restore total revenue from all federal 
excise taxes to approximately the level they were in 1993-94.
<P>
	Finally, we are announcing today a temporary tax on the 
capital of large, deposit-taking institutions, including the 
banks. That tax will be in effect until October 31, 1996 and will 
raise about $100 million.
<P>
	Taken together, the revenue measures in this budget are far 
overshadowed by the size of the spending cuts we have made. 
For every $1 raised in new tax revenue over the next three years, 
there are almost $7 in spending cuts. Furthermore, in this 
budget, like last year's, we are not increasing personal income 
tax rates one iota.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	This budget sets this country on a sure course of fiscal 
responsibility and government renewal. Our task is not over and 
our efforts will not cease. Those who believe that the 
government will inevitably let up in its effort to cut costs as the 
next election approaches simply do not understand the 
conviction of the Canadian people that a deteriorating national 
balance sheet is no longer acceptable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Constant renewal is what this country is all about. Indeed, it is 
the essential ingredient of a dynamic federalism.
<P>
	There are those who would argue that this country, this 
federation, cannot change-that Canada is about the status quo. 
That is nonsense.
<P>
	None of us is here to defend the status quo. We are here to 
change it. And with this budget we are.
<P>
	Providing new fiscal leadership. Reducing overlap and 
duplication. Giving the provinces greater freedom to design and 
deliver services. These changes respond to positive pressures 
for change from across the country.
<P>
	They mark a recognition on the part of us all that in this tough, 
competitive world, despite the differences we have, we all have 
so much to gain by working together-productively, rather than 
standing apart-destructively.
<P>
	This budget faces difficult choices for all Canadians. But this 
year, in Quebec, some of us are also being asked to choose a 
country. To choose to remain proud partners in a large, 
reforming country. Or to become something else-smaller and 
alone. To embrace real change and improvement, or to join those 
who pretend that the road to a better future lies through fracture.
<P>
	The separatist view has always been the same-its own status 
quo. Ignoring reform that has happened. Denying reform when it 
is occurring. Refusing reform when it is offered.
<P>
	That is not our position. By definition, Canadian federalism is 
change-always improving, always progressing and today, with 
this budget, reaching ahead to a new phase of renewal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is customary at this time, when closing the presentation of a 
government's budget, to claim that the measures being taken 
have solved every problem, responded to every expectation and 
addressed every need. That is something we will not say today.
<P>
	The fact is there is so much more that we would like to be able 
to do for the millions of Canadians who care little about the 
world of dividends and derivatives and simply worry about 
making ends meet. That being said, if we believed that dealing 
with the deficit would do nothing to protect what we value, if we 
believed that it would do nothing to offer hope to ordinary 
Canadians, we would not be acting now because it is they who 
suffer  when government must focus its precious resources on 
satisfying lenders abroad rather than real needs at home.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	For all of us who care for the social fabric of this country, who 
seek a better future for our children, who are committed to the 
protection of our seniors and to the independence of our country, 
the state of the nation's finances simply has to be addressed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The choice is ours. We can either dwell on our 
imperfections-or work together towards real improvement.
<P>
	We can leave the field to those who have given up on 
Canada-or we can demonstrate trust in ourselves.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We believe this is the year we can turn the corner and turn the 
page. It may seem like a long struggle, but the light at the end of 
this tunnel is much nearer than any of us might think.
<P>
	Canadians can have confidence now in a government that has 
put the era of band-aid budgets behind it.
<P>
	Canadians can have confidence now that their social 
programs will be there for those who need them.
<P>
	Canadians can have confidence now in their country being 
one of the most attractive places in the world to invest, creating 
jobs.
<P>
	For too long, governments have known the need for reform 
and renewal; known the need, but not the will. That has been the 
problem with the governments of this country. This government 
has made its choice and it is against the status quo and in favour 
of a stronger country.
<P>
	Let me close by quoting from another Canadian in an earlier 
time, a member of a previous government who, as I remember, 
did not particularly like finance ministers:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Government must not live in the past-Every day there are new needs to be 
met. If inflation is to be fought, unemployment countered and something done, 
and soon, to get Canadian prosperity back into its stride, the government must 
begin to plan ahead-not timidly, not tentatively-but boldly, imaginatively 
and courageously.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, those words were spoken by my father in 
1957-for his time. That is what I believe we have done today, 
for ours.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to introduce 
Bill C-73, an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal 
year beginning on April 1, 1995.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the only thing the finance minister is decentralizing to 
the provinces in this budget is the deficit, and nothing else.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> He is decentralizing the deficit while making 
cuts, as we have been seeing since last year, at the expense of the 
most destitute, that is to social programs, unemployment 
insurance and everywhere except where cuts should be made.
<P>
	After the finance minister's usual generalized downloading 
since bringing down his budget in February 1994, we are now to 
witness a major downloading of the deficit and of his 
responsibilities onto the provinces.
<P>
	The cuts in federal transfer payments to the provinces, 
specifically transfers for postsecondary education, health and 
the Canada assistance plan will not be made right away this year. 
That would be far too much courage to expect from this 
government during this referendum year. But they will be made, 
the axe will fall in 1996-97, eliminating $2.5 billion in federal 
transfers for postsecondary education, health and the Canada 
assistance plan.
<P>
	Not satisfied with axing social programs and transfers to the 
provinces, in 1997-98 the federal government will cut a further 
$4.5 billion from transfers to the provinces, all of this under the 
guise of alleged decentralization, a masquerade of 
decentralization which is really just the finance minister 
downloading his responsibilities.
<P>
	These cuts of $4.5 billion to social programs in 1997-98 will 
of course have to be negotiated after the referendum. That shows 
how much the government cares about clarity, honesty and being 
compassionate about education, health and poverty. Not only 
does this government show a lack of courage by downloading its 
problems onto the provinces, it has been so hateful as to do it on 
the backs of the most destitute.
<P>
	As for the unemployment insurance fund, already drastically 
cut by $300 million last year, the minister is proposing $2.4 
billion in cuts this year and another $2.4 billion next year while 
at the same time considering a 10 per cent cut in contributions to 
the UI fund. The finance minister is hateful and arrogant enough 
to present these deficit objectives, these deficit results for 
1994-95, saying  that he has reduced his objective from $41 
billion to $39 billion. But he has pulled this off by taking the $2 
billion surplus from the unemployment insurance plan and 
deducting it from his forecasts. That explains his outstanding 
accomplishment; he did not in any sense reduce the deficit for 
this year, he simply took the surplus from the unemployment 
insurance program to make himself look good as a public sector 
manager.
<P>
	This is unacceptable. While $7.5 billion were already to have 
been cut from social programs and unemployment insurance 
over the next two or three years, the finance minister presents in 
this budget a 60 per cent cut in business subsidies over the next 
three years. Sixty per cent over three years, although the Bloc 
Quebecois and even the Conseil du patronat du Québec had 
suggested eliminating these business subsidies over the coming 
years, subsidies which most often give rise to patronage, 
inefficiency and unfair competition. Not only does the finance 
minister tell us that the $3.8 billion in subsidies will be reduced 
by only 60 per cent over three years-there will still be $1.5 
billion in business subsidies in 1997-he is cutting more than 
$300 million from CMHC for social housing. That is this 
government's concept of social justice.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Where is the reform of the tax system? Where is this so 
long-awaited reform? Where? The minister has been heralding 
it with great pomp since he assumed the position. He did not 
deliver. He never had any intention of reforming the tax system.
<P>
	What did he do about the taxation of businesses? What did he 
do to prevent a reocurrence of the recent fact that over 70,000 
profitable Canadian businesses did not pay a cent of tax to 
Ottawa? With what has he plugged this tax loophole? Nothing. 
He took no steps to collect this money that profitable businesses 
owe to federal coffers. He has slightly raised corporate taxes, 
about 1.5 per cent over three years.
<P>
	What did he do about those tax agreements signed with 
countries considered to be tax havens? Nothing. The Auditor 
General said himself that hundreds of millions of dollars are 
being transferred through bogus Canadian subsidiaries to 
foreign tax havens. What did he do about this? Once again, 
nothing.
<P>
	What did the Minister of Finance do in this budget to cut the 
tax breaks offered to extremely rich Canadian families through 
family trusts? By the way, I do thank the minister for getting rid 
of these tax breaks, but he should have cut them immediately, 
not in 1999, as is provided for in the budget. Doing it in 1999, 
what a sham.
<P>
	By then, extremely rich Canadian families will have had the 
time to dismantle their family trusts and to transfer their 
hundreds of millions of dollars to other tax shelters to avoid 
paying tax on capital gains year after year. And they dare say 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10104"> 10104 </A></B>
<P>
that they met the demands of the official opposition. The 
Minister of Finance must be joking.
<P>
	What did the Minister of Finance do in this budget to reduce 
duplication and waste? As the champion of restructuration, of 
flexible federalism, of the progressive backward status quo, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, said himself, the federal 
government will continue to be active in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. He made this comment while referring to forestry 
and health services.
<P>
	The budget itself tends to download deficit problems while 
keeping a firm central rein on areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
Be they known as Canada-wide standards, guiding principles or 
by any other name, the budget's bottom line is that over the next 
few years, there will be no decrease in overlap, duplication and 
waste in the management of public funds. We are certain that 
this overlap and wastage will persist because the federal 
government will not withdraw from areas falling under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This budget talks of an increase in taxes on gasoline but pays 
only lip service to the issue of collecting the some $6.6 billion in 
unpaid taxes payable to the federal government.
<P>
	If we compare last year's budget to this year's, we see it 
contains no concrete measure regarding the collection of these 
unpaid federal revenues. Instead of recovering these $6.6 billion 
in unpaid taxes, the minister has created new taxes, new needs 
and imposed cuts on the most needy.
<P>
	Earlier, I heard the minister talk about agriculture. It is 
disgusting what is happening with agriculture. To compensate 
the prairie provinces for the loss of the famous Crow's nest rate 
and of subsidies for the transportation of grain and for the drop 
in land values, this new budget will give western producers $1.6 
billion to start. They will also receive $1 billion in loan 
guarantees.
<P>
	To that, we can add $300 million for the transition. Close to $3 
billion will be invested in Western Canada following the 
elimination of the Crow's Nest subsidy, while there is nothing in 
the budget for Quebec. On the contrary, the budget cuts the dairy 
subsidy by 30 per cent, which will have a major impact in 
Quebec since 50 per cent of dairy production comes from that 
province.
<P>
	While giving $3 billion to Western Canada, they are cutting 
by 30 per cent the dairy subsidy to Quebec farmers, which 
amounts to between $30 million and $40 million, in addition to 
reducing their income security. That is a disgrace! They are 
perpetuating all that has been denounced for 30 years about a 
system that does not treat Western and Eastern Canada equally 
in various regards, particularly in the agricultural sector.
<P>
	I could have mentioned the blind cuts affecting cultural 
institutions, like the CBC, and regional development, but I will 
not go any further since we will have the opportunity in the 
coming days to discuss in more detail this budget, this crock 
supposedly aimed at restoring some confidence among 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Today's budget does not tackle the real problems. In fact, the 
Minister of Finance is not credible when he expresses his 
intention to eliminate the deficit, because he does not address 
our serious structural unemployment problem nor acknowledge 
the fact that there are too many levels of government in this 
country. Finally, he says he wants to eliminate the deficit 
without explaining when or how; in particular, he did not outline 
budgetary appropriations for 1997-98. We do not know where 
we are going after 1997-98. We do not know where this 
disgraceful reform to be achieved at the expense of the most 
disadvantaged and the provinces is leading us.
<P>
	To deal with both duplication and unemployment, the federal 
government should have included in its budget a proposal to 
withdraw immediately from all areas of provincial jurisdiction 
in return for the corresponding share of our federal taxes. That 
would be a real reform. That was what we were expecting. As far 
as restructuring is concerned, that is what we were expecting on 
this side of the House.
<P>
	In conclusion, the minister said at the beginning of his budget 
speech that there were two clouds looming over the horizon. 
Quebec nationalists are crying out that they want more power, 
particularly the sovereignists. The second cloud is the debt and 
deficit. The minister is deliberately looking for a scapegoat for 
his laxness. He has been lax for the past year, and all Canadians 
paid for it barely one month after his first budget in the form of 
increased mortgage or other interest rates.
<P>
	We are paying for this laxness. If a cloud is looming over the 
horizon, the minister should have added two more to replace the 
constitutional cloud. His government is the looming cloud. His 
government has had a year and a half, but has not made the right 
decisions, leaving us facing huge cuts this year. And they will 
carry over into the coming years as well. Because the 
government is lax, we have this enormous problem of the federal 
debt before us. Another cloud looming over the Canadian 
horizon is unemployment.
<P>
	There should have been talk of tackling unemployment, but 
no mention was made, because it is not a priority for the 
minister. It is not a cloud looming over this government, despite 
the fact that 1.2 million people are out of work in Canada, and 
people are waiting for training, who have not had it because of 
the government's inertia.
<P>
	I therefore move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the debate be now adjourned.</BLOCKQUOTE>
