These winners display tremendous leadership and commitment in the field of health care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An orthopedic surgeon and a leader in his field, Dr. de Beer is dedicated to the research and learning of joint replacement and is also an assistant professor at McMaster University.  One of his initiatives, the event “A Day in Arthroplasty”, encourages patients to learn more about their upcoming surgical procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social worker Diana Tikasz is the coordinator of the Hamilton Health Sciences Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Care Centre.  She works tirelessly to raise awareness of sexual assault and provides necessary and crucial support to those who have been victimized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruce Wilson, a volunteer at Hamilton Health Sciences, has Lou Gehrig's disease.  He is an activist and a counsellor for the physically challenged.  Bruce is determined to find a cure for his disease and is involved with several community fundraisers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate these 2005 Cornerstone Award winners.</p>

What are my thoughts after 4,167 days?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been an extraordinary privilege to serve the people of Elk Island, and now Edmonton—Sherwood Park.  It has been exciting to progress from the Reform Party, to the Canadian Alliance and now to the new exciting Conservative Party of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this corrupt, tired Liberal government is missing the mark with respect to leadership of this wonderful country, I and my party are ready to govern with vision and insight.  We are ready to offer Canadians a responsible, trustworthy government, an end to mismanagement, a new respect-based relationship with our American neighbours, a justice system that does a better job of protecting law-abiding citizens, effective democracy and much more.  I can hardly wait until the electorate gives us the green light at the next election.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Brazeau's unmatched generosity, tireless work, perseverance and tenacity led to the creation of Rimouski's cancer treatment centre and regional hostel unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Brazeau, who himself fought a stalwart battle against cancer, but eventually lost it, never stopped working to improve the quality of life of his fellow citizens. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985, Mr. Brazeau became the president of eastern Quebec's cancer association. He left his position in 2001 and, with André Casgrain, founded the eastern Quebec palliative care association.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social involvement of this great man was eloquently recognized. Indeed, Mr. Brazeau was recently honoured with these prestigious honours, among others: the   Quebec National Assembly Medal; the Order of Canada; the Queen's Jubilee Medal and the Paul-Harris Medal, which is the highest distinction awarded by Rotary clubs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my behalf and on behalf of my constituents and my Bloc Québécois colleagues, I extend our most sincere condolences to Omer Brazeau's family and friends.</p>

To put those benefits in perspective, I offer this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 anglers and hunters spent $1.3 billion on overnight trips.  That is three times the amount of money generated by all performing arts in Canada. Between 1984 and 1999, anglers directly contributed more than $335 million to wildlife habitat conservation efforts. Anglers and hunters support  more Canadian jobs than the Bank of Nova Scotia, our third largest publicly traded company. Each year, anglers spend more than $6.7 billion on their sport.  That is double the GDP of P.E.I., more than all  the restaurant and tavern receipts in Quebec and more than the total retail value of all new vehicles sold in Alberta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anglers represent nearly 20% of our population and are some of the most ardent conservationists we have. I would like to thank them for their efforts to make certain that our children enjoy the outdoors as much as we have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farm improvement loans program was quietly scrapped by the Liberals.  Program loans had a special interest rate and special terms and provided farmers with a real option to regular loans.  Lenders would set up similar loans using the program's low rates and terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With border closures and poor growing conditions, cutting this program hurt small farms and youth wishing to start farming.  Farmers continue to wait for the 2003 and 2004 payments under the CAIS program.  It is still not working, despite the announcements. Slaughtering plants are not being set up in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do the Liberals continue to fiddle while Rome burns?  That is called dithering.</p>

The UPA, Quebec's farmers' union, the CSST, Quebec's occupational health and safety commission, and the occupational health network want to reduce the number of such tragedies. From March 9 to March 16, the UPA held a major awareness campaign among its members, as part of the prevention in agriculture week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past several years, the UPA has been involved in numerous prevention awareness initiatives. This year, the union has offered training sessions on the safe use of tractors to producers, members of their family and employees. The UPA has also launched a contest on prevention initiatives on the farm, to reward the creativity of farm producers in  the area of occupational health and safety. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a farmer and Bloc Québécois member, I wish to thank the UPA for promoting safe behaviour in the workplace. This is a fine illustration of respect for  ourselves, those close to us and the rural community as a whole.</p>

Since they are not mentioned at all in the official communiqué, could the government tell us what exactly it did today to advance and to solve Canada's problems on softwood lumber, on beef and on our other trade interests?</p><A NAME="Int-1182805"></A><a HREF="#Int-1182807"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1182799"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11, the United States has added 1,000 border patrol officers to protect their borders. However, the Liberals are closing nine RCMP detachments that help protect the border between Quebec and the United States.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. opposition House leader in his original statement objected to comments made by the Minister for International Trade on the day following the defeat at second reading of Bill C-31 and Bill C-32.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. opposition House leader alleges that the minister's words suggest that the passage or defeat of legislation was inconsequential to the separation of the departments and, in so doing, showed disregard for the role of the House of Commons.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider the first issue, the status of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 12, 2003, a number of orders in council were made under the authority of several statutes, including the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, the Public Service Employment Act, the Financial Administration Act and the Ministries and Ministers of State Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw the attention of the House, for example, to order in council numbered 2003-2052 designating the Department of International Trade as a department.  Other orders in council in this series address ancillary issues related to that designation, while the existence of the positions of Minister of Foreign Affairs and a Minister of International Trade both existed pursuant to the Salaries Act prior to that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act provides that the government, by order in council, may reorganize existing functions of government for which Parliament has voted funds.  In short, existing statutes grant the government considerable leeway in proceeding with any reorganization it chooses to pursue.  The Canadian custom has been to complete or confirm such rearrangements by way of legislation.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will note that these are some of the very points which were emphasized by the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the government House leader when he spoke to this issue on March 8, saying, in part:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>In reorganizing or organizing a cabinet and making use of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, the government does not create new statutory authorities or powers. Rather, the government rearranges pre-existing authorities that have already been created by Parliament and does so in accordance with a legislative mechanism that has also been created by Parliament. </small></td>

</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear to the Chair that in general the power of the government to reorganize, and specifically this latest reorganization, is not very well understood.  The House will recall that as far back as March 2004 questions related to the reorganization were surfacing in the House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I remind hon. members of the question of privilege raised on March 10, 2004 by the hon. member for St. John's South—Mount Pearl with regard to the form of the main estimates for 2004-05. I refer hon. members to the debates for that day at pages 1310 and 1311.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also refer hon. members to the text, Organizing to Govern, Volume One, by the Hon. Gordon F. Osbaldeston, former Clerk of the Privy Council, who explains at page 24:</p>

<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, too, in the case now before us, whether or not the House is convinced of the case for reorganization, the government nonetheless has at hand the tools to execute those plans; legislative measures like Bill C-31 and C-32 merely complement them.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust  that the background I have just presented will assist the House in better appreciating the current situation.  Here, existing functions, notably international trade, are being reconfigured and those rearrangements have been carried out by orders in council.  I should say that this is what distinguishes the current situation from the one cited by the hon. opposition House leader on which Speaker Fraser ruled in 1989.  In that case, a new tax, the GST, was being proposed by the government of the day, but enacting legislation had not yet been adopted in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opinion of the Chair, the authority to begin the process of separating the departments rests on the series of orders in council adopted December 12, 2003 pursuant to existing statutory authorities granted to the government by Parliament.  That authority is set out in the law and it is not for me to judge whether it is sufficient in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following a search of our precedents, I am unable to find a case where any Speaker has ruled that the government, in the exercise of regulatory power conferred upon it by statute, has been found to have breached the privileges of the House. Indeed, the hon. member is not arguing that.  He seems to be suggesting that the minister's comments amounted to a breach of privilege, but if the minister was stating the legal position, it could hardly constitute a breach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recap then, since I promised the hon. member for Halifax that all would be made clear in this ruling, statutory authority, namely the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, already exists to proceed with the changes that were originally made in December by orders in council pursuant to that act. When the government introduced legislation, specifically Bill C-31 and Bill C-32, since, as explained the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Government House Leader, it was as a complement in keeping with “...Canadian practice...to confirm major changes in government organization through legislation”. We can think of these bills as similar to the miscellaneous statutes amendments bills that come before Parliament from time to time.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a reading of the bills, it appears to me that they enshrine in statute the new names of the departments and ministers and spell out the mandate of international trade, not in the cryptic language of the order in council but in the more Cartesian vocabulary of legislative drafting. Furthermore, Bill C-31 appears to create a new post of associate deputy minister of international trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as the House well knows, on December 7, 2004, Bill C-31, an act to establish the Department of International Trade and to make related amendments to certain acts, and Bill C-32, an act to amend the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, were introduced and read a first time.   These bills were debated at second reading in early February, each coming to a vote on second reading, that is to say a vote on approval in principle of each bill, on February 15. Both bills were defeated at second reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does that leave matters?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedural consequence is clear.  Bill C-31 and Bill C-32 will not proceed further in this session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal consequence is not for me to address.  The Chair is unable to determine what future legislative measures the government may bring forward to complete or confirm the division of the two departments.  That is for the government to determine.</p><A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1515)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my predecessors and I have pointed out in many previous rulings, where legal interpretation is at issue, it is not within the Speaker’s authority to rule or decide points of law.  This principle is explained on pages 219 and 220 of the <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i>: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—while Speakers must take the Constitution and statutes into account when preparing a ruling, numerous Speakers have explained that it is not up to the Speaker to rule on the “constitutionality” or “legality” of measures before the House.</small></td>

</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Chair cannot pronounce on the legality of government action, it is up to the Speaker to examine the situation and to weigh the arguments of the hon. opposition House leader to determine from a purely procedural perspective whether the privileges of the House have been breached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only assume that the minister, in stating his intention to continue with the establishment of the Department of International Trade, is planning to proceed for the moment under existing authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar vein, the Chair has noted and draws the attention of the House to the form of the main estimates for 2005-06.  Those documents present separate budgets for foreign affairs and for international trade, though the formal name  Foreign Affairs and International Trade  is still invoked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there cause for concern, however, that the privileges of the House are breached where the government continues with its departmental reorganization by orders in council after confirmation of these initiatives was not approved by the House?  Am I to find here a prima facie breach of privileges of the House?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that in making the statement outside the House, which gave rise to the point of privilege of the hon. opposition House leader, the minister might only have meant to indicate that the reorganization by orders in council continue to have legal effect.  If that was the intent of the minister's remark and the actions taken are legally valid, which I must assume is the case, it is difficult to find this comment offensive to the dignity of the House and  therefore  a prima facie breach of privileges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say that the comments, if reported accurately, do not concern me.  I can fully appreciate the frustration of the House and the confusion of hon. members, let alone those who follow parliamentary affairs from outside this chamber.  The scrutiny of legislation is arguably the central role of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the House at each stage of a government bill determines whether or not the proposal can go forward.  How can the decisions of the House on these bills be without practical consequence?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appear to have come upon a paradox in Canadian practice.  Bill C-31 and Bill C-32 aimed to confirm executive action, action already taken pursuant to statutes by non-legislative means, and the House of Commons has refused to give that confirmation.  It leaves the government and the House in a most unfortunate conflict on the matter  but, on the information I have, I cannot find that this constitutes a prima facie breach of the privileges of the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of all this, it seems to me that what we have here is an unfortunate incident that has impacted upon the working relationship between the House and the government.  The hon. government House leader has said that the government is reviewing its parliamentary options.  The Chair would encourage the government, during the course of that review, to have further consultations with all parties in the House to clarify events and restore the central working relationship to its usual good form.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason behind this bill is that in 2001 the government passed a bill that imposed interest.

Until last year holy books were simply displayed on tables at the back of the hall, free for new citizens to take. The new citizens were not handed the books.  The books were not forced on them.  The judge produced no evidence to justify his inappropriate decision to ban the availability of holy books.</p>

Dominic LeBlanc: </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank the opposition House leader for his comments. Because I know that members are so enthusiastic to give the bill third reading and passage, perhaps I was ahead of myself.  The opposition House leader is absolutely correct.  We will be addressing the report stage amendments and obviously I will be talking about the very worthy merits of the legislation.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying that I am also delighted  the committee  reported back with the support of members of  the NDP and the official opposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the members know that, currently, parliamentary compensation is  tied to compensation for the judiciary. Last September, the government promised that the changes to parliamentary compensation would reflect the average salary increase of Canadians. Bill C-30  follows up on this commitment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this bill, changes to parliamentary compensation are tied to the annual average wage settlement index, published by Human Resources and Skills Development. This index tracks annual pay increases in the private sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the index includes over 400 collective agreements for over  800,000 employees across Canada.It is published every February documenting the wage changes of the previous calendar year.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This index is widely regarded as an authoritative measure.  It is used by governments, private sector employers and unions, including the Canadian Auto Workers, the Teamsters and the Confédération des syndicats nationaux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the government House leader has said before, linking parliamentary compensation to this index is the right thing to do, for three reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is a fair way to ensure that parliamentarians' salaries are adjusted in line with the changes received by Canadians.  The former House leader for the official opposition said during second reading debate of this bill that “the private sector wage settlement process is a very good one”. He thinks “Canadians can accept that”. We on this side of the House agree with those sentiments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the index is a well-known, respected and predictable measure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, members of this House have recognized that we should not be linked to an index that includes the public sector, because we could be in a situation where the government is negotiating compensation levels for public sector unions or other groups or where Parliament must legislate public sector wages.  If these negotiations or such legislation were to affect our own salaries, then obviously this would appear to create a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this consideration, we are proposing an index for parliamentary consideration and parliamentary compensation that covers salary changes in the private sector alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs reported this bill, it was brought to the government's attention that a number of parliamentary functions were in fact not covered by the Parliament of Canada Act.</p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that the official opposition and the NDP agreed that the deputy House leaders, deputy whips in the House and the Senate and the national caucus chairs receive modest compensation. These positions considerably increase parliamentary responsibilities and should therefore be compensated accordingly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I want to say that, thanks to this bill, the government is keeping its commitment to delink compensation increases for parliamentarians and judges and, instead,  to link them to the average pay increases of Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I believe it is important that decisions on parliamentary compensation take into consideration the opinion of all members of this House. As a result, I am delighted that this bill has received generous support from both the government and opposition members.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1183505"></A><a HREF="#Int-1183516"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1183481"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, first I want to commend my colleague on his remarks in connection with the report stage amendments to Bill C-30. Specifically, I want to ask the parliamentary secretary about this whole issue of linkage and then delinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he correctly said, the official opposition, the Conservative Party of Canada, is supportive of this legislation and indeed supportive of the amendments. I will get to that in my remarks on report stage in a few minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one of the things we have been concerned about all along was the linkage to the Judges Act and the fact that whatever increase  the judges got would automatically be applied to members of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made the strong argument, and indeed, eventually the government made a similar argument, that there should not be that link or tie between an increase to the salaries of members of Parliament and an increase to judges' salaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was this government that linked   MPs' salaries to     judges' salaries in the first place.  Then the government  delinked them.  Now  the government is going to link salaries to this index.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, while we support linking to this index, we do not understand why judges should not be linked to this very same index as well.  Why must they have this special commission, which indeed, if rumour is correct, is recommending an increase of somewhere around 10% or 11% to judges' salaries?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has not brought forward the legislation to deal specifically with an increase or this commission's recommendations that would deal specifically with an increase to judge's salaries. As yet, at least,  we have not seen the legislation that would allow for that increase.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if my colleague would agree   with me that  there is no reason why judges should not be subject to this very same index.  He made all the relevant points in his remarks about the validity of this index and the fact that it is fair because it is a reflection of the average wage settlements in the private sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that members of Parliament in most parties, with the exception of the Bloc Québécois, are willing to go along with that. They feel it is a fair compromise. It  takes our own remuneration situation out of our hands so that we would not constantly be caught in this conflict. Why would we not apply the same logic and the same index to the judges?</p><A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1183516"></A><a HREF="#Int-1183522"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1183505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Dominic LeBlanc: </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank the official opposition House leader for his comments and for his very constructive support, frankly, for this legislation, Bill C-30, with respect to parliamentarians' compensation being linked to the wage settlement index I referred to earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His question with respect to the potential increases for federally appointed judges is a good one.  The government decided to suggest to Parliament legislation delinking us from the Judges Act increases, to some extent because the quadrennial commission established by law to look at the whole issue of judicial compensation decided, of its own motion, to change the basis upon which it evaluated the appropriate remuneration of judges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that previously it had been linked to a number of public sector functions.  The commission chose to look at different factors and therefore came up with a suggestion for judicial remuneration which we thought may have been inappropriate in the case of parliamentarians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the opposition House leader to wait for amendments to the Judges Act to be brought forward by the Minister of Justice to give effect to the quadrennial commission report.  All of his very valid comments will be explained during that debate.  I am sure he will be very comforted by the discussion around amendments that will soon be proposed to the Judges Act as a separate issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like him to explain something to me. Twenty four months ago, he and his colleagues on the government side rose in this House to explain to everyone that it was extremely important, indeed fundamental, that parliamentary compensation be linked to judicial compensation, that this was government policy and the best approach to setting and establishing a salary for parliamentarians. Now, 24 months later, the same members rise again to explain, this time, that this is the wrong approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know  what impact he and his government think they are having on the credibility of parliamentarians across the country by rising 24 months later to take the exact opposite stance.</p><A NAME="Int-1183528"></A><a HREF="#Int-1183538"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1183522"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Dominic LeBlanc: </b>Mr. Speaker, I had an opportunity to partly answer the Bloc leader's question when I answered the question of the House leader for the official opposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, when the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission prepared its report, which was released by the government in the fall, it decided of its own motion to change the method for calculating judicial compensation and determining whether it is appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, it was linked to factors in the public service, such as senior government officials. The commission decided   to look at how much lawyers were paid in major city firms to determine what would be appropriate compensation for federally appointed judges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, and partly because the recommended parliamentary compensation appeared to be slightly higher than what Canadians make on average,    we saw fit to delink our salaries from judicial compensation and link them instead to the compensation of Canadians.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1183538"></A><a HREF="#Int-1183618"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1183528"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and address this amendment to Bill C-30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 12, 2001, a commission chaired by the Hon. Ed Lumley was appointed to study and make recommendations on compensation for members of Parliament. The Lumley commission tabled its report on May 29, 2001, and from that report came Bill C-28 which implemented the proposals in the report. In the report the commission remarked:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Parliamentarians' salaries are important, not just to the members of Parliament themselves but to all citizens; certainly, how we compensate members of Parliament can influence the ability to attract good candidates. Our democracy is based on Parliament's ability to mirror society's basic values and to respond to the needs of Canadians. In turn, Canadians ought to understand that parliamentarians need to be compensated fairly.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commission recommended a number of changes and established stipends for members who take on certain parliamentary responsibilities, such as chairmen of committees and vice-chairs of those same standing committees. This amendment that we are discussing today reflects and is consistent with the recommendations from the Lumley commission's report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before adopting the recommendations from the commission's report, compensation for members who perform certain caucus roles, such as House leader, whip and leader of recognized parties, were already established. However, while there was compensation for the deputy whip of the official opposition, there was no compensation for the deputy House leader for the official opposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for forgetting about the deputy House leader may be due to the fact that it is a fairly new position. Before the second world war there was no House leader, let alone a deputy House leader. At that time the Prime Minister managed the business of the House. The outbreak of the second world war caused the Prime Minister to be absent from the House, so he delegated the responsibility of managing the business of the House to one of his ministers, who did the job in addition to his other responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As government became more complex, the job of government House leader likewise became more involved. That is why today we have a full time minister responsible for managing the affairs of the House, and that is why he has a deputy House leader and a parliamentary secretary to ably assist him. He is shadowed by me, the official opposition House leader, and I too am assisted by a deputy, currently the member for Calgary Southeast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior House leader positions on the opposition benches evolved with compensation, but the deputy positions did not. Unlike the opposition whip and his deputy, which are positions that go back to the early days of the parliamentary system, the deputy House leader is a relatively new caucus officer. This amendment that we are debating today proposes to correct that omission, and to recognize the position and the hard work of the deputy House leader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment also recognizes the reality of the multiparty system that we have today in this chamber. We have the Bloc Québécois with 54 members and the New Democratic Party with 19. As much as some of us would like them to go away, they have not. Maybe some day, but until then they also have whips and House leaders, and their deputies should be recognized as well.  However, if the Bloc Québécois is insistent and in fact opposed to this amendment that we are discussing today, then I feel that it would naturally follow that its deputy House leader, deputy whip and  caucus chairperson will obviously refuse this extra stipend that was revealed in the amendment that is under debate. I would assume that since they are voting against it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a situation where chairmen of standing committees now receive compensation, but the caucus chairmen do not receive any extra compensation and we should be consistent. To be consistent, this amendment applies the salaries of existing positions to the ones covered by the amendment. </p><A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the deputy opposition House leader would get the same compensation as a parliamentary secretary under this amendment.  Deputies for the Bloc Québécois and the New Democratic Party would receive the same compensation as vice-chairs of the standing committees. Caucus chairs for the government and the official opposition would receive the same as the chairs of standing committees of the House, and caucus chairmen of the other two parties would receive the same as vice-chairs of the standing committees. This  is a straightforward and a defensible proposal.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My party will be supporting this amendment and the bill. Why will be supporting this legislation? Throughout my 12 years in the House of Commons, I have always maintained that members of Parliament should not be placed in the natural conflict of interest that arises when we have to debate and vote on our own personal remuneration. I am not aware of anywhere else where this happens.  I have had many jobs in the private sector and in none of those jobs did I have the advantage of setting my own remuneration or my own perks such as my pension benefits.  There is no defensible reason why we would have that here in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I support the government's initiative to tie any future increases in our salary to a cost of living index that would reflect the average increase received in the private sector, in the real world outside of the chamber.  That is a commendable goal of the legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said before, the Bloc Québécois does have a valid point.  There is more than a touch of irony here. This same government made some very impassioned arguments a couple of years ago about why we needed to link our salary increases to something so that we did not have to set them.  We were in agreement with that.  The government chose to link them to increases given to judges.  As the deputy leader and the House leader for the Bloc Québécois have already stated, there is more than a touch of irony here in the fact that the government did this a couple of years ago and is now arguing against it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I support the bill and the amendment, as I said in my question to the parliamentary secretary, I have always maintained that it is incumbent upon the government to defend why two years ago it felt our salary had to be linked to judges and now is being linked to this index in Bill C-30, which is a fairer system and much more defensible.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By extension, I believe that we should watch very carefully when the government brings forward legislation to enact an increase for judges.  If an increase of say 1%, to reflect the cost of living index and the average increase that is reflected in the private sector, is good enough for members of Parliament then it should be good enough for judges.  We will be watching that very closely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take the parliamentary secretary at his word that the government will bring this legislation forward.  My predecessor and I have been calling upon the government to do this.  We hoped it would bring Bill C-30 and the amendments to the Judges Act forward at the same time so that we could have seen both and seen that they were compatible.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has not happened.  The government has not seen fit to bring that forward at this time.  I am looking forward to that when the time comes. I am also looking forward to the debate that will take place hopefully soon on third reading of Bill C-30 when I can once again express the official opposition's support for this legislation.</p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1183618"></A><a HREF="#Int-1183658"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1183538"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague with great interest.  I too greatly support the linking of our salaries to this private sector index.  I congratulate  the government on it because it removes the conflict of interest. Virtually everything we do, it seems to me, affects the economy of Canada and so indirectly, almost everything we do influences this index that we are linking our salaries to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could tell from my colleague's remarks that a good deal of this appears to me, as I was not involved in the discussions, to have come from the official opposition. I know we are dealing with legislation that affects all parties.  It affects the remuneration of the Conservatives, the Bloc and the NDP, so it is not simply for government members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague and I have been here for exactly the same time and I remind him that I actually once voted against a secret ballot for the chairs of standing committees. I did that not because I was opposed to the secret ballot but because I felt the ballot did not protect the official opposition enough or the official opposition vice-chairs of the standing committees.  He will remember that.  We must protect the official opposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he think that this legislation protects the official opposition in situations where, as has occurred in Canada, it is reduced, for example, to one or two members faced with a huge government majority?  Do the provisions here deal with that situation and, with due respect to the other parties, protect the official opposition which is so important to the functioning of the House of Commons?</p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1183658"></A><a HREF="#Int-1183677"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1183618"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jay Hill: </b>Mr. Speaker, if I were a cynic, I would have to say that my hon. colleague is interested in protecting the official opposition because he soon plans to be a member of the official opposition when the Conservatives become the government in the next election.  I am left assuming that is why he is so concerned about the status of the official opposition. It is hard for me to follow his rationale</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am assuming it is a serious question in relation to the fact that it states that the extra stipends will be awarded to positions of recognized parties.  Recognized parties in the chamber, as we all know, are those that elect 12 or more members of Parliament. He brings up a valid point of what happens and did happen of course following the 1993 election.  At that time there were five, not four parties, and two of them were not recognized officially because they elected less than the requisite 12 members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am comfortable with the way this legislation deals with that issue.  It would continue to acknowledge that a recognized party  in Parliament is 12 members or more. I have not heard arguments why we should change that to a lower number, although as my hon. colleague states, the reality is that there have been many instances not only in this chamber but in provincial legislatures where even the official opposition, for example, in my home province of British Columbia, only has two elected members.  It does create problems if that indeed happens.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.  parliamentary leader of the Conservative Party made a suggestion to us earlier that the Bloc Québécois members opposed to a salary raise should refuse it and let the other parties take theirs.  According to him, the Bloc members ought to manage on less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, I would ask the leader of the opposition if he is serious in his proposal.  In the case of any institution, be it a school, a hospital or a parliament,  workers could choose their salaries.  The nurses could decide to work for full salary, half salary, with a premium, without one.  This makes no sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No system in the world could operate that way.  This would open the door to the worst kind of demagoguery.  Someone sufficiently well off could announce that he would work in Parliament for free, and everyone would find that ever so nice.  We would return to the days when representing one's fellow citizens was a privilege of the wealthy.  That makes no sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the hon. leader of the opposition if what he is proposing to the Bloc members, that is to not take advantage of the proposed pay raise, is not something like the strategy used by the Canadian Alliance.  At the time, all its members announced that they would not take advantage of the pension system and yet now they all do.  Not one of them is not in the pension plan, but they let everyone think that it made no sense to take part in it.  I would like to know if that is what he is proposing to us because, if he is, we are not interested. </p>

Clearly, Mr. Speaker, as you are well aware, since you  were the House leader and I was the whip at the time the bill came forward, we were involved in a lot negotiations behind the scenes. On the passage of that legislation, all members of Parliament were forced back into the pension plan. The only choice that was left to us was whether to buy our back service.  The reality is everybody is now in the same pension plan.  That is my answer to question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether I was serious or not that   the members of the Bloc Québécois should consider, since they appear to be opposed to this amendment,  willingly giving up the extra stipend for their deputy House leader, deputy whip and caucus, I will leave that for them to decide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am expressing my disappointment that they would not be in agreement that those positions, whether it is in their party, our party or any of the four parties in the chamber, are deserving of that extra stipend just as the other positions are, as I laid out in my remarks.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say from the outset that the reason our opinion differs from that of the other political parties it that we refuse to engage in any form of hypocrisy regarding the salaries and allowances of members of the House of Commons. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, two years ago, members of the House unanimously decided to link the salaries of parliamentarians with those of justices of the Supreme Court and other courts in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of the citizens paying these salaries and watching us, the basic principle was that the Prime Minister's salary should be equivalent to that of the chief justice of the Supreme Court. I realize that the Prime Minister is not performing very well and that, perhaps, he does not deserve to hold this position, but as  long as he is the Prime Minister, as far as we are concerned, he deserves the salary of the position. In our opinion, the Prime Minister should earn at least the same salary as the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two salaries are paid by taxpayers. Let us stop being hypocritical and admit that from these same taxes the public is paying us. A comparable scale enables the public to evaluate the importance of the work we do.  I think everyone agrees that the job of Prime Minister of Canada is equal to if not greater in importance than that of chief justice of the Supreme Court. Moreover, the latter does not have to get elected and he does not have to justify his decisions. He is appointed for life and he must work in a much more protected environment than the Prime Minister, the ministers or any parliamentarian in this Parliament. This is our first point.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that, today, we find ourselves holding a debate that has already taken place? We are once again talking about the salaries of parliamentarians and an amendment is proposed to allow holders of certain positions to enjoy additional monetary benefits.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My comments and my refusal to support the amendment have nothing to do with the value of the work done by these people. Absolutely not. My comments and our position have to do with the whole bill and the process whereby we are once again talking about the salaries of elected members, because of the Prime Minister's  lack of courage. That is the reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister realized that the committee recommendation on judges salaries granted an 11% salary increase, there was an outcry across Canada. The Prime Minister addressed this matter quickly. We would have expected a statesman to say that 11% is high for a salary increase and that the salary determination process for judges and members of Parliament would be reviewed. He should have said that in today's economy, it made no sense to give an 11% salary increase to all these people, because it is the public who pays. That is what we would have expected a statesman to say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, totally grandstanding, the Prime Minister grabbed the first microphone he could to say that MPs would not be getting an 11% salary increase and that their pay would be delinked from judges' salaries. He acted as though Canadians felt that an 11% increase was too high for MPs, but not for judges. Let us not be hypocrites. For Canadians, an 11% salary increase was too high for judges and for MPs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An examination of the mechanism is called for, not hypocritical behaviour and image polishing. The Liberals wanted to have everyone believe that they were being generous and that they did not want an 11% increase, but  would grant it to the judges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public will start trusting politicians when politicians start having principles. To have principles is to be able to carry an argument through to its conclusion.</p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the outcome of that argument is that the result is out of proportion, the entire process must be reviewed and not just one part or a little bit that serves our purposes and makes us look good. We must look at the entire process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot support the amendment and we cannot support the bill. We are busily undoing what this government had us doing 24 months ago. It is absolutely, incredibly, ridiculous. There is a limit to what the people can accept. The same members of Parliament rose in this House to tell us they had  found the way to finally solve the problem of parliamentary salaries. Today, these same members are rising to tell us the opposite. I have never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the people have confidence in this Liberal government?  It is obvious that a Liberal government says whatever will give it an advantage at the time it is speaking. That is not discourse based on principles; that is discourse based on partisan political interests. That is what we face on the other side. That is why we refuse to act in the miserable film they are proposing. It is not right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for the Conservative Party, to listen to them, it is time to start playing with salaries. We take the salary. We take it not. “I think I do not deserve it, so I will not take my allowance.” “I deserve half my salary, so I will take half.” What kind of society would we have if everyone applied the Conservatives' principles?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In schools, young teachers could say as they were hired, “I come from a well-off family; I will take half the salary to do the job”. Another might say, “I think I am very good; I will take the full salary”, or “I am going to do a good job, but I think being a teacher is not very tiring, so I will take three-quarters of the salary”. This is all nonsense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not seem like a parliament but rather like a day care. Everyone is bringing their own idea and their own opinion to the table,  and the impression is that this is how society is built. We have to build our society on principles. We had established principles for determining parliamentary compensation. These principles have been set aside. The Bloc Québécois said that, since the compensation system was being set aside, parliamentarians would not get an increase. Since this is the case and we want to people to be  happy, let us ask the public what it thinks. No increase for any parliamentarian: this  is the position of the  Bloc Québécois.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the members of this House are responsible enough to properly discuss this issue is when we can talk about linking parliamentary compensation to compensation for senior public servants, the judiciary and whomever else we decide to link our compensation to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe there would be a conflict of interest if we were to tie parliamentary compensation to that of public servants. Would we vote for huge salaries for 300,000 public servants so we could give ourselves a $500 raise? That does not hold water.   It is not fair, and the way the government is proceeding is not right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one way of doing things for the judiciary, another for parliamentarians, which means much lower increases, yet another for senior officials, who get bigger raises than  junior public servants, who in turn get a bigger increase than MPs. It is a total mess. Everything is on a case-by-case basis. Everything depends on partisan interests instead of on principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs, senior public servants, junior public servants, the judiciary and everyone, big or small, should get the same increase. The same principle should apply to everyone. In my mind, this would be the most logical solution and more acceptable to  the public.</p><A NAME="T1630"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1630"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1630)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I recall, during  the debate a couple of years ago, when the government was intent upon linking the salaries of members of Parliament to judges, I  was opposed to that.   I felt that what a judge did,  in or out of a courtroom, had absolutely nothing to do with the job of a member of Parliament.   In fact, there is arguably nothing similar about the two jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore  at that time I felt   there was no defensible argument for linking  the salaries  of   members of Parliament to the salaries of    judges. However I did believe that any linkage at all that removed  from  the House of Commons the ability to set its  own remuneration was a step in the right direction. In other words, it was better than the status quo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Bill C-30 is a step in the right direction. Now we can argue all along that the government should have brought this forward a couple of years ago. It should have done it then to link the members of Parliament to the similar average wage increase index that affects people out in the real world, in the private sector, and the  increase in salary that they have to face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue came to a head last spring when it leaked out that the commission, which  sets the  increase for the judges, appeared to be on the verge of setting a 10% or 11% increase in one year for judges and that same increase would have applied  to members of Parliament. It is not defensible for us to go back to our ridings and say that we deserve a 10% or 11% increase in our salary when our constituents are getting maybe 1% at best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give that framework as a bit of background.   I wonder why it is,  never mind that the government made the mistake of  linking it to judges to begin with, that  we would not all be supportive of linking it to the same salary increase that the real world faces every day.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1183921"></A><a HREF="#Int-1183952"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1183874"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Michel Gauthier: </b>Mr. Speaker, today I really do not agree with the government, but I agree even less with the opposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have just been told that the work done by an MP has nothing to do with that  done by a judge. An MP makes laws and a judge interprets them.  These areas are very closely related.   I will admit that a judge cannot be compared to an MP in that an MP has to be elected.  He has to fight every day and he has to constantly be reviewing his positions in order to please his fellow citizens.  He is in the hot seat at all times to keep his job, and he must rethink what he is doing every day.  That is not the case for a judge. Once appointed, he sits and he brings down the decisions he wants.  Unless he is really outrageous, he will stay there, never bothered by anyone.  Let it be understood, I have the greatest respect for judges,  but once they get in there, there is not much job insecurity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, perhaps the work done by MPs is not like that done by judges.  But now they are trying to tell me that it is more similar to what is done by some guy in a plant.  I have a great deal of respect for people who work in companies with 500 employees, who work for Alcan, for instance, but I have the impression that my work is a bit more similar to that of a judge, who interprets the law, since I make laws, than to the work done by a man who does welding on some big machine or is an electrician in a plant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party is telling us that we must separate ourselves from the judges,  because our work has no connection to what they do.  We should instead link it with what is done in the private sector in Canada. I have a great deal of respect for the work done in factories, but it does not strike me as bearing any resemblance to what we do in Parliament.  Under that line of thinking then, the best link found so far is with the judges.  Anyone finding a better one must tell us what it is, for time is of the essence.  For the moment, I think that it was the best way to go, and still is. </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1635)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1183952"></A><a HREF="#Int-1183962"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1183921"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>Order, please.

We support the work that has gone on between the parties.  The report stage amendment was  based on all party discussions and   we feel it  provides fair remuneration for the caucus, the chairs, the deputy House leaders and the deputy whips.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the  amendment  because we in our party believe that our caucus, chair,   deputy House leader and deputy whip perform some very important functions in terms of our parliamentary duties in  bringing  forward the kind of legislation and issues that need to be addressed in this House. We also recognize the work that the   representatives of all parties do  in this regard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe  this   deals  with the MP issue of compensation. We supported it at second reading and in committee.  We believe that pegging it to the industrial wage index is fair and we support that.</p>

Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to participate in the debate as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very honoured because this department is at the centre of issues about which I feel passionately. It is also at the centre of challenges that our country must meet if we want to continue paving the way to success in this 21st century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. members are aware, the Prime Minister announced the creation of the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development in December 2003 to better position the government, to strengthen Canada's social foundations and to build a true 21st century economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to be the parliamentary secretary of a department whose vision touches on the well-being and fulfilment of every single Canadian.  That vision is a country where individuals have the opportunity to learn and to contribute to Canada's success by participating fully in an open and efficient labour market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department's mission is to improve the standard of living and quality of life of all Canadians by promoting a highly skilled and mobile labour force, and an efficient and inclusive labour market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill that the House is considering today would  give Human Resources and Skills Development Canada the legislative foundation we need to realize this comprehensive vision and mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-23 sets out:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all matters relating to human resources and skills development in Canada over which Parliament has jurisdiction....</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to work in partnership with the provinces and territories, employers and employees, and other key stakeholders.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of this legislation will give the minister and the department and the Minister of Labour and Housing the authorities required to effectively fulfil this mandate.</p><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1640)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear in mind that this legislation does not create any new programs or services. It only reflects changes to the  machinery of the government announced by the Prime Minister in December. The bill also  lays the foundations for a new harmonized code governing the disclosure of personal information. This code will be more efficient and more transparent and will reflect our   commitment to ensure continued protection of personal information.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also enable  us to strike a fair balance between the need to protect Canadians' privacy and the use of such information for the effective administration of programs and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Privacy Commissioner has expressed her solid support for the privacy code in this legislation.  She said, “We think this is a very positive measure. We urge you to adopt it”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take the time to remind the House of the importance and breadth of the mandate of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. There are many reasons why the average Canadian  is more likely to be in contact with the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development  than most other federal departments and those reasons relate to the diverse programs that we offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department is responsible for $20 billion in benefits for Canadians. By providing employment insurance benefits, for example, the department assists Canadians during times of transition, such as job loss or sickness.  EI benefits also enable parents to be at home with a newborn or a newly adopted child or to care for a gravely ill family member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our employment programs, which include employment insurance active measures and the youth employment strategy, help thousands of unemployed Canadians each year to develop skills and fine good sustainable jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workplace skills strategy assists employers across the country through initiatives like the sector councils and labour market information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department's learning programs, including the Canada student loans program and the Canada education saving grants program, help make post-secondary education more accessible to millions of Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to mention particularly the National Literacy Secretariat which funds projects to support literacy across the country, in every community that  is represented here, including my own.</p><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1645"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1645)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under its labour program, the department provides mediation and conciliation services to resolve labour disputes affecting the federal government.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our programs for the homeless include many initiatives to help communities across the country address problems with housing and homelessness.   The Regional Homelessness Fund and the Supporting Communities Partnership Initiative represent two of these initiatives.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I am sure the House will agree, all these programs have a very direct and positive impact on the lives of Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to highlight how the department will be focusing its efforts in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the demographic trends, the rate of growth of our labour force is slowing. Although this phenomenon is not unique to Canada, we lag behind a number of our international competitors in terms of positioning ourselves to enhance productivity. We can no longer rely on the quantity of our labour force to support economic growth. We, like many other industrial economies, must rely more and more on the quality of our labour force to remain competitive and to spur economic growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Human Resources and Skills Development's priority will be the development of Canada's human capital. By human capital, I mean the sum total of all our citizens' skills. Canada's success as a nation and the well-being of us all increasingly depend on how we develop this human capital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be the department's contribution to the government's broad objective of sustaining and enhancing a productive and innovative economy, a vibrant and healthy  society, and an efficient and inclusive labour market. We want to see a nation where all our citizens can readily acquire the skills and knowledge they need to succeed and where everyone adopts and values a culture of lifelong learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For individual Canadians, our focus on human capital will mean increased earnings, sustained employment and enhanced health and social well-being. For employers, human capital will mean a skilled, mobile labour force and increased investment in training and innovative workplaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will build a human capital strategy on three pillars. The first is lifelong learning, which I have mentioned. The second is modernizing our employment programming. The third is a national workplace skills strategy.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing a culture of continuous learning is a prerequisite to ensuring the quality labour force the new economy calls for. At a very early age, Canadians have to have access to skills development opportunities. Moreover, they will have to develop and practice their skills throughout their working lives.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support lifelong learning, Human Resources and Skills Development will continue to improve the Canada student loans program as well as enhance the Canada education savings grant to encourage low income and medium income families to start investing for their children's long term education. We will also be reviewing student debt measures and support for part time students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know we face some major challenges in our learning goals for Canadians. Eight million working age Canadians lack the literacy skills needed to meet the demands of the knowledge based economy. Raising literacy and essential skill levels will be critical to improving the quality of our workforce and contributing to Canada's social prosperity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second pillar of our human capital strategy will see the renewal of the department's employment programs to foster a productive, adaptable and resilient labour force. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will develop an integrated labour market strategy to respond to emerging labour market trends and work with the provinces to update labour market programming to better reflect the realities of work in the 21st century. Part of this involves strengthening employment insurance and making it more responsive to the current labour market realities.</p><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1650"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1650)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the budget included a number of measures to this end, such as a new premium rate setting mechanism to increase transparency and accountability and to provide increased rate stability by setting a ceiling on employment insurance premium rates. This mechanism will ensure that the rates paid by workers will not exceed   the current rates over the next two years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, unemployed Canadians will receive more support through three new pilot projects launched in high unemployment regions.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to allow clients new to the labour market, or returning after an extended absence from it, to access EI benefits after 840 hours of work rather than 910 hours, when linked with EI employment programs, and to calculate EI benefits based on the “best 14 weeks” of earnings over the 52 weeks proceeding a claim of benefits. This will mean that for individuals with sporadic work patterns, EI benefit levels do a better job of reflecting their full time work patterns. Last, it will increase the “working while on claim”   threshold to allow individuals to earn the greater of $75 or 40% of benefits so that they can continue to work without reduction in their benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuation of the pilot project that provides workers in high unemployment regions with five additional weeks of regular benefits is another improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the extension of the EI so-called transitional boundaries in the economic regions of Madawaska-Charlotte, New Brunswick, and the lower St. Lawrence North Shore of Quebec for another year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, EI is only part of the answer since we also need to address the growth of self-employment and the requirements for continuous skills upgrading. As we need to enhance our employment programs in support of labour market participation, this means we will renew our efforts to bring in those at the margins of the labour force, like aboriginal Canadians, new Canadians and older workers.  We want all Canadians to be able to develop and use their full skills and talents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third pillar for developing our human capital is our workplace skills strategy.  We are focusing on the workplace because it is ideal setting for Canadians to gain skills, to re-skill and to up-skill for the new economy.  The workplace skills strategy will encourage skills development and use through collaborative partnerships with business, unions, learning and training institutions, and sector councils.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing the important role workplace learning can have in improving labour market productivity and the quality of Canada's workforce, the recent budget announced significant new investments of $125 million over three years.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it will strengthen apprenticeship systems in Canada. The government will continue working with the provinces and territories and other partners to enhance interprovincial mobility in the skilled trades and support high quality apprenticeships for all Canadians</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it will also support the testing of new skills initiatives that are demand driven and targeted to employed people. A new workplace skills innovation initiative will encourage employers to invest in the skills development of their employees and inform them of government labour market policy and programming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will also foster dialogue on workplace skills issues through the workplace partners panel, comprised of business, labour and training leaders.  The new panel will be a forum for sharing best practices and innovations and increasing industry leadership and commitment in the area of skills development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy will also support workplace innovation through demonstration projects and enhance and refine existing tools to support skills development in the workplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department also will continue to advance the government's foreign credential recognition program. Between 2011 and 2015, we expect that virtually all of Canada's net labour growth will come from immigration.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must find new and better ways of attracting skilled immigrants and helping newcomers integrate into our labour markets so that they can apply the skills and work experience they bring with them.  This is why we are investing $68 million over six years to help find better ways to assess and recognize professional credentials and work experience earned outside of Canada. Through the efforts of a broad range of partners we will develop foreign credential recognition processes that are fair, accessible, transparent and consistent all across the country.  </p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These processes will also be rigorous in order to protect the health and safety of Canadians. For example, we have reached an agreement with the provinces and territories and key medical stakeholders on improved procedures for licensing foreign trained doctors. A similar initiative is underway for foreign trained nurses and consultations will soon begin with other health professions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also supporting the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers on an action plan to integrate international engineering graduates more quickly and efficiently into the Canadian labour market. In addition, we will be working with employers and sector councils to find ways to recognize the skills and prior experience of immigrants seeking work in non-regulated occupations, which make up 85% of the Canadian labour market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goals for human capital development will only be achieved by working closely with our partners, including the provincial and territorial governments, businesses, unions, sector councils, education and training institutions, community organizations and municipalities. We will continue to respect provincial jurisdiction while recognizing that the federal government has an important role to play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation under consideration today also will enable the department to continue its work on other priority issues that matter intensely to Canadians. A key priority issue is the renewal of the aboriginal human resources development strategy and work with communities through the urban aboriginal strategy to find solutions to the issues that aboriginal people face in our cities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department will also work to ensure that official language minority communities have the tools their members need to participate in and contribute fully to Canadian society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the members of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Persons With Disabilities for their work on the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have demonstrated that the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development has a major role to play in helping Canada to address the challenges of the knowledge-based economy and provide an even better future for every person, community and business in the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mandate, authority and necessary tools this legislation provides, the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development will be able to assist individual Canadians to learn and continually develop their skills. This crucial investment will, in turn, enable our citizens to contribute to Canada's economic success and to their own well-being and sense of fulfilment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of the legislation will, therefore, help ensure that Canada continues to be internationally recognized for the quality of life we offer to our citizens and for its vital and innovative economies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons and for the fact that a standing committee of the House and the House endorsed the division of the former HRDC department, I strongly support the legislation.</p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1184313"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184326"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184012"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Barry Devolin (Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I sit with the member for Peterborough on the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Persons With Disabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question has to do with ministerial accountability. This is an issue I have raised before. As we all know, before HRDC was split into two ministries, there was a significant scandal in that ministry regarding the minister's inability to keep track of what was going on. The defence at that time was that the ministry was simply too large and it was impossible for one person to know everything that was happening there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the ministry has been split, we have two separate ministries that are linked in many ways. They are not separate but connected in some ways. It raises an issue of ministerial accountability. Our system is based on the principle of ministerial accountability. Everything that happens in government, a minister is responsible for that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear comments from the parliamentary secretary. Would he agree that when we have programs under one minister but services being delivered by staff from another ministry, as will be the case between social development and human resources skills development, there may be gaps in the principal ministerial accountability?</p><A NAME="Int-1184326"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184361"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184313"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Peter Adams: </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank the member and his colleagues for their work on the committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this is a  very serious question because ministerial responsibility is something on which our system depends.  In this case I would beg to differ.   I supported the division of the former department, not simply because it was too large but because it was too diverse and there were too many cultures in it. That in itself created complexities and problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bit like dividing Siamese twins, not that I have done it.  It is a very intricate process to take two departments which have been linked for generations and then divide them.  As my colleague put it, how does one maintain this ministerial responsibility?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest a number of things to him. I think the division is appropriate and I suspect he does too.  It is the right thing to do.  There are formal overlaps in this legislation between the two departments, but they are not unique. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example, in my speech I mentioned aboriginal affairs and education, and we have a Department of Indian and Northern Affairs.  In a very real sense, our aboriginal division, although it is responsible to the minister of HRSD, is in fact delivering programs which are sort of developed in conjunction with another department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, there are two formal overlaps at the moment.  Call centres will be responsible for the new Department of Social Development and delivery on the ground is the responsibility of HRSD.  I think decisions of ministerial responsibility will be made on the grounds of the programs which are being delivered, not in immediate response to them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that is a useful response.</p><A NAME="Int-1184361"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184373"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184326"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter Van Loan (York—Simcoe, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the address by my colleague, the hon. member for Peterborough.  He listed an enormous number of things that the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development of Canada  presumably will be able to undertake, if this legislation is passed.  That is what we kept hearing.   I guess, if that is true, it speaks to how many wonderful things the department has not been doing so far.  I say that somewhat tongue in cheek because  the department has been doing most of those things thus far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already seen the division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade under Bill C-31 and Bill C-32, similar to what we have with the legislation in front of us, which the government undertook a year and a half ago, and it was of absolutely no consequence whatsoever with the government. When it was finally implemented by the counterpart legislation for foreign affairs, it was defeated, yet the government forged ahead with the division in any event.  It did not make any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we not wasting our time today debating this, since it seems to have little consequence to what the government actually does?</p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1184373"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184404"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184361"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Peter Adams: </b>Mr. Speaker, I am faced with very well-informed people today because they are members of the committee.  I thank my colleague for his work on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say first off that a big difference between the two legislations, and I know less naturally about the other legislation, is that this legislation has its roots in a unanimous report of a standing committee fully supported in the House of Commons. There was an inquiry into the previous department, as was mentioned by my predecessor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking at something which the House can be proud of because the House of Commons said that one of the recommendations of the committee report, which was accepted by the House, was that the old department should be divided. This is a serious matter from that point of view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of public policy, which goes back to the previous question, it is almost inevitable in our society that government departments operate on a silo basis.  They work within themselves and have a mandate.  One of the difficulties is reaching out between them. In this case, we have two more effective silos, but we also have useful links between them which help us with the problems which silos create.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a product of the House of Commons, not a government initiative.  It has been carried out in an effective way.  For this one department, it is my great hope, if one reads the mission statement of HRSD, that this will department become not the delivery mechanism but the point of contact for everything to do with lifelong learning in the federal system. That alone is something needed in Ottawa.</p><A NAME="Int-1184404"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184373"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary very astutely pointed out that the government was listening quite attentively and implementing a  unanimous recommendation made by a committee of the House of Commons, albeit in a previous Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this not an example of how well our Prime Minister has listened to the advice given by a committee of the House of Commons?  It appears to me, very objectively, to be precisely the case.</p><A NAME="Int-1184420"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184437"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184404"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Peter Adams: </b>Mr. Speaker, I tried to make that point.  As it happened, I was chair of the standing committee concerned and was very involved with it.  Although this is a minority Parliament we are used to consultation and discussion to a certain point, in those days that was not common.  There was a great deal of consultation in committee and it was agreed that a revision of some sort was one of the solutions to the problems at which the committee was looking.  The House of Commons agreed to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree that this was a large example of individual members of the House of Commons having an influence all the way through to massive changes in a structure which involved $60 billion in the previous department.</p>

I think that my hon. colleague is seriously mistaken when he says that the other opposition parties also agree to divide the department into two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to remind my colleague that the work done previously was conducted within a framework totally different from the one to which this bill refers. The bill  makes reference to concepts with which the Bloc Québécois completely disagrees, in particular the Employment Insurance Commission and infringements in areas of jurisdiction relating to on-the-job training and so forth. I have already talked about this, as has my colleague for Québec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what the member opposite said, we disagree for very specific reasons. This bill ignores  the consensus reached during the previous session of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will vote against the bill for many reasons. The first of which, as I mentioned, is that it infringes in areas under provincial jurisdiction. For Quebec, this is serious, particularly with regard to labour management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is the EI fund also. The Prime Minister used the proposed division of the former  Department of Human Resources Development into two departments to establish the Department of Social Development and maintain the EI fund in its present form, in spite of the opposition from all  stakeholders in the Canadian society, and the Quebec society in particular. I will come back to that. This does not reflect the consensuses at all. In this regard, the Prime Minister is on the wrong track, as I will show.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister split the department the very day he was sworn in. He did so in a hurry,because of the recent election. It was obvious that the matter had been thought over for quite some time. I will come back later to the intention behind this decision, because it is clearly different from the one set out by our distinguished colleague from Peterborough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill adds to existing bureaucracy. It does not introduce anything new or additional in terms of the services to be delivered through this Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, which will be duplicated, naturally, with the Department of Social Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One objective pursued by the government with this   Department of Human Resources and Skills Development is to mobilize the private sector, non-governmental organizations and communities on community development, the social economy and social development. There are also plans for an adequate income security system for seniors, persons with disabilities, families and children and  for integrated policy development and program delivery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adds nothing to the services currently provided. It only adds a second head,   grafted on to the existing body, namely the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, and chops off arms. Nothing is added to the existing structure, but the  unstated purpose is the one in the latest budget.</p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House that because this is about splitting a department in two, we cannot limit our discussion to Bill C-23, which concerns the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development. We must also, logically, discuss Bill C-22, which proposes the creation of the Department of Social Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the House that there are currently 14,000 public servants in this department, which has a budget of $20 billion. The Department of Social Development will absorb 12,000 of these public servants, and have a budget of $53 billion. Up to that point, all is well. The same employees will be assigned to the same places, but spread out in service points across the country. These service points will include management of 105 employment insurance processing centres and 11 income security programs processing centres .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the Department of Social Development will use exactly the same channels to provide exactly the same services as before. What has changed, then? A minister has been added to a institution providing services under the social safety net, namely employment insurance, income security for the aged, job-related training, for a category of sectors, and more than I can mention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on and look closer at what they want to do with that. The answer is found in the budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stakeholders in our society are crying out for the creation of an independent employment insurance fund, with improvements. That fund would be managed by the two groups that contribute to it, namely employees and employers. We want contributions to cover employment insurance program requirement, on the order of $12 billion to $15 billion annually. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surpluses accumulated in the employment insurance fund over the past eight years total close to $47 billion. What happened to these surpluses? They were used for other purposes. How were they generated? They were generated with the employment insurance benefits that were not paid to individuals who were entitled to these benefits and who had paid for them.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A claim is being made in this regard. I will get back to it later on, in the context of the bill and the standing committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My distinguished colleague often makes reference to the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities. On February 15, the committee tabled in this House a unanimous report recommending the establishment of an employment insurance fund administered by those who contribute to it, namely employers and employees. This committee, to which my distinguished colleague is referring, unanimously asked the government to put back in the employment insurance fund the $46 billion or $47 billion that have been diverted over the past several years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is this measure not provided in the budget or in this bill,  the contrary that is confirmed. This bill provides for an employment insurance commission consisting of four commissioners. Just think: there will be one representative for employers, one for the some 18 or 19 million workers across the country who contribute to employment insurance, and two government representatives. This does not change anything in  the current situation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say the government will continue to divert the funds intended for employment insurance.</p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two stances. First we are told in this House that the issue of EI is a priority and the government will take care of it. Timid measures were presented suggesting that the best was yet to come. Nothing specific happens. When we look at the bill before us we realize they want to keep something that is unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move along. I come now to the budget. That is why I say we need to know exactly what this government is trying to achieve. Not only does it not want to put back into the EI fund what it took out, and not only does it not want to improve EI benefits, even though it has the means to do so, but it is giving the expenditure review committee the mandate to use various cuts to save $2 billion or $3 billion in the EI program. Where will this money be taken? It will be taken from the EI contributions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the government is doing indirectly what the House will not allow it to do directly. Before the holidays, this House voted on a resolution as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From now on, the employment insurance fund is to be used only for employment insurance purposes and the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, is given the mandate to recommend to the  House the measures to take to ensure that this fund is indeed used only for employment insurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of complying with the wishes of the House, the government is in the process of doing indirectly what the House told it not to do directly. This is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where will this money be taken from? They say it will come from programs or structures. They say contributions might be reduced. Yet, that is not what those who are contributing to EI are saying. Maintain the contributions at the current rate and improve the program. What is happening now is totally unacceptable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the unstated intention of this bill, to truly understand its meaning, we have to look at other documents. I have here a highly important document in which most of the recommendations were made unanimously. It is quite recent and concerns current factual data bases, not different data form the last Parliament. It is the report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first eight recommendations are unanimous.  They recommend an independent fund so the government will no longer be able to dip into it for other purposes.  It will be administered by the contributors and used to improve the benefits of those who pay into it.  This has to mean something more solid than what the parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for Peterborough, is referring to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent weeks in this House, we have also heard the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development delighting in the measures she had presented here relating to Employment Insurance.  The Quebec lieutenant, the transport minister, added that any reasonable unemployed person would find the budget and the government's position excellent.  They were about the only two to say so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with this, the minister referred to a New Brunswick worker who claimed to be delighted with it.  If anyone wants to consult them, I have some letters here that are addressed to the minister.</p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They come from the Canadian Labour Congress. The president sent me a copy, along with a letter.  The CLC represents 3 million workers.  The Quebec component alone represents over 1 million.  Many are going short everywhere in the country, in Quebec in particular: the jobless,  youth centres, women's shelters, municipalities.  Just about every group of society is represented among those millions of workers and people working with those who are suffering because of the government's inadequate, restrictive and inhumane measures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unacceptable, and at the same time ironic.  It is a clear illustration of what goes on in this place and the mess things are in.  As we have seen, while the government has the ability to make people poor, it is, in a muddled sort of manner, proposing  measures to the members of this House that will make them rich. </p><A NAME="Int-1184665"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184666"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184448"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Don Boudria: </b>Our benefits have been reduced. </p><A NAME="Int-1184666"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184586"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184665"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yves Lessard: </b>Yes, benefits can be reduced. As for the hon. member's benefits, perhaps he should explain that to the unemployed. His colleagues are not even able to meet the unemployed. Their Quebec lieutenant is incapable of meeting with the unemployed; he refuses to meet with them. Here, they say that the unemployed are happy. If they were happy, they would go to talk with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Acadie—Bathurst, in the editorial in <i>L'Acadie nouvelle</i>, are giving the minister a rough ride over her position. In almost all municipalities where there are seasonal workers, editorials are saying that it is unacceptable and lacking in common sense. One journalist even suggested that we find a way to spend half an hour with the minister to try to get her to listen to reason. That is what is in  the newspapers. The minister has not talked about that.   She has said that everyone was happy with it. The Minister of Transport, the Quebec lieutenant, and the minister are not representative of what people are going through in rural ridings, especially with respect to seasonal employment in businesses, whether it is textiles, shoes, softwood lumber and our forest workers, seniors or the POWA.  Recommendation 13 in the committee  report, which I have here,  was passed unanimously.  There is nothing here,  except insensitivity to these situations. It is inconceivable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could say there is no money. That is not true. Not only is there money, but that  money belongs to the contributors. As a result, people are in need. Families have been impoverished this way, and here  the government struts about, concerned about our  salary increase and so on, when there are people in need who have paid their contributions. Really!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be embarrassed. I think they lack courage. Here, all is well. Passing measures like this that impoverish people, and then refusing—</p>

It has also happened in Saskatchewan and British Columbia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province of Manitoba informed all marriage commissioners that they had to perform same sex marriages and that if they refused, they would have their licences revoked. Right off the bat, 11 marriage commissioners resigned. Two more refused to quit and have taken this matter before the Manitoba Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is quite simple. We have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada, yet the government has not stood  up for these individuals' rights. The freedom of religion and the freedom of conscience of these individuals are being trampled upon by the Government of Manitoba and also by the Government of Saskatchewan and the Government of British Columbia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make sure that the federal government will stand up for the rights of individuals. We cherish our charter  in this country. We believe strongly in the freedoms that we enjoy as individuals. Yet the federal government has not come to the aid of those individuals. It should be standing side by side with them, defending their rights to  freedom of religion,  freedom of expression and  freedom of conscience and making sure that their voices are heard by the Manitoba Human Rights Commission. The government should tell the province of Manitoba and the other provinces that are doing this to take a solid step back and allow individual freedoms to reign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the  two people who are fighting this in Manitoba, one is a constituent of mine, Kevin Kisilowsky. He  got his marriage commissioner licence from the province of Manitoba because  he wished to  sanction  marriages outside of a church. He is a Christian who  has an outreach ministry for outlaw biker gangs and a  youth ministry. He is  trying to reach out. These people do not belong to a church. He is not affiliated with any particular religious organization. In order to  legally marry people who decide to become Christians through his ministry he needs  to have a licence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already informed the Government of Manitoba when he applied for his licence that he only wished to marry Christian couples through his outreach ministry. He was told to go ahead with his application and that he would be put on a private list. Unfortunately, Kevin is now in a situation where he refuses to perform same sex marriages so his entire licence is being revoked.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially I want the government to explain why it has not supported Kevin and all the other commissioners in Manitoba. I want the government  to make sure that they can still perform traditional marriages. This  does not prevent the province of Manitoba from hiring other marriage commissioners to perform same sex marriages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us defend the rights of individuals who were born and raised in Canada and  also those individuals  who came to Canada because we have such a great charter. Let us not trample on those rights. I want the government to explain why it has not supported the individuals' rights and freedoms of religion and conscience.</p><A NAME="T1850"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1850"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1855"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1850)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1184891"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184897"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184879"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Paul Harold Macklin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, the member first asked this question on December 3 last year, just as the government was anticipating the release of the decision from the Supreme Court of Canada on the marriage reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the House that the government takes the issue of religious freedom very seriously. Indeed, as the House will recall, the Government of Canada was very concerned that the granting of equality to same sex couples should not come at the expense of other charter protected guaranteed rights and freedoms, such as the freedom of religion. It was for that reason that the government chose to refer its proposed legislation to the Supreme Court of Canada before tabling it in Parliament, so that our opinion that the bill would not affect religious freedom could be confirmed by the highest court in the land. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court released its decision on December 9 of last year and confirmed that the charter already protects the religious freedom of all Canadians. In its ruling, the Supreme Court made some of the strongest statements ever on the nature and importance of religious freedom in Canada. Specifically, the court clearly ruled that: religious officials are protected by the charter from being compelled to perform any religious or civil marriage that would be contrary to their religious beliefs;  and religious institutions are protected from being forced to provide their sacred spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court was categorical:  the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms already protects the freedom of religion. The charter protects churches and synagogues, mosques and temples from being obliged to perform marriages contrary to their beliefs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This protection is clearly echoed in the draft bill to extend civil marriage to same sex couples. Indeed, the crystal clear assurances of religious freedom are one of the major reasons that I personally support Bill C-38.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I am concerned that some may be seeking to unduly alarm Canadians by confusing the question of civil commissioners with that of religious officials performing marriages. The two issues are qualitatively different. Religious officials are protected by the charter from doing anything that would be against their religious beliefs. Civil marriage officials are provincial or territorial employees or appointees hired to perform a service that the provinces and territories are required under the law to provide to all without discrimination. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As provincial employees, civil marriage officials are not within federal jurisdiction but would fall within provincial or territorial jurisdiction. As I understand that there is currently a case on this issue before the provincial human rights body, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on that specific situation in Manitoba.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general terms, however, if any additional specific protections for religious freedom are desired in the terms of civic marriage officials, commercial provision of services, hall rentals, et cetera, they must be made by the provinces and territories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even here, at a recent FPT meeting, the attorneys general of two of the most populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec, both said that they had experienced no problems with religious freedom despite thousands of same sex marriage ceremonies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many provinces and territories already have amended their laws to add specific protections for religious freedom. In a recent FPT meeting, the Minister of Justice encouraged the provinces and territories to ensure, as the federal government is doing, religious freedom is protected in all their laws.</p><A NAME="T1855"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1855"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1855)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1184897"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184899"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184891"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Bezan: </b>Madam Speaker, I find the parliamentary secretary's comments   quite amazing. First, he makes  a statement that religious freedoms are very important to Canada and yet  refuses to engage in a situation that we have happening in the provinces. Yes, these are provincial civil matters  but these are people who have their rights guaranteed to them under the charter, which is a federal responsibility. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is up to the federal government to stand up for these people and to ensure they have the opportunity to express their freedom of religion or freedom of conscience.  Not everyone has a particular religion but they do have strong   personal beliefs and   do not agree with the approach being taken by the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore  I ask the government one more time  to actually take a stand and stand up for individual rights and freedoms. It has the responsibility to oversee what the provinces are doing and to ensure   t they are enforcing what we have as a charter.</p><A NAME="Int-1184899"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184903"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184897"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Paul Harold Macklin: </b>Madam Speaker, it is quite clear that different provinces and territories  are entitled to and will take different positions on this issue, as they do with many others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that the government has no intention of intruding into matters of provincial jurisdiction.  Frankly, I am quite shocked to hear the member opposite suggest that we should be forcing a sister government to do anything that is within its exclusive power to decide for itself even where we may respectfully disagree with its approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, I am concerned that the specific cases, such as civil marriage officials, are being taken out of context and used to alarm religious groups into believing that Bill C-38 should not proceed because the government cannot assure religious freedom.  That is simply not the case.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court has clearly supported the position of the government that the charter continues to protect freedom of religious officials and groups who oppose same sex marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil marriage officials already have the potential for conflicts with their religious beliefs.  For example, in situations where the marriage involves a divorced person, first cousins or interfaith couples, each of which is forbidden by some religious beliefs, in these situations a solution has been found before. I am confident that our provincial and territorial colleagues will find one now.</p>

My question was to the Prime Minister and had specifically to do with the opening of the American border to Canadian and particularly Saskatchewan beef. I asked him what he had to say to all of the farmers and ranchers across Canada who are facing another winter of despair about what was going to happen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer was that at the USDA, the United States Department of Agriculture, and in the White House steps were being taken to have the border open on March 7. In fact, in a news release our agriculture minister announced that Canada received a commitment from the United States to open the border and resume trade of Canadian live cattle under 30 months on March 7, 2005. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the process involved was an administrative one by the United States Department of Agriculture. They had hearings and so on and came to the conclusion that in their opinion, administratively, and according to their legislation, the border ought to be open to Canadian cattle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter was that during these hearings, Canada had an opportunity to make representations. I have heard the members opposite indicate that based on science, based on facts, based on data, there was no question that the transfer of Canadian cattle through the American border was safe, that our food chain was safe,  that our inspection agencies were properly codified, and that they were using the proper protocol and there was nothing to be concerned about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When R-CALF made an application for an injunction to the Montana court, the court in that particular case held that the injunction would issue. One of the reasons it held that the injunction should issue was that it said the USDA “failed to provide the specific basis for the conclusion that its actions carried an acceptable risk to public health and failed to provide the data on which each of the agency's critical assumptions were based”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that judge was saying was that the USDA did not provide the basis and data for its decision. My question is, where were the Canadian government and its people in ensuring that the USDA had all of the facts and all the basis to show that the sound science was there for the border to open. Why was that material not there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when the matter was before the Montana judge, our government should have had lawyers present at that court case arguing Canada's position. They applied late, I understand, trying to file a brief, and perhaps they filed a brief, but they were not there to advance the case. Consequently Canada was not represented at a very critical time when we had millions of dollars in trade being affected. Canada was using the political angle when it should have been using legal process and material. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the courts have become involved, they are still playing politics. Our Prime Minister is in the United States today talking to the President, but we have no basis upon which to speed up the process. We have a Montana court decision that has been appealed. We have some indication that it will take until July 7 for a decision to be made. There is a trial and the process is taking months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the government? Is it taking the steps to ensure that this process is expedited? It is not a political matter now.  It is a court matter. But political pressure can be applied to ensure that the process happens in weeks, not months and years. We see that happen in American politics. Let us look at the recent case relating to Terri Schiavo in which two courts, three judges of one panel and 12 judges of another panel, heard a case in the same day. If there were the political will it could be done, but Canada has wasted a lot of its political capital.</p><A NAME="Int-1184911"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184929"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184904"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food (Rural Development), Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, I thank the member for Souris--Moose Mountain for his question because I know that he is deeply concerned about this issue as we are.  Certainly, all of us in the House were disappointed on the decision that was made relative to the March 7 border opening because based on science that border should have been opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to put the issue into perspective. First, the hon. member  said that the USDA failed to provide the specific basis and why Canada was not there. The fact of the matter is that the Canadian government did ask to present an amicus brief which would have outlined the scientific details of what we are doing relative to BSE in this country. If the judge would have heard that, then he could have made a decision on the facts, but the judge refused to allow Canada to present that amicus brief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important that I outline a few other specific points. First, the Government of Canada's approach has achieved some very considerable results, but not all that we wanted.  We would have preferred the border to be opened totally on March 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that the interventions with President Bush and other American officials made by the Prime Minister, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and others have resulted in the border being reopened for boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age in August 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the first time that ever happened to a country that had BSE. In fact, our exports of beef products, not cattle, to the United States are over 300,000 tonnes and that is at levels above in terms of the beef side prior to the BSE issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Bush, as the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has said in the House a number of times, and Secretary Johanns have repeatedly expressed their commitment to further opening the border as soon as possible based on science. It is disappointing that a U.S. district court judge in Montana has managed to keep the border closed by taking the presentation made by R-CALF and preventing us from getting products in based on science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe there were compelling reasons for the court to allow us to participate in an amicus brief in order to shed light on a number of factual issues raised in the litigation, but we were refused from doing so. However, we are pleased to note that the USDA is now appealing the March 2 preliminary injunction.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada intends to seek permission to file an amicus brief with the appellate court that would allow us to set out the facts about Canada's system for protecting human and animal health and food safety. We believe, if given that opportunity to raise the facts with the court, that the judge, if he is fair at all in terms of addressing the issue, would in fact allow the U.S. law to proceed. This would allow Canadian beef under 30 months into the United States and we would work on the other issues following that date.</p><A NAME="T1905"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1905"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1910"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1905)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1184929"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184935"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184911"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ed Komarnicki: </b>Madam Speaker, I note that the United States appeal court said that the judge set July as the hearing date. We are now in March. That is a long period of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister today stated:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>We look forward to the day in the future when, notwithstanding all of the lobbying, all of the legal challenges, all of North America is open to our safe and high-quality beef</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must do more than hope. Given the fact that the government was not on its toes and not making the representations it should of made, I think there is some obligation on the government now because of its lack of due diligence to put some money on the table for the BSE farmers who are suffering. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the parliamentary secretary, who knows agriculture quite well, also knows that the problem is deeper than that. Saskatchewan farmers and Canadian farmers need some financial assistance.  They need it now before spring seeding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the parliamentary secretary commit the government and tell us what the government's actions are with respect to those two things: funding for the BSE cattle producers who are dealing with that issue and the ordinary grain farmers who are waiting for some answers from the government?</p><A NAME="Int-1184935"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184939"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1184929"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Wayne Easter: </b>Madam Speaker, I think the member knows that both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food were in western Canada last week and talking to producers about the very concerns that the member has raised. The Prime Minister has made it clear as well as the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food that we will stand with producers in their time of need. Those issues have certainly been looked at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us look at a couple of facts specifically on BSE.  There has been a BSE repositioning in the livestock industry in  September 2004 in the amount of $488 million from the federal government; $995 million in March 2004 for the transitional industry support program; and in June 2003, there was $475 million for the cull animal program.  Two weeks ago on March 10 the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food announced an additional $50 million to help aggressively market beef products around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we are standing with the producers and we will continue to do so to support them in their time of need.</p><A NAME="T1910"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1910"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1905"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1910)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1184939"></A><a HREF="#Int-1184935"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Hon.
