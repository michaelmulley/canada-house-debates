	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent):</B> Mr. Speaker, job 
creation, economic growth and environmental improvement are 
the challenges that face the government.
<P>
	The development of an ethanol industry in Canada will help 
us tackle these challenges. The proposed ethanol plant in 
Chatham, Ontario, will create 1,100 construction jobs, employ 
90 people permanently, generate another 400 indirect jobs, 
contribute $125 million annually to our economy, provide a 
market for Ontario corn, and manufacture a renewable fuel 
which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
<P>
	I urge our government today to commit to this development. 
This industry is important for our future.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, on April 24, 
Armenians will commemorate the 79th anniversary of the 
Armenian genocide in which 1.5 million people lost their lives. 
This is a people that, despite its ordeals, has always shown its 
determination to survive. Tragedy struck again in 1988, when 
nearly 25,000 Armenians died in an earthquake.
<P>
	I wish to salute the Armenian community in North Montreal 
which is working to provide humanitarian support in Armenia.
<P>
	The Quebec National Assembly recognized the Armenian 
genocide in 1980, but the Government of Canada has yet to do 
so. I therefore wish to ask the Canadian government to recognize 
the historic truth of this tragedy.
<P>
	We wish to extend our sympathy to our fellow citizens of 
Armenian origin and wish them every hope for a better future.

over this past weekend in Oberstdorf, Germany, Rick Folk of 
Kelowna, British Columbia, led his rink to a second World 
Curling Championship.
<P>
	There is also a decidedly human side to the story. Just days 
before Rick and his teammates left for Germany, Rick's father 
passed away. After his victory Rick told reporters:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Definitely I was thinking of my dad. When I finished throwing my last shot, 
and I knew I had it, that was the first thing that went through my mind. I wondered 
where he was watching. I promised I would do my best and for my dad my best is 
always the best.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canadians appreciate Rick's victory all the more because he 
was able to demonstrate that quality of triumph through 
adversity that all Canadians find so inspiring.
<P>
	I invite all members of this House to extend congratulations to 
our new men's world curling champion, Rick Folk, his team and

	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Timiskaming-French River is a rural, northern 
Ontario riding, and our way of life differs greatly from that of 
urban centres. Solutions that work in Toronto will not 
necessarily work in the north. The majority of gun owners in my 
riding are law abiding and safe users of firearms for hunting and 
sport. It is part of our way of life.
<P>
	In the interests of public security it is important to maintain a 
certain level of gun control in Canada. However, since 70 per 
cent of all criminal acts involving guns are committed with 
smuggled, illegal firearms, we need to have and enforce stricter 
laws and penalties for criminal users of firearms. We do not need 
more complicated regulations for law-abiding citizens.

Valley North on his initiative in organizing the first citizenship 
day for members of Parliament and senators to publicly reaffirm 
their allegiance to Canada.
<P>
	Yesterday the hon. member for Don Valley North brought us 
together in the Hall of Honour because of his appreciation as an 
immigrant to hold Canadian citizenship and because of his love 
and commitment to this great country.
<P>
	It was a moving experience and for many of us it was the first 
time we experienced the joy of enunciating the words aloud, 
declaring our allegiance for Canada. At a time when many 
nations are being torn apart by civil insurrection and war, it is 
imperative that we Canadians show the world through our 
leadership and policy how people with many diversities live in 
harmony as one nation.
<P>
	Let this ceremony be the beginning for all members in the 
House to publicly serve and pledge allegiance to one great 
country, one Canada, our beloved country.

pleased to inform the House that the Canadian Association of 
Health Care Auxiliaries has declared this week of April 17 to 
April 25 Canada Health Auxiliary Week.
<P>
	This year's theme is the challenge of choices. Health care 
auxiliaries across the country will be celebrating this week with 
the goal of increasing public awareness of the tremendous 
contribution made by volunteers to the health care system in 
Canada.
<P>
	Last year health auxiliaries across Canada worked to raise in 
excess of $33 million for their respective health care facilities. 
One hundred and thirteen thousand volunteers gave 8.5 million 
hours to patient services, community health care, public 
relations and fund raising.
<P>
	I am sure all members will join with me in congratulating the 
Canadian Association of Health Care Auxiliaries on its work 
and in urging Canadians to support their local auxiliaries.

there will soon be an general election in Quebec, and the 
federalist troops, terrified at the prospect of being swept from 
the Quebec political scene,  are using underhanded tactics to 
convince Quebecers that their option is the right one.
<P>

<P>
	Premier Daniel Johnson, with the hounds of sovereignty 
nipping at his heels, went before foreign investors with a 
message of gloom and doom, predicting political instability in 
Quebec if the Parti Quebecois came to power.
<P>
	These desperate and highly irresponsible tactics are unworthy 
of someone who is supposed to defend Quebec's best interests, 
especially when he is in another country. Now that die-hard 
federalists can no longer scare Quebecers, they are trying to 
scare foreign investors.

and John Bremmer of the town of Oliver in my riding recently 
returned from the Slovak republic where they worked with 
CESO on a development project, helping a producer of 
agricultural products with their expertise. Perhaps more than 
money their volunteer efforts will help those people stand 
proudly on their feet as their country emerges from the dark ages 
of communism.
<P>
	Volunteers have made a personal choice to make all our 
communities better places to live, whether it be through working 
with a service club, organizing a community event, helping the 
disadvantaged or leading a youth group.

<P>
	The Government of Canada is a very committed partner in this 
initiative which is another fine example of what can be achieved 
on an important social issue through co-operation between the 
public and private sectors.

broadcast these announcements.

	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today marks the day that the United States of America adopts the 
Ryan White bill, a bill that was endorsed by President Bush but 
is being enacted by President Clinton. It is a law that mandates 
hospitals to notify emergency response personnel about the 
infectious status of a patient who was treated by the emergency 
worker.
<P>
	This law prohibits involuntary testing of patients and only 
requires the hospital to share any such information in its 
possession. The program is also structured in a way that protects 
the confidentiality of patients.
<P>
	I would encourage all members of the House to co-operate in 
establishing such legislation in Canada.

like to call the attention of the hon. members of this House to a 
recent initiative from our government to promote the economic 
development of Quebec.
<P>
	On April 14, we announced, in conjunction with the 
Government of Quebec, a first set of projects to be implemented 
under the Canada-Quebec agreement on infrastructure projects. 
This program is being initiated a mere two months after the 
agreement was signed. This is palpable proof that we do meet 
the demands of the Canadian people. It also demonstrates 
clearly that we are intent on putting Canada back to work as soon 
as possible.
<P>
	This first stage will see nearly $35 million invested in 50 
projects involving 43 municipalities in Quebec. These projects 
will result in the creation of 400 direct jobs over the weeks to 
come because, as you know, this government was elected last 
fall to put Canadians back to work, and this program is being put 
into place to do just that.

Premier's pre-election visit to the United States.

concerned, whatever the outcome of the decision, they respect 
the right of Quebecers' to self-determination.

	Now, Mr. Speaker, here at last is a level-headed statement 
reflecting profound respect for democratic values. 
Unfortunately, you are more likely to hear that kind of remark 
abroad than within this chamber.
<P>
	The universal standard for democracy is respect for other 
people, respect for the decisions made by the people.

represented in this House to follow the example of Senator 
Kennedy and show the same open-mindedness, the same

<P>
	The message that I received from the people attending these 
two meetings was loud and clear: do not handcuff together what 
are two separate issues, gun control and criminal justice reform; 
do not attempt to control the criminal abuse of firearms by 
punishing the innocent, legitimate gun owners in the country.
<P>
	This message has been supported by over 300 phone calls and 
faxes to our ``let the people speak'' lines here in Ottawa. These 
come from all across the country. The people of Moose 
Jaw-Lake Centre say we need to get tough with violence and

	During this week in Peterborough riding and across Canada 
recognition events are being held to honour volunteers who do 
so much to maintain our standard and quality of life.
<P>
	Volunteerism is one of the unwritten secrets of democracy. 
Healthy democracy demands the full and free participation of all 
citizens. That is why during in this particular volunteer week, 
while remembering all Canadian volunteers, we should save a 
special thought for Canadians helping with the election in South

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Despite yesterday's ceasefire, Serb forces are continuing their 
assault on Gorazde. They have even shelled the hospital. The 
emergency room was hit this morning by rocket fire and 10 
people were killed and 15 wounded. According to a wire report 
just in, even the wounded cannot be rescued because Serb fire is 
preventing would-be rescuers from reaching them. At noon, we 
learned that following a request from the UN, NATO countries 
agreed today in Brussels to proceed with new air strikes in 
retaliation for Serb atrocities.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm to us if Canada has endorsed the 
NATO resolution to proceed with new air strikes and can he also 
confirm whether Canada has in fact expressed some reservations 
about the effectiveness of such strikes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are extremely concerned about the deteriorating 
situation in Bosnia. The decision by the UN Secretary General to 
ask NATO to order offensive, rather than purely defensive, air 
strikes is obviously one fraught with implications.
<P>
	In light of this change of policy, forces serving under the 
auspices of the UN will no longer be in the field solely to 
maintain peace and provide safe passage for humanitarian aid 
convoys. They could be called upon to take action to impose 
peace. Ambassadors to NATO are currently meeting to discuss 
this request and once a final decision has been made, I will be 
happy to convey it to the House.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the minister that the situation has reached 
a critical stage beyond which major decisions will have to be 
made. Must Canadian and other peacekeeping forces be content 
to stand by, powerless to stop a disaster of inhumane 
proportions, almost as if they were sanctioning what was 
happening by doing nothing, or should they take more concrete 
actions and intervene, as the minister said, to impose peace? The 
other option is withdrawal. I think that the conscience of the 
western world will lean more toward intervention. The fact that 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3273"> 3273 </A></B>
<P>
Russian security council convened a meeting this morning is a 
sign that the conflict is getting worse.
<P>
	My question to the Minister of Foreign Affairs is this: Can he 
tell us if Russia has agreed to back the UN resolution calling for 
more air strikes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all I can say to the House today is that talks are 
continuing between government leaders in an effort to thrash out 
a unified policy. A short while ago, the Prime Minister of 
Canada spoke with the President of the United States who 
himself was scheduled to speak with the Russian president. 
These talks will continue during the next few hours, the 
objective being to devise a plan of action, one that has the widest 
possible support, to bring an end to the conflict raging in the 
former Yugoslavia.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have learned that the Russians could decide to retire 
the kind of support, at least the sympathy they had for the Serb 
movement. Now we hear that the conflict might expand to Iran 
because the last dispatch is to the effect that the Ayatollah 
Khamenei has just ordered Iranian troops to intervene in Bosnia 
to defend the Muslims.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Foreign Affairs agree that the situation 
could deteriorate very rapidly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think we should be very cautious about all these 
rumours. One thing is certain, and that is that members of NATO 
are trying to put forward a unanimous position and to bring 
along other important players in this area of the world to draft a 
common approach to the current situation.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	I can confirm that there have been discussions at the highest 
levels. It is quite clear that the involvement and the 
co-operation of Russia with the European Union, the United 
States and Canada could be very decisive in making sure we take 
steps that will stop this conflict in the ex-Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Our purpose is to arrive at a united front and to ensure that all 
the parties in ex-Yugoslavia come to the table and respect a 
peace initiative.

is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs claims that his government consulted 
the provinces before announcing its youth strategy.
<P>
	Yesterday, Quebec's Minister of Education categorically 
denied having been consulted by Ottawa.
<P>
	How can the minister continue to claim that the provinces 
were consulted, when Quebec's Minister of Education denies 
that he was consulted? Will the minister now withdraw his 
allegations and admit that Quebec's Minister of Education was 
not consulted?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, on February 28 I met with the 
ministers of education who compose the Council of Ministers of 
Education. The federal government was invited by the council to 
develop a co-operative approach to a broad range of matters 
affecting young people.
<P>
	At that time we gave a full briefing to all the ministers of 
education concerning the various youth initiatives: the 
internship program, the youth services corps, the student loans 
and the learning initiatives which were discussed at the request 
of the provincial ministers themselves.
<P>
	As the hon. member probably knows, they had issued a 
declaration over a year ago asking that there be full 
co-operation between the federal and the provincial 
governments to undertake a common approach to the problems 
facing education.
<P>
	After the meeting, at which we outlined the approach we were 
taking, we offered to establish a number of meetings with 
officials to go over the specific parts of the program. There were 
a series of meetings on the student loans program.
<P>
	Specifically last Friday a meeting was held in Quebec 
between federal and provincial officials to discuss the 
internship program.
<P>
	That is a fair description of the kind of consultation, 
collaboration and co-operation we want to have with the 
provinces. We outlined the approach and certainly in response to 
any request by the provincial ministers we are very open to 
continuing the dialogue to look at the specific implementation 
of that program so we can once again work together to help 
young people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> How can the minister 
seriously say that he made every effort to avoid further 
duplication of responsibility between Quebec's programs and 
his youth action plan, since this plan has three components that 
directly overlap similar Quebec programs and are in no way 
complementary?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand fully the inability 
of the hon. member to understand the notion of co-operation. 
That is probably not part of his vocabulary. It is certainly not 
part of his behaviour in the House.

	However, I want to emphasize that at the present time we are 
already-and I will just take one province as an example-in the 
province of Quebec, co-operating with the province on the 
development of the purchase of training courses. We are 
working with the provinces directly on looking at labour market 
needs. We work in a co-operative fashion with the SQDM. We 
have joint management of co-operative education with the 
province of Quebec. We have joint approval of stay in school 
initiatives. There is a substantial number of areas where we 
work in co-operation with the provinces and with the province 
of Quebec. It is too bad the hon. member is not interested in

<P>
	All of us in the House know that the people of Quebec will be 
making a fundamental choice later this year that will affect all 
Quebecers and all other Canadians. That choice will be between 
a federalist provincial government and a sovereignist provincial 
government committed to the separation of Quebec from 
Canada.

seriousness of this issue I hope that she will not regard this as a 
partisan question. What steps does the government believe 
Parliament should take in the next two months to ensure that the 
federalist option is chosen by a majority of Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the admonition 
of the leader of the Reform Party to take this issue seriously.
<P>
	The Liberal Party believes that the future of the country is a 
very serious matter. We do not consider it a family feud and we 
do not consider it simply a matter to be discussed by Quebecers. 
We think the issue of Canada staying together is an issue that 
touches every single one of us in every part of the country.
<P>
	That being said, we think that the best way to convince 
Quebecers that Canada wants them as part of our country is by 
showing Quebecers and the rest of the country that we are 
capable of providing good, decent, honest government for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Deputy Prime Minister's reply makes myself and other 
federalists uneasy because it suggests that status quo 
federalism, simply ``good government'', is enough to rally 
support for federalism.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister and the government not 
acknowledge that what Parliament really needs to do is put a 
new and better face on federalism; the face of a balanced budget, 
the face of a more accountable Parliament, the face of economic 
and social renewal, in order to deepen the commitment of all 
Canadians, including Quebecers, to Canadian federalism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the last six months the 
government has shown it is not the party of the status quo. We do 
not believe that by changing suits you are going to somehow 
show people that you have a better government.
<P>
	What this party has shown over the last six months and what 
we will continue to show is balance in decision making. We will 
also continue to fight, as we fought yesterday, for the rights of 
every single minority wherever they live in our country. An 
important part of a country is understanding that in building for 
the future you also have to understand your history and that is 
what the Liberal Party represents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the Deputy Prime Minister's answer. However what 
is missing from it is any deep commitment or acknowledgement 
of the need for real reform of federalism itself.
<P>
	If it can be demonstrated to the government that a majority of 
Quebecers want a balanced federal budget, that a majority of 
Quebecers want an overhaul of federal language legislation, that 
a majority of Quebecers want systemic change, like many other 
federalists in the country do, would that persuade the 
government to offer Quebecers and indeed all Canadians 
something more than status quo federalism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, to understand what Quebec 
wants I think the member has to start by electing some members 
of Parliament from Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	The member's unfortunate ignorance of the situation in 
Quebec is reflected by the resolution put yesterday which 
basically tried to carve up the city of Montreal into east and 
west.
<P>
	The reality is a nation is built by celebrating its differences, 
by making sure every part of the country feels it is part of the 
whole. Every single policy that passes through the government 
is going to be based on principles of equity and fairness. 
Therefore we say exactly the same thing in the city of Montreal 
as we do in the city of Vancouver. We do not wait for a telephone 
call to tell us what our policy should be.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, in response to the federal finance minister's intention 
to slash transfers to the provinces in order to reduce his deficit, 
the Quebec minister of finance issued the following warning to 
his federal counterpart:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-we told the federal government that this reform should not be achieved on 
the backs of the provinces and that the issue of government debt in Canada will 
not be resolved by offloading the federal deficit onto the provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Will the Minister of Finance ever understand-now that his 
Quebec counterpart has joined with the Official Opposition in 
trying to make him understand-that he must cut federal 
government waste and stop dumping his deficit problem on the 
provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, we fully agree that we 
should not dump our problems on others. That is why we first 
settled the issue of equalization that has been of enormous 
benefit to Quebec and six other provinces. That is why we 
agreed with finance ministers, including the Quebec minister of 
finance, to impose a moratorium on social security reform. That 
is why, as I said in my speech, we clearly stated in the budget the 
objectives agreed on by the finance ministers in January.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
could the finance minister's insensitivity despite his Quebec 
colleague's appeal be explained by his urgent need to carve out 
for himself, at the expense of the provinces, enough fiscal 
leeway to finance his colleagues' repeated, brazen and appalling 
intrusions in areas of provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me simply read what I said. I will do 
this in English because it is part of the speech that was given in 
English.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-then we took a look at the absolute necessity of renewing fiscal federalism.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The provinces agree with that. The minister of finance for 
Quebec agrees with that.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-it is now crucial that we begin to take a look at what all levels of 
government do, not with some political aim in mind, but in terms of its 
affordability and efficiency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Government of Quebec agrees with that, as do all of the 
provinces who want to solve our problems. Then I went on to say 
that we have discussed that with the provinces.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-they have two years in which to complete with us this process. At the end of 
that two years we will be taking massive amounts of money out of the 
federal-provincial structure, hopefully not at their expense nor at ours, but as a 
result of the more efficient programs between the two levels of government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what the provincial finance ministers want. It is what 
the provincial governments want. It is what the federal 
government wants. It is what Canadians want. It is what we are 
going to deliver.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Finance. I will give him a little hint on the 
answer: billions versus millions.
<P>
	Today's <I>Financial Post</I> reports that the Deutsche Bank has 
recommended to its clients to reduce their Canadian bond 
exposure to zero from 3 per cent which could represent up to $10 
billion. One of the primary reasons given is that Canada's heavy 
budgetary risks will result in further underperformance. It is 
obvious the Deutsche Bank does not share the minister's 
optimism and opinion that the budget was a success.
<P>
	Why would the Deutsche Bank recommend pulling out of the 
Canadian economy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the questioner being a businessman 
himself understands that what makes markets are obviously 
differences of opinion.
<P>
	The fact is the analyst in the Deutsche Bank has expressed an 
opinion. I had breakfast with the president of the Deutsche Bank 
not long after that report and it certainly was not his. He wanted 
to give you his best.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	The fact is the majority of investment houses in the United 
States recommend a holding of Canadian bonds at 3 to 4 per 
cent. That is what makes markets and that is why we are very 
confident.
<P>
	The member should have read the whole report because the 
Deutsche Bank talked about provincial deficits and about the 
very uncertain political situation in Quebec. Let me tell you, 
once the political situation in Quebec is cleared up with a 
victory to the provincial Liberals the Deutsche Bank will change 
its mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, further to the 
remarks of the finance minister I would like to add another 
possible reason the Deutsche Bank gave this recommendation 
despite the breakfast.
<P>
	One of the reasons both foreign and domestic investors are 
uneasy about the Canadian economy is that mixed messages 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3276"> 3276 </A></B>
<P>
keep coming from the Prime Minister and the Finance minister. 
The billions versus millions controversy is only the latest 
contradiction by these two senior ministers.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Finance clarify once and for all for the 
House and for foreign and domestic investors, whose comments 
on deficit reduction can be relied on, his or the Prime 
Minister's? And no double talk, please.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member asked the same 
question yesterday. I will give him the same answer.
<P>
	The fact is that in the red book, in the budget and in statements 
in the House the Prime Minister and I have made it very clear 
that the cuts have been made in the budget which are required to 
get us to 3 per cent of the GDP within three years. At the same 
time we have said a major review of every single program is 
being carried on by the Minister responsible for Public Service 
Renewal.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has said it; I have said it; and you can keep 
asking us. I would really suggest to the hon. member that he 
come up with some new questions. Ask Canadians for some new 
questions. I think your research well is running dry.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans unveiled his new program 
regarding income support and labour adjustment for fishery 
workers adversely affected by the dwindling groundfish stocks 
in the Atlantic.
<P>
	How can the minister be satisfied with a program which does 
not propose any measure to get the fishing industry going again 
through the development of new markets or new products, and 
how can he justify the reduced assistance, considering that 
compensation cheques will now drop by 6 per cent?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, quite frankly I am surprised at the attitude of the hon. 
member, given his previous experience with the fishery.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is the Government of Canada is not 
reducing the groundfish sector. The Government of Canada is 
not shutting down the groundfish sector. The hard truth rather 
than the easy rhetoric is that the groundfish sector today is 
closed. There are 14 moratoriums in place. People in the 
groundfish sector are not working today and a great many, the 
majority, have not worked for two years.
<P>
	The issue is not whether or not we are going to shut the sector 
down, but how much of the sector we can reopen, how much of 
the capacity we can employ based on the ability of the resource 
to sustain that sector.
<P>
	We are taking the hard and difficult choices but the honest 
choices to work with communities, fishermen and plant workers 
to restore as much of the industry as possible and, where that is 
not possible, to give them the truth so they can make the 
decisions to rebuild their lives.
<P>
	Does the member want us to do something different? If he 
does, we will not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is all very nice; 
however, what fishery workers need is hope. Right now, the 
government is giving them false hopes; in fact, the package 
offered is 6 per cent smaller than last year's.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I will give the minister a chance. How does he 
reconcile his will to help Atlantic economic diversification with 
the fact that his government just reduced by $160 million 
ACOA's budget for the next three years, as well as FORD-Q's 
budget, an office whose role is precisely to promote regional 
economic diversification? Perhaps the minister could clarify 
this issue, because so far, rather than discussing he is cutting.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member talks about empty hope. We are not 
talking about empty hope. We are talking about a $1.9 billion 
program. It is the only new major expenditure in the February 22 
budget. That expenditure represents the commitment of the 
Prime Minister and the government to the people of Quebec and 
Atlantic Canada affected by the fisheries crisis to stand by them 
in their time of crisis and to help them rebuild their lives. The 
member ought to recognize that.
<P>
	We have said clearly there are three legs to this program. The 
first is assistance for individuals. That we have delivered on. 
The second is to restructure the industry. That process begins 
over the next six weeks through consultation. The third is to 
diversify the economy of Atlantic Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	I have the greatest confidence the Minister for the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency and the minister responsible for 
FORD-Q will work hand in glove with the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and me to see that commitment is 
delivered in spades.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3277"> 3277 </A></B>
<P>
	Yesterday the Reform Party suggested the concept of 
post-secondary education vouchers given to students and 
income contingent repayment plans for student loans.
<P>
	Could the minister tell the House if education vouchers and 
income contingent loans are specifically on his agenda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the matter of income 
contingency repayments, if the hon. member would look at the 
announcement we made on Friday he would know the legislation 
we propose to bring in the House very shortly will include the 
opportunity for us to undertake a series of pilot projects with the 
provinces to develop an ICR system.
<P>
	That was based upon the meeting with the ministers of 
education I spoke about earlier. Several of them requested that 
we undertake that kind of approach. Others were not in 
agreement. Therefore rather than bringing it in on a national 
basis we thought we would work with those provinces that were 
interested to develop it and see how the methodology would 
work.
<P>
	As for the question of a form of education voucher or 
education investment that idea has been presented to us through 
the work of the House of Commons committee by experts in the 
field. It is one of the considerations I would like to raise when 
we meet with the ministers of education and labour at the 
provincial level.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I hope the program the minister is talking about is not 
the band-aid type variety but is a true reform to a commitment to 
education.
<P>
	One of the most appealing aspects of a voucher system is it 
allows individuals to choose what is best for themselves.
<P>
	Could the minister tell the House if he has already discussed 
the idea with his provincial counterparts and, if so, what was 
their general reaction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just told the hon. member but I 
am glad to repeat it.
<P>
	When we met on February 28 with the Council of Ministers of 
Education we outlined the proposals we would want to 
undertake to substantially improve the student loans program.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows we substantially increased the 
loan limit to bring it into reality with today's costs. We have 
undertaken a program of more direct support for students, 
particularly women going into graduate school, students with 
special needs, single mothers, so that they can get back into a 
higher education program.
<P>
	What we did discuss with them is how we can provide a 
program that would enable all Canadians to be able to go into the 
educational system on a lifelong basis. We  want to turn the 
notion of lifelong learning from a cliche into a reality for 
people.
<P>
	Members in the entire House would be interested that the 
co-chair of the Council of Ministers of Education who happens 
also to be the minister of education for Quebec said in a speech 
recently in Vancouver that it is a fact Canadians everywhere 
have common expectations.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	It is also a fact that we are faced with common problems. It is 
clear that we must adopt a common approach in dealing with 
them. That is our philosophy too.

question is for the Minister of Public Works. Yesterday, the 
minister used decisions of previous governments to justify 
awarding 50 per cent of the flu vaccine contract to Connaught. 
Need we remind him that in 1991, when Connaught was awarded 
this contract, the maritimes ran out of vaccine, and that last year, 
100 per cent of the contract was awarded to BioVac?
<P>
	On the substantive issue, does the minister know that 
Connaught is only a distributor of flu vaccine in Canada and 
imports this vaccine from the United States, while BioVac, the 
only manufacturer of this vaccine in Canada, made a bid that 
would have saved $600,000 of public money if the minister had 
accepted it?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question.
<P>
	The fact is that the Government of Canada, as I have said 
repeatedly in the House, purchases approximately 1 per cent of 
the total amount. Ninety-nine per cent of the vaccine is 
purchased by the provinces. This is done through the auspices of 
a co-operative committee by federal but primarily provincial 
governments across the country. They are the ones that purchase 
the vaccine.
<P>
	As a result, there was an agreement reached by that committee 
where 50 per cent would be purchased from the province of 
Quebec, namely BioVac, and the other 50 per cent purchased 
from Connaught.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the

<P>
	This member and that party have been pushing this

primarily the provinces, was $1.85. Connaught's was $1.69. A

my question is for the parliamentary secretary for transport.
<P>
	The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence seaway is a viable economic 
route. It is economic and it is friendly to the environment. 
Unfortunately there is predatory and very unfair pricing by the 
railroads of Canada when competing against commodities being

seaway system.
<P>
	The railways in the country do that by and large by the almost 
one billion dollars a year they receive in subsidy.
<P>
	When will the government stop this abuse of this 
transportation subsidy? When will it maximize the return to the 
farmer where it should be? When will it create a level playing 
field for all modes of transportation in the country in which to 
compete?

is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	There are many law-abiding, decent Canadians who choose to 
own guns. They comply with the letter of the law respecting 
handguns. Yet the government is considering taking away their 
choice of responsible ownership of those guns.
<P>
	Does the minister respect Canadians who have acted 
responsibly? If so, why is he considering a ban on handgun 
ownership?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, time and again studies have 
demonstrated and our experience shows that guns inherently 
dangerous fall into the hands of criminals either because they 
are lost or they are stolen. There is a need for gun control in the 
country.
<P>
	Bill C-17 recently adopted by this Parliament and now in 
place across the country constitutes an important measure 
toward achieving that safety. However, more steps must be 
taken. We campaigned for office on a platform that included 
specific proposals for increased and stricter gun control.
<P>
	I do not quarrel at all with the assertion by the hon. member 
that there are honest and law-abiding people who are entitled to 
the use of rifles for the purpose of hunting or other legitimate 
purposes. However I say that we have an obligation to the public 
and its protection to ensure that these inherently dangerous 
weapons are under control so they do not fall into the hands of 
criminals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, with the 
greatest of respect to the Minister of Justice, I suggest that he is 
continuing to target those who choose to obey the law, the 
law-abiding gun owners.
<P>
	The minister should be focusing his concerns on those who 
are breaking the law. The focus should not be on the gun owners 
but on the criminals who are misusing them.
<P>
	Why does the minister not enforce the law, stop the illegal gun 
trade, get guns out of the hands of criminals and stop harassing 
legal gun owners?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has just 
read from the list of priorities in the Department of Justice to act

penalties for those who possess firearms in the commission of 
offences are enforced and are effective and to take other steps to 
ensure that the use of firearms in criminal activity is properly 
punished.

the good of Canada. I am sure that the minister will consider the 
suggestions of the hon. member opposite and act accordingly.

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	Recently, after having asked the House Standing Committee 
on Health to study the issue of plain packaging of tobacco 
products, the hon. minister publicly stated: ``I would like to see 
us move on that as quickly as we possibly can'' and ``I feel that it 
would do a lot to discourage young people especially from 
taking up smoking''.
<P>
	Could the minister tell the House why she has requested both 
her department and the health committee to study this issue, at 
considerable expense to the taxpayer, when it is apparent from 
her statements that she has already decided to go ahead with the 
plain packaging?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for her question.
<P>
	In January 1994 the Canadian Cancer Society released a 
report ``The Effects of Smoking on Young People''. This report 
concluded that it would discourage young people from taking up 
this terrible habit of smoking.
<P>
	In February 1994 when we released our anti-smuggling 
strategy, the Prime Minister announced in the House that we 
would look at the issue of plain packaging. The Standing 
Committee on Health is looking at that at this time. I await with 
great anxiety and I am anxious to hear the results of what the 
committee is doing. I am sure it will have some very valuable 
information to give to all of us.
<P>
	In the meantime, I have asked the Department of Health to 
undertake a research project, a very specific marketing project, 
to look into allegations that it would discourage young people 
from smoking. As the member knows, if we can prevent just one 
death it is very worthwhile. In this case every year 38,000 
Canadians die as a direct result of smoking.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the minister's answer. Considering that the 
Department of Health has publicly stated that its study would 
take until the end of the year and that the committee on health 
care was also looking at this, is it fair to assume that the 
government will not make a decision on this issue until those 
reports are in?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can tell the hon. member that no legislation has been drafted at 
this time. I must add that when I met with provincial ministers of 
health there was a great deal of interest on their part to look into 
the matter of plain  packaging. It is not just the federal 
jurisdiction that is interested in doing some work in that area. 
We will continue this as I truly believe that plain packaging will

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport.
<P>
	Transport Canada has just issued a notice to airmen and the 
marine industry advising of the possibility of space debris 
re-entering the atmosphere and crashing off the east coast of 
Canada, specifically the east coast of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	What information could the parliamentary secretary give the 
House concerning this matter, more particularly whether it is the 
view of the government that this re-entry poses any threat to the 
safety of Canadians on the east coast of Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for giving me this 
opportunity of advising the House that Transport Canada has 
been advised by Cape Canaveral that there is a possibility that 
some space debris may re-enter the atmosphere and crash into 
the ocean off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland on Thursday, April 
21, 1994, between 1200 and 1500 hours, eastern daylight time.
<P>
	This is a serious and important issue and Transport Canada is 
working with the departments of National Defence, Foreign 
Affairs and our respective American counterparts to monitor the 
path of this debris. As the member mentioned, notice has 
already gone out to the marine and aviation industries.
<P>
	I also advise the House that it is intended that the 
departmental satellite re-entry contingency plan, which 
provides for Transport Canada emergency staff, will give the 
authority to take whatever action within its sphere of 
competence to-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

also in place to protect us here in Ottawa.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order under Standing Order 18 to 
bring to the attention of the House a very serious matter with 
respect to statements made by the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester both in and outside the Chamber.
<P>
	Standing Order 18 states in part that no member shall use 
offensive words against either House or any member thereof.
<P>
	I refer to <I>Hansard</I> of Monday, April 18, 1994, page 3175:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party proposes a form of ethnic cleansing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Also, in response to a question I had asked the hon. member, I 
refer to page 3176 of <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think you are a bunch of bigots.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. member later withdrew this but only after the 
Deputy Speaker insisted.
<P>
	Also, in response to my colleague, the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan, the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester stated: ``The Reform member should not 
have worn a dark suit to address the House today but rather a 
white sheet''.
<P>
	<I>Erskine May</I> 21st edition of parliamentary practice also states 
that insulting language of a nature likely to create disorder is 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	The only reason that these remarks did not create disorder 
which has been seen so often in the House is that the Reform 
Party has too much respect for Parliament and for the Canadians 
who elected us. However, the words spoken by the member for 
Carleton-Gloucester are offensive in the extreme. This type of 
language has no place in the parliamentary forum or anywhere 
else.
<P>
	I would also like to draw to the attention of the House that 
today outside the House the member for Carleton-Gloucester 
once again-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As to the remarks outside the House, whatever 
is said outside the House as a general rule we do not deal with in 
here.
<P>
	Does the member have something to add to the primary?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with what you said. 
What I was saying was that while these remarks were made 
outside the House they were similar to those remarks made in 
the House.
<P>
	While I recognize, Mr. Speaker, that you cannot rule on 
comments made outside the House, the repetition of remarks 
made in the Chamber does nothing for the level of decorum that 
Canadians expect from their parliamentarians.
<P>
	Finally I would ask that you make a ruling on this 
unacceptable language in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before I turn the floor over to the hon. member 
for Carleton-Gloucester, I did read over <I>Hansard</I> and I did see 
the tapes. It is my understanding that the hon. member has 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3281"> 3281 </A></B>
<P>
withdrawn the word bigots categorically. He has withdrawn that 
and I turn the floor over to the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity to 
respond to the Reform Party's House leader, the one who had 
just thrown four sheets to the wind.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare</b>: Mr. Speaker, we have here a prime 
example of what the Reform Party--
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I would encourage the hon. member, as 
he is directly involved, to please direct himself to the point of 
order on the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, the House leader is offended by 
the fact that I talked about ethnic cleansing. He quoted some 
pages of <I>Hansard</I> to support his contentions a short while ago.
<P>
	I would like to refer to page 3147. A member of the Reform 
Party stated yesterday that language fractures a country and he 
made reference to Bosnia and suggested that all the problems 
and wars in the world today are caused by ethnic problems. He 
then continued to speak about the problems that the French 
Canadians are creating in Canada by wanting to be recognized 
for their rights, minority-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Of course we are engaged every day in 
very strenuous debate in the House. We all encourage one 
another to use language which is not offensive in any way to any 
hon. members. Sometimes in the heat of debate we use words 
which are not entirely appropriate.
<P>
	The hon. member has raised a point of order and rather than 
get into a debate about perhaps what was said and what was not 
said, I wonder if he would give me the time to review, in total 
again, the specific words which were said. Then perhaps we 
could take this up tomorrow when I could make a ruling on the 
particular words that were put before us.
<P>
	If we would agree to this, I would look into it and come back 
tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that my colleagues 
would be happy to drop this matter and not put you to the trouble 
if the member would withdraw those statements.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I hope there is agreement in the House to give 
your Speaker time to review all the words that were said and the 
context in which they were said.
<P>
	I believe there is agreement and, if so, I will come back to the 
House tomorrow. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud to present the first annual report on the 
administration and application of the Energy Efficiency Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By promoting energy efficiency and alternate energy my 
department will help increase economic competitiveness by 
lowering energy bills and reducing the environmental impacts 
associated with energy use.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3282"> 3282 </A></B>
<P>
	This report notes a variety of important departmental 
activities which integrate economic and environmental 
objectives. Through my department's programs and initiatives 
the Government of Canada is working in partnership with 
business to promote energy efficiency.
<P>
	I will use these initiatives as a base for a more co-ordinated 
program with higher visibility among Canadians. Energy 
efficiency is widely recognized as the best short term strategy to 
achieve our economic and environmental goals. I have 
encouraged an expansion of voluntary action programs within 
both government and the private sector.
<P>
	We are working with the provinces and the Canadian 
Federation of Municipalities to reduce duplication and expand 
the scope of these programs, and we are participating in 
initiatives to encourage fuel efficiency in transportation fleets 
and residential energy retrofits.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I encourage all members of this House to support the gradual 
direction in which Canada is moving for the sake of greater 
energy efficiency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the report which the Minister of Natural Resources has 
just tabled is another example of the form of centralizing 
federalism which Quebec chose to move away from on October 
25 last. Whereas the Government of Quebec already has 
jurisdiction in this area, now the minister is announcing clearly 
today her plans to move further into this field.
<P>
	Responsible energy management is a provincial matter. It is 
precisely this kind of jurisdictional overlap between levels of 
government that we must eliminate if we are to avoid these 
endless squabbles over jurisdiction which ultimately cost the 
taxpayers a pretty penny indeed.
<P>
	Must we remind the minister once again that Quebec has 
already adopted a broad energy efficiency strategy, that it 
administers sizeable budgets for energy efficiency research and 
development and demonstration projects, and that it already has 
in place an important energy productivity program? Through its 
Department of Natural Resources, the Government of Quebec is 
already involved in this area, acting in co-operation with Hydro 
Quebec, the private sector and regional chambers of commerce.
<P>
	If, as she claims, the minister really wants to reduce overlap 
between the provinces, then she should be setting an example 
and abolishing her department's own programs which only add 
to the confusion and distort the efforts undertaken by Quebec. If 
the minister cannot bring herself to do this, then she should at 
least have the decency to allow Quebec to oversee its own 
energy efficiency policy independently and turn over to the 
Quebec government the money she was planning to spend in the 
province under these nice Canada-wide programs.

annual meeting between the Canadian and European 
Parliaments held in Vancouver, British Columbia, from 
February 15 to 18, 1994.

parliamentary association doing positive work on behalf of 
Canadians on an issue that could potentially have been very 
damaging to the Canadian economy and thousands of jobs, 
namely the forestry industry.

	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-239, an act respecting the decade of the brain.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I wish to introduce a bill to declare the 
1990s the decade of the brain following an original initiative of 
the World Health Organization in the late 1980s.
<P>
	It is the human brain which makes us unique among living 
creatures. Ailments of the brain carry with them heart rending 
disabilities that can rob us of the very essence of personhood. 
The real tragedy is not only the disease that may cause death but 
the disintegration of the mind, with devastating impact on 
family and on society.
<P>
	A great threat to the independence of the elderly are diseases 
of the brain, some treatable, most preventable. A healthy mind is 
the greatest guarantee for continued independence.
<P>
	A cognitive mental stability enhances the ability to heal and 
recuperate, to cope and overcome physical ailments. It is also 
important to note that diseases of the brain are among the 
costliest, both directly and indirectly.
<P>
	It is my fond hope that the bill will raise the awareness of 
Canadians and will encourage further research and support to 
those in our communities who are forging advances of 
knowledge that will ultimately improve the lives of all of us.

communicating our love for Canada. In this week of national 
citizenship some of us participated in the Hall of Honour 
yesterday reaffirming our oath.
<P>
	We sang ``O Canada'' like it has never been sung before, I am 
sure, in these halls. In every one of our constituencies there are 
gifted individuals, choirs, et cetera. Unfortunately music is 
conspicuously absent from the daily proceedings here in 
Parliament. After having given notice to the other two official 
parties in the House I am seeking unanimous consent for the 
following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Standing Order 30 be amended by adding the following words: ``and 
shall cause Canada's National Anthem to be played or sung in the House every 
Wednesday immediately preceding oral questions''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I think you would find unanimous consent in the House for 
that, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the substance of what the member is trying 
to propose.
<P>
	However, there are errors in the drafting of the text. Perhaps 
the member would be willing to move that the item in question 
be referred to the parliamentary committee on procedure. I am 
acting chairman and I commit to her to deal with it forthwith. As 
a matter of fact, we have a meeting as early as tomorrow 
morning. There are errors in the text. It does not refer to what 
subsection of section 30 the item should be addressed to.
<P>
	It is traditional for amendments to the standing orders to be 
made pursuant to a recommendation of the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	If the member is willing to make that small modification, on 
behalf of my colleagues I am willing to give consent to have the 
matter referred immediately to the parliamentary committee in 
question.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that when we 
asked the Table and the clerks about this, it was in order. It was 
given back to me saying that it was in order and we could 
proceed with it. I appreciate the generosity of the member and, 
barring unanimous consent in the Chamber now when we are on 
national TV, that the secondary way we could proceed is as he 
suggested.
<P>
	As an individual member I believe I have every right and 
privilege to ask if there is unanimous consent for the motion so I 
would like the Chair to put the motion to see if there is 
unanimous consent for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not a matter of whether this 
issue is dealt with on or off television. I would like to think that 
we stand for a bit more substance than that.
<P>
	The issue is whether the wording is proper. I am acting 
chairman of the committee this week. I have given my 
undertaking to the member. If this is as serious as she claims it is 
and I believe it is, then surely a commitment to deal with it at 10 
or 10.30 tomorrow morning in committee would not seem like 
undue delay in anyone's mind and in any reasonable Canadian's 
mind, listening to the proceedings on or off TV.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As an alternative the hon. member for 
Beaver River might wish to wait until tomorrow.
<P>
	She has already indicated she wants me to ask if there is 
unanimous consent now. We have not heard from the Official 
Opposition. Perhaps she could put it off for 24 hours and bring it 
back tomorrow, having discussed it with the deputy whip for the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	It is entirely her right if she wants me to ask for unanimous 
consent. I will do it as soon as she sits down.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> I did ask once, Mr. Speaker. That was my request.
<P>
	Let me then put an amendment because the hon. member is 
upset about the technicalities of it. I would move an amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Standing Order 30, subsection (1), be amended.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And everything further to that. Yes, we would like unanimous 
consent but barring that we would be willing to send the matter 
to committee.
<P>
	This is a very large thing, but in fact a very small thing for the 
House to deal with. There is no shame to it, and surely this is the 
place for us all to say: ``Yes, we love this country''. Maybe we 
should sing it right now. Who knows?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have the 
unanimous consent of the House to move the motion as 
indicated a moment ago?

stop work order imposed on Sunshine Village that calls for yet 
another environmental study is an unnecessary cost to the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	Numerous studies and public forums have already been held 
and expansion was approved by Liberal and Conservative 
governments during the past 16 years.

caribou herd.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to formally reaffirm the 
position stated in 1987 of the best way to ensure the future of the 
many shared wildlife populations of the coastal plain. Canada's 
preference would be for the United States to follow the example 
already set in both the adjacent Arctic national wildlife refuge 
lands and on the Canadian side of the border by designating the 
1002 area as wilderness.
<P>
	This was the position taken by the previous Parliament. I 
agree with my constituents and those of the Northwest 
Territories that the Porcupine caribou herd is a national treasure. 
I would urge the government and Parliament reaffirm that

	My constituents are unhappy that Canadians were not 
consulted before the Official Languages Act was entrenched in

petition from more than 100 residents of Peterborough and 
surrounding areas. It is on behalf of long service employees who 
lose their jobs and have locked in pensions.
<P>
	These petitioners request changes to the Pension Benefits 
Act, 1985, which was revised in 1990 to bring that act they say in 
line with the economy of the 1990s and to improve the situation 
of displaced long term employees.
<P>
	The petitioners suggest that consideration be given to 
releasing such pension funds in cases such as financial hardship, 
the loss of a job, where someone is starting a new business, or 
where there is no job available. They also suggest that the 
eligibility age should be reviewed and lowered. I have signed 
these petitions.

<P>
	Canadians who are offended by these killer cards will be 
pleased that the minister has acted so quickly. Today draft 
amendments to the Criminal Code have been tabled which 
``would restrict or prohibit the sale or distribution of materials 
such as serial killer cards and serial killer board games to

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXCISETAXACT">EXCISE TAX ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
Bill C-13, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act and a related act, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity today to reaffirm the government's 
commitment to a fair and simpler sales tax system.
<P>
	Our goal is to make it fair for consumers and business, 
especially small business, and to have a tax structure that 
promotes federal-provincial co-operation and harmonization.
<P>
	The House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance has 
already begun to explore alternatives to the current GST. The 
committee is focusing on the objectives of administrative ease 
for registrants, enhanced competitiveness for Canadian business 
and fairness for all taxpayers. It will also be mindful of the 
transitional impact on taxpayers of any proposed changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3286"> 3286 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition the committee will have to be sensitive to the 
impact on revenue, for we need a sales tax system that can be 
relied upon as a stable source of revenue for the government.
<P>
	The committee is consulting with Canadians. By June 1 it will 
report back to the House on ways in which we might achieve 
these goals.
<P>
	The committee's report will help to set the agenda for 
consultations with provincial governments. We will invite the 
provinces to work with us to achieve a greater sales tax 
co-ordination. The lack of co-ordination in the tax system, 
particularly in the area of sales tax, increases the complexity for 
businesses and creates many extra costs for governments, both 
federal and provincial.
<P>
	Through this process of consultation we will do our best to 
ensure that improvements to the tax system rest on a broad 
public and intergovernmental consensus. It will take time to 
build this consensus. It will take time to reform the sales tax 
system, to do it once and to do it properly.
<P>
	It is therefore necessary for this government to take steps to 
make the GST easier to comply with in the interim. Bill C-13 
proposes amendments that will accomplish this.
<P>
	In several areas the GST legislation needs to be brought into 
line with what is practical on an administrative level both for the 
government and the GST registrants. The bill contains measures 
that have been developed and refined in consultation with 
representatives from the business community and other sectors 
affected by the changes. These measures will make the GST 
easier for businesses and other entities to comply with in their 
day to day operations.
<P>
	Even though the GST will be replaced during the 
government's mandate, we will do what we can in the meantime 
to make the existing rules easier to understand for businesses, 
taxpayers and their professional advisers. The bill contains 
provisions that will ease the administrative burden on seasonal 
and part time businesses.
<P>
	Bill C-13 is beneficial for charities as well. In fact it will 
allow some of the smaller charities to be excluded from the GST 
rules altogether. For charities that do remain in the system there 
are measures that would make the rules easier to follow.
<P>
	This bill will also clarify and broaden the scope of the special 
treatment in the agricultural sector and certain exempt sectors.
<P>
	I would now like to take a few minutes to tell my hon. friends 
about some of the specific measures in Bill C-13. I would like to 
begin with the changes we are proposing for the business 
community, especially small businesses, for it is in this sector 
that the need for change is particularly critical.
<P>
	The bill contains provisions related to a simplified method for 
registrants to claim input tax credits, that is to recover the GST 
they pay on their business expenses.
<P>
	This simplified method will be available to businesses with 
annual taxable sales of $500,000 or less. It will eliminate the 
need for them to identify the amount of tax payable on each and 
every purchase they make. Effectively this special approach will 
allow them to calculate input tax credits by using the same 
information they need for income tax purposes.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	Other amendments in this bill will ensure that seasonal and 
part time businesses will no longer have to file GST returns 
during the off season.
<P>
	Taken together, these small business measures will make the 
current sales tax system easier to comply with for many 
registrants in Canada.
<P>
	There are other sectors of society that have special needs and 
practices to which the tax system must adapt. Bill C-13 contains 
provisions that respond to the concerns of the health, charitable 
and non-profit sectors.
<P>
	For example, the legislation will guarantee the tax free status 
of adapting privately owned vehicles to the needs of the 
individuals who use wheelchairs. Another measure will broaden 
the GST exemption for homemaker services that are rendered to 
people who require special assistance due to age, infirmity or 
disability.
<P>
	The bill will help charities by entitling them to rebates or 
input tax credits on allowances and reimbursements they pay to 
volunteers who have incurred expenses on the charity's behalf. 
It will also make it easier for them to calculate input tax credits 
on their meals and entertainment expenses. Another amendment 
will make it simpler for charities to determine whether or not 
they are required to register for GST purposes.
<P>
	In the agricultural sector Bill C-13 guarantees the tax free 
treatment of rabbits produced for food.
<P>
	For suppliers of exempt services particularly in the financial 
sector, the bill clarifies the extent to which they may claim input 
tax credits in respect of expenses they incur in support of both 
their exempt and taxable activities.
<P>
	The measures contained in Bill C-13 will lessen the 
administrative burden of the GST. They will resolve some of its 
technical shortcomings until we, together with our provincial 
counterparts, have an opportunity to forge a solid consensus for 
a fundamental reform of the sales tax system.
<P>
	I therefore urge the hon. members to give their full support to 
the bill.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, the House will consider three bills, 
including one which concerns the Department of National 
Revenue and, more specifically, the merger of customs and 
excise. The other two bills deal, respectively, with legislative 
provisions concerning the GST, Bill C-13 and Bill C-15 which 
deal with certain Income Tax amendments.
<P>
	The Official Opposition will support the government on the 
adoption of Bill C-13. As the hon. member for Vancouver South 
just pointed out, this bill, whose purpose is to revise or adjust 
certain provisions of the GST legislation, will affect small and 
seasonal businesses, charities, health care services, agriculture, 
financial institutions and other exempt suppliers, and also sets 
requirements for payments and remittances of $50,000 or more.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to discuss why the 
government has to revise these bills from time to time. In the 
case of Bill C-13, the bill before the House today, I must admit 
this is an admirable attempt by the government to make our 
taxation system more straightforward and more equitable.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The Official Opposition certainly welcomes this initiative, 
especially since it also aims to correct some technical 
deficiencies in legislation adopted previously. However, I think 
this would be a good time to explain how important it is for us, 
as legislators, to produce legislation that is clear, concise and 
consistent. The trouble with most of the legislation being passed 
today, especially when the government is trying to move a large 
number of bills through Parliament, is that the implementation 
of all this legislation often creates problems that are even worse 
than those it was supposed to resolve, which are often quite 
simple. The result is that today, we have hundreds of laws that 
merely complicate the lives of most citizens.
<P>
	I think we should realize, as legislators, that there is the 
federal government, the House of Commons, which passes bill 
after bill, and the provincial legislatures which also produce a 
considerable number of bills and regulations every year. There 
are also municipal governments across Canada and Quebec 
which adopt by-laws to be observed by all members of the 
community. There are also school boards, each with their own 
by-laws.
<P>
	My point is that the well-known principle that ignorance of 
the law is no excuse is often difficult to maintain in the maze of 
legislation we find at all levels of government. Often the only 
people who can be sure of enjoying the benefits of these laws are 
the experts in the field, including lawyers, notaries and 
accountants, for whom I have tremendous respect; but the fact 
remains that more often than not, they are the real beneficiaries 
of this maze of legislation at all levels of government.
<P>
	How do you expect ordinary people whom we are supposed to 
represent in this House to find their way through the incredible 
labyrinth of legislation in this country? A law is never perfect, 
but we should at least ensure it is worded as simply as possible. 
Legislation that is not clear will inevitably be misinterpreted or 
misused, sooner or later. As I said before, there are hundreds of 
laws in Canada that would gain by being simplified or at least 
clarified.
<P>
	Bill C-13 fills that need to some extent, and that is why the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois support it. We, on this side, are 
able to recognize it when the government does it right and we 
will never hesitate to support any measure or bill such as Bill 
C-13 that makes it possible to simplify the Canadian legislative 
system. Unfortunately, such is not the case with all Canadian 
legislation. In some cases, it is almost ridiculous and Canadians 
get the impression, in fact the conviction, that the legislator 
does not know where he is going, that he has no vision and that 
all we are asking of our fellow citizens is that they trust their 
government and obey the many laws passed just about 
everywhere.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Survey after survey shows that current Canadian public 
opinion on the confidence of the people in their governments 
and elected representatives in general -and Quebecers agree 
with their fellow citizens in English Canada on that- is lower 
than the interest rates set by the Bank of Canada, although these 
are relatively low.
<P>
	All this to say that neither increasing the number of laws nor 
enforcing them will improve the public's perception.
<P>
	I will come back to that later, but we will also be debating Bill 
C-15, which is a good example of the kind of legislation that 
should be put before this House to make some sense of the 
legislative and administrative jumble created by previous 
legislation.
<P>
	Bill C-13 clarifies the legislation that governs us. While a 
step in the right direction, such efforts remain very modest in the 
face of the masses of legislation which continues to make the 
lives of people and corporations miserable in this country 
because of their lack of clarity and transparency.
<P>
	Let us not forget that each time a flawed piece of legislation is 
passed in this chamber, that a statutory regulation providing for 
the execution of a law is misinterpreted or applied incorrectly, 
and that this has an impact on the everyday lives of our fellow 
citizens. As legislators, we often acquire the annoying habit of 
forgetting that the various bills we pass impact on the daily lives 
of our fellow citizens.
<P>
	Those were the main comments I wanted to make as the 
Official Opposition critic concerning Bill C-13. In conclusion, I 
would like to reiterate that the opposition will support this bill 
because, as I pointed out, it improves several legislative 
provisions on the GST. We hope that, under the GST review 
initiative referred to by  the hon. member for Vancouver 
South-we know that public hearings and consultations are 
being held on a new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3288"> 3288 </A></B>
<P>
act, perhaps, or an in-depth review of the GST-the government 
will take the time needed to table before Parliament a bill that 
will make sense to Canadians, that will be equitable and that 
will, in the end, benefit our society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be the 
only caucus member for the Reform Party addressing the bill 
today.
<P>
	I rise today to address Bill C-13, an act to amend the Excise 
Tax and a related act. The bulk of the bill offers relief to small 
business, charities, health care users and rabbit growers in 
paying their GST. Yes, that is right, they now get back the money 
they paid in taxes on rabbit food.
<P>
	The bill makes life easier for them or permits them to pay less. 
It makes permanent administrative practices already in place. 
One section, however, prevents people who owe over $50,000 
GST to pay by cheque on Friday afternoon and get a weekend of 
extra interest credit because the cheque does not clear until 
Monday.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	The only contentious section concerns financial institutions 
that have been trying to get their GST bill lowered by claiming 
that a section of the act is ambiguous. The ambiguity was 
discovered by tax lawyers, which justifies their high pay. It 
would take several paragraphs to explain the highly technical 
nature of the ambiguity. However the weak position of the banks 
is revealed by the fact that for four years they paid between $150 
million and $300 million under protest. The new bill removes 
the ambiguity and the money stays with the government. This is 
a very good and sound decision under the current economic 
circumstances.
<P>
	It is particularly refreshing to note that Bill C-13 offers relief 
to rabbit growers in the country. Now all the Minister of Finance 
has to do is magically pull out one of these rabbits from a hat and 
balance his budget.
<P>
	My party supports Bill C-13 but it would like to point out that 
it represents yet another example of a federal government 
tinkering with an old idea that does not work.
<P>
	Since its inception the GST has been a burden for business to 
collect on behalf of the government the moneys owed and also 
for the government to administer. With its countless exemptions 
and high rate, the GST has become symbolic of the country's 
chaotic tax system causing confusion and resentment among 
Canadians.
<P>
	I have said this before and I will say it again. Canadians pay 
too much in taxes and want the current system overhauled, not 
just tinkered with.
<P>
	The problem is that governments have been spending in ways 
that ignore both the need for a strong economy and the dangers 
of continued deficit spending. The government, like those 
before it, relies on the revenues generated by taxes like the GST 
and the new tax sources to fund their programs and make interest 
payments on the debt.
<P>
	If the federal government were to truly attack the debt and not 
just nibble around the edges as is currently the case, tinkering 
with rabbits, interest payments to service it would be lower and 
leave it with more revenue to fund other programs.
<P>
	This would give the federal government the ability to reduce 
its current tax hauls from hard working Canadians and give them 
back their disposable income which will then be spent more 
efficiently and effectively. They know how to spend their money 
on their needs better than the government knows how to spend it 
on their behalf on what it perceives to be their needs.
<P>
	With more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers, 
people in the private sector will stimulate the economy creating 
jobs using at risk money that motivates and not government 
money which wastes.
<P>
	Continued government overspending of debt capital, not 
equity capital, on rehashed programs from the 1960s and 1970s 
has further encouraged taxpayer resentment, unemployment, 
high deficits and debts. In today's world, real sustained growth 
depends on trade, investment and strong industry.
<P>
	Over the past two decades, the country has lost the 
competitive edge that it once held in the world marketplace 
because of poor government policies combined with 
overspending and high taxation.
<P>
	As Mr. David McLean from the Vancouver Board of Trade has 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Foreign investors do not just look at the costs of the goods and services tax 
and provincial sales taxes, they add them all up. If the cost is too high then 
capital will not come to Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is why we must re-examine all taxation, stop tinkering 
and put in place a simple, comprehensible system that will take 
the country into the future, leaving the old policies behind.
<P>
	Enough reruns. Let us create an entirely new program. Canada 
needs a proportional system of taxation. The Liberal member 
who spoke first to this bill today mentioned that the finance 
committee is looking for a replacement for the GST as promised 
by its leader. One alternative it should consider is a proportional 
system of taxation or, as is sometimes otherwise referred to, a 
flat tax.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3289"> 3289 </A></B>
<P>
	The present system of taxation is too complicated, too high 
and too unfair. These factors in combination with consistent 
government overspending are stifling our economy. I 
recommend the implementation of a proportional tax on 
individual and corporate income.
<P>
	A proportional tax is the only way to increase the revenue side 
of the budget, remove the incentives for the underground 
economy, restore fairness and, most important, stimulate 
economic growth, which is a priority of all of us here.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	While we are fighting with our high annual deficits, the high 
debt and the interest on that debt, we could increase the 
disposable income both for corporations and individuals 
through a completely new taxation system. This would help 
speed up the process of reducing the deficit to zero and starting 
to supply some surplus funds to the debt. This is the kind of 
signal, the kind of message that will really inspire and 
encourage this country to be a haven for investment as it used to 
be.
<P>
	This concept is not new to the House or the government. It was 
the member for Broadview-Greenwood who sits opposite me 
who initially, I understand, supported a single or flat tax. He 
wrote in his book <I>The Single Tax</I>: ``Lower marginal rates and 
more take home pay would be an incentive to work harder and 
smarter. The new incentives plus elimination of avoidance and 
evasion would lead to this tax taking in more revenue''.
<P>
	I unequivocally agree with the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. I am very impressed by his 
intelligence and insight on this subject.
<P>
	The objective of this tax would be threefold. First, it would 
simplify current complicated tax forms so that all Canadians 
could understand them. I challenge the 295 members of the 
House for this taxation year to fill out their own income tax 
forms by themselves and with no help go through the form. 
Whatever they come up with then send it in to the Minister of 
National Revenue and have two independent people within that 
bureaucracy figure out their tax return. I would not be surprised 
if over half the returns had two different answers with a lot of 
mistakes which would prove that is very difficult and 
complicated. Nobody understands the 2,300 and some pages of 
the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	This would also increase savings for the Department of 
National Revenue in the collection of taxes and the monitoring 
of all personal and corporate tax exemptions.
<P>
	Second, it would restore equity in the tax system, eliminating 
the perception that one group of taxpayers is favoured over 
another by setting a lower fixed rate of tax over a certain 
threshold for individuals. Corporations would also pay a low 
fixed rate of taxation under this reform system.
<P>
	Equity is when people who make relatively the same amount 
of income pay relatively the same amount of tax. By eliminating 
yesterday's incentives, which we refer to today as loopholes for 
the rich people, we can ensure that we capture 15 per cent or 20 
per cent, whatever the flat rate would be of that income. That is 
what would increase the revenue for the government. We could 
give a high enough tax deduction for the first $12,000 or 
$15,000 of earned income so that nobody has to pay tax on that. 
That would also relieve a lot of the pressure on our social 
programs.
<P>
	It would restore integrity and bring effectiveness to the 
system by eliminating the need for so many tax concessions and 
loopholes like those that the government is trying to close with 
Bill C-13. We waste our time on old laws and old rules that are 
not working.
<P>
	The Liberal government must stop following the same path as 
its predecessors and show some initiative. Stop just talking the 
talk and walking the walk. Take some tough action and act 
instead of talking about acting by setting up 15 new committees. 
It will take six months before they come back with a 
recommendation which the House will then have to review for a 
further six months or a year. Let us take some action.
<P>
	By maintaining the status quo with taxation and programs like 
infrastructure and the Katimavik II youth job program, 
Canadians are seeing nothing new from this government. When 
will this government wake up and realize that you cannot keep 
taking from Canadians higher and higher taxes and borrow 
indefinitely in the bond market. One of these days and soon 
somebody will not buy the bonds.
<P>
	My hon. colleague for Beaver River said in the House 
yesterday something which I believe is worth repeating: ``Old 
songs by new singers are still old songs''.
<P>
	The Liberal red book for example is now becoming an old 
song book which offers a two-track policy of growth which will, 
and I quote from the book, ``make possible a monetary policy 
that produces lower real interest rates and keeps inflation low''. 
The Liberals promise that their policies, measures, budget and 
all the necessary budgets made to date will get the deficit to 3.5 
per cent of the GDP, will keep the interest rates low and we will 
have low inflation. Since the budget was released the Bank of 
Canada rate has jumped to a two-year high of 6.26 per cent, an 
increase of 2.16 per cent. Interest payments on our debt will now 
increase which will likely force businesses and consumer rates 
to follow as well in the marketplace.
<P>

	As a former professional football player, I would like to point 
out that the current Liberal government playbook is not

	The playbook is not working. It is time to write a new one, a 
dynamic one. Let us create a new system of taxation which is 
fair and simple for all Canadians, that will put to rest the need 
for band-aid bills like Bill C-13. It is our collective 
responsibility to develop new ideas and move the country 
toward a future based on prosperity and away from the old 
school ideas that just do not work.
<P>
	I hope that in the Standing Committee on Finance where new 
ideas are being presented by witnesses from all across the 
country that the new proposals being suggested for a 
replacement for the GST are really and truly listened to and that 
the committee will not be just a job for backbenchers to keep 
them out of the way while cabinet occupies itself on the greater 
issues of the country.
<P>
	There have been some worthwhile suggestions put forth in 
that committee. Some good solutions have been put forward in 
that committee. It comes from non-politicians, the intelligent 
people in this society. They have put forth some good ideas and 
we should be listening to them. If they do and it is on a 
non-partisan basis, I look forward to a report in the House that 
comes to you, Mr. Speaker, and says ``the replacement for the 
GST is-''and that it has the unanimous consent of all members 
of the three parties in the House who are on that committee. I 
look forward to that and I hope it will be that conclusion.
<P>
	In conclusion, easing the GST burden on the public is highly 
desirable and we should support all such legislation. I encourage 
the federal government to examine the benefits of a completely 
new system of taxation, a proportional tax which would remove 
the need for undesirable taxes like the GST and put money back 
into the pockets of hard-working Canadians.
<P>
	The Reform Party will offer any assistance it can to move this 
country toward a proportional system of taxation and eliminate 
the need for debate and talk by the bureaucracy and politicians 
on useless bills like Bill C-13 when there are much better 
solutions to the problems, new solutions to new problems.

like to take this opportunity to thank hon. members of the 
Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois for supporting the bill.
<P>
	I think the bill is an important bill because often we have had 
in the House both the Reform and the Bloc talking about 
duplication in government, talking about paper burden on small 
businesses and the administrative difficulty of managing the 
GST.
<P>
	I think the government recognizes some of those concerns and 
this bill shows that we want to ensure that the government is 
aware of the concerns of small business in terms of the 
difficulties of the GST.
<P>
	As someone who has been a small businessman, I think that 
doing things as simply as possible, as the hon. member said very 
well, we can help small businesses to be more competitive. We 
can help to ensure it is efficient and productive.
<P>
	I want to thank the members for that and for the excellent 
comments that were made by the hon. member on how we as a 
government can work toward improving the environment for 
small business so it can be more productive, efficient, create 
more jobs and get this economy moving.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would

is a very small step in the right direction and I think he could use 
what we just did as a model to tackle real problems such as the

overall review of government spending and the entire federal

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a point of 
protocol, I guess, I rise to indicate that we do support the bill in

today do flow back to the Standing Committee on Finance and 
from the Standing Committee on Finance back to the House and 
that the government some day in the near future, perhaps in time 
for the next budget, can come up with comprehensive reforms in 
taxation that would improve the system that we have.

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (for the Minister of Justice)</B> moved 
that Bill C-15, an act to revise certain income tax law 
amendments in terms of the revised Income Tax Act and Income 
Tax Application Rules, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-15 contains in its schedules a rewrite of the nine 
income tax amending acts passed between November 30, 1991 
and July 1, 1993; that is to make them consistent with the 
revised Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Amending acts passed prior to December 1, 1991 were 
incorporated in the revision of the Income Tax Act and the 
income tax application rules in the context of the statute 
revision exercise which forms the fifth and last supplement to 
the revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, which came into force on 
March 1, 1994.
<P>
	Between November 30, 1991 and July 1, 1993 nine acts 
amending the Income Tax Act were passed. These acts amended 
the old version of the Income Tax Act, which was in force at that 
time.
<P>
	In Bill C-15 the nine amending acts are being rewritten to 
read as they would have read if the revised version of the Income 
Tax Act had been enforced when they were passed. Each 
schedule of Bill C-15 revises one of these nine amending acts.
<P>
	What needed to be done to bring the form of the amendments 
in line with the revised version is under question. In English, for 
instance, where the Income Tax Act once contained a large 
number of gender related terms, these have now been removed 
or replaced.
<P>
	In the French version terminology and style have been 
improved and standardized to correspond as much as possible to 
the improvements in the language of the general statute revision 
of 1985.
<P>
	The enactment of the bill will bring the revision of Canada's 
income tax law to a close. It will provide the citizen and the tax 
community with a uniformly revised, up to date version of the 
current income tax legislation.
<P>
	I wish to stress the point that this bill does not amend the 
substance of the Income Tax Act. Indeed, Bill C-15 specifically 
provides that this bill shall not be held to operate as new law 
when it provides that the Revised Statutes of Canada 1985 Act 
will apply to these schedules.
<P>
	This is a technical bill that does not create new law and I am 
seeking the co-operation of the House for its speedy passage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I said in my speech on Bill C-13, Bill C-15, as 
was just noted again in this House, is intended to clarify several 
provisions of the Income Tax Act and does not make any new 
law. Accordingly, the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill.
<P>
	My speech will be short. I want to come back to the point that I 
raised earlier, and I think that this bill shows it even more clearly 
than the previous one.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We have before us a bill that is over 650 pages long, with some 
150 clauses that, I repeat, are intended to amend some previous 
legislative provisions in accordance with the legislator's desires 
or with amendments made to other laws so that all these 
amendments are in the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	The point I want to make is as follows: although it is good 
occasionally to have bills that clarify previous provisions or do 
some housekeeping, this shows that legislators must act wisely 
in passing these laws the first time. Of course, I am not saying 
that once passed, a law must never be revised, but it should be 
changed for substantive reasons, to adapt it to new 
circumstances and to situations that prevail when the need for 
change arises.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3293"> 3293 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill is meant to correct errors, if you like, that were made 
or adopted in some other legislative provisions. Especially at 
this time of year when everyone lucky enough to have a job must 
file an income tax return, it is easy to understand how hard it is 
for the ordinary citizen to make sense of all this mountain of 
legislation. We add to that complexity when we have to pass this 
kind of legislation.
<P>
	Although it will be more understandable for specialists, 
ordinary citizens will still have difficulty making their way 
through it. That is what we want to emphasize to the 
government. When you present a bill, you should ensure that it 
is as easy to understand as possible for the citizens who will 
have to comply with it.
<P>
	That said, I repeat that the Official Opposition will support 
the amendments contained in Bill C-15.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if I am informed correctly I am the only speaker on this subject.
<P>
	Today I rise in the House to comment on Bill C-15. This bill is 
intended to revise certain amendments of the Income Tax Act. I 
think the Reform Party generally supports the bill except for a 
few minor suggestions that I would like to throw over to the 
other side of the House. The bill does, however, provide this 
opportunity to criticize somewhat what the hon. members on the 
other side are doing with our tax money.
<P>
	I was very surprised this afternoon in oral question period 
when we were criticized for using the telephone to gather 
information and opinion. I would like to suggest to the hon. 
members on the other side of the House that it is probably a lot 
more efficient than using Challenger jets to go and see 
individuals or small groups of people, and I think we get better 
information on certain subjects.
<P>
	The Reform Party position on income tax includes a single 
rate tax, with larger personal and family exemptions so that 
families earning below a certain income would pay less tax or no 
tax. We would also eliminate most of the tax deductions and 
loopholes which are not general in application for most 
Canadians. As a party we are opposed to any increases in general 
income tax burden imposed on Canadians by the federal 
government.
<P>
	The flat rate system would be simpler, more sensitive and 
fairer than the current system.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	It helps to look at a few facts and figures since 1984. The 
Canadian tax burden has been the largest among the G-7 
countries. In the fiscal year 1991-92 the personal income tax 
yielded $61.5 billion which accounts for 49.6 per cent of federal 
revenues.
<P>
	The root cause of this serious overtaxation is the problem of 
government overspending. It seems incredible that government 
after government refuses to recognize this.
<P>
	In 1984 the Liberal government was defeated by Brian 
Mulroney and the Conservatives on a platform of deficit 
reduction and political patronage. The same thing happened in 
1993 when the Liberals defeated the Conservatives on deficit 
reduction and overspending.
<P>
	Thank heavens there are 52 Reformers on this side of the 
House now to watch the spending, even if they cannot do 
anything on the revenue side. Therefore we have a little more 
balance which I hope will be positive in this House.
<P>
	I wonder sometimes why the governments have tried in vain 
to get the government spending problem fixed by increasing 
taxes. The notion that a deficit can be reduced from government 
revenue increases alone is a misguided one.
<P>
	Federally higher taxes have failed to reduce the deficit. They 
have in fact stalled the economy by cutting the spending power 
of the consumer, by dampening new investment and diverting 
growth into a flourishing underground economy.
<P>
	In my riding of Lisgar-Marquette agriculture producers 
have seen along with the rest of Canadians a reduction in our 
country's international competitiveness. Our income taxes to 
our producers and businessmen have got to the rate that the 
Americans are a lot more competitive just on that one simple 
tax.
<P>
	I urge the government not just for the farmers, but for the 
businessmen, private enterprise, entrepreneurs and 
constituents, to start thinking of lowering taxes and not raising 
them.
<P>
	The evidence is across this country. University educated 
professionals leave Canada for nations where the income taxes 
and cost of living are lower. This is after we have paid to educate 
them.
<P>
	The government should be looking at a tax break that would 
help our farmers, businessmen and consumers to increase their 
buying power, their productivity and our competitiveness.
<P>
	I was shocked to learn recently that since 1961 Canada's tax 
freedom day has advanced 73 days. In 1961 the ordinary 
Canadian paid his taxes by May 5. Today that same taxpayer has 
to use his wages or productivity until July 15. This type of 
taxation whether it is corporate tax or income tax is 
unforgivable.
<P>
	We are rapidly approaching a point where we will be working 
for governments full time just to pay for their debt-creating 
policies and bad spending habits. If we do not break this cycle 
soon and allow ourselves to implement useful, carefully 
considered tax breaks, Canadians will see their incomes taxed 
out of existence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3294"> 3294 </A></B>
<P>
	What direction should the Government of Canada take in its 
tax policy?
<P>
	A good example is happening right now in Alberta. Since the 
election, the premier of Alberta has been on a crusade to 
eliminate his province's $2.5 billion deficit. He is on track to 
achieve a zero deficit within three years. This has been done 
with a commitment not to raise taxes. The message has gone out 
that he will not raise taxes.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	It surprises me that where we live in our global economy 
technology and freer trade will reduce the importance of 
political boundaries. Investments and jobs will go to places with 
highly skilled workforces, good public services and competitive 
tax rates.
<P>
	I can tell you what this means to my own province of 
Manitoba. Recently I have seen two companies move their 
Winnipeg operations to Calgary. A number of small businesses 
have moved their production facilities from the 
Morden-Winkler area to North Dakota. Why? One of the big 
reasons is income tax, sales tax. Alberta has no sales tax. 
Alberta has a lower corporate tax. The income tax in North 
Dakota is about two-thirds of what we pay.
<P>
	The blunt fact is that Canada's political establishments have 
overspent and are on the verge of bankruptcy. Governments take 
50 per cent of the average Canadian family's earnings. Multiple 
layers of government drain off the highest personal income tax 
burden in the G-7 countries and it seems not to be enough.
<P>
	Reckless borrowing by government still continues as bond 
rating agencies prepare to downgrade our government credit 
ratings. Ridiculous tax levels are transferring people's spending 
power to unaccountable governments. That means retail sales 
and job growth shrinks and investment falls. It is a simple 
message that government should heed, or beware.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Prior to

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-2, an act 
to amend the Department of National Revenue Act and to amend 
certain other acts in consequence thereof, as reported (without 
amendment) from the committee.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall (for the Minister of National Revenue)</B> 
moved that the bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to begin third reading of Bill C-2. This is an act to amend the 
Department of National Revenue.
<P>
	While the amendments are administrative in nature they go to 
the heart of one of the fundamental concerns of the government 
and the country. That concept is to reshape the instruments of 
government and to provide both better service and better value 
to the taxpayer.
<P>
	Bill C-2 does that in terms of the services provided by the 
department most involved with the concerns of the taxpayers, 
the Department of National Revenue.
<P>
	Since 1926 the Minister of National Revenue has had 
responsibility for two separate functions: customs and excise on 
the one hand and taxation on the other. Over this time these two 
components of the department have operated as virtually 
autonomous organizations. Yet the daily reality with which 
taxpayers live has never been so easily compartmentalized. 
Increasingly through technology, trade and travel Canadians 
find their lives becoming more complex, more frustrating to 
manage and more difficult to understand in terms of the burdens 
government places on them.
<P>
	All of us see this daily in terms of the complaints received 
from our constituents of overlap and duplication, of paper 
burden and red tape. The distinction between taxation on the one 
side and customs and excise on the other has become more and 
more an artificial distinction.
<P>
	Increasingly the distinction denies rather than reflects the 
way Canadians live their lives. The distinction renders 
Canadians' lives more complicated than they need be. 
Reversing that trend must be and is our first priority.
<P>
	However, increasingly this artificial separation also impedes 
rather than improves administration, making it more difficult to 
redeploy resources and to employ new technologies as tools to 
improve services on the one side and compliance on the other.
<P>
	It is long past time that we brought the department in its 
structure and operation into line with the reality with which 
ordinary Canadians live. It is time we free the quality people 
who work within Revenue Canada to do a better job. It is time we 
eliminate overlap and duplication within the department for the 
sake of the department's clients and the Canadian taxpayer. It is 
time that we do this in law.
<P>
	We have already demonstrated what consolidation can 
achieve within the existing legislative framework. The savings 
have been substantial. We have also demonstrated that we are at 
the limits of what we can do within that framework. We require 
Bill C-2 to remove those limits, to create new possibilities for 
improvements, to continue our momentum toward the goals of 
better service and better value and to free the department to 
work to its full potential. By doing that we can better align what 
we do with what Canadians want.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	During the minister's appearance before the Standing 
Committee on Finance on February 15 members asked him for 
specific information on the benefits inherent in the 
administrative consolidation of Revenue Canada and he has 
responded to them.
<P>
	I would like to share with all members of the House some of 
the benefits administrative consolidation will bring to 
Canadians and governments in terms of efficiency, productivity, 
effectiveness in generating revenue, and finally lightening the 
burden of the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	First, let me speak to efficiency and productivity. Revenue 
Canada has a solid record of providing Canadians with good 
value for money. It administers more than 185 acts, regulations, 
incentives, credits, surtaxes and international tax treaties, and 
does so with its eye on the bottom line. Through ongoing 
improvements to its operations and efficiency gains realized 
through technological advancements, the department has 
achieved productivity gains equal to adding more than 2,000 full 
time staff in the last ten years.
<P>
	These savings have permitted the department to carry out its 
legislative mandate while also investing in better service, 
enhanced enforcement and staff training and development.
<P>
	At the same time, Revenue Canada has made a significant 
contribution to deficit reduction through both enhanced revenue 
collection and reduced spending. This will continue in the 
future.
<P>
	Bill C-2 will allow the department to go even further in 
streamlining administration and generating savings for 
reinvestment. Already the consolidation of corporate activities 
and administration, which we have been able to pursue within 
the existing legislative framework, has saved $30 million.
<P>
	Some $13 million of this saving has been reinvested in critical 
customs programs that are essential in protecting Canadian law 
and sovereignty at the border.
<P>
	These include $2.3 million for the primary automated lookout 
system. This system provides a primary inspection line officer 
with access to data base of local and national information to 
determine the admissibility of travellers and their goods. The 
cost includes the acquisition of a licence plate reader system to 
streamline and speed the examination of travellers.
<P>
	Also included is $1.2 million for the personal alarm security 
system. Seventy-four isolated border posts will be connected to 
ultra high frequency radio communications networks to enable 
customs inspectors to summon help in case they face threats to 
their health or safety.
<P>
	Also included is $1.1 million for X-ray equipment. Four 
X-ray vans will be purchased to enhance examination and 
enforcement capabilities in Halifax, Toronto, Montreal and the 
Pacific region for providing a  less intrusive and more time 
saving examination technique.
<P>
	Also included is $1 million for the integrated customs 
enforcement system. This project will integrate and replace a 
number of customs systems to reduce overlap and improve 
enforcement. The integrated customs enforcement system is a 
comprehensive information repository and analytical tool that 
ensures front line customs personnel have the most reliable 
information to more effectively manage risk at the border.
<P>
	Also included is $3.5 million for the new business 
relationship. Significant funds have been allocated to 
re-engineer processes such as electronic data interchange and to 
develop profile based release, accounting, self-assessment and 
audit processes. The benefits translate into real savings for 
business.
<P>
	Also included is $1.3 million for the Peace Arch crossing 
entry. This initiative, which has been successfully piloted in 
Douglas, B.C., enables frequent pre-approved travellers to use 
an express lane at border crossing points. Duties and taxes are 
billed electronically to the travellers credit card based on 
personalized declaration forms. Additional funds will expand 
the service to other locations.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Also included is $2.6 million for specialized customs 
enforcement tools and systems.
<P>
	Funds have been allocated to purchase a number of devices 
such as contraband detection kits to detect commonly smuggled 
goods and to improve compliance.
<P>
	The full consolidation of Revenue Canada which Bill C-2 
enables will permit even further savings. We anticipate that 
consolidation could generate a further savings of $30 million for 
the year 1995-96.
<P>
	Let me turn to the second area, our enhanced revenue 
generating capability. As the Minister of Finance declared in his 
budget speech on February 22, our government is committed to 
take decisive action on tax compliance and to strengthen 
enforcement.
<P>
	Through administrative consolidation Revenue Canada will 
have a stronger combined enforcement capacity and thus be able 
to follow through on this commitment. Our experience has 
shown that non-compliance in one area such as under reporting 
income tax is often matched in other areas such as under 
reporting on GST.
<P>
	As a single unified department we will improve our 
penetration into the underground economy and thus increase the 
fairness of our tax system. It will do this by allowing us to build 
bridges between our tax system, trade system and border 
operations to improve the effectiveness of them all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3297"> 3297 </A></B>
<P>
	We want to apply the benefits of such collective efforts to 
target those who do not comply with the law and to level the 
playing field for those who do. Efforts to date in co-ordinating 
the administration of the two existing departments have 
enhanced revenue generation by enabling increased 
co-ordination and enhanced sharing of data bases as shown by 
the following illustrative examples.
<P>
	First, we have established a pilot in 15 district offices to 
identify areas of major non-compliance through joint GST and 
tax audit activities. As at December 31, 1993, $8.4 million in 
additional federal tax has been assessed and 4,343 non-filers 
and non-registrants have been identified.
<P>
	Second, in November we enhanced our effort to identify GST 
non-filers. It utilizes a combination of overtime, casual staff 
and facilities from both taxation and excise. Results to date 
include $417 million having been identified as additional 
accounts receivable, of which $220 million has already been 
collected.
<P>
	Third, we have undertaken the cross-referencing of excise, 
GST and taxation data base to identify non-filers and 
non-registrants. The estimated recovery for 1993-94 is $240 
million.
<P>
	As members will see, the return in terms of revenue far 
outweigh the cost. This will be enhanced by departmental 
consolidation. The best examples of this is the initiative to 
offset GST credit payments against income tax liabilities and 
family court orders.
<P>
	For 1992-93, $59 million was offset from GST credit 
payments. Results for the first three quarters of 1993-94 show 
that $56 million has already been offset. In similar fashion we 
have made efforts to use better co-ordination to provide more 
convenient and fair services in particular areas. As well, we 
expect enhanced revenues from our recent efforts to clamp down 
on smuggling.
<P>
	The recent announcements concerning 42 additional customs 
officers in the Windsor area and 350 customs personnel for the 
government action plan on smuggling are examples of the 
government's commitment to improve border protection.
<P>
	Finally, let me turn to our efforts to reduce the burden on 
Canadians of compliance with tax laws.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	By eliminating the unnecessary barriers between the different 
components of Revenue Canada, Bill C-2 will have a positive 
impact on those who must deal with Revenue Canada whether 
small and large businesses, professionals, importers or the 
taxpaying public.
<P>
	The following are but a few examples of the opportunity 
presented by administrative consolidation to reduce burden and 
increase service: an integrated collection program so that clients 
and their representatives need deal with only one Revenue 
Canada official; the provision of a convenient, one stop 
shopping service whereby clients can obtain information, 
acquire  forms and make payments at any of about 130 customs, 
excise and taxation offices across the country; a single business 
registration number to replace the various identification 
numbers that business is currently required to use in its dealings 
with Revenue Canada.
<P>
	The plan is to develop one single and common registration 
process, a single registration form, an integrated approach to 
payments, inquiries and account maintenance as regard 
corporate tax, source deductions, GST and customs; a simplified 
combined business return enabling small business with gross 
sales of less than $500,000 to file a net payment in a single 
annual return; simultaneous GST, income tax and source 
deduction audits when necessary and where possible.
<P>
	Revenue Canada has been entrusted with a significant 
mandate that involves the lives and the livelihood of Canadians. 
This is indeed a challenging mandate affected by national and 
international elements. This consolidation will give Revenue 
Canada an unprecedented opportunity to enhance its ability to 
respond to these challenges without imposing any further 
burden on taxpayers.
<P>
	As I said at the outset, this legislation provides concrete 
evidence of our commitment to reshape government to the needs 
of Canadians. The unanimous report of members of the Standing 
Committee on Finance is testament to the recognition of this 
imperative.
<P>
	I now seek the support of all members in the passage of Bill 
C-2.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Once again, the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, do you mean you are tired of listening to me? This 
will be my last speech for the day, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Today, April 20, 1994, we are witnessing an event of almost 
historical proportions in the House of Commons. If I am not 
mistaken, within a matter of hours the government and the 
opposition parties will have agreed to adopt three bills which, 
we hope, will have a positive impact on the lives of our fellow 
citizens.
<P>
	Bill C-2, whose purpose is the consolidation of the taxation 
and customs and excise sectors in the portfolio of National 
Revenue, seems very appropriate because it brings about a 
reduction of current spending and overlap within one and the 
same department.
<P>
	In his speech, the hon. member for Vancouver South 
described the savings that will result from this initiative. The 
proof of the pudding is of course, in the eating, but we are 
prepared to approach what was said by the hon. member for 
Vancouver South with a very open mind. At the same time, we as 
members of the Official Opposition will make a point of 
ensuring that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3298"> 3298 </A></B>
<P>
these commitments are  met and that potential savings become a 
reality in the months to come.
<P>
	However, aside from this particular aspect, as you know, Mr. 
Speaker, members of the Official Opposition have for months 
asked for a reduction in all forms of administrative duplication 
and even, I would say, of constitutional duplication.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will support such initiatives in this 
House, provided, of course, that the proposed changes do not 
adversely affect Quebec interests. In other words, we remain 
prudent but nevertheless very open to this type of proposal.
<P>
	Bill C-2 is in itself a good bill, but I hope that when the time 
comes to implement this legislation, the government will 
consider all aspects of the question. In this respect, perhaps I 
may remind hon. members of apprehensions expressed by the 
president of the Customs and Excise Union, for instance.
<P>
	In fact, the president of the union appeared last February 
before the Standing Committee on Finance, when the committee 
was considering Bill C-2, and he stressed the main concerns his 
union had about this bill. One of the union's concerns arises 
from the fact that as a result of consolidation, many employees 
trained to collect income tax will turn up as managers in 
Customs and Excise. However, the Free Trade Agreement, or 
should I say the Free Trade agreements between Canada and the 
United States and, more recently, between the United States, 
Canada and Mexico, as well as the trend towards the 
globalization of world markets, will mean that in the years to 
come, there will be fewer and fewer tariff items to enforce at our 
borders. Customs and Excise does not need more tax collectors. 
As I see it, Customs and Excise should be more concerned about 
the lack of protection at our borders.
<P>
	A prime example is the smuggling problem we see today. 
While the lowering of taxes on tobacco products had a definite 
impact on smuggling, it would be naive to think that the whole 
smuggling problem has therefore been resolved. Canadian 
borders are said to leak like sieves in many places. Only last 
week, a U.S. government report put Canada on the list of the 
countries where it is the easiest to smuggle drugs in because of 
the length of our borders, but that stands to reason considering 
how few resources are allocated in that area by the government, 
although some remedial action was taken recently.
<P>
	The fact that Canadian borders are poorly guarded has 
certainly given a boost to the black market phenomenon which is 
now spreading, as we know, to alcohol. It has been spreading for 
a long time, but loads of spirits keep flowing through our 
borders. It has even spread to such things as clothing, drugs, as I 
said earlier, but more dramatically to illicit arms dealing and 
pornography, which goes to show how urgently action is 
required in that area.
<P>
	One of the purposes of Bill C-2 is to reduce the operating 
costs of the Department of National Revenue.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	But if the government does not also step up our border 
security-I repeat, action has been taken, but it must really do 
more along those lines-it is likely to have much more serious 
problems than those it now faces. It will have a rude awakening, 
judging by what the president of the Custom and Excise Union 
said when he appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Finance.
<P>
	Here verbatim is one of the warnings he served on the 
government concerning the actual savings that might be realized 
from this merger:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Decreased border protection will ultimately translate into more weapons in 
our schools, more fraud and smuggling, and more expense in enforcing the laws 
of Canada when the criminal element ends up a step closer to our daily lives. This 
will cause the need for increased policing within Canadian communities. For 
example, one missed cocaine seizure at the Canadian border could require 
several hundred policing actions within the communities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government must deal with this problem before 
implementing this bill.
<P>
	It is also important to question the motives behind the 
government's decision to merge the two departments in 
question, namely National Revenue and Customs and Excise. 
Why does the government now find it necessary to consolidate 
these two administrative entities? The answer to this question 
was given to us in this House on February 4 by the hon. member 
for Essex-Windsor, who is also Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Revenue, who said unusual things for a member of 
the government now in office.
<P>
	She said: ``This bill would enable the Minister of National 
Revenue to consolidate two distinct departments that have been 
under his responsibility since 1926 into one''-which was 
confirmed by the hon. member for Vancouver South a few 
moments ago-``and thus eliminate unnecessary duplication 
and overlap within government. It will also bring distinct 
benefits to taxpayers and it will enhance the Department of 
National Revenue's ability to provide more efficient and 
effective services and programs''.
<P>
	I recognized in this short quote several terms and expressions 
often used by members of the Official Opposition in this House. 
When the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National 
Revenue talks about eliminating unnecessary duplication and 
overlap to provide more efficient and effective services and 
programs, I get the impression that her speech was inspired by 
remarks made by members on this side of the House, and 
especially by members of the Official Opposition. In fact the 
comments made by the hon. member for Essex-Windsor seem 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3299"> 3299 </A></B>
<P>
to come straight from the mouth of a member of the Official 
Opposition.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois cannot logically oppose Bill C-2, as it is 
perfectly consistent with the philosophy we are advocating with 
respect not only to administrative management, but also to 
constitutional issues. The fact of the matter is that the bill 
incorporates principles which we hold dear: implementation of 
efficient and effective government programs, and the 
elimination of duplication and overlap; in other words, good 
administrative and political common sense. The problem, for 
the Liberal government, is that it is starting to sound a lot like 
what Quebec is demanding in terms of job training.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Why does the government not apply the same principle of 
sound management when comes the time to negotiate with its 
provincial partners, and Quebec in particular, to reach an 
agreement on manpower training? All the stakeholders-they 
are mentioned day after day in this House and several times each 
day-all those involved, whether federalists or sovereigntists, 
all agree to say that by repatriating all these powers in Quebec, 
hundreds of millions of dollars could be saved in the area of 
manpower, perhaps as much as $300 million a year. Yet, year 
after year, the federal government keeps systematically 
preventing any development. It does not even get along with the 
ultra-federalist, if there ever was one, Liberal government of 
Daniel Johnson.
<P>
	Just last week, the Prime Minister used the word ``whim'' to 
describe Quebec's demands in that area. Why is the Liberal 
government forgetting the virtues and advantages of 
effectiveness and efficiency, in so far as Quebec's demands are 
concerned? How is it that overlap within the Department of 
National Revenue is a more pressing problem to be resolved 
than duplication in the administration of manpower training? 
This is but one example.
<P>
	By tabling Bill C-2 in this House, the present government is 
unwittingly showing the inequities in the federal system and 
laying bare for all to see the problem it is having setting serious, 
credible priorities when it comes to managing its affairs. We 
applaud the federal government-and I want to stress this 
point-for taking the initiative to merge these two departments 
which in any event had been the responsibility of a single 
minister since 1926.
<P>
	What worries me is that if the federal government needed 68 
years to realize the damage created by overlapping authority at 
the Department of National Revenue, how long will Quebecers 
have to wait to see the same results, that is an end to duplication, 
in the area of manpower training?
<P>
	Therefore, the Official Opposition applauds the federal 
government for recognizing the absurdity of administrative 
overlap. If the merger of these two departments indeed results in 
real savings and benefits, and I have no doubt that it will, then 
we urge the government to be innovative and to explore other 
similar initiatives, such as negotiating with the Government of 
Quebec on the issue of manpower training.
<P>
	However, the federal government, in keeping with its 
reputation, apparently feels that the duplication hampering 
Quebec's development is a necessary thing and should be 
stepped up.
<P>
	As we all know, Canada's political history is full of examples 
of federal intrusion in provincial areas of jurisdiction. The 
current Liberal government seems not only intent on staying this 
historical course, but also bent on increasing the number of 
areas in which it feels free to encroach, such as health, 
post-secondary education and, as I mentioned, manpower 
training.
<P>
	Quebec taxpayers will not be satisfied with the simple 
internal merger of the Department of National Revenue. Of 
course they will reap the benefits of this merger and, like the 
Official Opposition, they will applaud the government's action. 
However, the majority of Quebecers are awaiting the day when 
they will be answerable to only one national revenue 
department, namely that of a sovereign Quebec which is master 
of its own economic decisions. Perhaps when that day comes, 
the expressions ``administrative overlap'', ``duplication'' and 
``government inefficiency'' will become obsolete.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, despite some reservations, the Official 
Opposition wishes to express its support for Bill C-2 which calls 
for a merger of the two departments in question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
support Bill C-2 at third reading. I addressed the bill previously 
and have spoken favourably about it.
<P>
	According to the Department of National Revenue, the 
approval of Bill C-2 will ``enable it to be more responsive to 
changing needs, to streamline operations, to reduce the 
administrative burden on taxpayers, to reduce costs and 
duplication and to improve the quality of its services and 
programs''. That is a pretty tall order and we hope it can be 
pulled off.
<P>
	The Reform Party position on an objective like this is very 
much supportive. The steps taken by the Liberal government in 
an attempt to streamline departmental activities is a worthwhile 
effort. Combining immigration and citizenship, customs, excise 
and taxation and eliminating altogether the Department of 
Public Security will help reduce duplication and overlap.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3300"> 3300 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope the current treatment of the overseas tax credit is not an 
example of this new and improved department's modus operandi 
in the future. The overseas tax credit is predicated on the 
assumption that people who work outside the country for 
extended periods ought not to pay full taxes since they do not 
consume their full share of government services.
<P>
	This virtually eliminates tax on 80 per cent of total income for 
workers logging at least six months of the year abroad. I want to 
go into this to show members an example of what this super 
efficiency ought not to do.
<P>
	By regulation, the tax credit cannot be claimed by employees 
of foreign parent companies but for years Revenue Canada 
permitted such workers to claim it anyway. They were taxed at 
the same level as employees of domestic firms working abroad.
<P>
	Last fall, however, during a routine audit of the Calgary arm 
of Texas based Nabors Drilling, tax assessors said they would 
disallow the overseas tax credit not only for 1994, which seems 
legitimate, but retroactively for 1993, 1992 and 1991. The 
decision would nail up to 600 workers with additional tax bills 
of up to $48,000 each. Nabors' lawyers are currently disputing 
Revenue Canada's attempt to disallow the tax credit for the 
earlier two years, and so they should.
<P>
	How can the Minister of National Revenue and the 
Department of National Revenue change the rules four years, 
three years after the fact? Once the department has set a 
precedent-it always deals on precedent-it should stick to it or 
change the law and give people warning so that they know what 
to expect.
<P>
	If U.S. parent companies move their overseas operations 
centres back to the United States, that will kill office jobs in 
Canada and deprive Revenue Canada of far more money than 
allowing the overseas tax credit. It is not efficient. It is not 
effective. It does not serve the purpose for what this 
amalgamation is supposed to do. It gives the impression that we 
are creating a tax collection police force that is going to squeeze 
every penny, every dollar it can out of honest working Canadian 
companies and individuals. The Minister of National Revenue 
refused to be interviewed on this subject, so I plan to bring this 
up during question period in the very near future.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	We need increased financial reviews and reforms for all 
government departments to ensure that taxpayers' money is 
being spent efficiently and effectively. The reduction of costs 
associated with departmental consolidation and the removal of a 
few individuals at the executive level are just the tip of the 
iceberg when one considers the amount of government waste 
that has existed over the years.
<P>
	The ivory towers of the Conservative years have to come to an 
end and I hope the government is serious in its attempt to do so. 
The new super deputy minister of National Revenue Taxation, 
Customs and Excise through  this amalgamation told us in the 
Standing Committee on Finance that he will save money. But I 
have a concern. He also told us that the department employs 
44,000 people at a cost of $2.2 billion. When asked what the 
short term savings of this bill are, meaning within the next 12 
months, his answer after much fumbling was $36 million.
<P>
	He then pointed out in another part of the bill that through 
amalgamation and the changes that had to take place due to the 
smuggling problem that existed three or four months ago, the 
department would be spending more money on customs 
officials, et cetera, and there would be $50 million of new 
spending. The net saving is not a saving. It is a $16 million 
increase to the already high $2.2 billion cost of running the 
department. Let us hope that is not something of which he is 
proud.
<P>
	Thirty-six million dollars is a lot of money and a savings of 
that amount is very much appreciated. It would do well in a lot of 
our pocketbooks and the pocketbooks of the taxpayers. It is very 
important that those people should have that money back.
<P>
	If that is all the deputy minister is promising to save out of 
$2.2 billion, at the end of the current fiscal year I would hope the 
Minister of National Revenue would look for a replacement. 
There has to be a better objective than that. If that is all he can 
save he is unfit for the job.
<P>
	Our party would encourage the minister and the government 
to initiate a line by line, item by item review of all departments 
to find out where the money is going. If we took the time to find 
the savings in the estimates, through the estimates of every 
committee and if the backbenchers of the government were 
allowed to point out where those savings are and if the cabinet 
had the courage and the confidence in its backbenchers to listen 
to their input, it would find a lot of further savings. If all the 
millions of dollars that the Prime Minister is talking about in 
savings and cuts are added together, it will come to the billions 
that the finance minister is talking about in cuts and savings. 
Therefore the two stories would go together and we could 
restore some confidence in the economy and in the government 
itself. It would then be speaking from the same song book 
whether it is old or new.
<P>
	We have some concerns about Bill C-2. Although we support 
it, it is feared that the combination of Revenue Canada Taxation 
and Customs Canada is designed to place more of an emphasis 
on revenue collection, controlling the underground economy 
and smuggling rather than designed to save overhead and this 
ivory tower bureaucratic structure we talked about earlier.
<P>
	Customs officials must not be hindered in any way by 
legislation from performing the important duty of protecting 
Canadians from illegal drugs, weapons and criminal elements 
by reducing their ranks. By making administrative cuts at the 
top, the minister must not reduce the number of customs 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3301"> 3301 </A></B>
<P>
personnel in the field which would hinder their ability to 
function effectively.
<P>
	Other concerns have also been raised by the customs union, 
several municipalities and the media-I am sure the media is 
doing it on behalf of the Canadian public-with the 
consolidation of the two departments, customs officers' 
resources to effectively defend the border will be strained. The 
customs union is under the impression that increased emphasis 
on these activities will lead to a reduction in resources for other 
activities such as controlling illegal immigrants, firearms, 
pornography and stopping child abduction.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of National Revenue has said-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Just a 
clarification, there has been discussion and there is agreement 
that we should pass this bill before we move to Private 
Members' Hour. I do not know how long the member has left but 
if the House agrees not to see the clock so he can finish his 
speech, then you could put the question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In fairness to all members, the member 
has not had long. We should go to private member's in five 
minutes. Is there unanimous agreement not to see the clock so 
that we might pass this bill?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have good news for the government 
Whip. I will be under that time limit so we will watch the clock 
closely and make sure we follow the schedule as pre-arranged 
by the three party whips. I am sorry, we have a party 
co-ordinator.
<P>
	The Minister of National Revenue has said in relation to Bill 
C-2: ``I believe a unified Department of National Revenue will 
build on the strength of our existing customs, excise and 
taxation administrations. It will better serve Canadians and 
strengthen their confidence in Canada's revenue 
administration''.
<P>
	I hope so, but I hope my example about the overseas tax credit 
is taken to heart and taken seriously because that is not the way 
to treat Canadian corporations or individual taxpayers.
<P>
	In conclusion, we believe that improved efficiency and 
effectiveness can result from this bill provided that 
reorganization and government cost savings will be done with 
the security and the best interests of Canadians in mind, versus 
empire building within the bureaucracy or a heavy handed tax 
police force auditing and demanding tax dollars in a totalitarian 
fashion.
<P>
	We support the bill but we will be watching and I will be 
watching as it is my duty to monitor the actions of this particular 
bill and the effect that it has on government over the next year. 
The Minister of National Revenue promises lower costs. The 
new super deputy minister of this cabinet minister in the 
Standing Committee on Finance promised lower costs. 
Therefore we will expect substantial lower costs.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt 
the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the third time and passed.)
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.35 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to consideration of Private Members' Business as listed 
on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West)</B> moved that Bill 
C-206, an act to provide for the relocation and protection of 
witnesses, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking my seconder for 
seconding the bill. In the 20 minutes that I have allotted to me 
under Private Members' Business I would like to deal with six 
specifics of my bill, an act to provide for the relocation and 
protection of witnesses in Canada.
<P>
	The first point I would like to deal with is the genesis of my 
interest in the subject.
<P>
	In the previous Parliament I was the Official Opposition critic 
for the Solicitor General. In that capacity I was approached by 
someone who had difficulty with the existing witness relocation 
protection program run by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 
I, like many Canadians, had assumed that such a witness 
relocation program was a national program with rules and 
regulations pursuant and subject to the laws of Canada. I was 
shocked to find out that is not the case. In my capacity as the 
Official Opposition critic I began to investigate to see what I 
could find out about witness protection in Canada.
<P>
	It came to my attention that we in this country do not have a 
national witness protection program which would cover 
potentially all witnesses to serious crimes in Canada. What we 
have is ad hoc witness protection programs across the nation 
with various police forces.
<P>
	We know, for example, that there is an ultra secret witness 
protection program for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. We 
know that there is a witness protection program of some nature 
run by the Ontario Provincial Police. There may be one for the 
Quebec provincial police. We know that some but not all 
municipal police forces such as the metropolitan Toronto police 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3302"> 3302 </A></B>
<P>
force and the Calgary police force have witness protection 
programs.
<P>
	What is the common characteristic of these various witness 
protection programs? I think there are really a couple. First, 
there is really no legislative provision for any of them. There is 
no accountability to the public for any of them and they are all 
shrouded in complete secrecy. When I attempted to find out 
about these witness protection programs I found that this cloud 
of secrecy descended and became a fog of secrecy and we simply 
were not able to find out any information.
<P>
	This would come as a surprise to Canadians, to potential 
victims of crime, to witnesses to crime and to the taxpayers of 
Canada.
<P>
	That is what got me interested. Am I alone in thinking this 
way? Am I alone in feeling that there is a need for a national 
witness protection program? Of course I would suggest not. In 
fact I have presented in the last year or so numerous petitions 
with thousands of constituents and Canadians across the country 
asking that there be a national witness protection program 
enacted.
<P>
	In response to one of those petitions the Solicitor General of 
the day, the Hon. Doug Lewis, said: ``Witness protection is 
indeed a very important function of law enforcement and 
equally a crucial service to witnesses who are at risk of 
retribution as a result of giving testimony in court. It is accurate 
to say that presently there is not a national legislated program as 
exists in the United States, for example. My officials are 
currently examining the state of witness protection in Canada''. 
This was March 16, 1993. Over a year ago the officials were 
examining the situation.
<P>
	That was a different government at a different time. 
Thankfully I note that the current Solicitor General of Canada, 
when he appeared before the justice and legal affairs committee 
on April 13, 1994, had this to say about the subject: ``An 
effective witness protection program is critical to the successful 
prosecution of serious drug and organized crime cases''. He has 
also undertaken to report back.
<P>
	The problem is that there have been studies and studies going 
on and we do not seem to be getting anywhere. Therefore, I 
brought forward my private member's bill. Is there some 
experience in some other jurisdiction that might help us? Indeed 
there is. In the United States, for example, a national witness 
protection program has been in existence since 1970. We can at 
least look at that to see whether it has served a useful purpose.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	That particular program was enshrined in the 1970 omnibus 
crime control act and is currently in force in all 50 states.
<P>
	Bill Dempsey of the U.S. marshall service in Washington 
said: ``It is the most successful tool that U.S. attorneys have in 
their daily work''. It merely buttresses what our own Solicitor 
General has so eloquently said before the committee.
<P>
	Are Canadians, those who are at least aware that we do not 
have any rules and regulations pertaining to the protection of 
witnesses, behind this program?
<P>
	I received a letter from ``Canadians Taking Action Against 
Violence''. The founder and president is Deborah Mahaffy. Her 
daughter was violently murdered and the alleged perpetrator is 
currently before the courts.
<P>
	I think it expresses a lot of the intention I have in bringing this 
bill forward: ``Dear Mr. Wappel, I am writing to commend your 
action and offer our support of Bill C-206, a national witness 
act. As we in Canada are guided by a national criminal code it is 
logical and economically apparent that we should also have a 
national witness protection act.
<P>
	It is also very clear that there are a great number of people 
who have not been afforded proper protection for their valuable 
testimony in our criminal courts of law across the country. 
Unfortunately witnesses have found themselves victims, always 
looking over their shoulders for fear of reprisals from those they 
helped convict or someone associated with them.
<P>
	Agreements between witnesses to crimes and police should 
not be left to chance. Written contracts would provide effective 
protection rather than add further insult to injury. We are paying 
far too great a price when witnesses and informants do not come 
forward as they fear exposing personal safety or that of their 
families.
<P>
	When the general public becomes aware that Canada has an 
effective and efficient national witness and police informant 
program which would be accountable to the House of Commons 
with respect to budgeting concerns, only then will we see the 
desired reductions in delayed investigations and unsolved 
crimes.
<P>
	My husband and I continue to support a national witness act, 
and in the memory of our daughter, murder victim Leslie 
Mahaffy, and all victims of violence in Canada. All families of 
victims of violence in crime need to see that justice is served in 
an expeditious manner based on accurate and forthcoming 
testimony and to achieve that it is imperative that Bill C-206 is 
votable'', which thankfully it is, ``and that it becomes the 
legislative framework of one national witness act which will aid 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3303"> 3303 </A></B>
<P>
in the prosecution of violent crime and show that our 
government is willing to make public safety a priority''.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association as well as Victims of 
Violence of Canada is also supportive of this particular bill and 
the principle behind it which is the protection of witnesses.
<P>
	There are approximately 1,400 unsolved murders in this 
country, some of them clearly because witnesses are afraid to 
come forward for fear of reprisal.
<P>
	What is the subject matter of this bill? It is a relatively short 
bill. I would like to discuss briefly some of its provisions and 
then talk about what would happen if this House were to give its 
agreement to this bill.
<P>
	The underlying philosophy is in section 3. The minister may, 
where the minister considers it appropriate in the interests of 
justice, take action to relocate and protect the witness or any 
member of their family where the minister believes that there is 
a substantial risk of violence being directed toward that person 
in an attempt to interfere with the course of justice.
<P>
	Is that somehow different than what we have now? Of course 
not. Any of these police forces using their current witness 
protection programs can do precisely what I have put into this 
bill. The difference is that they do it without legislative 
authority and without a minister responsible to this House and 
the Canadian people to answer for situations in which either a 
witness has been refused or a mistake has been made. There is 
nothing new except it is actually in an act giving the minister 
some direction.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The minister must consider certain factors. One is to 
determine whether there is any other alternative to providing 
relocation and protection. It is not mandatory. Every person who 
is going to be seeking relocation is not going to get it. It will 
depend on the minister's judgment whether the interests of 
justice and the safety of the witness are dealt with and that there 
is no other reasonable alternative.
<P>
	One of the important features is in clause 5 because if the 
minister feels that it is necessary to relocate it may also be 
necessary to give a new identity. The bill provides that the 
minister would have the power to provide suitable documents to 
assist the person in establishing a new identity or to otherwise 
assist in protecting the person. This would mean a new name, a 
new social insurance number, new documents of all kinds.
<P>
	It is my understanding, and I may be wrong, that the RCMP 
currently does this. They currently provide in certain 
circumstances a new name, new passport, new documents. 
Under what legal authority? There is no legal authority yet they 
are doing it.
<P>
	However if someone happens to be a witness to a crime that 
the RCMP is not investigating, if it happens to be a municipal 
police force or if it happens to be a province, the province has no 
power to provide a new identity. Arguably the RCMP has no 
power, but at least they are doing it because they are a federal 
agency.  Certainly there should be even treatment of all 
witnesses across Canada, just as there is even treatment of all 
people who are accused of a crime across Canada.
<P>
	Another aspect of the bill I would like to highlight for the 
House concerns the responsibilities of the parties. I have set out 
in clause 7 that there must be a written memorandum of 
understanding. The memorandum of understanding would set 
out the rights and obligations of the parties. The federal 
government is currently being sued by a number of people who 
are in the witness protection program. Disputes arise as to 
whether or not the RCMP agreed to something or did not comply 
with some promise that was made. Why? The answer is because 
often there is no document to which to refer and to see whether 
or not the parties met their obligations.
<P>
	I have set out there should be a memorandum of 
understanding and of course, because of confidentiality and 
protection, there should be a mechanism short of a court of law, 
short of requiring a witness to go public, if you will when they 
are trying to hide from criminal retribution, a method whereby 
those breaches or alleged breaches could be dealt with in a 
private way.
<P>
	To protect the minister, to protect society I have provided that 
no decision made by the minister would be subject to review in 
any court in Canada. This would prevent all sorts of frivolous 
lawsuits by people who feel they were unfairly denied an 
opportunity. However it would not allow the minister to escape 
responsibility from certain decisions that were made and from 
questioning about those decisions in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Finally, we have no idea how much money is currently spent 
on witness protection. We do know that money is spent, but there 
is no way of finding out how much. There is no way of 
budgeting. There is no way of suggesting that there should be 
another allocation. My bill provides that no payments shall be 
made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to defray the 
expenses necessary for the implementation of this bill without 
the authority of an appropriation made by Parliament for such 
purpose.
<P>
	We need a witness protection act. Everybody seems to be in 
agreement. This provides some legislative framework for it. It 
provides some legal authority for the act to proceed and it 
provides also an opportunity for the aggrieved witness or the 
aggrieved crown to deal with problems of interpretation.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	In drafting the bill I tried my best, but by no means do I 
pretend that it is absolutely perfect. I know that the minister has 
a department and I know the justice minister has a department 
that spend its days looking at legislation. I am not adverse to 
amendments to the bill. I am not adverse to any suggestions that 
would keep the spirit and the intent but make the bill better. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3304"> 3304 </A></B>
<P>
have no desire to pretend that the bill as drafted is necessarily  
perfect, although I would like to think that it is pretty good.
<P>
	However, it is important to realize that what I am asking, and 
those people who have petitioned the House over a course of 16 
months or so are asking, is that we accept the principle of 
witness protection and relocation across Canada so that all 
people are treated the same way under law pursuant to 
legislation.
<P>
	If the House is favourable to voting in favour of the bill, it 
would then be referred to the justice and legal affairs committee 
for intensive study. At that time the department, witnesses, 
everybody could come forward and put suggested amendments. 
The committee could deal with the bill on a clause by clause 
basis, accept those amendments which are thought appropriate 
and needed and then refer the bill back to the House for final 
passage.
<P>
	What I am saying is very simple, an affirmative vote would 
not mean that the bill is cast in stone. It would mean that the 
principle, which is the protection of witnesses, would be 
espoused by the House. The fine tuning, the drafting, the repair, 
if any is needed to some of the drafting that was done by me and 
by the counsel who help us in doing these things, would then be 
done at the committee level.
<P>
	In a nutshell then, I ask the House to very seriously consider 
this bill over the course of the time that it has to debate it, to look 
at the principle, look at the forest not the trees, examine the 
principle and remember that currently it has no legislative 
foundation. We are operating in a vacuum. We are operating 
under a cloud of secrecy We are operating under a system that is 
not fair because it does not apply equally to all people across 
Canada and is not accountable to the House of Commons.
<P>
	I would ask my colleagues to vote in favour of Bill C-206 at 
the appropriate time so we could take the matter to committee, 
get it addressed and protect witnesses as soon as possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity today to speak to Bill 
C-206, an act to provide for the relocation and protection of 
witnesses, standing in the name of the hon. member for 
Scarborough West. I would like to comment first on the 
principle of the bill and then on its substance or content.
<P>
	As far as the principle is concerned, I am glad to see that some 
government members think about the issues. We have at least 
one member who just showed us he had examined a situation 
that was deplorable and who has now introduced a bill on his 
own initiative, and he is to be commended for that. I agree it is 
intolerable that today we have no legislation to protect these 
people. Canada is a society that provides a lot of protection for 
the rights of offenders and the rights of defendants, but very 
little for  the rights of people who go to court to testify so that the 
accused will answer for the crime they committed.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Yes, we have the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I 
checked the Charter, because I thought there might be something 
in it to provide for this. The only section is section 7, which 
says: ``Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the 
person-'' Other than that, there is nothing in the Criminal Code 
or any other item of criminal or penal legislation that deals 
directly with the subject the member has approached through his 
private members' bill.
<P>
	Today, there are certain ways, and certain funds are used, to 
protect these witnesses, but that is not enough, and the trouble is 
that it is at the discretion of the police. I think that a program of 
this kind, when we are talking about taxpayers' money, should 
be organized so that everyone is treated equally, and I think this 
bill takes that approach.
<P>
	On what basis do people make a decision, when we say these 
decisions are discretionary? How do they decide whether or not 
funds will be allocated in a given case? Does it depend on 
whether one criminal is more dangerous than another criminal? 
Does it depend on the fact that some crimes are more repugnant 
than others? I think it is intolerable to talk about 
``discretionary'' in this respect.
<P>
	The police force that makes the assessment can also make a 
wrong decision without being made to account for that decision. 
Sometimes these mistakes are covered up. It is very difficult, 
and I will give you an example of what I mean.
<P>
	Since being appointed Official Opposition critic for the 
Solicitor General of Canada on October 25, I have had two cases 
that fit in very well with the bill of the hon. member for 
Scarborough. I will ask this House a question.
<P>
	What do Lucie Leblanc from New Brunswick, Sue Smith from 
Alberta and Mireille Martin from Quebec have in common? 
What they have in common is that they are the same person. In 
five years this person changed names three times. I am giving 
them because the last time she called me, she told me she would 
be changing her name for the fourth time since her husband, a 
criminal famous across Canada, had discovered her new 
identity. How did he do it? The people dealing with her case had 
made every conceivable change to her passport, driver's licence, 
social insurance number and other pieces of ID but made a 
mistake in registering the car she was provided with under the 
name of Mireille Martin from Quebec. She had been living in 
fear for a few months, not knowing exactly where to go, how to 
proceed, or where to find money. She asked me to approach the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3305"> 3305 </A></B>
<P>
Solicitor General of Canada to have her case dealt with 
expeditiously because she was living in a terrible situation.
<P>
	I too came up against a brick wall. I could not get information 
or find anyone accountable in this case. However, she told me 
herself that after a few calls her case was finally dealt with, but 
only after a member of Parliament intervened.
<P>
	If the mistake is very serious, the person who did not enforce 
the law properly, who made the mistake, should be held 
accountable and asked where the money went to.
<P>
	I am not saying the mistake was intentional; honest mistakes 
can be made but they can have serious consequences for the 
individuals who are given money to protect them from potential 
harm.
<P>
	With all due respect to the hon. member, it is not a matter of 
reinventing the wheel. I think this is a good bill but, as he said, 
we must look at what is done elsewhere. There is a similar 
program in the United States. I also looked at Italy where, given 
what is happening with justice in that country, legislation was 
passed to protect witnesses. Great Britain also has a similar 
program.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	This means that all great societies concerned with the 
protection of victims and offenders, whether accused or 
charged, are also concerned with the protection of witnesses, 
because I think it is all tied together in the system.
<P>
	This kind of bill, if passed-I will address contents 
later-will send a clear message to the criminal element as well 
as to witnesses and the public, the message that this House takes 
this matter seriously, that we will not let the people who testify 
in court down.
<P>
	I think that any legislation that supports, not informers 
because I do not like that word, but let us say witnesses who 
come forward, is good for the system we live in. If we encourage 
people to come forward and testify, I think that it will show in 
rulings, sentencing and the entire system. I think the judicial 
system stands to benefit greatly.
<P>
	In my legal practice, I have noticed that it is one thing for a 
witness to testify, but quite another to give convincing evidence. 
I may comply when served a subpoena, yet be extremely 
reluctant to answer questions, knowing that my life could be in 
danger as soon as I step out of the court. Perhaps I would feel 
safer and my evidence would be more convincing if I knew that, 
when I walk out of court, there will be people there to protect 
me.
<P>
	I am not saying that such a measure should be applied in all 
criminal courts. The mere fact of witnessing a murder near my 
home does not automatically endanger my life. However, my 
life could be in danger if I testified in a case involving organized 
crime or a major case of fraud. I think that work could be done 
on this bill to amend it so that it could become very useful to 
Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	I knew from Quebec statistics that many crimes went 
unpunished because no one was actually found guilty. I was 
surprised to see Canadian statistics for the period 1980-1992. 
Over this 12-year period, for murders alone, there were 1,455 
unsolved murder cases. One can wonder how many cases of 
fraud, robbery, assault and well-planned crimes also went 
unsolved. We could then ask ourselves the same question about 
smuggling. I think that it is a very important subject and that this 
deficiency must be corrected as soon as possible.
<P>
	So I think that this bill could encourage witnesses to come 
forward and say what they know in order to clear up some crimes 
and some cases for which the criminals go unpunished.
<P>
	As for the principle, there is no problem, we agree 100 per 
cent. The Official Opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, will support 
you on this bill. I think that we have always shown that we 
co-operate when presented with a good bill, and I think that is a 
way to show it to you again and to tell you again that we will 
co-operate with you on this bill.
<P>
	I do not have much to say about the form and content. Of 
course, some small adjustments could be made, including the 
following. I would immediately take the matter to the Solicitor 
General. I would say that he is responsible for applying this bill 
once it is adopted, not a member of the Privy Council. In the 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, among colleagues and 
people working on that committee, we will easily be able to 
come to an understanding; I say ``easily'' because everyone 
around the table will be on the same wavelength, so we will be 
able to agree.
<P>
	But on the whole-and I conclude with that-regarding this 
bill, I would ask the whole House to be unanimous and I would 
ask the government to pay very careful attention to this private 
member's bill, and perhaps we will have something to show that 
private members' bills can go somewhere, for the good of 
society in general that will benefit from it.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I consider it both 
an honour and a privilege to rise today to open debate on Bill 
C-206, an Act to provide for the relocation and protection of 
witnesses.
<P>
	I would first like to commend the Member for Scarborough 
West, the sponsor of this private member's bill, for bringing this 
important issue before the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3306"> 3306 </A></B>
<P>
	His months of dedication and hard work to improve this 
particular aspect of our criminal justice system are reflected in 
the pages of this bill. The basic intent of Bill C-206 is very 
clear: The government must ensure the safety and security of 
persons who assist police and prosecutors in their efforts to 
crack down on crime, particularly organized crime.
<P>
	This makes sense not only from a moral standpoint but from a 
practical standpoint as well. Past experience shows that 
witnesses who provide evidence or assist in police and 
prosecutors' investigations at the risk of harm to themselves or 
to their families, are often one of the most effective tools our 
justice system has against organized crime.
<P>
	And we need that tool, today more than ever. Organized 
crime, and especially transnational and international organized 
crime, are growing concerns for Canada, and indeed for many 
nations.
<P>
	Organized crime threatens basic social, political and 
economic institutions in countries around the world. And it is 
seldom easy, given the power and influence of many criminal 
organizations, for the authorities to obtain the information and 
assistance they need to move effectively against organized 
crime.
<P>
	That is why we, as legislators, must take every step within our 
power to ensure our criminal justice system is as well-equipped 
as possible to respond to the threat posed by organized crime. 
For these reasons alone, I believe that this bill is both timely and 
well directed. However, having said that, I believe there are a 
number of fundamental issues that need to be considered before 
approval of the bill is given at second reading.
<P>
	First, we must consider very carefully the scope of 
application of a protection program. Under Bill C-206, any 
witness appearing in a case prosecuted under a federal act could 
be eligible for protection or relocation.
<P>
	My concern is that this broad, umbrella approach could be 
unwieldy and difficult to administer efficiently. Our experience 
regarding the RCMP Source and Witness Protection Program 
indicates that such a program should focus on very serious 
offences and cases involving organized crime.
<P>
	A related issue here is the question of cost. The provision of 
protective services and relocation of witnesses or sources is a 
very expensive proposition.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has said to this House and to Canadians on 
many occasions that fiscal responsibility is one of the basic 
principles of this government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Accordingly we want to make sure that any witness protection 
program is not so broad that administrative overheads become 
unacceptable. All members will agree I am sure that we owe it to 
Canadians to make the best possible use of taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	Still on the subject of administration there is the question of 
who will manage and administer the program. It would appear 
that Bill C-206 seeks to provide a legislative base to the witness 
protection services provided by the RCMP. However it may be 
desirable to review other administrative options.
<P>
	For instance in the United States an independent body, the 
Office of Enforcement Operations within the Department of 
Justice, decides who will be accepted into the U.S. marshal's 
service witness security program. The decision is made after 
this office has considered the recommendations for admission 
from the responsible enforcement agencies such as the FBI and 
the U.S. attorney's office.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	The point I wish to make is that in the United States it is not 
the law enforcement body that makes the decision whether or 
not to give witness protection.
<P>
	As well, once the witness is accepted into the program the 
protection is administered by the U.S. marshal's service. Again 
it is not the originating law enforcement agency that provides 
the protection but an independent agency, the U.S. marshal's 
service.
<P>
	I raise these administrative issues as points that warrant 
further consideration and review before determining and 
legislating our own arrangements for witness protection in this 
country.
<P>
	A second issue we need to carefully consider is the legislative 
basis for a witness protection program. It may be appropriate for 
example to link a program to provisions in the Criminal Code or 
other legislation.
<P>
	Protection of people who assist in criminal investigations or 
prosecutions may involve changes in identity. This requires the 
active participation of federal authorities outside of law 
enforcement agencies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It would seem to me to be appropriate to indicate that the 
responsibilities of these authorities also be captured in any 
legislation. The same rationale applies to the roles and functions 
of provincial authorities involved in the provision of protective 
services. Provincial interests in this area are a very important 
consideration given the constitutional responsibilities of 
provincial government for the administration of justice. At a 
minimum, I believe that legislation should permit provinces to 
opt in to a federal program. All of this is to say that we would 
want to work closely with the provinces in all respects.
<P>
	There is also the question of cost sharing between the federal 
government and provinces desiring to participate jointly in a 
protection program. This could be addressed directly in 
legislation, or perhaps indirectly through the establishment of a 
statutory instrument or specific ministerial approval.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3307"> 3307 </A></B>
<P>
	A last concern I would like to raise deals with the limitation of 
Bill C-206 to witness protection alone. Witnesses are not the 
only persons who provide information to the authorities in 
criminal cases and who may require protection for having done 
so. Many police investigations would never lead to arrests 
without the assistance of sources or informants, most of whom 
are paid for their services. Source information is just as vital to 
police investigations as witness testimony is to court 
proceedings.
<P>
	I note that the RCMP source witness and protection program, 
which I referred to a few moments ago, protects both police 
sources and Crown witnesses.
<P>
	These are the type of factors that must be examined before 
this government can, in good conscience, proceed further with 
legislation for a witness protection program. However, I do not 
want these concerns to overshadow the basic accomplishment of 
this bill. With this proposed act to provide for the relocation and 
protection of witnesses, the hon. member for Scarborough West 
has focussed the attention of this House on an important 
component of our criminal justice system. For that he deserves a 
vote of thanks from all members of the House, and indeed, from 
all Canadians.
<P>
	I understand that other members will now take the 
opportunity to touch, in more depth, on the points I have raised, 
as well as discuss other key considerations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my support for 
Bill C-206. To me it is self-evident that anyone who risks his or 
her personal or family safety to testify for the crown is entitled 
to protection. This is especially true if protection has been 
promised as an inducement to take the stand.
<P>
	In general, formal witness protection and relocations are 
needed for serious prosecutions involving drugs or organized 
crime. The people needing protection are often pretty unsavoury 
folks, criminals motivated by fear, vengeance or greed to turn 
against their fellows and act as police informers. Nevertheless, 
if they help us, for whatever motive, they have the right not to be 
hung out to dry by law enforcement agencies which use them to 
make their case. There must be national, predictable and 
enforceable mechanisms to deal with such people and this is 
what Bill C-206 is all about.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Without informants who can testify without fear, 
investigations and prosecutions of people involved in organized 
crime sometimes lead nowhere. The cost in wasted effort by 
police officers and courts is enormous. It must be incredibly 
frustrating for police to have the goods but be unable to secure a 
conviction because the safety of a witness cannot be guaranteed.
<P>
	The type of protection envisaged through this bill is complex 
and expensive, and it might be required for several years for 
individuals. Nevertheless, if it helps to put dangerous criminals 
out of business it will be a sound public investment. When 
convictions are obtained, society wins.
<P>
	Not all beneficiaries would be paid informants. In Canada the 
most famous protected person, federally protected because of 
his high profile, was Igor Gouzenko. He was given a false 
identity. If my memory serves me correctly he was kept out of 
sight for 40 years. I doubt that many Canadians begrudged him 
his new life.
<P>
	Although I support this bill I do wish that it was a little 
broader in scope with provisions for increased penalties for 
threatening witnesses and with more emphasis on in situ 
protection for those witnesses who are not paid informers and 
who do not want to have their lives disrupted by relocation. I am 
referring to ordinary citizens who just happen to witness a crime 
and who hesitate to get involved because of the possible 
retaliation against them or their families.
<P>
	I most especially wish that this bill would provide better and 
longer term protection for victims who risk being victimized 
again if they agree to testify against a dangerous individual, an 
individual who might very well be out on bail awaiting trial or 
who, if convicted, probably will be paroled after serving a 
fraction of his sentence.
<P>
	Consider this. Women who cause their husbands or lovers to 
be jailed for assault face early confrontation with their 
attackers. Some of them live in fear of the man they sent to 
prison. The released criminals can walk around freely. If they 
are vindictive and vengeful, their victims have to cower at 
home, protected only by court orders which are scraps of paper 
or by anti-stalking laws which are useful only if the abuser tries 
to extract vengeance over an extended period of time.
<P>
	A woman in such a situation cannot even keep a shotgun 
handy to protect herself because in Canada the victim has less 
rights than the brute who might want to kick her door down. She 
can live in fear. She can run. She can hide. That is not fair.
<P>
	In summary, I compliment my colleague on the other side of 
the House for his initiative in this regard. Canada's witness 
protection system is at best patchwork. We need national 
guidelines and criteria so that from coast to coast the same 
protection is available for all Canadians.
<P>
	It is high time that informers are given the guaranteed 
protection warranted for their assistance in bringing offenders 
to justice and this bill is a short step in the right direction. It 
merits our support.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak as well on Bill C-206, an act to 
provide for the relocation and protection of witnesses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3308"> 3308 </A></B>
<P>
	As we have already learned law enforcement agencies provide 
protection to their sources and to witnesses where there is a 
threat of retribution as a result of either the source informing on 
the criminal activity or a witness providing crucial testimony in 
a criminal proceeding. Generally witness protection 
requirements arise out of cases involving the most serious 
charges and by that I mean charges which upon conviction 
attract the heaviest penalties. Probably we are most familiar in 
this area with charges such as trafficking in large quantities of 
drugs, murder, armed robbery, and other conspiratorial crimes 
involving elements of organized crime.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	It is obvious that the more serious the offence and the stiffer 
the penalty upon conviction, the greater risk to an informant or 
witness. As the threat becomes more serious to the witness of 
course, the more comprehensive must be the protection of that 
witness.
<P>
	Witness protection programs are a valuable tool in law 
enforcement and in some areas an invaluable tool. They have 
been developed in varying degrees across the country by 
different police forces and services. The types of services 
available under a witness protection plan also vary according to 
the individual case. They vary as well according to the resources 
that an individual police department may have.
<P>
	Examples of these services which are currently available in 
Canada include psychological counselling, escorts to and from 
the court house or the prosecutor's office, guarding a witness' 
residence at crucial times or on a full time basis if need be 
during a trial, documents in a witness' name, housing upon 
relocating a witness to a new location, transportation of the 
witness' private property to a new home, payment of basic 
living expenses to a witness for a period of time or assistance in 
obtaining employment.
<P>
	In Canada, depending upon the capabilities of the individual 
police force, these services have provided some degree of 
protection to informants and witnesses but again administered 
individually through different police services.
<P>
	Of all of these programs however the most comprehensive is 
the RCMP source witness protection program. It was originally 
established in the early 1980s for the RCMP to use, but now it is 
increasingly used by other police forces and services across the 
country.
<P>
	The need for RCMP assistance would arise primarily when an 
informant or witness must be relocated to another province and 
where that police force needs to obtain some form of federal 
assistance, such as federal documentation in a new name for the 
witness or source. The RCMP has offices in every province and 
every territory. They have an extensive witness protection 
capability. It is easy to see why other agencies seek the 
assistance of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
<P>
	There is no other department and no other agency in Canada 
that can facilitate and co-ordinate the various aspects of 
assistance and protection that are involved in a witness 
protection relocation.
<P>
	These considerations of witness protection are not just going 
on in Canada. In fact, world wide there is a growing interest in 
the criminal justice community in the enhancement of witness 
protection services and the creation of national witness 
protection programs. This is in part most likely a result of the 
global growth in organized criminal activity and increased 
reliance on the use of informants to obtain convictions.
<P>
	Here in Canada we too are examining existing witness 
protection services in light of increased organized crime and 
shrinking law enforcement budgets. To that end in 1992 a survey 
was undertaken of all police forces in Canada. This survey had a 
twofold aim. First, the government wanted to obtain 
information on police witness protection capabilities in general. 
Second, the government wanted to know to what extent 
provincial and municipal police services seek and obtain 
assistance from the mounted police source witness protection 
program.
<P>
	Questionnaires were sent to 393 police services across the 
country and responses were received from 284. Only data for 
three years prior to 1992 was requested.
<P>
	The great majority of police services, in fact 88 per cent of 
them, said that they had not used the RCMP witness protection 
program over the three years preceding the date of the survey. 
They had not done so primarily because they just did not have 
cases in which protection was necessary. This comes as no great 
surprise to the government because most cases involving 
witness protection occur in large urban areas.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	The survey also shows that a very small number of provinces 
either have or are considering developing a standardized 
provincial witness program within their province.
<P>
	We have to bear in mind that regardless of individual 
provincial programs, there will always be a need for an agency 
such as the RCMP to arrange out of province relocations. For 
example, should Nova Scotia wish to relocate a witness to 
British Columbia, it is probable that the provincial program 
would not have the reach and would not be able to provide for 
witnesses' various needs in British Columbia. As it stands, the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police source witness protection 
program can and does accommodate relocated witnesses from 
one end of the country to the other.
<P>
	The survey also revealed that 15 police services can provide 
some degree of witness protection. Again, this protection does 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3309"> 3309 </A></B>
<P>
not include out of province relocation and is limited according 
to the availability of personnel and other resources.
<P>
	Twenty-three police forces indicated that they had used the 
RCMP program in the past three years, primarily to facilitate 
name change and relocation. Of these, over 50 per cent were 
satisfied with existing witness protection arrangements 
including their own arrangements and those within the RCMP 
program.
<P>
	The greatest concern of those expressing dissatisfaction with 
existing witness protection arrangements was lack of resources, 
in particular personnel. Another concern was the need for 
standardized witness protection procedures that are clearly 
understood by all local police services.
<P>
	Finally, the survey pointed out that mainly due to a lack of 
resources, witness protection is not equally available to all 
police services.
<P>
	Based on this preliminary survey it is clear that an effective 
witness protection program is a crucial part of the law 
enforcement community's response to growing incidents of 
organized crime and other types of serious crime. Further, this is 
a matter that requires close attention to the various needs of the 
general police community who are the potential users of this 
service and we have to pay special attention to their financial 
capabilities.
<P>
	I believe that particularly in these times there is a requirement 
on the part of the government to further only the most 
cost-efficient and effective programs in co-operation with all 
the relevant players. I would submit that there is yet some work 
to be done before the government proceeds with legislation on 
this issue. I am thinking here of further consultations with the 
relevant players to define the parameters of an effective witness 
protection program.
<P>
	Once these issues have been explored and decided on, the 
government will be in a much better position to bring forward 
legislation on witness protection services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on this particular issue and I 
am thankful to my colleague for having drafted this bill. I hope it 
succeeds.
<P>
	Many areas of Canada's justice system need to be revamped. I 
believe here too regarding witnesses there is a need to 
restructure some of the existing programs. I believe a bill of this 
nature would certainly help do that.
<P>
	As a former police officer who served for 22 years, I have seen 
more than my fair share of trials and certainly my share of 
witnesses. Unfortunately I have run into some situations where 
the safety of witnesses and informants and potential witnesses 
has been threatened, compromised by organized and ruthless 
thugs who know very well how to exploit fear to their advantage.
<P>
	As a result of this experience I support this bill. I am confident 
that witness protection will be improved by uniformity of 
practice across the country. I hope in the future that my 
colleague and I will be able to work together to write more 
legislation that will help make Canada a much safer place.
<P>
	I am quite frankly getting a little more discouraged at the fact 
that it is taking private members' bills as opposed to unified 
government action to cause changes to be made in the criminal 
justice system. Too often it is a private member along with our 
party, the Reform Party, that is interested in protecting the 
victims, the defence of witnesses and informants, the 
preservation of our peaceful way of life and swift justice for 
those who deserve it.
<P>
	The last time I rose to speak to a bill dealing with a justice 
issue was on Bill C-8. It is a bill that will have the probable 
effect of taking power away from police officers. This 
government promises to regulate guns to such a degree that even 
lawful ownership by responsible people will be threatened.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The justice minister intends to regulate special rights for 
homosexuals. The chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs wants to get soft on murderers. There 
you have it: Disarm the people; take power away from the 
police; disrupt the family by giving all the privileges that are 
now accorded to married couples to homosexuals; and tap 
murderers on the wrist. If that is not a recipe for disaster, I do not 
know what is.
<P>
	This government wants to make us totally incapable of self 
defence. It wants to limit the power of our police officers to 
defend us. It wants to contribute to the raising of a generation of 
dysfunctional youth by undermining the best system of justice 
preservation any society can have, the family.
<P>
	It is no wonder we need witness protection legislation. The 
need for witness protection legislation begs the addressing of 
another issue. That is tough anti-gang and tough anti-organized 
crime legislation. As yet, and it is no real surprise, I have not 
seen any sign this government will be addressing those issues 
either.
<P>
	One of the main threats to witnesses comes from gangs and 
organized crime. Fortunately this country has not been ravaged 
by gangs and crime rings to the degree our neighbour to the 
south has. However, with time and a vacuum of political will to 
get tough on crime, gangs will very well extract the same sort of 
toll on us as they have for years on the United States.
<P>
	Incidents of witnesses who have been harassed either by an 
accused or by friends or family of an accused are not that 
frequent. Far more common is the terrorism people who come 
forward either as citizens or as repentant members of crime 
rings have to face before, during and after trial. This bill will 
help to make it easier to protect threatened witnesses.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3310"> 3310 </A></B>
<P>
	There is so much more that could be and should be done. For 
instance we should be legislating harsher penalties for people 
who commit crimes as part of an organized crime ring. We 
should be cracking down on gangs before they get into our 
communities. We should be proactive in these areas.
<P>
	While the legislation we are discussing today is a good piece 
of work, it is nonetheless a reaction to the symptom of a problem 
and not to the disease.
<P>
	There is a disease in Canada. That disease is a growing lack of 
regard for the law and for public order. That disease has been 
allowed to spread and to contaminate more and more segments 
of our society. There are reasons for increased crime. There are 
reasons for a disregard of the law.
<P>
	Canada has gone soft on crime. We are no longer doling out 
justice where it is deserved. We have become a nation of people 
claiming victim status. There has to come with that a subsequent 
decline of individual responsibility.
<P>
	This government has been an accomplice in spreading the 
myth that somehow poverty or discrimination causes crime, that 
if Statistics Canada raises its arbitrary poverty rate then we will 
suddenly see a corresponding increase in the crime rate. That is 
nonsense.
<P>
	Canada has become a nation committed to protected symbolic 
rights, arbitrary rights instead of basic common sense rights that 
everyone can relate to. Rather than protecting a person's right to 
have an income, a family, and a community that is unfettered by 
government taxation and regulation, we are protecting the rights 
of those who least deserve them.
<P>
	We are attacking the family. We are burdening it with taxes so 
that parents cannot take care of their own. We are regulating how 
a family can raise its children. We are attacking its very 
definition by enlarging it so much that the word family becomes 
meaningless.
<P>
	These things are leading to an increase in crime, an increase in 
lawlessness and a decline in the morality that has built this 
nation and has kept it so relatively free from crime over the 
generations.
<P>
	It is tragic how we have mixed up our priorities. I think it is 
very tragic.
<P>
	This government has a great opportunity to reverse the trend. 
Instead, the rhetoric of the government indicates that more of 
the same is coming. We can safely predict that rather than 
cutting crime and making Canada a safer place to live, the 
government's misguided and out of touch stand on justice issues 
will lead Canada further and further down the path of becoming 
the sort of society that none of us will want our children to live 
in.
<P>
	It is a shame that only private members are producing 
legislation that makes sense. It is a shame that new and better 
witness protection legislation is necessary. The fact that my hon. 
colleague has felt the need to write this bill is a subtle sign of 
what is going wrong with Canada and our system. I only hope 
that his colleagues on the other side of the House will have the 
perceptiveness to pick up on this issue, listen to the common 
sense of the common people and take the correct steps to put 
Canada back on the right track.
<P>
	I urge the support of the House for this bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the matter goes to the bottom of 
the list for two more hours of debate.
<P>
	It being 6.35 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.35 p.m.)
