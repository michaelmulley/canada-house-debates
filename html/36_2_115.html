<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is ready to rule on the 
point of order raised on June 5, 2000 by the hon. opposition 
House leader concerning Bill C-201, formerly known as an act to 
amend the Competition Act (protection of those who purchase 
products from vertically integrated suppliers who compete with 
them at retail) in the name of the hon. member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, which is presently on the order of 
precedence. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, I would like to thank the opposition House 
leader, the leader of the government in the House of Commons and 
the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for their 
contributions in this matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 86(1) allows a private member's bill considered 
in a previous session to be reinstated at the same stage at which 
it stood at the time of prorogation.  At the time of prorogation 
the bill in question, previously Bill C-235, had been reported 
from the Standing Committee on Industry with amendments that 
deleted the title and all the clauses of the bill and it was set 
down for consideration at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge introduced 
his bill on October 14, 1999, pursuant to Standing Order 86(1), 
it was again placed on the order of precedence at the report 
stage with its title and clauses deleted.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of occasions during the present session, the hon. 
member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge has given notice that he could 
not be present in the House to go forward with his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the time it was possible to arrange an exchange of positions 
on the order of precedence with another member.  However, on two 
occasions, on February 15 and on June 2, the House was informed 
that it had not been possible to arrange an exchange of 
positions on the order of precedence for Private Members' 
Business Hour for the following sitting day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, Private Members' Business Hour had to be cancelled 
and the hon. member's bill was dropped to the bottom of the 
order of precedence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 5 the opposition House leader expressed concern about 
the number of times exchanges had been arranged for Bill C-201, 
and the fact that when no exchange of items on the order of 
precedence was possible, Private Members' Business could not take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 7 the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge 
responded to the point of order raised by the opposition House 
leader, and the Speaker undertook to return to the House with a 
ruling, which I am now providing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-201 is once again working its way up the order of 
precedence, while the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge 
seeks a way to restore, through amendments, the effect of Bill 
C-201.  However, the hon. member will agree that the situation is 
unfair to other hon. members who have items in the list outside 
the order of precedence that they consider of equal importance 
but which are unable to advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 94(1)(a) allows the Speaker to ensure the orderly 
conduct of Private Members' Business and, with that in mind, the 
Chair has decided to allow the hon. member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge a further 48 hours to place on the 
notice paper motions in amendment to restore the title and 
clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the expiration of the 48 hours, if no motions in amendment 
are placed on notice, I hereby instruct the clerk to remove Bill 
C-201 from the order of precedence, the order for concurrence at 
report stage to be discharged and the bill withdrawn. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated the other day, I would encourage the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to consider this 
specific issue and to provide the House with some guidance as to 
how it should proceed in the future with similar cases 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair would like to take this opportunity to thank all hon. 
members for their patience in awaiting this decision.

vehicle program and could be deployed when there is a requirement 
for the protection provide by such vehicles. Before any such 
deployment is authorized, very careful consideration is given to 
the situation. Restrictions on the deployment of the program's

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize that the health care 
system in Canada is in crisis, the status quo is not an option, 
and the system that we have today is not sustainable; and, 
accordingly, that this House call upon the government to develop

with the provinces to encourage positive co-operative relations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to have 
moved this motion today.  I intend to try to share some of what 
Canadians have been saying about the health care system and to 
put forward some of the solutions we would like Canadians to look 
at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposed to a two tier, U.S. for profit health care 
system.  Through the course of the day members of my party and I 
will demonstrate exactly what we see as the future for health 
care and the direction it might go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that Canadians are extremely concerned about 
their health care system.  I will quote from some recent articles 
that have appeared in newspapers right across the country.  One 
headline read “Gloom deepens about health care, new polls 
show”.   Some 78% of Canadians think the health care system in 
their province is in crisis and 75% believe the system currently 
is facing a major crisis around funding. So the headlines go: 
“Mediocre health care called brain drain factor”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All kinds of other health care shocks are part of the system. We 
hear about over 1,000 people in Quebec on waiting lists for heart 
surgery. 
Cancer patients are waiting sometimes up to three months before 
they can get any treatment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with the member for Fraser Valley.  I 
will come back after that to carry on with some of the solutions 
I propose for the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with this system?  If we take a broad view we find 
there are many turf wars.  There are turf wars between the 
federal and provincial governments.  Things are happening within 
the system such as the so-called driveby smears that are 
occurring.  There is a $1.8 million ad campaign against the 
Ontario government.  There is a real ongoing battle between the 
federal and the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not care who fixes the health system.  They want 
Canadians to fix the health care system, both provincially and 
federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have system centred health care.  We are always 
concerned about the system and seldom seem to talk about the 
patient.  We do not talk about what is best for patients, be they 
senior citizens who are having difficulties finding a place to go 
for their declining years or people with impending heart surgery 
to save their lives.  We do not talk about individual people.  We 
always talk about the system and saving the system.  That is 
wrong.  We have to change that focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well we have to take a look at a state run, socialized type 
of system.  Maybe it works in North Korea and in Cuba, but I am 
not sure it works in modern Canada. We also have to look at 
doctor and nurse shortages.  We have to look at all groups that 
are concerned about health care.  We have to end the turf wars. 
We have to get down to a patient centred focus where health care 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to talk about funding.  Obviously we can go back in 
history to the sixties when a 50:50 agreement was made by the 
provinces and the federal government.  The federal government 
obviously has different responsibilities from those of the 
provinces but they agreed to a common funding.  In 1977 it was 
agreed to change the way the funding occurred from strictly 
dollars to a dollar and tax points system.  We could go into 
great depth and detail about how it works, but I do not think 
that is the point of today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the government again changed the system and the method 
of funding to the CHST grants involving a block of money. We 
really lost control of what was happening and how the system was 
being monitored.  The auditing of the system is just not there. 
This block of money is transferred.  We do not know how provinces 
are using it or what they are using it for.  No one seems to know 
what anything costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should address the fact that in 1993 the amount of money 
being transferred by the federal government was $18.8 billion. By 
1998 it had declined to $12.5 billion or close to a 40% cut in 
funding by the federal government.  Since then it has increased 
to $14.5 billion this year and $15.5 billion next year.  If we 
add each year's cut in funding from the 1993 levels, the bottom 
line is that today's total would be a cut of about $24 billion in 
federal funding.  That is the point that the Ontario government 
is trying to make to the health minister and which the health 
minister seems to fail to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we enter into a kind of shell game with the Prime 
Minister saying that he is transferring more money than ever 
before.  Even in Las Vegas this sort of shell game would not be 
accepted by the players in that city. 
What is happening with the funding?  The federal government has 
definitely cut the funding and the provinces are saying it must 
at least return it to 1993 levels.  To this point we have no 
response.  Nothing has happened.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at the rating of our health care system.  We 
need to look at a study done by the OECD on the 29 industrialized 
countries of the world.  We find that we spend somewhere between 
the fourth and fifth most on health care of those industrialized 
countries.  We spend 9.2% to 9.8% of our GDP on health care. 
That is similar to most of those other top industrialized 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that in many other areas we are in the bottom 
third of the rating of those countries in terms of the delivery 
of service.  If we spend the fourth most and we are the 23rd 
best, there is obviously something wrong.  It is not to point 
fingers or to blame anyone; it is a matter of looking at what is 
wrong and why it is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the World Health Organization is coming out with a 
report, which we have seen parts of already.  On June 21 that 
report will be made public.  Again, there will be an evaluation 
of the 181 countries in the World Health Organization. In the 
report, on the area of life expectancy, it indicates that we have 
dropped from second to twelfth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decline of Canada and Canada's health care system is of 
major concern to Canadians.  That is why 78% of Canadians say 
that their health care system is in crisis.  That is why they are 
asking and demanding that Canadian politicians, provincial and 
federal, look at health care, identify what is wrong and fix the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot of talk in the House about how the 
government cares about health care.  However, we really have not 
seen very much.  We pretty much have a white page of solutions 
coming from the government.  It is not a white paper; it is just 
a white blank page as far as the solutions that the government is 
putting forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and talk about education, the brain drain, the 
lack of technology and the huge problems we have.  I had the 
occasion to tour a Swiss hospital recently.  I could not believe 
the difference between the Swiss hospital and some of the 
hospitals I have toured in Canada.  The emergency room crisis, 
the aging population and the rising drug costs are all things 
that Canadians expect us to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tempt you, Mr. Speaker, to be here a little later in 
the day when I will talk about the solutions to health care.  I 
will also tempt the health minister to be here as well to hear 
the proposals from the Canadian Alliance as to what we should do 
with the provinces to fix the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because my time is up, I will turn it over to the House leader 
for the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before we hear from the House leader 
for the official opposition, there are five minutes for questions 
and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member talked about a blank page.  Yesterday, I had an 
opportunity to visit the Canadian Alliance website to look at 
the proposed solutions to the challenges of health care and I 
found that there was a blank white page. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a common discussion going on among all people 
interested in health care in Canada about the need for additional 
injections of money, but also money where it is targeted to areas 
in which there will be meaningful change and improvement in the 
delivery of health care to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take a lot of detail to answer. 
I simply ask the member whether the Alliance believes that the 
government needs to transfer more money to the provinces for 
health care, or whether moneys should be put in with the 
understanding that there be conditions on measurable standards so 
that Canadians fully believe and understand that they are getting 
quality health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I became the 
critic on January 1.  We are in the middle of a leadership race. 
I can assure the House that our web page will be full of health 
care solutions as we proceed in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's question is whether we should put more money 
in.  The point is that we spend about the fourth most of the 
industrialized countries on health care and we are in the bottom 
third in terms of our ratings.  We are 23rd in the area of 
technology and so on.  If we are in the bottom third with the 
fourth best investment, money is obviously not the only answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an answer to return some of the funding to go to the table 
with the provinces so they will negotiate.  We need that money on 
the table, but that is not the key to solving this problem of 
health care.  I think Canadians know that.  I think people in the 
health industry know that.  I think the provincial health 
ministers know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of co-operation with them, and coming to the table 
with an open slate.  That is the point that has to be made and 
that is the point we will continue to make.  We are in the 
process of consulting with Canadians.  We intend to do that 
extensively through the fall.  At that point, if the government 
is not asking the necessary questions of Canadians, we will do 
that for the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for his motion today.  I think 
it is timely and worthy of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned that his party is not in favour of a two 
tier system.  Everyone heard him say that.  My question relates 
to the leadership of his party, the CA, formerly known as the 
Reform Party.  That party has one candidate vying for its 
leadership who actually launched his campaign on the basis of a 
two tier system of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member suggesting that this candidate is out of the 
race and he will not win it?  Where does this fit in?  How can 
the member stand in his place and suggest that his party does not 
stand for that when one of the potential leaders of his party is 
actually campaigning on that very issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is presumptuous of the member to think that his party 
does not stand for that.  The leadership race is not over.  We 
will not know until June 24 who will win the race.  Is he not 
pre-empting his potential leader? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously in a leadership 
race, as he knows and everyone in the House knows, leadership 
candidates can pretty much say what they want.  The point is what 
happens here.  What the party says, what the shadow cabinet looks 
at and what caucus looks at is what is party policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the member that there was a candidate in the race 
for the leadership of his party, Mr. Orchard, who obviously was 
against free trade and against a lot of the things which that 
party introduced and stood for.  I think that says it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we will wait until June 24 to see what the leadership 
stands for. 
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to talk about what 
Canadians have described as their number one concern, both 
federally and provincially.  They have asked their political 
leaders to deal with what they see as the decline of the health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw on the news last night that the premier of Saskatchewan 
has struck a committee and a public inquiry, so to speak, into 
the status of health care in Saskatchewan.  It is indicative of 
what we are going to see increasingly in Canada, which is a 
grasping for new ideas to make sure that the health care system 
that we all depend on will be healthy as we go into this new 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments of the Saskatchewan premier last night on the news 
were interesting.  He was asked “Is this an attempt to pressure 
the federal government to hold a similar type of conference to 
bring people together to discuss new ideas?”  He said “Maybe in 
part”. 
I think he understated the case.  Certainly many provincial 
health ministers have been in contact with us, saying that they 
are very nervous that the federal government has backed away from 
the idea of the need for all first ministers to get together in a 
formal way to discuss this very important issue.  They are acting 
a little like skittish fillies.  They are prancing around. 
Everybody wants to get in on it, but they are not sure exactly 
whether the federal government will provide leadership.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the questions which are discussed and debated today by 
all sides of the House, especially by the health minister, will 
address the big problem.  The philosophical question is where we 
will go with this, which is obviously the big problem for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are only so many ways to fund health care, and it does not 
take long to list them.  There are federal and provincial tax 
dollars involved in the system.  There are plans that help to 
provide and augment those who are fortunate enough to have 
access.  Whether it be an insurance plan, a medical service plan 
or a provincial plan, people need to know what role those 
contributory plans will play in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are private funds, which of course fund a lot of the 
health care system.  Anyone who has paid for their own 
prescriptions, paid fees to a chiropractor or to another health 
care professional for services that are not covered under the 
provincial health care system knows that private money is used 
extensively in the health care system, and that will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government with its tax dollars, the insurance people and 
the people with the private funds have to lock themselves in a 
room and say “When we come out of here we will decide how this 
system will be paid for”.  It has to be paid for, but what will 
be the provincial role and what will be the federal role?  What 
will be the insurance role?  What will we ask insurance programs 
to look after? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one will deny that dental care is health care, yet dental 
care is not covered under most provincial plans.  People need 
private insurance plans.  In other words, it is already 
extensively used.  Now we need to decide, in this new, upcoming, 
expensive 21st century medicare plan, who will pay for what. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also important is the list of procedures that we will continue 
to fund for all Canadians.  It is no secret, as one of the 
architects of health care said on the news again last night, that 
no one thought about the $3 million CAT scan, no one thought 
about the MRIs and no one thought about the expensive drug 
treatment programs which are so effective but so expensive when 
we started this whole medicare plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians see these programs, they want to have access to them, 
but they are told that they will have to wait months for the MRI 
that should be prescribed for them.  It is a modern health care 
treatment to which Canadians deserve access, and timely access. 
It is not enough to say there is universal accessibility under 
the Canada Health Act if universal accessibility means that a 
person has to wait as long as everybody else.  It is no good to 
tell someone that they are just the same as everybody else 
because they get to wait a year for their treatment.  That is not 
universal accessibility, that is universal inaccessibility. 
While it may be equal, it is not fair.  I would ask the minister 
to please address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also ask the minister to talk about some innovative 
ideas to which I hope all Canadians and all politicians will be 
open.  We all talk about how we do not want the American system. 
The American system is nothing like our system.  To most 
Canadians it is a frightening thing.  The thought of breaking 
your leg and losing your house as a result, and all of the horror 
stories that we read about from time to time, make Canadians 
nervous.  I do not think Canadians want to go there, but if we 
are not going there, then what new systems will we put in place? 
The minister should not say we just have to be innovative, he 
should explain what it is that we will be doing differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of innovative ideas.  We have talked about 
savings plans for the private portion that we already pay for in 
our health care system.  Are there ways through tax breaks to 
encourage people to save funds to look after the health of 
themselves and their families into the future?  What about ideas 
such as those of Michael Walker from the Fraser Institute?  I 
thought he had an innovative idea.  He said “Please, do not 
change the system that allows everyone universal access to the 
public health care system, but put in place a system that rewards 
people who do not abuse the health care system”. 
In other words, he is saying that we should have a plan that is 
accessible to everyone, but for those who look after themselves, 
do not smoke, do not abuse themselves and do not need the health 
care system because they have taken care of themselves, they 
should reap a reward for that.  Maybe we should look at that kind 
of thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the health minister will deal with the whole issue of 
preventive care.  What is the role of the federal government in 
preventive care?  Is it primarily a provincial jurisdiction? 
Largely, I think it is because so many of the social programs are 
administered by provincial governments.  However, he should 
detail again what it is that the federal government sees as its 
role.  Is there an overarching theme? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our members has put forward the idea of a headstart 
program.  I know there is already an aboriginal headstart because 
that is a federal jurisdiction.  We put in an aboriginal 
headstart to try to deflect some of the high risk kids into 
treatment, preventive therapy and preventive work in order to 
keep them out of the health care system when they grow up.  Is 
there a role for all Canadians or does the federal government 
want to see that dealt with at the provincial level? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to delineate the lines of authority.  It is time to 
start talking about what can and should be done federally, what 
can and should be done provincially and to be honest with 
Canadians about what can be, should be and must be done 
privately.  We should be telling them forthrightly what we can do 
for them and what we cannot do for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just like job creation.  There are some things people 
have to do on their own.  There is a role for government but 
there is also a role it will take on.  I hope the minister will 
address what he sees as the delineation of authority and the 
programs he sees the federal government maintaining or enhancing, 
and then to be honest with the provinces and Canadians about the 
programs that he will not maintain or enhance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government and the minister will talk about the 
Canada Health Act.  It is an old act that has been around for 
decades and has served Canadians pretty well.  However, time and 
again we have seen the need to bring it forward and open it up, 
not necessarily for change, but to open it up for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are five pillars to the Canada Health Act.  Should there 
be six?  Should we define what we mean by universally accessible? 
What about portable?  If portable means we can get no service in 
this province just like we can get no service in the next 
province, there is no use in it being portable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us describe what we want in the Canada Health Act.  Let us 
not be afraid to talk about it.  This is not to say that we will 
throw the whole thing out.  Let us discuss whether there is a way 
in the 21st century to anticipate the expensive procedures, the 
expensive drug treatments and the aging population.  Is there 
something we need to do with the Canada Health Act to make all 
those things possible?  Maybe there is not but I think there is a 
need to talk openly about the Canada Health Act.  Maybe we could 
add another pillar talking about a health guarantee for 
Canadians, that they will get access to care, not just the same 
as anybody else but in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the minister's speech.  I would like to move: 
<A NAME="LINK145">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting after the words 
“Government to”, the word “immediately”.

to be seized of forthwith.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the House will know that one of the leadership candidates for the 
Canadian Alliance is proposing two tier health.  It strikes me 
that may very well be the reason why the Canadian Alliance's web 
page on health initiatives is blank at this date.  It is waiting 
to find out which leader's policy it will have to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that facetiously, but the member for Red Deer talked about 
how money is not enough and maybe we need new initiatives.  The 
House leader for the Canadian Alliance said—maybe 
unintentionally but he should clarify it—that we need new 
initiatives and new ways to do things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that he suggested was that maybe we needed 
incentives for Canadians to save so that they will be able to 
take care of their own health care needs in the future.  That is 
what he said, and he might want to check the blues.  That to me 
signals, whether it is specific or implied, that a two tiered 
health strategy for the Canadian Alliance actually is a 
possibility, that it thinks that somehow if we can get more money 
into the hands of Canadians they will be able to take care of 
their own health.  As far as I can see, that is a total 
abandonment of a public health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member whether or not he clearly 
supports a publicly funded health care system to the exclusion of 
any alternatives, including two tier health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it looks like this is 
going to go on all day.  Of course I did not say that.  What I 
said was that a good portion of health care in Canada is paid for 
by private funds.  Anyone who has bought a prescription for 
antibiotics for their kids and shelled out $10 or $15 for it has 
paid for the health of their family out of their own funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I go to a chiropractor I have pay for that because it is not 
covered under general medical services.  My back is being helped 
but I have had to pay for that repeatedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people get a massage, they have to pay for that themselves. 
Even if the doctor has prescribed it, it is not covered under the 
medical plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I suggested was that when people have to pay out of their 
own pockets, as they often do already for those kinds of 
services, we should look at something in the tax system that 
would allow people to save, like we do for retirement or for 
education, the private portion that we already pay for, not new 
things, should be looked after by the government in a way that 
encourages and allows people to save, free of the tax man, 
something that is specific to their health care.  That is what I 
was talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leadership candidate, who the member spoke about, is 
frustrated with the current state of the health care system. I 
guess it is a case of walking a mile in his shoes.  He is an 
emergency room doctor who has spent many years on the front lines 
both here and overseas delivering health care to all kinds of 
people.  He spends the summers working on aboriginal reserves, in 
very difficult situations, giving of his time and providing 
services where no one else will go.  What he sees is a 
deterioration of the health care system that is very frustrating 
to him.  He has seen people lying on gurneys who are not 
receiving treatment, and no matter what he, as a doctor, 
prescribes, nothing happens to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that leadership candidate says is that we have to talk 
about options.  I have thrown some options out this morning, but 
as a medical doctor and an emergency room specialist, the member 
for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca has seen firsthand unnecessary 
suffering and even death because people have not had access to 
timely health care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in one way or another, in one form or another, each of 
the leadership candidates for the Canadian Alliance has advocated 
private involvement in the health care system, whether we are 
talking about a parallel private health care system or a greater 
share of the pie by private forces.  That has been clear and it 
has been stated by the previous health critic and the present 
finance critic of the Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the official position is of the 
Canadian Alliance.  Does it support a parallel private health 
care system, yes or no?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada already has a 
private health care system.  If we get our teeth fixed by a 
dentist, that is private.  We pay for it out of our hip pockets. 
If we go to a chiropractor or to many other treatments, they are 
private. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of British Columbia, the provincial NDP 
government sends needy health care patients to the United States 
for treatment.  A guy I used to work with needed cancer treatment 
but the cancer clinic was full.  The NDP government not only paid 
for his treatment in Bellingham, it gave him vouchers to travel 
back and forth.  When he had to stay overnight, the it paid for 
him to travel to the United States and paid for his overnight 
stay in a private American health care clinic to receive 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For anyone to say that there is no private health care 
involvement in the system is incorrect.  There is, absolutely. 
That is why we need to discuss what that involvement should be 
and how we can ensure that all Canadians have access in a timely 
way to the health care they need. 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity today to speak to this issue.  I 
think it is fitting that on the last day of the session of this 
parliament we spend our time talking about the number one issue 
on the minds of Canadians across the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that what we are discussing today is a subject of 
vital importance to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The state of our health system is of major concern to our fellow 
Canadians.  It is obvious, and we must be frank during this 
debate, that we are faced with some major challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can discuss the long waiting lists, the over-crowded emergency 
rooms, the shortages of physicians and nurses. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these circumstances concrete action is required from all 
governments working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In responding to the motion put before the House by the Canadian 
Alliance Party today, let me make three points.  The first is 
that in the efforts we make to solve the problems facing Canadian 
health care, we must stick to the principles that are spelled out 
in the Canada Health Act.  Simply stated, a single tier, publicly 
financed, universal system of health care provided for by the 
Canada Health Act is the best possible approach to providing 
health coverage for our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain why I say that.  The member for Fraser Valley 
described the Canada Health Act as an old act, as though somehow 
in the 16 years since it was adopted by the House the statement 
of the principles contained in that statute has become outmoded, 
outdated or must be reframed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the evidence, our experience as Canadians and the 
experience elsewhere in other countries shows that those five 
principles in the Canada Health Act are as relevant and as 
valuable today as they ever were.  Those principles are as 
important and as relevant to health care in Canada today as they 
were when they were formulated by the Liberal government in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say that?  I say that for two reasons:  First, they 
spell out the foundation of a system of universal health coverage 
that is socially fair; and second, they provide for a way of 
making services available to a population that is economically 
efficient.  I will deal with each of those in turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to social fairness, we all know that Canadians cherish our 
public system of health care.  Why?  It is because to them it is 
about more than just doctors and hospitals; it is about values, 
about being Canadian and about the way we want to live our lives. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about the promise we have made to one another as Canadians 
that we will look after each other in times of need regardless of 
wealth or privilege.  Access to needed services will not depend 
on the state of one's bank account, but will be determined by the 
state of one's health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Canada Health Act is all about.  It reflects 
something that lies very close to the heart of this nation's 
sense of self.  For that reason, because of the social fairness 
of public medicare in Canada, the principles of the Canada Health 
Act are as important today as ever they were, and it is important 
that we defend them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is economic efficiency.  We do not talk about 
this often enough.  Public medicare in Canada allows us to 
provide health coverage for the population in a way that is less 
expensive than approaches taken in other nations.  Let us look at 
the comparative situation between Canada and our closest 
neighbour, the United States.  We are so much alike in so many 
ways, but there are important distinctions that demonstrate the 
economic value of Canadian medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, as the member for Red Deer observed this morning, 
Canadian medicare costs just over 9% of our gross domestic 
product.  For that we insure 100% of our population for medically 
necessary services.  In the United States, health costs are 14.2% 
of the gross domestic product.  Notwithstanding that much higher 
level of spending, coverage is provided for only part of the 
population.  Today there are 43 million Americans who have no 
health coverage.  There are 100 million Americans who are 
underinsured and who worry that one day they may have to choose 
between their health and their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that we can provide health insurance for everyone for 
9% of our gross domestic product and the Americans spend 14.2% 
and leave so many tens of millions uninsured?  It is because the 
single payer publicly financed universal coverage provided for in 
the principles of the Canada Health Act is economically 
efficient.  The overhead in the American system is a huge source 
of cost with so many people providing coverage with private 
insurers.  I will give an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year a professor from the United States was in Toronto at a 
conference on this very subject.  He described a hospital in 
Boston which had about the same number of beds as a Toronto 
hospital.  In the Boston hospital there were 317 people in the 
billings and collection department.  In the Toronto hospital 
there were 16 people in the billings and collection department. 
That is a vivid illustration of the difference between us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago I was in Grand Falls, New Brunswick.  During my 
stay in that beautiful community I met a man who had come across 
the Saint John River from Maine, which is immediately adjacent 
and just a few moments away from Grand Falls.  This American, a 
resident of Maine, had recently had open heart surgery.  He told 
me that the cost of that surgery was $400,000.  This man was 
among the lucky ones.  He had some private health insurance that 
paid 80% of the cost, but simple arithmetic makes it clear that 
this man from Maine was obligated to fork out $80,000 of his own 
money to pay for that open heart surgery.  That is a vivid 
illustration of what happens when private for profit interests 
take over the organization and delivery of needed medical care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the case is made to the satisfaction of the party 
opposite that our first goal must be to hang on to those 
principles, to preserve this public system of which we should be 
so proud. 
In Canada, unique in all the world, we have found a way to 
provide health coverage to our population that is socially fair, 
that reflects our values and speaks of the way we treat each 
other as citizens.  At the same time it makes economic sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of my work in the Prime Minister's government, I 
have occasion to travel to other countries or to receive here in 
Canada health ministers from abroad.  In the course of those 
meetings the subject has often arisen whether Canada should 
import some of the features of foreign health systems and 
particularly, as the alliance members would contend, the private 
for profit element to, as some of them say, take the pressure off 
our public system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House that without exception, every such foreign 
minister to whom I have spoken has urged me not to follow that 
course.  They have urged me to hang on to our present public 
system and to do what we must to fix it, but not to go down the 
road of the private parallel health system.  Why is that? They 
usually give me the same reasons speaking from the experience in 
their own countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that if we open the private parallel system of care, 
then we will lose doctors, nurses and other health workers to the 
private system.  The problems we have now with providing medical 
care professionals in the health care services will become even 
worse.  It is often the best and the brightest who leave the 
system to practise privately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They emphasized that the private parallel service will focus on 
the simple repetitive procedures where profit is greatest.  And 
as soon as there is a problem, we know where that case will go. A 
complication will be sent right back into the public system and 
the public will end up subsidizing the private for profit sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These ministers also pointed out that the private for profit 
element, the private parallel approach, has not resolved problems 
in public medicare.  England is an example where the waiting 
lists are worse than ever.  In England a person can go for the 
private for profit parallel services, yet its waiting lists are 
worse than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members ought not to think that the simple answer to the 
problems that confront medicare is to establish the private for 
profit parallel system.  It does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other point that those from other countries urge 
upon me in arguing that we should keep our public system of 
medicare in Canada.  They point out that if we allow the most 
influential and wealthiest in our society to purchase access to 
services, if we allow those with money and influence who help to 
shape public opinion to purchase access to private services in 
health care, then to that extent we will reduce the pressure on 
governments across the country to fix the problems in medicare. 
It will slip down the public agenda and the problems will not be 
resolved.  That is a very important consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first of the three points I wish to make this morning in 
speaking to the member's resolution is that we should do what it 
takes to hang on to our system of public medicare.  It is 
socially fair and economically efficient and it reflects the best 
that this country has to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point is that the public system of medicare must be 
financed properly.  It must have the money it needs to provide 
the services that Canadians must have.  That includes the 
obligation of the Government of Canada to do its part in 
financing public medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when this government was elected, the total value of 
transfers to the provinces was about $28 billion per year.  This 
year the total value of transfers to the provinces will be over 
$30 billion.  We have not only restored the transfers, but we 
have increased them in the time that this government has been in 
office. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year in Canada the federal government contributes 
one-third to all public health spending. In the last two years we 
have increased by 25% the cash transfer to provinces, including 
$2.5 billion just three months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that we do enough.  Indeed, I am an advocate 
for increased federal funding for health care and for increasing 
transfers to the provinces for health.  The Prime Minister 
himself has said that the Government of Canada is prepared to 
increase transfers to provinces for health when we reach common 
ground with the provinces on a common vision for the future of 
medicare and an approach to the problems it faces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument in favour of additional funding from the Government 
of Canada is clear.  In parts of the system more money is needed. 
If Ottawa is to play its role, if it is to have the moral 
authority to protect the principles of the Canada Health Act 
across the country, it must have a credible voice at the table. 
This government will ensure that the Government of Canada is at 
the table to play its part in protecting public medicare in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leads me to the third point I wish to make this morning and 
it is simply this.  It is not just money alone that is going to 
succeed in solving the problems we confront in medicare.  Our 
goal must not be simply to make health care more expensive in 
Canada.  Our goal must be, by supporting provincial innovation, 
to make access to quality health care available across this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must work with our provincial partners toward developing a 
common vision and common approaches to the resolution of these 
issues.  We must speak with our provincial partners about 
establishing these objectives, finding some way to measure the 
performance of the health care system, and reporting to Canadians 
whether we are making progress toward those objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not misunderstand.  I am not suggesting for a moment that 
provincial governments are accountable to the Government of 
Canada, but that governments of both orders are accountable to 
the public of Canada.  We must use common indicators to measure 
the performance of the system and report to Canadians so that we 
can work toward restoring public confidence in medicare by 
proving and by establishing that we are making progress toward 
our shared goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also identify areas of innovation.  The hon. member for 
Fraser Valley asked for innovative ideas.  He wanted to know what 
would work and what we could do that would help change the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that we know that, from the national forum which the 
Prime Minister chaired, to the excellent work the provinces have 
done, including last week when they tabled their cost driver 
report, to the innovations that the Government of Canada funded 
through the health transition fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 we set aside $150 million in the health transition fund. 
We have funded over 400 pilot projects across the country, 
demonstrating the value of new approaches in home and community 
care, in primary health care reform and in integrating health 
services.  We have learned from those pilot projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have watched as provinces themselves have innovated.  Now is 
the time for the Government of Canada to get behind those 
provincial efforts, to broaden and to accelerate the innovations 
in which they have engaged in order to make real progress in 
improving access to quality care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we know the broad directions we must take.  It is now 
up to governments to work together to ensure that we pursue them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Primary health care reform and broadening the availability of 
home and community care, those are the changes that will take the 
pressure off our emergency rooms by making services accessible. 
Dealing with shortfalls in medical equipment, investing in health 
information technology to integrate our health care system and 
sharing information among providers about patients, dealing with 
the issues of the right number of doctors, nurses and specialists 
to care for Canadians, these are the issues we must pursue in 
common.  We have begun.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also mention wellness because there is an important 
federal role in that regard, not just to think about treating 
those who are sick but to think about encouraging all to remain 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cardiovascular disease continues to be the number one killer in 
the country.  There are four risk factors, three of which are 
within our control: diet, exercise and smoking.  That is why we 
will continue our aggressive efforts against the tobacco industry 
to encourage Canadians to understand the tactics of big tobacco, 
to encourage young people not to begin and to protect children 
from the tactics of big tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress that we must work with our provincial partners to 
achieve these goals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already begun.  Six months ago, I wrote to my provincial 
and territorial counterparts, inviting them to the negotiating 
table, inviting them to work with me to identify priorities and 
to develop an action plan to address these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon, I shall be holding a conference call with them. 
I trust that, in coming weeks, we will be face to face around 
the negotiating table. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ensure that we put before the first ministers when 
they meet in September something upon which we can agree as 
common ground and a common vision for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I do not support the motion before the House.  I 
am as concerned as the next person about the issues in medicare. 
We are confronting them with our provincial partners.  I disagree 
that the health system is in crisis.  I believe we have grave 
issues to deal with, but let me quote from the provincial report 
last Friday wherein the provinces said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's publicly funded health care system is not in crisis. 
Canadians continue to be well served by their health care system 
but it is under serious challenges due to rising demand and cost 
strictures. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I entirely agree with the provinces.  Let us work together to 
make sure that we preserve our greatest social asset, our public 
medicare system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we heard a lot of motherhood, a lot of status quo and a 
lot of comparison to the U.S. system which no Canadian wants. Why 
even talk about it?  It keeps coming out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question is that today we spend $86 billion in public 
money in total on health care.  The projections of Health Canada 
are that it will increase at 3%.  That means that by the year 
2020 we will be spending $160 billion on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the new technology.  We want the new medications.  We 
want all that.  The Premier of Newfoundland says he is already 
spending 42% of his budget on health care.  Other provinces say 
they are spending 30% of their budgets on health care.  What is 
the right amount to be spent on health care?  If we are to spend 
$160 billion, what about all the other things government has to 
do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about the system not being in crisis, but 
78% of Canadians say that the system is in crisis.  The people 
are saying that.  The only people who do seem to be hearing it 
are the politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am afraid the hon. member 
has to accept the fact that the provinces in their report last 
Friday declared that the health care system was not in crisis. It 
faces serious problems, particularly in relation to cost 
pressures that must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me come to the member's question.  The cost drivers in 
health care can be managed through changes in the way health care 
is organized and delivered.  That is why we are anxious to 
support provincial efforts to innovate in areas like primary 
health care reform, for example the current system of fee for 
service as opposed to a different approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario has talked about getting 80% of its 
physicians over the next four years on to different methods of 
payment, apart from fee for service. 
I am anxious to support innovation of that kind.  I believe that 
by using information technology, by measuring performance and by 
looking at the way we can influence the rate of increase of costs 
we can indeed keep our system sustainable.  It will take 
innovation.  It will take change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alliance party opposite would have us go in a different 
direction.  It would have us go toward the private parallel for 
profit system of health care.  The facts show that will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree fundamentally with the approach it favours.  I do not 
believe Canadians agree with that approach for a moment.  I think 
Canadians expect us to work very hard to keep the principles in 
place to preserve the public nature of medicare but not to take 
the American style approach.  It will not work and it will not be 
supported by Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
to say that we on this side of the House have had it with 
watching this minister rise and ask the provinces to work with 
him, when the minister and the government have unilaterally cut 
transfers the provinces were entitled to expect in the health 
care sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that a person has to be a real hypocrite to rise 
in this House and call for co-operation when, last week, the 
provinces tabled a report in which they unanimously—I hope the 
minister will have the decency to rise in this House and 
acknowledge it—asked the minister to reinstate the transfer 
payments at their 1994-95 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968, the government established a social contract in 1968 in 
which health care programs, in terms of transfer payments and 
funding, were to be shared 50-50, that is, 50% by the federal 
government and 50% by the provinces. However, the government did 
not honour its part of the bargain, because it contributes 12%, 
that is 12 cents on the dollar.  The federal government's 
contribution has shrunk to 12%, and the provinces have to assume 
the rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best thing this minister could do to establish his 
credibility in the House is not give us fine speeches for the 
leadership campaign, but exert pressure for the reinstatement of 
the transfer payments at the 1994-95 level, as Brian Tobin, 
Bernard Lord, Pauline Marois and all the health ministers have 
asked him to do.  He must stop his fine speeches and do 
something.  That is what we want from him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that the hon. 
member only talks about money. But if this is what he wants to 
do, I am perfectly comfortable with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote Bernard Landry, Quebec's finance minister. 
Some weeks ago, it was discovered that Mr. Landry, in his 
capacity as Quebec's Minister of Finance, had left untouched, in 
a Toronto bank, an amount of $850 million paid to Quebec by the 
Government of Canada, for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Landry was confronted with these facts, he said “Health 
is not just a money issue, it is also about how our health care 
system is run and structured. This is where the real answers 
are”. That is what Mr. Landry said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I am really disappointed to hear the hon. member 
focus exclusively on money. 
This is clearly not just a money issue. Innovative methods and 
changes in the delivery of services are also required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am prepared to work with my counterparts in that regard. I 
have received and read the report. It is an excellent report. I 
intend to discuss it in detail this afternoon during a 
conference call with the provincial and territorial health 
ministers. I hope the hon. member will recognize that this will 
require us to work together, in a co-ordinated fashion, to 
improve service delivery.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
minister for his commitment to social medicine in Canada. 
Unfortunately I think he discredits himself when he acts like the 
problems have not arisen from the serious cuts made by this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What plans does he have for dealing with access in remote areas 
such at the north and Yukon?  The fact that people have to travel 
thousands of miles to obtain treatment such as dialysis means 
complete isolation from families.  It is a serious problem for 
isolated areas, which means most of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is quite right. 
Monday morning last in Chesterville, Ontario, I had occasion to 
speak to this subject in the presence of rural members of the 
government caucus.  I said at that time that after becoming 
Minister of Health, travelling the country and looking at the 
situation on the ground, I came to the conclusion the real threat 
of two tier medicare in Canada was not so much between the rich 
and the poor but between the urban and the rural. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to services in rural areas is a major issue.  The 
one-third of Canadians who live in rural Canada or in the more 
remote regions are demographically older, have poorer health 
status, are more subject to accidents and injuries, and yet have 
less access to the whole range of services from ambulances to 
emergency rooms to diagnostic equipment and family physicians, 
let alone specialists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my appearance in Chesterville with members of the 
rural caucus of the government was to receive their report on 
recommendations for action the Government of Canada could take to 
address some of these issues.  I accepted all their 
recommendations and I undertook to implement those that were 
within my sphere of authority as federal minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I announced $130 million for concrete steps 
which I will believe will help.  First, there is a program 
devoted to pilot projects for rural and community health with 
money set aside specifically for innovative practices to be 
funded in rural communities and looking at new ways to overcome 
issues of access to services, whether it is training physicians 
and nurses or paying them differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, investing in telemedicine would enable us to take 
advantage of new technology to overcome the challenge of 
distance.  In the member's riding and in rural Canada generally I 
believe telemedicine holds real promise for helping us overcome 
some of the problems the member has identified.

<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
getting into the opposition motion from the Canadian Alliance 
members, I wish to point out that today is the last day of work 
of someone whose dedication in helping us with our parliamentary 
duties has been extraordinary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to Pierre Ménard, who has worked with the Bloc 
Quebecois since 1993.  I am sure that all members of the House 
will want to thank him, because we all have colleagues who work 
behind the scenes to help us to do a better job as 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Ménard is someone with a solid legal background, who is 
well versed in parliamentary procedure, who has a very keen 
sense of humour, and who is charming.  I want to tell him that 
we will miss him very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that all my colleagues share these sentiments, 
particularly the members for Chambly, for Beauharnois—Salaberry 
and for Repentigny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tribute is not intended, however, to distract from the 
extremely serious and urgent business of debating in this House 
the federal government's responsibility in the crisis facing the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin with two cautions.  The first is that we 
believe that the provinces should be responsible for the health 
care system. 
We believe that the problems facing the provinces obviously have 
a lot to do with the question of money and transfer payments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no way does the Bloc Quebecois believe that we should cut 
corners in examining the re-organization of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going into detail, I wish to tell hon. members that I met 
with some hospital administrators a few months ago, the ones for 
CHUM and for Maisonneuve-Rosemount.  I understood clearly that 
the problem was not solely financial.  It is mainly financial, 
however, because if the provinces do not have all the resources 
they should in order to be able to re-organize the health system, 
the debate will remain extremely theoretical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I will offer one example of how the network can be 
reorganized. 
Does it make sense that there can be 30, 40 or 50 different 
collective agreements within one health facility, and that the 
person who puts down salt when there is a winter storm is not 
the same one to shovel or clear the entrances to the hospital? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it make sense that there is such fragmentation in the 
health community that, when one person could perform two or 
three different jobs, at present this takes four, five or six 
people?  We are able to figure out that service delivery needs 
to be re-organized along with the way the system operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic reality is that demographic and technological 
pressures and drug costs will confront all provinces, whether 
Quebec, Newfoundland, British Columbia or Saskatchewan, and 
despite their greatly different political leanings, with the 
same reality: that 4%, 5%, 6%, even 7% more will have to be 
invested yearly in order to provide exactly the same services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to show hon. members the factors that contribute to 
the pressure on the health system.  Now we have not just 
seniors, but increasing numbers of older seniors.  In French we 
call these the “fourth age” as opposed to the third. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not exception to run into people in our ridings who are 
85, 90 or 95 and in relatively good health.  These are the “old 
elderly”, those aged 80 and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since people are living longer, they want to continue living in 
their own environment.  This presents a challenge in terms of 
home care.  This presents a challenge in the way society will 
organize itself to keep people in their natural surroundings, 
and I will come back to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has a larger population of people aged 65 and older than 
do other societies.  I have some figures that will provide food 
for thought for the member for Repentigny, who has a good crop 
of grey hair himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2011, the number of people 65 years of age or older will have 
increased by 60% since 1991.  The increase in the number of 
those 85 years of age or older is even more striking.  Their 
numbers will increase by 84%. 
We might be tempted to think this is far off.  We might think 
2030 is beyond reach, but 2030 is just round the corner.  In 
2030, 25% of Quebecers will be 65 years of age or over.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, an eternal 
optimist, has just whispered a very relevant point to me.  In 
2030, Quebec will be sovereign, but that fact in no way changes 
the need to organize and consider how we can give our seniors 
the best services possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we compare things in Quebec with the way they are in 
Germany, Canada, France and England, we realize that what sets 
Quebec apart is the rate at which its population is aging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proportionally, Quebec's population is aging twice as rapidly as 
the population of European countries. This means that the 
percentage of people turning 65 or more will be demographically 
greater here than in Europe. This will take place at an 
accelerated rate that is unknown in countries such as France, 
Germany and the Scandinavian countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention another reality. The upward pressure on 
the health budget is around 4% to 5% annually. This means that, 
by the year 2002, if we want to provide exactly the same 
services, if Quebec wants to provide exactly the same range of 
services as it does in 2000-2001, the National Assembly will have 
to increase its health budget by 4% to 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at this figure, and my colleagues are anxious to do 
so, we realize that demographic growth accounts for 1.3%, 
technological change for 1% and inflation for about 2% annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is a natural growth of 4% to 5% in the health sector. 
Mr. Speaker, if I asked you, since you are mentally alert, to 
tell me the rate of Quebec's collective growth, you would have 
to say 2.5%. Therefore, if we do not restructure Quebec's health 
system, we will find ourselves in a situation where the National 
Assembly, the government of Quebecers, will have to allocate 
more money for health than it can, based on the collective 
wealth indicator. This is what is disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Premier of Quebec, one of the best ever to have 
held the position, said, in response to Jean Charest in oral 
question period, that it was not possible for Quebec's health 
care budget to be open-ended.  It is not possible.  No government 
in the world can operate that way and neither can Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to what the Minister of Health erroneously said in 
a moment of what I would call confusion and delirium.  I will 
come back to the money which is supposedly being held in trust 
and which Quebec has not used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I wish to say that there are structural pressures on the 
health system.  We have the number: in 1999, last year, for 
example, emergency rooms saw 50,000 more cases than in 1994-95. 
Of these, 56% were people over the age of 75.  This is where we 
begin to understand the demographic pressure. When emergency 
rooms are treating 50,000 more people and three-quarters of them 
are aged 75 and older, we can see why demographic pressure has an 
impact on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the example of radiation oncology.  Oncology has to 
do with cancer. Well, the demand for radiation oncology, 
particularly for those aged 50 and up—baby boomers—is 
increasing.  New cases of cancer are increasing by 3% annually.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demand in cardiology is also increasing, particularly for 
those aged 50 and older.  Obviously, more seniors are undergoing 
coronary bypass surgery.  The number of heart surgeries is 
increasing by 3.6% a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are a good-hearted person.  You are going to be 
very upset to hear that the number of angioplasties has increased 
by 260% over the past ten years.  This has an impact on the 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was totally amazed to hear the Minister of Health, with his 
dulcet leadership-seeking tones, praising the health ministers' 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago, all of the ministers of health met together and came 
to exactly the same conclusion.  What was that conclusion?  That 
the federal government must return transfer payments to their 
1995 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministers of health wanted to document what was going on in 
the various health systems, so they tabled a report.  I would 
like all hon. members here in this House to understand that this 
report is over the signatures of Bernard Lord, Pauline Marois, 
the premier of British Columbia and Brian Tobin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the same conclusion is invariably reached, whether those 
involved be Liberals, Progressive Conservatives, New Democrats 
or Parti Quebecois: the federal government has literally robbed 
the provinces of their due. 
It has diverted funds.  It has turned its back on its most basic 
of responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share part of the report, beginning on page 16. 
I find the Minister of Health particularly hypocritical for 
praising this report without giving us any of its content.  I 
feel obliged to share with hon. members the two main findings of 
this report, which are most critical of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 16 we find: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Total provincial/territorial health expenditures in Canada 
increased from $11 billion in fiscal year 1997-98 to $55.6 
billion in fiscal year 1999-2000, an average growth rate of seven 
per cent per year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it is not just the provinces that failed to assume their 
responsibilities.  It is not just the provinces that failed to 
put money into the health care system. From 1977, the year 
established program funding, EPF, was created, the cost 
increased from $11 billion to $55 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a limit, however, to what the provinces can do.  There 
is a lot of federal money and less provincial money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At page 19 of this report, endorsed by all the provinces, by 
Brian Tobin, Bernard Lord and Pauline Marois, the figures are 
stunning.  At page 19, the report by the health ministers reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long before the CHST, years of federal transfer restrictions had 
significantly reduced the federal government's proportional 
share of provincial/territorial health care programming costs. 
The federal share, which stood at 26.9 per cent in 1977/78, had 
fallen to 16.3 percent in 1995/96 at the onset of the CHST. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report indicates there was a 40% decrease.  It went on to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deep cuts accompanying the introduction of the CHST reduced 
this share considerably, so that it stood at just 10.2 per cent 
in 1998/99. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over a period of 21 years, the percentage of health care funding 
assumed by the federal government dropped 62.1%.  Is it 
acceptable that the federal government cut transfers to the 
provinces, especially transfers for the health care system, with 
impunity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then the Minister of Health rises in the House and says “In 
spite of all the harm that I have done to the health ministers 
and to the provincial health systems, I would like to act as if 
none of that had happened and invite my provincial counterparts 
to sit with me at the negotiating table, so that we can discuss 
together the changes that should be made to health and social 
services programs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that there is a prerequisite to the 
minister convening a meeting with his counterparts, namely the 
restoring of transfer payments for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government restored health transfer payments to their 
1995 level, the provinces would receive $4.1 billion for health 
alone. Quebec's share should be $1 billion, including $500 
million for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the members who are listening and the people who are 
watching the debates of the House of Commons what Quebec could 
do with this additional $500 million for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That amount is equivalent to more than one quarter of the budget 
for Montreal's hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $500 million owed by the federal government to Quebec 
represents nearly half the budget for the whole CLSC network in 
the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $500 million owed by this government to Quebec is almost the 
equivalent of the budget allocated to home support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $500 million is four times the annual budget of 
Sainte-Justine hospital for children. It is three times the 
budget of the Royal Victoria Hospital, and it represents one 
quarter of the cost of the prescription drug insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that if this government is serious, if 
it really wants to take its responsibilities and help the 
provinces meet their obligation to maintain the health system 
and preserve its integrity, it has no choice but to immediately 
state its intention to restore transfer payments to their 1994-95 
levels. Otherwise, it will mean—and voters will remember it at 
the next election—that this government is a hypocrite and talks 
from both sides of its mouth. It will mean that the government 
does not want to help the provinces with their problems in the 
area of health and social services. And Quebecers will remember 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have listened to the Bloc 
Quebecois health critic give an overview of health issues and try 
to paint a negative picture of what the federal government is 
doing.  At the end of his speech, I heard him say that Quebec was 
ill-served and underfunded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to remind the hon. member and all Canadians that Quebec 
is getting its fair share of the 2000 budget. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 24% or 25% of Canada's population, Quebec is getting 
approximately 28% of transfer payments.  It is getting 28% of 
transfer payments with 24% or 25% of the population.  I do not 
think that it can cry wolf and complain about being underfunded 
compared to other regions in Canada and other provinces.  The 
record must be set straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I hear the hon. member basing his arguments on a lack of 
funding from the federal government. We have before us a motion 
by the Canadian Alliance members, who talk about a system in 
crisis, and would have us agree that Canada's health care system 
is in crisis and vote in favour of their motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a report before us from the provinces.  They are asking 
for more money.  That was already understood.  We have known that 
for some time.  In this report, the provinces are saying that 
Canada's system is not in crisis.  There are pressures, problems, 
challenges, but it is the provinces, not the federal government, 
saying this.  It is not the Liberal Party saying it.  The 
provinces are saying “The Canadian health care system is not in 
crisis”.  That is the actual conclusion of their report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois what 
comment he has to make on the opinion recently expressed by 
Claude Castonguay, the father of health reform in the 1970s, and 
a man with a reputation for wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All political parties and all consultations defer to Mr. 
Castonguay.  People like to get his point of view.  On May 6 he 
was quoted in <I>Le Devoir</I> as follows “In backing the race toward a 
zero deficit, Quebec won the bet on taxation, but lost the one 
on health.  Quebec has lost its shirt on that one”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has it not managed to reform the system, it has even 
lost its shirt.  Mr. Castonguay also pointed out that there are 
a number of reforms that need to be looked at. He pointed out 
that, not only is the health system inefficient, but also there 
is absolutely no way to gauge its productivity, its performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are, to my mind, severe criticisms and I would ask the 
hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve to consider that there is 
work to be done in all of the provinces as far as service 
organization and delivery are concerned.  This was also said by 
the Quebec Minister of Finance, Bernard Landry, a month and a 
half ago, when it was reported that there were hundreds of 
millions of dollars, $850 million at that time, available to 
finance services for the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some Quebec patients are having to go the United States for 
cancer treatment, and for other treatments, at the present time. 
There are waiting lists, as everyone is well aware, and there 
is also $850 million which could be used.  The Quebec Minister 
of Health was very surprised when this amount became known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Quebec Minister of Finance, “Our problem in 
Quebec is not just money, but also the use, the administration 
of that money”.  The minister got that message clearly, because 
she is commissioning an in depth study, and then of course there 
is last year's study, which led to the Arpin report.  The 
Minister of Health and the Government of Quebec are therefore 
well aware that service delivery and organization must be 
re-examined, as Mr. Castonguay has also suggested.  We must, 
therefore, focus on a concerted effort to solve these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what our colleague thinks of Mr. 
Castonguay's diagnosis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, no one is denying in the House 
that the various health care networks have to look at the 
delivery of their services and that there is room for 
reorganization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself provided the example of the meeting I had with the head 
of the emergency hospital centre.  He explained that, in a 
winter storm, the person cleaning the entranceways is not the 
person doing the salting.  These are examples of illogical 
working arrangements we have to reconsider. Situations we see 
now that are not logical, and not the best way to deliver the 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has to agree, however, that the provinces, in their 
report said unanimously—and this includes Brian Tobin as well—that 
the federal government did not assume its funding 
responsibilities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every dollar the provinces invest in health care, the 
federal government, under its commitment, must set aside 50 
cents.  For every dollar spent, the federal government gives the 
provinces only 12 cents.  We think something has to be done 
before we talk about co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the Minister of Health may want to meet his colleagues to 
find a way to reorganize the network. 
Yes, there are pressures that did not exist in the sixties. The 
so-called fourth age, the group made up of very old people, was 
not an issue. We did not have the same medical technologies. We 
can certainly understand that. Back then, people did not wish to 
remain in their community as long as they do now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, who is a 
Quebecer like me, will agree with the assessment made by the 
Quebec Minister of Health and Social Services, who is urging 
this government to assume its responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few stakeholders in the health sector do not agree that the 
federal government drastically reduced its financial support. I 
personally talked to Mr. Castonguay myself and I believe he 
acknowledged that the federal government had reduced its 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the government to co-operate. 
We will support its co-operative efforts. I also invite the 
parliamentary secretary to recognize that the federal government 
has reduced its support and that restoring transfer payments 
must be a prerequisite to any dialogue with the provinces. That 
is our conviction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague, the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, is very 
enthusiastic. I am convinced that he still has a lot of things 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards transfer payments, and I anticipate his answer, would 
he agree with the suggestion that the federal government should 
make such a transfer by allocating additional tax points? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, our colleague no doubt wishes to 
remind the House that the Canada social transfer, as it now 
stands, takes two forms—cash payments and tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that he, like other stakeholders, has worked out that 
it would be more advantageous to receive tax points, given 
deflation and real value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that our colleague, whose primary motivation has always 
been to defend Quebec's interests, which he considers 
non-negotiable, has put a great deal of effort in recent weeks 
into the argument that Quebec should collect all its taxes. 
That is a characteristic of sovereignty, or one step towards 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no hesitation in giving him my support and I thank him 
for publicly pushing this idea, which is as generous as it is 
enlightened.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate 
in this debate and to begin the input in this discussion on the 
part of the New Democratic Party caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fitting that we should end this parliamentary session with 
a full blown debate on the question of health care.  I want to 
acknowledge the work of the Alliance in bringing this motion 
forward.  However, in so doing I also want to say “Welcome to 
the debate” to members of the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  What about the Liberals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  An Alliance member just said 
“What about the Liberals?”  I too want to say to the Liberals 
“Welcome to the debate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was any telling comment about the productiveness of 
this past parliamentary session it has been the lack of a clear 
discussion and debate on the future of our health care system.  I 
hold the Liberals responsible for this lack of accountability to 
parliament and to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Alliance members “Welcome to the debate”.  This 
is something we have been trying to push to the top of the 
parliamentary agenda day in and day out for the past several 
months, from the day the federal budget was tabled and we were 
informed of just how serious this federal government took the 
crisis in our health care system. 
The government responded to the most critical situation facing 
health care in the history of this country by tabling a budget 
that gave two cents to health care for every dollar it spent on 
tax cuts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that moment there was no one else in this Chamber speaking 
up, joining us in calling on the government to act appropriately 
and responsibly in the face of the serious critical situation 
facing health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were alone, day in and day out, week after week, raising this 
issue without any support, and we will continue to do so.  We 
have not only used every question period available to put this 
question to the government, we have presented to the House two 
motions using our two opposition days on this very question.  We 
have called for support from all sides of the House for an 
increase in transfer payments.  Did we get the support of the 
Canadian Alliance?  No, we did not.  Of course we did not get the 
support of the Liberals.  That seems to be a given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presented a second motion in the face of the most critical 
development in the history of medicare, that being the passage of 
bill 11 in the Alberta legislature.  We put a motion calling upon 
the government to stand and either enforce the Canada Health Act, 
or, if that was not possible, to amend the Canada Health Act to 
prohibit private for profit hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Canadian Alliance support us?  No, it did not.  It does 
not need to be said again that the Liberal government did not 
support us either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one supported us on those motions.  We have stood alone, day 
in and day out, trying to hold the government to account and 
raising the number one issue facing Canadians today.  Thank 
goodness, at least to this point in time, in the dying days of 
this parliamentary session, the Alliance has finally decided that 
perhaps there should be a discussion here in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased to participate in this debate.  I also want to 
acknowledge though, because I do not want to issue total blanket 
statements about lack of involvement by the Alliance on this 
critical issue, the work of the health critic of the Canadian 
Alliance, who has tried along with others to have this matter 
addressed by the health committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will know that during the whole period that we were 
dealing with the fall-out of the abysmal federal budget and the 
rise of Ralph Klein's for profit private agenda the minister 
avoided the debate here in parliament.  He avoided the health 
committee.  In fact, he deliberately manipulated our agenda at 
the health committee so we could not have the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it be absolutely clear that at the point when it was the 
most pressing time for all of us to come together to debate 
health care and deal with the serious threats to the future of 
medicare the Minister of Health took every measure he could to 
dictate to the Liberal members on the health committee to prevent 
us from having the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the debate taking place?  Not in parliament.  Not in 
the health committee.  Except for the one or two days that we 
presented motions, there has been no ongoing, serious, long term 
discussion about this issue.  Where is that taking place?  In the 
other chamber.  In the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the most pressing issue for Canadians.  Surely to 
goodness it ought to be before parliament.  Why did the Minister 
of Health, when he knew the concerns of all parties in the House, 
when he knew how Canadians felt, come to the committee and try to 
dictate what it should be studying?  It certainly was not our 
universal public health care system.  It certainly was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When confronted about why he did that he said “The committee is 
master of its own destiny.  It can choose to do what it wants”. 
If we can choose, how is it that he tried to deliberately 
influence the agenda?  How did he manage to get through to every 
Liberal member of the committee so that we did not have that 
opportunity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the last day of the session.  The health committee is 
not discussing this issue.  Parliament is hardly discussing this 
issue, and the crisis continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this issue has not been thoroughly debated in 
parliament, the motion today gives us an opportunity to discuss 
the future of health care and put things into context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance motion poses the challenges that we all have to 
deal with.  However, we question what is really behind this 
motion, obviously.  As we have noted in the debate today, time 
and time again the Canadian Alliance has stood in the House or 
outside the House to advocate private for profit health care. 
I mentioned in my remarks earlier that every single leadership 
candidate for the Canadian Alliance has in one way or another 
advocated this kind of private encroachment on our health care 
system.  Just this past week Stockwell Day said that we should 
trim the health care budget.  The month before, Stockwell Day 
said that we should stop the intrusive health transfers.  The 
member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca is clearly on record as 
calling for a parallel private health care system.  Today he is 
quoted in the London <I>Free Press</I> as saying “Establishing 
private clinics in hospitals in Canada is the key to aiding the 
country's health care system”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not stop there.  We know where Tom Long comes from.  He 
is either the protege or the actual force behind Mike Harris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  The candidate from Bay Street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Absolutely, the candidate from 
Bay Street.  What do candidates from Bay Street want?  They want 
to get their tentacles into the private health care market.  They 
know that this is a lucrative market.  It is an $82 billion 
golden egg and they want it.  Tom Long wants it, not for the good 
of the public sector, but for commercial interests.  As Dalton 
Camp said so well, when we are talking about Tom Long or Mike 
Harris, we are talking about the beginning of a concerted effort 
to change health care from a public interest to a commercial 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then of course there is the other leadership candidate, the 
member for Calgary Southwest, who has said in this House, and I 
have no doubt he has said it along the campaign trail, that we 
should look at private sector health care.  We can go right back 
and trace the whole history of that individual and members of the 
Canadian Alliance, and the Reform before it.  All they ever 
talked about was opening up the Canada Health Act to allow 
private for profit health care.  All they have talked about is 
the need for private interests to get their hands on the health 
care system, and my goodness, would it not be more efficient and 
would it not be better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to quote all of that again.  I have put those 
quotes on the record before.  We have quotes from the member for 
Calgary Southwest.  We also have quotes from the former health 
critic, and we have quotes from the present finance critic of the 
official opposition in response to the last budget.  When we were 
leading the charge in terms of the weakness of the federal budget 
vis-a-vis the health care crisis, the finance critic of the 
Canadian Alliance said publicly on February 29, 2000 “Obviously 
we are going to have to look beyond the money and start to 
entertain some private sector solutions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we need this debate in the House, but 
we are very suspicious of the motives behind the motion.  What 
does this party mean when it talks about the system?  What does 
it mean when it says the system is not sustainable?  Is this 
party refuting everything that was ever studied in terms of our 
health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the most in-depth review of our health care system in 
recent times, the National Forum on Health in its report “Canada 
Health Action” clearly states “We believe the health care 
system is fundamentally sound”.  What is behind the Alliance 
motion?  Is it questioning the system, that the medicare model is 
not sound?  Is there a hidden agenda?  Is this a clever way to 
create an illusion of concern for health care, all the while 
advancing the agenda of that party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care critic said that he has solutions which he will 
present.  We are really looking forward to those solutions, 
because all we have heard from those members to date are 
basically three models, and they are all variations of the two 
tier, Americanized style health care theme.  One is that we go to 
the welfare model.  Those of us who have the money would pay for 
our own and look after ourselves.  For those who do not, we would 
make sure they have health care.  There would be one system for 
the wealthy and one for the rest of us, and we can be sure who 
would get the best quality health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second option they have presented, which is equally 
suspicious in terms of any kind of integrity in its argument, is 
the notion of a parallel private health care system, with the 
argument that this would take pressure off our public system and, 
lo and behold, we would have a much more effective and efficient 
system which would be able to meet the needs of all Canadians in 
the future because those who could afford to pay would go their 
own way.  They say this, notwithstanding the fact that every 
study on the issue of private for profit institutions in health 
care and any study done on private parallel health care models 
shows absolutely and unequivocally that it is not more cost 
effective, that it is not more efficient and that people get left 
behind and fall between the cracks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third suggestion we sometimes hear from the Alliance members 
is something about a voucher system, that we should scrap the 
transfers and give everybody money and they can go out and buy 
whatever they need.  This is just like what they have advocated 
for education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would this build hospitals?  How would it build community 
clinics?  How would it provide public health care?  Who would pay 
for it?  Where would people go if they have the money and there 
is no infrastructure?  This is equally fallacious in the 
arguments because all of it would end up being a two tier health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the Alliance, what do they really mean when 
they talk about the present system not being sustainable?  Do 
they mean medicare?  Do they mean universal public health care? 
Or, do they mean something else?  Do they in fact question the 
very root of Canada's health care system?  Are they running 
counter to the sentiments of Canadians and throwing those 
longstanding values to the wind?  Are they in fact advocating 
something that Canadians absolutely abhor and would be repulsed 
by if it were put on the public agenda?  Are they trying to 
advance an agenda in a clever way, pretending to create concern 
for health care, when in fact they are not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the Liberals for a minute, it is too bad that we 
are not here debating a constructive proposal, an initiative to 
respond to this crisis.  All the Minister of Health does is stand 
in this House and say that there is no crisis.  He uses the 
report put out by the provincial and territorial health ministers 
just last week to say there is no crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He uses the report selectively, even though the report clearly 
leaves the impression that, with the rising costs in our health 
care system, we know that we could still manage the needs in our 
health care system if the federal government provided the 
leadership we have been calling for for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps in pure fiscal terms one could say that there is no 
crisis.  We have argued that if the government put the money 
where its mouth is we could sustain our health care system.  To 
say there is no crisis in health care is to totally deny the 
feelings, the sentiments and the experiences of Canadians.  The 
Liberals cannot do that.  They cannot stand in the House and say 
there is no crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could they say that to someone who has spent time on a 
gurney in a hallway waiting for medical attention?   How could 
they say that to someone who has had to be shipped to the United 
States for cancer treatment because we do not have the 
specialists in this country?  How could they say that to the 
families who are spending more and more out of their own pockets 
to cover prescription drugs and home care?  How could they say 
that to the Canadians who are now paying, on average, $36 per 
month for prescription drugs because the Liberal government has 
refused to advance the value of a universal health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that we do not have this government advocating a 
serious position in this parliamentary session.  It is too bad 
the Minister of Health did not have the courage that Monique 
Begin had in 1984 when we had a similar crisis.  What did she do? 
She brought legislation to this House.  She addressed the 
issues.  We had the debate and we moved forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to acknowledge the work of my colleague, the hon. member 
Winnipeg—Transcona, who was the health critic for the NDP at the 
time.  He did an enormous amount of work to ensure that the 
concerns of Canadians and the threats to medicare were brought to 
the attention of the government.  He worked actively to hold the 
federal government to account and to push for the kind of changes 
we finally saw in 1984 in the Canada Health Act.  That should be 
a lesson to the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech on March 29, 1983, the member said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of those rare opportunities one is presented with in 
political life, and I hope there are more, when one has been able 
to follow a political issue through what we might call a chapter 
in history—in this case of medicare.  I believe that chapter 
began in 1977.  What we are seeing now is an effort on the part 
of the federal Government to shore up and correct some of the 
consequences of the mistake it made in 1977— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that government could not have been here today in 
this parliamentary session with a similar piece of 
legislation—with an initiative to deal with the crisis at hand. 
What have we got instead?  This spread of mythology and 
propaganda about how transfer payments have not really been cut 
and all the money has been put back.  It is creating more and 
more antagonism at the federal-provincial level, instead of 
leaning toward a more co-operative approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the Liberals have to gain by continually denying the 
fact that there is a shortfall?  The Liberal government took the 
biggest single bite out of medicare funding in the history of 
this country in 1995.  What do they have to gain by saying that 
money has all been put back when it has not? That is where their 
selective reading of reports comes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the report which the health ministers delivered 
last week entitled “Understanding Canada's Health Care Costs”. 
The report clearly talks about the shortfall. 
There is no question that there is a $4.2 billion shortfall. What 
do we have to gain by not admitting it and getting on with the 
job?  It seems pretty straightforward if the government has the 
money, but it is obviously waiting for an opportune moment, 
probably an election.  Why does it not do it now when the crisis 
is at hand and we can get on with the job?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government not stand up to bill 11?  Why did it sit 
back and say, time and time again, that it was going to study it 
and take action when it had to?  The bill has now been passed and 
still the government has done nothing about it.  It is now going 
to wait to see how it will be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too late.  It is over and finished.  The Liberal 
government and the health minister will go down in history as 
being responsible for overseeing the death of medicare.  I say to 
them that they should wake up, start the debate and do something 
today.  Action is what we need, not more of the rhetoric that we 
have heard time and time again from the health minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to tell members our position.  We have advocated 
time and time again, not just for money to be added to the health 
care system, but that a twofold obligation and strategy on the 
part of government is required.  The government needs to at least 
keep its word in terms of restoring transfer payments and 
bringing some stability to the federal-provincial table to allow 
provinces to deal with the critical situation they are facing 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we need more.  We need leadership from the government 
to actually reform, renew and strengthen our medicare model.  We 
have presented idea after idea on how to achieve that.  We have 
talked about how one has to look at health care on a continuum 
and ensure that coverage is there for people who are in the 
hospital or outside of it.  We have talked about the need to 
address the root causes of ill health and trying to get the 
government to deal with the fact that poor health comes from 
poverty, and on that, we note the recent statistics and this 
government's record.  Ill health also comes from people living in 
deplorable housing situations or on the streets.  It comes from a 
lack of clean water, which we see on many of our reserves. It 
comes from many things and the government sits back and lets it 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have called on the government to do some very specific things 
when it comes to renewing our medicare model.  We believe that 
the medicare model is sustainable.  We believe that with 
financial commitment and political leadership we can sustain our 
health care.  If we look at all the studies, we know that when we 
invest in community care and preventative measures, and when we 
ensure that home care, pharmacare, community care and maybe even 
dental care are provided, we can sustain the system.  Would this 
not mean people would be less of a drain on our health care 
system in the long term? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system is one of the most cost effective and efficient in 
the world.  Let us keep it that way.  I agree with the Alliance, 
we do have a crisis.  I agree that we do have serious problems 
but it is not the public sector aspect of our health care system. 
It is because 30% of our health care system is now in private 
hands.  It is because drug costs have gone through the roof.  It 
is because the government and Alliance members, with their 
complicity, have not stood up to the multinational drug companies 
that have a hold over our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things we can do and much that can be done.  I 
hope that in presenting this motion the Alliance is genuine and 
sincere, and that it will state today that it is committed to the 
medicare model, that it will work to make it sustainable, that it 
believes in a universally accessible public health care system, 
and that it will join with us in championing this cause and 
ensuring that health care, the number one priority of Canadians, 
is addressed and addressed soon.

Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my 
colleague's speech.  I have always respected this colleague 
because she is obviously very passionate about health care and 
very focused on what needs to be done.  However, I was 
disappointed in her speech.  For some reason, she chose to spend 
the most of it in a diatribe, a rant against the Alliance Party, 
which is the only party that has brought forward the opportunity 
to talk about real, constructive proposals for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the hon. member that the Alliance members get 
sick and their families get sick.  They want health care and need 
health care.  They care about medical services as passionately 
and as deeply as any member of any other party.  I urge the NDP 
and the hon. member to focus their remarks and their fire on the 
government.  The government is the only one that can actually do 
something about this issue other than advise, which is what we 
have tried to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that to use half of a 20-minute speech to tear 
down an opposition party that is simply working honestly and 
openly with all parties to try to fix a broken system, is a 
misuse of time, which is pretty unwise and disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the member putting forward conspiracy theories, I 
noticed that she did make two suggestions:  first, that the 
government should put more money into health care; and second, 
that the government should show leadership in reforming and 
strengthening it.  That is exactly what this motion is about.  It 
is about reforming and strengthening the health care system to 
ensure that all Canadians have health care when they need it 
regardless of their ability to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member to focus on the solutions that we are 
trying to reach so that we can then put pressure on the 
government to actually do something.  I also would ask the member 
to spend a couple of minutes on solutions, for which can all get 
behind and support and which would really help Canadians, and not 
just more political rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to 
answer the question.  The first thing I want to say is that this 
is not the first opportunity we have had to debate these issues. 
The NDP has presented two previous motions and we have had two 
full days of debate.  We have presented options and solutions but 
we have not had the support of the Canadian Alliance.  One option 
was as fundamental as trying to get a change to the Canada Health 
Act to stop private for profit hospitals.  If that is not a 
concrete solution what is, given the crisis we are facing and the 
threat by American multinational corporations to get their 
tentacles into our health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried very hard over the last number of months to engage 
everyone in the House in this discussion.  I have not just 
focused on the Alliance.  I have focused just as much on the 
Liberal government.  I say, a pox on both your houses.  I worry 
when two parties start to sound exactly the same.  In fact they 
are both prepared to passively allow for the privatization of our 
health care system and oversee a climate of negligence.  That is 
the fundamental issue here.  We have presented many solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I was given another hour I could go into line and verse over 
the health care proposals offered by the New Democratic Party.  I 
could go into detail about how we believe home and community care 
should be an integral part of our national health care system.  I 
could talk about our plan for introducing a national pharmacare 
plan in conjunction with measures to contain drug costs.  I could 
go into our proposals for developing national health goals to 
guide co-ordinated action in collaboration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go into our proposals for creating new ways to integrate 
federal policy in support of national health goals.  I could talk 
about our proposal for establishing a ministry of state for 
public health within Health Canada.  I could talk about our 
proposal for a forum to work with all senior civil servants 
providing an integrated, co-ordinated approach to health policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about our proposal for requiring formal health 
impact assessments of all related federal policy.  I could talk 
about our need to democratize the development of health policy at 
the national level.  I could talk about our recommendation for 
appointing a national public health commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about our recommendations for stable funding for 
public education, policy research and advocacy for health 
consumer groups.  I could talk about the need for a broad public 
dialogue on the ethical challenges facing all of us in the face 
of these burgeoning technological changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about the specific suggestions we have for dealing 
with the absolute deplorable conditions among the remote and 
northern communities.  I could talk about the situation facing 
aboriginal communities and what needs to be done.  I could go for 
hours giving members very specific details— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Why didn't you? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  The member asks why I did not. I 
think I did a pretty good job outlining our proposals in my 
20-minute speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, all members of the Alliance have to understand that 
what is at stake here, first and foremost, is our ability to 
stand up and preserve medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have not heard, and what I am still waiting to hear from 
that party, is:  Does it or does not support the medicare model? 
Does it support universally accessible, publicly administered 
health care?  Do not give me the line that we do not have it now. 
We know we do not have totally universal health care system.  We 
know we have two tier health care.  We know we have people going 
to the States for coverage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  Where does reform stand on where we go in the 
future?  Do we try to deal with those problems?  Do we try to 
convince the federal government to not only put in more money but 
to show leadership around innovative ways to meet the needs of 
Canadians, or do we cave in, as the Alliance appears to be doing, 
to the forces of multinational corporations and the global 
corporate agenda, and actually say “the market is open, come in 
and get your share and let whoever goes by the wayside, let it 
be?”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the New Democratic member for 
Winnipeg North Centre speaks with passion about health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out a certain contradiction in what she is saying. 
Today, the House has before it a motion moved by the official 
opposition, the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is based on the assumption that the health care 
system is in a critical state, in crisis, and that, as a result, 
it needs to be overhauled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg North Centre waxes eloquent against the 
Canadian Alliance stand on health care but is getting ready to 
vote with the Canadian Alliance, against the government, on this 
motion.  I am trying to follow her logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you, who follow our debates closely, heard her as 
well as I did.  She spent most of her time shooting down in 
flames the positions of the Canadian Alliance and then, at the 
end, suggested that she was going to support the motion because 
the opposition parties must stand together.  Is she serious?  Is 
not her greatest threat the Canadian Alliance and its proposals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is well aware that the government has done everything 
necessary to maintain the basic characteristics of our health 
care system.  It is getting ready to increase the level of 
funding.  It is working with the provinces to improve the system. 
There will be more discussions this afternoon between ministers. 
She knows all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being told to listen to the provinces.  That is another 
contradiction because what are the provinces saying? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's publicly funded health care system is not in crisis. 
Canadians continue to be well served by their health care system, 
but it is under serious challenges due to rising demand, et 
cetera.  We know that.  This is what the provinces have said. 
Among the provinces, there are three governments led by the New 
Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are paying attention and listening to what the provinces are 
saying.  The system is not in crisis but we have to prepare new 
responses for the new challenges and new pressures we are feeling 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member 
did not catch all my remarks because I was speaking so quickly, 
but I want to be very clear about a couple of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we take umbrage with this government's suggestion that 
the system is not in crisis.  The member can argue the 
statistics.  Yes, I do have the report he quoted from and I do 
not disagree with him in terms of that selective quote.  However, 
as I have just said, the people who use the system, the people 
who want to know health care is there when they need it, are not 
at ease with what is happening.  They are worried, anxious and 
fearful.  When that kind of level of fear and anxiety occurs, we 
have a crisis.  Whether we can back it up in terms of statistical 
numbers or not, it is a human fact and it is a problem we have to 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Liberal parliamentary secretary tries to suggest 
that the whole system is sustainable.  We say that the medicare 
model is sustainable, and we have shown documents that back that 
up. The real question is, which was also stated in the provincial 
document the minister quoted from, that the rising need for 
additional health services is not sustainable without significant 
new federal funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we have said that there is a crisis in the 
health care system because of failed federal leadership and a 
climate of negligence.  We can address the problems and ensure 
that medicare is sustainable, but it takes the federal government 
to put its money where its mouth is and to show federal 
leadership and political courage.

want to thank the member and the party who introduced this 
motion.  I think it is a motion worthy of debate and it is a 
motion that most of us on this side of the House can and will 
support. 
Let us take a look at the wording in the motion.  I know the 
government has trouble with, but the motion reads:

same with our health care system.  It is in a crisis and the 
truth is that on the government's watch it has done nothing to 
save it.  It has not come up with any innovative ideas. Basically 
the government has been running on empty for seven years on this 
file.  The truth is that it is responsible for the state of 
anxiety that we are seeing in our health care system from coast 
to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We debated in the House bill 11 in Alberta.  We are hoping the 
government will take a position on it one way or the other.  The 
criticism we are throwing back at the government in relation to 
bill 11 is that it is forcing the provinces to perform radical 
surgery on their health care system.  The reason for this is that 
they have been in an animated state of suspension since 1993. 
The provinces have no idea where we are going on the health care 
file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most premiers probably believed that the Liberal red book 
promises in 1993 or in 1997 would count for something.  The 
Liberals promised to look after our cherished health care system, 
and obviously they have not.  It is just one more red book 
promise they have not honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to bill 11 in Alberta, it is simply a case of 
provinces doing what they have to do to salvage their health care 
system, to save their health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You may know, Mr. Speaker, a bit about the policies and 
platforms of the NDP.  From time to time I think you have made 
the statement that your party is sort of the father of health 
care.  We could talk about Diefenbaker and the work that our 
party and the Liberal Party did.  I think we all want to take 
credit for it, but the fact is that the NDP had a lot to do with 
the creation of health care in Canada.  It is a basic reality and 
we all acknowledge it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to preserve a health care system based on the five 
principles we often mention in this place:  universality, 
accessibility, comprehensiveness, portability and public 
administration.  We want to preserve it, as does your party, Mr. 
Speaker.  Horror of all horrors, yesterday in Saskatchewan, your 
home province, Premier Roy Romanow had to look this thing 
straight in the eye and say they had a problem and had to do 
something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from the <I>National Post</I>.  I know it is a 
newspaper that you and I do not have much love for from time to 
time, Mr. Speaker, but here is the story headlined “Health care 
under review in Saskatchewan”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commissioner appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier looks to remodel system, keep the dream alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan, which created medicare nearly 40 years ago, is 
launching a far-reaching review of health care that will include 
an examination of what services should be publicly funded.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most NDP members would have hid under their desks if they heard 
that a few years ago, and I would not have blamed them.  The 
truth is that the federal government is forcing the provinces to 
do exactly what the Premier of Saskatchewan would have to do: 
take a hard look at their expenses, where they are going and 
whether they can sustain the system.  My belief is that they 
cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the 1993 election this government extracted $17 
billion out of the system.  If it is allowed to stay in office 
until the year of 2001, it will have taken $30 billion out of the 
system.  No province, NDP, Liberal or Conservative, could live 
under that type of severe cutback to the funding of its health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that the provinces are the primary health care 
givers.  They depend on the federal government to help cost share 
health care.  When it was introduced many years ago it was a 
50:50 formula in which the federal government paid 50 cents on 
the dollar to help the provinces provide primary health care. The 
Liberal government has reduced that to an average of about 20 
cents on the dollar.  In some provinces it is as low as 15 cents 
on the dollar in terms of the federal share of health care 
spending.  It is not much wonder the system is in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider what is happening in New Brunswick in terms of 
the leadership of this government and what it has done in the 
last number of years.  I will quote from June 10 edition of the 
<I>Telegraph Journal</I>.  The health care minister of the 
province of New Brunswick, Dr. Dennis Furlong, has been in the 
health care field as a professional, as a doctor, for at least 25 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He is a good Newfoundlander. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  I am told he is a good Newfoundlander. 
That tells us something about the quality of care we will get in 
New Brunswick from this gentleman.  We are quite impressed with 
his credentials.  The story in the June 10 edition of the 
<I>Telegraph Journal</I> was headlined “Health-care cost spiral 
can't go on” and started out by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Minister Dennis Furlong expects the province's annual 
health-care bill to top $2 billion in five years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article indicated that was in the best case scenario because 
presently New Brunswick spends about $1.5 billion, which will 
rise to $2 billion in the best case scenario, and that the 
province would be forced to spend almost 50% on heath care for 
its citizens.  Referring to the federal government, the article 
continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We're at a stage now where we have to tell them that we can't go 
on.  If it continues to go on it's them that are putting pressure 
on the Canada Health Act, not the provinces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all of us in the House, at least those of us on this 
side, are in agreement with that issue.  The federal government 
is putting the provinces into a situation where they cannot 
sustain their system.  According to the article, Dr. Furlong went 
on to point out what was going on in Ontario in defence of his 
case: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Furlong said Ontario is estimating that 60 per cent of its 
provincial budget will be taken up by health care spending by the 
year 2010 unless something changes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have the premiers doing what is being done in 
Saskatchewan, as an example, it tells us something is wrong.  It 
tells us that these people across the aisle in the Liberal 
government have mismanaged that file despite the promises they 
made back in 1993 and 1997 via the red book.  That was a 
convenient sort of political thing to do, was it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go on.  In terms of criticism of the government Tom Kent, 
who is sort of the social architect of the Liberal Party and I 
believe a resident of Kingston, Ontario, and despite the fact 
that he is a Liberal, most of us in the House would agree has a 
social conscience. 
When people like Tom Kent speak most of us listen because he does 
have a statesmanlike stature about him on the issue of health 
care.  He said that federal action was required.  Brian Stewart 
on <I>The National</I> interviewed Tom Kent last evening on the 
news.  He said that federal action was required, because he is 
smart enough to know what the present Prime Minister does not 
understand, that the Liberals are in the driver's seat and that 
they have to show leadership on this issue.  They have not done 
so for seven consecutive years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What amazes me is that they are suddenly realizing that we had 
better start talking to the 10 provinces, our partners back home. 
We have to get them into the same room and come up with a 
solution.  It has taken them seven years to realize that there 
has to be some kind of meaningful dialogue between the provinces 
and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that they poisoned the atmosphere back in the 1993 
era when they started to make draconian cuts to health care after 
having promised that they would not do it in the 1993 election 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And then they bragged about balancing the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Exactly, and we know how they did it. 
It was on the backs of ordinary Canadians and on the backs of the 
health care system in our respective provinces.  Then they have 
the audacity to stand in the House and say that they balanced the 
books.  It is fine that they balanced the books, but at what 
expense?  It was at the expense of putting our health care system 
in a crisis situation from which we may not be able to recover if 
these people stay in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obvioulsy there is a solution to the problem: replace them when 
the next election comes around.  That is what we are hoping we 
can do because we need federal leadership in this regrd.  That is 
exactly what Tom Kent was talking about last evening and 
continually spoke about over the last five or six years after 
witnessing the horrible things his party did to the health care 
system.  I am saying good for Tom Kent.  He should keep speaking 
up because those are the types of people we want to hear from on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting point about the cutbacks in the 1993 to 1997 era 
and the damage they did to the health care system is that the 
provinces had nothing to say about it.  The government just 
simply went ahead and did it.  The provinces suddenly woke up to 
find that the money was not there and asked how it could be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, every member of the Liberal caucus nodded in silent 
agreement as the government did it.  They stood on their hind 
legs in this place and supported those draconian cutbacks to our 
health care system.  That is deplorable.  As Liberals, I do not 
know how they could have sat there and allowed it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for St. John's West certainly knows the Premier 
of Newfoundland who campaigned hard via another candidate to try 
to keep that member out of the House of Commons but did not 
succeed.  The Premier of Newfoundland, for goodness' sake, stood 
in this place in 1995 and voted for cutbacks to the health care 
system.  Now he is regretting it.  One of the strongest critics 
of the federal government in terms of what it has done to health 
care is the Premier of Newfoundland.  He goes by the name of 
Brian Tobin, just for the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals bragged last year when the budget came down about 
putting $11.5 billion in the health care budget.  In writing 
about last year's budget in the February 3 edition of <I>The 
Globe and Mail</I> Jeffrey Simpson stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who believed the $11.5 billion pledged in the last budget 
would suffice did not understand the economics of health. That 
increase amounted to a 4% yearly increase in public sector health 
care spending.  Four per cent is about the medical inflation 
rate, so the additional spending would only prevent the system 
from deteriorating further.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone a year with $11.5 billion which would basically 
keep up with inflation, if it did that; in some jurisdictions it 
did not even do that.  This year the government put in $2.5 
billion to keep the system going for four years.  It was $2.5 
billion over four years or take it all up front.  For example, if 
the province of New Brunswick took it up front, it would keep its 
system going three days.  It is the same in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not leadership.  That is attempting to salvage political 
careers.  That is exactly what the Prime Minister is famous for 
doing.  The Liberals did the same thing in 1997 on the eve of the 
federal election.  When the Liberals were in trouble right up to 
their eyebrows, they came up with a deathbed reprieve.  They 
suddenly threw a bunch of money into health care to make up a 
fraction of what they had taken out of it, only a fraction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what is wrong with the system.  It is ad hoc, 
make it up as they go along, fly by the seat of their pants. Our 
leader Joe Clark is suggesting that we have a sixth principle in 
addition to the ones I mentioned.  That principle would be 
predictable sustainable funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No business can run that way.  A business cannot be run by 
saying, “We do not have a plan.  We are just going to run and 
hope that it works”. Usually when someone runs a business like 
that, at the end of a year or two it is bankrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Liberals have done with health care.  They have 
bankrupted it because of no direction, no ideas and no plan. They 
have done it now for seven solid years.  In the meantime, they 
have poisoned the atmosphere with the provinces. The Prime 
Minister cannot get into the same room with the first ministers 
or the health ministers to solve the problem.  Why? They do not 
trust him.  Would anyone trust him?  It is like someone who 
sneaks into a house in the middle of the night and steals the 
furniture.  That is what he has done with health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a couple of things about the health minister. On a 
personal basis I like him.  He is a good man.  There is no 
question about that.  He is very articulate, well coifed, well 
dressed, maybe not rock solid on this file but he is a good 
person nonetheless.  I am not attacking him on a personal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he reminds me of is the little man on the wedding cake. He 
is properly dressed, well attired, like the perfect little 
gentleman on the wedding cake.  That is exactly how the Prime 
Minister treats him.  But the icing is melting.  The Prime 
Minister does not give his minister one ounce of support.  How he 
could stand up in this House day in and day out and prop up a 
Prime Minister that pulls the legs out from under him on a 
routine basis, I cannot fathom.  I cannot understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were the Minister of Health, I would resign.  I would not 
allow the system to deteriorate or allow someone to take a 
wrecking ball to the system under my watch.  If the Prime 
Minister wanted to do it, he could go ahead but it would not be 
on my shoulders.  If I were the health minister, that is exactly 
what I would say to the Prime Minister.  I would walk up to him 
with my resignation in my hand and tell him to show some 
leadership on this issue and do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the issues in this country, this is the number one issue 
on the minds of Canadians.  As the minister mentioned this 
morning, and I agree with him, we do not want to go down the road 
of Americanization of the Canadian health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an article which states that the American people are 
one sickness away from bankruptcy.  I live right next to the 
American border.  I have worked in the United States.  I have 
lived there and some of my family members have been bankrupted by 
the American system. 
That is one point on which we agree.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member used a lot of general terms, such as provide 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know that when the government was elected in 
1993 one of its platforms was the creation of the national forum 
on health.  During the national forum on health study the best 
health care experts in the country worked for two years 
consulting with Canadians.  One of the findings in the report 
issued at the end of 1996 was that money was not the problem. 
There was enough money in the system.  It was how wisely were we 
spending it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also said that we should provide leadership and work 
with the provinces.  That is exactly what the Minister of Health 
has done.  There have been consultations already with the 
provinces.  There is a meeting tomorrow.  In September the first 
ministers will be meeting to finalize the discussions and 
negotiations on health care between the federal and provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Conservative approach?  It is not a matter of money, 
even though our funding has increased to $30 billion this year 
compared to $28 billion back in 1993.  What does the member's 
party propose?  In one of the reports on poverty the member's 
party said to increase the transfers under CHST but only if the 
provinces matched that money.  In other words, let us only give 
it to those provinces who can afford to match some federal 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously it is just another case of a two tier system: 
improvements for provinces that have money and no improvements 
for those who do not.  How does the member square his policy with 
the need for leadership? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is nothing like a 
lynching in the morning to focus the mind. That is exactly what 
is happening on the health care issue. The government knows full 
well that it has mishandled it for seven years.  The lynching of 
course is the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are smart enough to know that unless they do 
something about it, they are in big trouble.  Support for the 
Liberals is about a mile wide and an inch deep.  The witness to 
this is sitting next to me, the member for St. John's West.  The 
Liberals went into the byelection 25 percentage points ahead and 
that member beat them.  Why?  Because a mile wide and an inch 
deep is what their support amounts to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money alone cannot fix the system. We are smart enough to know 
that.  Our leader has stated that.  We need innovative ideas and 
leadership which Joe Clark is prepared to do. He did that in the 
House of Commons in 1979 when he had a four year plan to lead the 
country out of debt and people rejected it.  It was a bold 
initiative which he took at great political risk.  He is prepared 
to do the same thing on the health care file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point we agree on is money alone  will not fix it, but the 
government is bereft of ideas.  The slogan in the next election 
should be, no ideas, no votes.  It is as simple as that.  If the 
Liberals do have an idea, they should be committed to keeping it. 
The electorate should hold the Liberals' feet to the fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting more into economics than health care, but the 
Liberals railed against the GST in 1993.  How many Liberals said, 
“If we get elected we are going to eliminate it”.  Today the 
GST brings in $22 billion in revenue.  If that is added to the 
$30 billion they have taken out of health care at the end of 
their tenure, that is $52 billion.  I could balance the books 
with that set of numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all phoney baloney.  They have nothing to brag about on 
this file.  They are going to bankrupt the system and health care 
truthfully is in a crisis.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my colleague from the Conservative Party made 
reference to Saskatchewan Premier Romanow and the great job the 
NDP are attempting to do in the face of the massive cuts by the 
Liberals in terms of health transfers.  As a matter of fact he 
made reference to the historic fact that Saskatchewan led the way 
by initiating medicare and starting a medicare plan for all of 
its citizens a full six years before NDP and CCF members of 
parliament persuaded the federal government to adopt such a 
program for all citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan again is taking the lead in defining a new vision 
of medicare to meet the challenges of the 21st century.  Premier 
Romanow for a couple of years now has been pushing for a national 
review of the medicare system to improve it.  He now plans to 
concentrate on what is important in Saskatchewan because the 
federal government refuses to look at this issue in a 
comprehensive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the premier announced the commission on medicare. 
The commission will be headed by health consultant Ken Fyke and 
will identify challenges facing medicare, outline potential 
solutions and engage the public and health care providers in a 
discussion of new ideas. The premier said that Saskatchewan 
pioneered publicly funded, publicly administered health care in 
Canada and today Saskatchewan once again leads the way in finding 
solutions to strengthen medicare and protect its core values into 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats believe very strongly that a family's health 
should never have to depend upon a family's wealth.  This is the 
underpinning of our support for medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Conservative colleague who just gave his remarks on this 
issue was a member of the Mulroney government which initiated a 
plan of consecutive three year cuts to the health transfers to 
the provinces.  The plan of the Mulroney Conservative 
administration, which was roundly rejected by Canadians in the 
1993 federal election, would have made Canadians not just money 
deprived in terms of health care by this year, but it would have 
eliminated any transfers to the provinces for health care by the 
year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member from the Conservative Party share with the 
House whether he supported that initiative of the Conservatives? 
His leader Joe Clark supports bill 11 in Alberta to privatize 
health care.  Does he support his leader on that issue?  Does he 
agree with the byelection results in Edmonton, which was run on 
the issue of bill 11 where the NDP candidate won with 60% of the 
vote in the Conservative province of Alberta?  I look forward to 
his answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, some if not all of what 
the member had to say is inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the transfers from the federal government, when we 
were in power from 1988 to 1993, as an example we planned to cut 
back on the rate of increase.  For example, we would project a 5% 
increase in transfers to the provinces which might go to 4%.  The 
NDP took that as a cutback.  NDP members are very selective in 
their use of figures.  This is one case where I agree with the 
member for Calgary—Nose Hill.  Today, the point is that the feet 
of the government in power should be held to the fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of Joe Clark's position, that is totally inaccurate. 
Joe Clark supports the five principles of health care.  He 
suggested a sixth one, which no other leader has been brave 
enough to do.  We are convinced that to solve this crisis we have 
to have open and honest dialogue and that also means open and 
honest dialogue for the NDP premier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about Roy Romanow and I tried to be generous, but with 
those kinds of remarks from the NDP member, it is pretty hard to 
be generous.  The truth is that Roy Romanow will have to do the 
horror of all horrors.  He will have to define what will be paid 
for by the province.  I mentioned this in a speech in the House 
about a month ago, long before the NDP knew what Roy Romanow 
would do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that he will shorten the list of services that will 
be provided by the province of Saskatchewan.  The truth is that 
he is being forced to do it by the federal government.  It is no 
different from any other premier.  It is no different from Ralph 
Klein in terms of bill 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically Ralph Klein said that he did not want to do it but was 
being forced to do it.  I am sure Roy Romanow does not want to do 
what he will do, but he is forced to do it.  On that we could 
agree, but I am disappointed in the tone and the comments made by

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a privilege to enter the debate.  There are two 
parts of it that I find disconcerting.  Probably the most 
significant part is that the government of the day does not seem 
to accept the idea that health care is in crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the liberty to get an official definition of the word 
crisis.  There are two parts to the definition which are very 
significant.  A crisis is defined as a decisive moment or a time 
of danger or great difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time the health care system is in danger.  Is 
it the system that is in danger or is it the people who are in 
danger?  I would suggest that it is the people of Canada who are 
in danger because the health care system is failing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to approach the definition of crisis from the point of 
view of the five principles of the health care system as laid out 
in the Canada Health Act.  Those principles are accessibility, 
portability, universality, comprehensiveness and public 
administration.  I want to look at each of them in turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great danger is that what we are told we have and what we 
believe we have in terms of health care coverage is not what in 
fact we have.  It is a bit like buying an insurance policy on a 
vehicle, thinking that there is appropriate and sufficient 
coverage for public liability, property damage and things of that 
sort, and then discovering when an accident occurs that the 
policy does not cover such things.  What we thought we had we do 
not have.  That is very dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought we had accessibility.  The Minister of Health 
suggests that the health care system is not in crisis, that we 
have the five principles and that is exactly what it is all 
about.  That is not the case.  It is a bit like having a child 
showing the symptoms of an illness and the parent denying the 
symptoms by simply saying that the child is not sick.  If the 
child is really sick the child's life is in danger.  If we do not 
deal with it at the time, by the time we are prepared to do so it 
may be too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time is now to recognize that we have a problem.  It is up 
to the minister and the government to recognize that we have a 
problem.  We are in a crisis situation.  The people of Canada are 
in danger.  If we ask the people of Canada whether they think 
Canadian health care is where it ought to be, they will tell us 
that it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it mean the health care that is delivered is not delivered 
well?  No.  There are very good practitioners in Canada.  I 
recently received some treatment from some specialists and they 
were extremely competent.  The difficulty is to get it. It is not 
universally accessible.  Accessibility should be available when 
it is needed, not some time in the future.  That is a very 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the example of a gentleman who went to his family 
doctor and said that he had severe abdominal pain.  The doctor 
looked at him and said that he would have to be referred to a 
specialist, which is what he did.  When he went to see the 
specialist he could hardly make it up the stairs.  There was no 
elevator.  He was doubled over in pain by the time he got there, 
and without even looking at him the receptionist asked him if he 
were a patient of the doctor.  He said no.  In that case, he was 
told, he would have to wait at least nine months before the 
doctor could see him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man thought he had a health care system and he thought he 
would get service.  He reminded the receptionist that he had a 
referral from his general practitioner, and she told him that he 
could not see the doctor for at least nine months. 
He left that doctor's office and 10 days later he was in the 
emergency ward of a hospital and within two days was dead.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1997 there has been a 30% increase in the people waiting 
for care.  In 1998 a total of 212,990 Canadians were waiting for 
care.  In 1993 the average waiting time was 9.3 weeks.  In 1998, 
five years later, the average wait was 13.3 weeks.  That is an 
increase of 43% in a matter of five years.  People wait for up to 
nine months to see a specialist, such as in the case I just 
mentioned.  There are huge shortages in technologies like the 
MRI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to another incident that happened recently.  We have two 
health care delivery systems in Kelowna, the general hospital and 
the cancer centre.  There is an MRI machine at each of those 
locations.  One of the machines broke down.  Were the patients 
allowed to go to the other institution for treatment?  No.  They 
did not have the people to run the MRI in one case and the others 
were idle.  Could they bring them over?  No.  It was a 
jurisdictional dispute.  This is serious business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say that is not the health minister's concern.  It is 
not directly his concern, but indirectly it is because there is 
an attitude out there that somehow the system is not geared to 
the patient but is geared to some other standard that has nothing 
to do with the patient.  That is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle under the Canada Health Act is portability. 
How portable is it?  I want to review a couple of facts.  Any 
Canadian has the right to be treated for an injury that happens 
anywhere in Canada.  The concept or the principle is that we 
should have treatment anywhere in Canada.  People living in 
Newfoundland, British Columbia or the Northwest Territories 
should have access to health care anywhere in Canada.  It should 
not matter where their health cards were issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless something has happened in the last couple of hours, 
Quebec patients outside that province are required to pay upfront 
because their government did not sign the portability agreement 
and cannot be counted on to pay.  That is very serious issue.  I 
looked around a bit to see if this were really the case, and it 
is.  If Quebec chooses it will pay claims at the rates set in 
Quebec regardless of the cost of the service provided elsewhere. 
Many other people who go out of the province have difficulties 
getting medical treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happened to come across a family of a child that came from 
Quebec who had contracted some kind of illness in Manitoba.  The 
child was taken to the medical clinic and the family was asked to 
pay upfront.  The individuals said they were on a trip across 
Canada, for which they had saved over the last 10 years.  They 
really wanted to travel across Canada.  If they had to pay 
upfront they would have to spend their money on the health bill 
and would be unable to complete their journey.  That was a 
serious infringement on what they thought they had.  They thought 
they had portability but they did not.  It is very serious when 
that sort of thing happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third principle is universality, which really means that all 
kinds of issues are covered.  What about access in a rural 
community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I apologize for 
interrupting the hon. member, but is he sharing his time with 
another colleague? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Yes, I will be sharing my time.  I 
will deal with the other two principles.  On the comprehensive 
nature of our public health care system, a lot of provinces have 
had to delist services.  If we are to have a comprehensive system 
virtually all services originally listed should be retained.  It 
should not be arbitrarily decreased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about public administration?  The largest expenditure in 
the health care system is the cost of administration of 
hospitals.  In British Columbia it is about 58% of health care 
costs and the budgeting is done on the basis of global funds. 
A global budget provision splits the administrators and the 
government into two negotiating teams.  The administrators say 
that they need more money than they had last year and the 
government says they have to get by with less.  The patient is 
lost in this battle between the negotiating teams.  It is not in 
the interest of the patient.  That has to be examined very 
carefully.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this something that the Minister of Health can do alone?   It 
is not.  He should recognize that there is a crisis. 
Unfortunately, human nature being what it is, he will do nothing. 
None of us will do anything until we recognize that there is a 
problem and that we need to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister needs to do something.  The government needs to do 
something.  If we achieve nothing else today, hopefully we will 
impress upon the minister that something has to be done.  He has 
to get together with the provinces to get it done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I think most hon. members would 
agree it is fair to say that health care is the number one issue 
for most Canadians.   Political parties grapple and posture over 
the Canada Health Act, medicare and the delivery of health 
services.  The public sees through most of this and in many ways 
is far ahead of the political parties in terms of understanding 
the major problems in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I was in Nova Scotia last week and met a middle 
aged woman with undiagnosed recent loss of feeling in her 
midsection and legs.  This is obviously a major concern to her 
and to her family.  The doctor's office triumphantly phoned her 
to say that it had obtained an appointment for her for an MRI on 
November 5, five months away.  These Canadians will be forced to 
go to Bangor, Maine, and pay approximately $2,500 on demand for 
an MRI.  Any reasonable analysis would conclude it should be a 
priority necessity of health care delivery.  This is not an 
isolated story.  This story could be replicated across the 
country.  In B.C. they would go to Seattle or to Spokane rather 
than to Bangor, Maine, and so on from west to east. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public knows full well that there is rationing and that is a 
two tier system is in play big time already.  Politicians who 
close their eyes or reject this reality are doing a great 
disservice.  We have seen evidence of that happening here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer for Canada lies in harnessing the best delivery 
mechanisms for all Canadians at a cost society can afford.  No 
Canadian should be denied basic health care delivery.  Nor should 
Canadians who wish to step outside the public health care 
delivery system be told they cannot do so.  We do not tell the 
Vancouver Canucks, the Toronto Maple Leafs or the Montreal 
Canadiens that their hockey clubs cannot have their private 
hyperbaric chambers or that they cannot have their team doctor, 
do we? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reiterate the official opposition supply day motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the health care system of Canada is in 
crisis, the status quo is not an option, and the system that we 
have today is not sustainable; and, accordingly, that this House 
call on the government to develop a plan to modernize the 
Canadian health care system, and work with the provinces to 
encourage positive co-operative relations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a reasonable and progressive motion.  Yet the Minister 
of Health has already indicated the government will not buy into 
supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are health care hypocrites and hypocrites 
generally.  The 1997 Liberal red book stated that the Liberals 
would not allow a two tier health care system and that they were 
committed to a continuing role in the financing of medicare. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal track record on financing health care? The 
provinces know their federal transfers have been cut since 1993. 
The Liberals spin the numbers and say, “Well, no, not really”. 
Meanwhile, the naked truth is that the Liberals cut health care 
to avoid other program reductions in the 1990s in order to 
balance the annual budget.  The deficit was eliminated by the 
finance minister by off-loading a bigger burden for medicare onto 
the provinces, and the Liberals have never made good for those 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberals want to portray themselves as the great 
defenders of medicare and place impossible constraints on the 
provinces.  The provinces are in an increasingly difficult set of 
circumstances and we are witnessing some things that are coming 
from that.  We have bill 11 in Alberta.  The Saskatchewan health 
care review was announced yesterday.  All the provinces are 
demanding that the federal government reinstate funding to 1993 
levels before the provincial governments will co-operate on other 
issues with the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care delivery is a provincial responsibility.  The only 
way to focus on the patient is to encourage the provinces and the 
federal government to check their politics at the door and 
concentrate on stabilizing the funding and modernizing the Canada 
Health Act.  This will only happen through innovation on the part 
of provinces and a flexible federal government that provides 
freedom to the provinces to push ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a partial strategy that we should consider.  The 
provinces need leadership from the federal government to help 
orchestrate change.  Respecting the existing jurisdictional 
framework is the surest way to begin building a sustainable, 
enviable health care system.  The long term funding base must be 
restored.  The provinces are calling for a $4.2 billion annual 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The feds must initiate relations with the provinces to support 
and encourage a health care system that works in the best 
interests of Canadians.  Co-operation is the key but that is not 
what we have been seeing coming from the government recently, in 
particular from the minister.  We must dedicate our efforts to a 
universal, portable, comprehensive and accessible health care 
system.  Does that remind you of the Canada Health Act, Madam 
Speaker?  It certainly does to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must examine the roles of administration for better 
efficiency, productiveness, and overall better service for the 
patient.  We must create standards and independent auditing for 
greater transparency and delivery of health care.  Without that 
transparency we do not have accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our present health care delivery system has one fatal flaw: the 
average consumer who utilizes that service has no idea what that 
service actually costs.  If the consumer does not know that, most 
often the deliverer does not know that either.  One cannot begin 
to reform a system until both sides of that equation are well 
aware of what the costs are.  Canadians deserve no less.  Health 
care hypocrites, like the Minister of Health, should actually get 
out of the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to review the five basic principles of the Canada 
Health Act, in particular the accessibility provisions.  In 1993 
we had an average wait of 9.3 weeks and in 1998 it went up to 
13.3 weeks.  People are waiting up to nine months to see a 
specialist.  We are also losing on the technology front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I gave an example of what is happening with MRI waiting 
lists in Canada and how different it is from the U.S.  We are 
failing on that score.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of universality, I have pointed out in this place and 
in correspondence how remote communities are so discriminated 
against in terms of their ability to access health care.  Very 
often it is the federal government, which is removing federal 
infrastructure, that is actually working against the universality 
of health care provision by its other actions.  I have a major 
concern on that front.  The government is really not addressing 
that and, in many ways, is discriminating against remote 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final thing I want to talk about is public administration. 
Eighty per cent of health care costs are labour component, 
whether it is doctors, nurses or administrators, and we must look 
at that whole area in a constructive fashion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to ask my colleague in the Canadian Alliance 
whether or not he is familiar with the announcement made 
yesterday by Premier Roy Romanow in my province of Saskatchewan. 
Does the member support the initiative taken there, which is to 
establish a commission that will spend the next six months doing 
a study, issuing an interim report and then a final report in one 
year's time?  All that is within the parameter of abiding by the 
principles of the Canada Health Act and perhaps expanding those 
principles in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing about the Saskatchewan study is that it 
believes in a single tier system, which is the premise of health 
care in the country, and a publicly financed system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member is probably aware, medicare was started in the 
province of Saskatchewan by former Premiers Woodrow Lloyd and 
Tommy Douglas of the NDP and CCF, and, of course, carried on 
through Allan Blakeney and now Roy Romanow.  Saskatchewan once 
again is the only province that has struck a commission to do a 
study on the future of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to know if the the member supports the Saskatchewan 
initiative and the parameters of the study.  Does he think it 
would be a helpful example for the federal government to perhaps 
emulate at the national level? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I did touch on that 
initiative in my speech and I do support it.  I think the 
provinces are actually doing things in a vacuum from the 
standpoint that the federal government should actually be the one 
providing the leadership for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the premier of Saskatchewan was asked that question last 
night, he said the same thing.  He agreed and was hoping that the 
province of Saskatchewan's initiative would move the federal 
government to show leadership and launch a similar national 
review.  We agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are doing things that they have no choice but to 
do at this point because they have a disproportionate share of 
the burden.  It has all happened in a hurry.  They have had to 
increase their spending and take on added responsibilities at a 
time when the cost of delivering health care was escalating 
anyway.  It is crunch time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think it is very 
important that the Saskatchewan study is within the confines of 
the principles of the Canada Health Act.  It is important for us 
to have a public health care system and not a two tier American 
style system.  We need to have a single payer system, which is 
the public.  Health care must be accessible to everyone.  Health 
care must be portable.  Access to health care must not be based 
on income, where one lives, the size of one's bank account or the 
thickness of one's wallet.  Those things are extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that is very important is that the federal 
government provide more funding for health care.  Many years ago, 
when health care came in as a national program, the federal 
government funded 50% of the cost.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in terms of cash transfers to the provinces, the federal 
government funds 13 cents, 14 cents or perhaps 15 cents to the 
provinces depending on the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to maintain health care as a universal program 
that is accessible to all, portable and publicly financed, then 
the federal government, with its huge and ballooning surplus, 
must come to the plate and put $4.2 billion more into the fund 
every year.  This would be equivalent to the money it has taken 
out over the last number of budgets.  I think that is very 
important. I hope my friend in the Alliance Party would support 
that point of view as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I can only conclude that 
the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle did not hear my speech because 
I did touch on basically all of those issues and I do support the 
$4.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one concern I have with the member's comment deals with what 
I call the mantra of the single payer system from the standpoint 
that if there is not a pre-existing two tier system in 
Saskatchewan right now, then it is the only province that does 
not have it.  Canadians are buying health care with their own 
money where they choose because they have no choice but to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>   Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to address the motion today. 
Let us remember what is important for Canadians.  This issue 
comes down to access to high quality care in our public and 
universal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians value our health care system above all other social 
programs and it is what sets us apart from other countries around 
the world.  To achieve that, Canadians expect governments to work 
together, openly and with transparency.  A lot of work has been 
done between the federal, provincial and territorial governments 
in the past, and that is how this government intends to approach 
the health care system renewal now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two years alone much concrete work has been done to 
lay the foundation for sustaining Canada's health care system and 
the health of Canadians.  In September 1998 the federal health 
minister, with provincial and territorial ministers of health, 
agreed to a number of key federal, provincial and territorial 
priorities to facilitate governments working more closely and 
collaboratively.  Ministers identified the following future 
directions and key priorities and emphasized the need to achieve 
concrete results and improve accountability to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers agreed to joint action on maintaining a financially 
sustainable, publicly funded Canadian health care system; 
supporting high quality, integrated and continuing community 
based health services; implementing population approaches to 
improve the health of Canadians; promoting the development and 
efficient use of information and research technology, and planning 
and reporting systems; and, collaborating in areas such as 
health, human resource planning, identifying best service 
practices, research evaluation, primary care reform and public 
health policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At their 1999 September meeting, federal, provincial and 
territorial ministers of health reviewed the work accomplished 
and noted concrete progress on their joint priorities. They 
endorsed intensified collaborative work in primary care reform as 
an essential element to ensuring the sustainability and 
accessibility of our health care system; tasked federal, 
provincial and territorial officials with preparing options for 
strengthening the development of the health human resource 
professionals; and, undertook to improve collaboration between 
governments and health care providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of that commitment, last November the Minister of Health 
co-chaired meetings of health ministers and representatives of 
the medical and nursing professions.  Furthermore, in the past 
year federal, provincial and territorial ministers of health 
released by significant reports on the health of Canadians and 
the importance of investing in early childhood development; 
endorsed a national strategy for collaborative action on tobacco 
controls in Canada; released several reports on pharmaceutical 
issues to ensure that drug prices are fair and reasonable, and 
that drugs are prescribed and used appropriately; and, approved 
the establishment of a council of organ and tissue donation and 
transplantation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I also point out that I will be splitting my time 
with my colleague from Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial ministers of health noted that the 
federal-provincial-territorial ministers meetings in the fall of 
1999 were productive.  They supported strategic direction in the 
ministers' key priority areas such as sustainability of the 
health care system, health human resources and preparation for an 
aging population.  Today, 12% of Canadians are now over the age 
of 65.  This is obviously a very important area and initiative we 
will work on with our provincial and territorial colleagues. This 
is only a partial accounting of the depth and breadth of the 
federal-provincial-territorial collaboration of the health sector 
on important health issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed and dedicated to working with the 
provinces and territories to find common solutions to ensure the 
future of the publicly funded health care system for the benefit 
of Canadians.  I stress that does not mean that as important and 
complex issues are being considered, there is not room for 
different points of view to be expressed and for open and frank 
discussions to take place.  Our focus is to renew the public 
health care system. Working together on joint objectives and 
priorities, consultation, and transparent information sharing are 
some of the ways to strengthen the collaborative partnership. 
This is what the government will continue to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the health minister have spoken about the 
Government of Canada's commitment to sustaining, strengthening 
and preserving public health care in Canada.  The federal 
minister is actively working with provincial and territorial 
ministers to lay the groundwork for an agreement on health by 
first ministers this fall.  The federal minister has had positive 
one on one discussions with provincial and territorial ministers. 
He is speaking with them collaboratively this week to continue 
their dialogue and to set out a concrete plan of action to 
prepare recommendations on health for the first ministers' 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are confident that this important work will succeed in 
ensuring that the kinds of broad innovations that are necessary 
to renew health care in this country are put in place with the 
support of all governments acting together in the interest of all 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague. He 
made a number of very good points as they relate to health care 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has done research and information gathering in his own riding 
and perhaps other parts of Ontario near and close to where he 
lives.  Could he confirm for me whether Canadians really do want 
the federal government simply to throw more money at health care 
or whether, as I believe, people in his riding and elsewhere 
would rather see the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments roll up their sleeves and work together to come up 
with a strategic long term plan?  Once that was done, then put in 
the money, the resources necessary to sustain that plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is very learned and one with great experience. 
He was head of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and he 
has a great wealth of knowledge. I wonder if he could comment on 
that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Madam Speaker, I had the pleasure a 
few weeks ago to attend the Federation of Canadian Municipalities 
annual convention.  Many mayors and councillors gave me the same 
message which was very clear.  Canada's health care system needs 
more than tinkering with.  We need to deal with the structure. 
Money alone will not solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that when we talk about pharmacare, primary 
care and a lot of the structural issues that are delivered by the 
provinces and territories, we as a federal government are 
prepared to talk two streams.  One is money, but most important, 
is to make sure that this time next year or even five years from 
now we are not talking about the same structural issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clarify an erroneous impression given by my colleague 
from the New Democratic Party.  This government does not give 13 
cents, 12 cents or 15 cents on the dollar.  I would point out it 
is a combination of cash and tax credits.  The provinces very 
conveniently forget about tax points and tax credits because they 
know they total about 33 cents to 34 cents that the federal 
government contributes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to solve the problem, as my hon. colleague 
suggested, we have to make sure that those issues are solved for 
future generations.  This is too important an issue to simply 
talk money which we have already indicated we are prepared to do. 
But we cannot do one and not do the other.  We must solve it for 
the future.  That is what the government intends to do. That is 
what the government will do. With the support of Canadians and 
the provinces and territories, we will get the job done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with great honour to participate in this 
debate.  This issue is of great interest not only to me and to 
all members in the House, but to Canadians wherever they live in 
this great country of ours.  We must ensure that we look at the 
whole issue of health care and that we have the facts straight 
when it comes to the things the federal government is doing in 
this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us will agree that the state of health care in Canada is 
the most important and pressing question in the country today. 
Canadians wherever they live are looking for leadership.  They 
are looking not only to the provincial and territorial 
governments, but to the federal government as well to play a 
leading role in this important area and justifiably so. It is 
something that is so fundamental.  It goes to the very core of 
who we are as a people and who we are as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians wherever they live expect the federal government and 
its territorial and provincial partners to work together to make 
sure that there is a health care system in place not only for us 
now, but for our children and our children's children.  Canadians 
expect that and rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to everyone to redouble their efforts to make it happen 
and to make it work.  We must get together and have the meetings 
required to set the long term strategy in place.  It is too easy 
simply to throw money at the system.  I have travelled in the 
last little while in British Columbia, New Brunswick and 
Newfoundland and I can tell the House that people in all of those 
places are consistent in what they say.  They do not want us 
simply to throw money at the problem. They want us to put in 
place a long term strategy and a good plan.  They want us to put 
in place a long term view as opposed to simply throwing money at 
the system now.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once that plan and long range vision is secured and most people 
have agreed to it in terms of what we should do and how we should 
do it, then put the necessary resources and money behind it to 
make sure that it happens.  It should not be just for the short 
term, but a sustained process where people can look with 
confidence at the health care system and know that it will be in 
place for a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be justifiably proud of our great health care system.  We 
do not have to travel very far around the world to know that we 
take an awful lot for granted here in Canada, and health care is 
one of the things we take for granted.  Yes, there are problems. 
Yes, we need to make adjustments.  Yes, we need to work with 
others.  Yes, we need to adjust the whole system to tailor it 
into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of new things happening in technology. 
Demographics change and affect the system. All kinds of things 
need to be done.  We need to double or triple our efforts to make 
sure that it happens and put in place the long term plan and 
strategy and then put the money in place to sustain it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, along with the residents of Waterloo—Wellington and others, 
insist and demand that the federal government take a lead role. I 
am confident that is precisely what we are doing now and in 
projections into the future we will certainly do precisely that. 
That is what Canadians expect of the federal government in this 
all important area.  It is a fundamental core value of this great 
country of ours that people go out of their way to proclaim and 
to celebrate.  It is certainly something I celebrate and I know 
other members do as well, and we do so because it is of such 
great value to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New demands are being placed on the system.  I have already 
mentioned demographics and how they  will affect the health care 
system in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk in terms of care being delivered in new 
ways. With new technology and new things happening, that is 
precisely what is taking place.  We need to be part of that. That 
is why when we developed the Canadian Institutes of Health 
Research in Bill C-13, we did it with vision and foresight. Under 
those institutes all kinds of things will be coming out, new 
medical procedures, new cures for diseases and new technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to take a back seat to anyone when it comes to 
medical science and the great medical community that is right 
here in this country.  One of the proudest things I did as 
chairman of the health committee was to call in witnesses from 
the United States.  There were five of them.  Young Canadians had 
gone to the United States for experience and might have stayed, 
but as a result of Bill C-13 and the Canadian Institutes of 
Health Research, they are coming back to Canada to bring the 
knowledge gained in other places, in this case the United States, 
back to their home country.  How very, very proud we can be of 
those young people and the others who will do the same as a 
result of the good work of the government when it comes to 
medical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard the stories of emergencies and the backup of 
people waiting especially during flu season.  We know about 
having to wait for specialists.  These are huge problems in the 
medical system.  Quite frankly I cringe when I hear them because 
it is not what we have come to expect.  We need to do the 
necessary work to make sure that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an interesting poll, Canadians were asked if they had 
firsthand experience with the medicare system.  Of those who said 
yes, 80% said that it had been a good experience for them.  But 
when they were asked if they had heard stories about problems or 
if there had been dissatisfaction with what they perceived the 
system to be, it was the reverse, because 80% said there have 
been problems and only 20% said there was confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real dichotomy between the reality of 80% of 
Canadians getting good service and the 20% who feel that they 
have confidence in the system. 
Between reality and perception there is this kind of dichotomy.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to work hard to change that perception and make it into 
a reality that all Canadians can enjoy.  We need to restore this 
confidence.  That is part of our challenge in this very important 
health care debate, to make sure that we provide the kind of 
quality care that is affordable, accessible and beneficial to 
Canadians and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague the Minister of Health has stated, this is 
going to require more than just money.  I have already talked 
about that.  We need to put in place a plan.  More to the point, 
we need to put in place some linkages among the various sectors 
in health care service delivery.  We need to ensure that people 
are receiving appropriate types of care at appropriate settings 
and at appropriate times.  The care has to match the settings, 
which have to match the times.  That is what is required for 
Canadians wherever they live in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the ways we will go about doing this is by building a 
more patient-centred approach.  Currently, for example, patients 
who receive prescription drugs free while in hospital have to pay 
out of their own pockets for those same drugs when they go home, 
unless they have access to such benefits through their employer, 
province or territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our mothers and fathers leaving the hospital may not have access 
to the home and community services they need.  Or, if they can 
find them, they cannot afford them.  These are all problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One in five Canadian women are providing care for someone at 
home, on average, 28 hours a week.  Half of those women, many of 
whom have children, also work outside the home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often patients have to navigate the bureaucracy by 
themselves, without any kind of guidance in a very complex and 
complicated area.  We need to help these people, not hinder them. 
For some, in fact many, it is much too complex and confusing. 
Laboratory tests are often repeated unnecessarily.  Patients are 
asked to recount their medical history time and time again. 
Records are not immediately available when needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that all of these are signs and 
symptoms of a health sector where instead of linkages there are 
silos.  We need to break down these silos and provide the 
linkages.  That is the important part of this whole equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would an integrated health care system look like?  That is 
really getting to the essence of what we should have.  What would 
it look like? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An integrated system would, first of all, bring together health 
promotion, disease prevention, treatment and care.  The full 
range of medically required health services would be properly 
funded and closely connected, from primary care delivered by an 
interdisciplinary team to the hospital bed, to home and community 
care, and to long term facilities, ensuring Canadians a smooth 
transition from one health service provider to another.  That is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of conclusion, let me say that this past week I attended 
a conference on tele-medicine in the riding of 
Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh.  It was as a result of the 
work done by the Minister of Health, the minister responsible for 
rural development and the chair of the rural caucus, the member 
for Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington, who have put in 
place tele-medicine for rural Canadians.  This is what we are 
talking about.  These are the good things. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of the 
member for Waterloo—Wellington.  There appeared to be a different 
person giving that speech from the person we have come to know as 
chair of the Standing Committee on Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote a few things from the member's speech.  He said 
that we should be looking at health care, that people are looking 
for leadership in health care and justifiably so, and that it is 
at the core of what every Canadian believes is important.  He 
said that we should be re-doubling our efforts, that we should 
make it happen, that we should make it work and that we should 
put in place a long term health strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is incredulous.  This very member, the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington, who was chair of the Standing Committee on 
Health, refused time after time after time to consider a request 
from all parties to study the situation of medicare in Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For three years now, the NDP has asked the government to 
commission a study, as quickly as possible, to look at the crisis 
in medicare, to look at some of the challenges in medicare and to 
look at some of the solutions.  This so-called member for 
Waterloo—Wellington has on every occasion denied, blocked, 
shut the committee down and censored it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saskatchewan NDP, led by Premier Romanow, also tried to help 
us get a commission.  After two years he gave up and commissioned 
his own study.  This morning he announced that Saskatchewan was 
taking the lead in defining a new vision of medicare to meet the 
challenges of the 21st century.  He is not waiting for the 
Liberals to do something about health care because they are the 
ones who have butchered it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Romanow also believes that medicare faces many challenges, 
including new medical treatments, rising costs, an aging 
population and shortage of key health professionals.  The 
commission the premier struck today will identify those key 
challenges.  Secondly, it will recommend an action plan for the 
sustainable delivery of health services across the province. 
Finally, the Saskatchewan commission will identify longer term 
opportunities for reform that will ensure a strong future for a 
publicly funded and administered medicare system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my question for the member for Waterloo—Wellington.  He 
talked about all of these things, which he was in a position to 
do something about for the last two years.  Why has the member 
not undertaken to do what he thinks has to be done?  He got up 
and gave his little speech, which was not worth two cents or the 
paper it was written on because it did not relate to any of his 
actions in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member define the comment in his speech that he is going 
to re-double his efforts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, members of the NDP are 
blustering and huffing and puffing as usual.  They caterwaul, 
bray and squeal like stuffed pigs at the slaughter house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that I was very happy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think the member is taking this personally.  I am not 
sure if you know this, but in <I>Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules 
and Forms</I> making reference to members as animals is really not 
allowed.  I would ask you to interject and raise this with the 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Yes, I believe the 
hon. member has a good point.  I would ask the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington to choose his words more judiciously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I did not say he was; I 
said he acted like it.  There is a difference here and I will 
be judicious in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out to him that I was very happy to be part of the 
health committee that looked at natural health products.  I was 
very happy to be part of the health committee that looked at 
organ donation.  I was very happy to be part of the health 
committee that brought in the CIHR, Bill C-13, which I reported 
in the House, which NDP members did not want to fully understand. 
More to the point, they did not want to support it.  I scratched 
my head and asked why the NDP would not support research and 
development and the doubling of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at how Bob Rae destroyed health care in Ontario.  He closed 
hospitals and delisted all kinds of services.  That is who NDP 
members are.  They are the Bob Raes of the world.  They would 
wreak havoc, left, right and centre—mostly left.  They would do 
it in the most egregious fashion, leaving people decimated in 
their wake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the hon. member's question, I was happy to bring in 
the CIHR, Bill C-13.  Last week I was very happy to bring in 
tobacco regulations concerning labelling and other requirements. 
If he thinks that we are not doing anything, he should attend the 
committee.  He should come and look at what we are doing.  He 
would be gratified to see that the health committee is not only 
working effectively, it is doing the right things for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak to the official opposition supply 
day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the motion again.  We are partway through 
the day on this debate and I think it is important that we have 
this kind of exchange in the House.  It may be the only time we 
will get to talk about health care in this parliament. We 
certainly cannot talk about it in the health committee.  The 
motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize that the health care system in Canada 
is in crisis, the status quo is not an option, and the system 
that we have today is not sustainable; and, accordingly, that 
this House calls upon the government to develop a plan to 
modernize the Canadian health care system, and to work with the 
provinces to encourage positive co-operative relations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally I am delighted to rise to bring the concerns of the 
constituents of my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan, and indeed all 
Canadians, before the House of Commons.  However, today I am 
saddened that we have to have this kind of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know and cherish the health care system that we have 
in Canada.  For many years we have had a “made in Canada” 
solution which ensures that all Canadians have access to quality 
health care.  Generations of Canadians have grown up expecting 
that their loved ones, their families and they themselves will 
have adequate health care available to meet their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the Liberal government, Canadians no longer have this 
comfort.  The cold reality is that the health care of yesterday 
has been destroyed by the Liberals of today and the system will 
not meet the health care requirements of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a few moments I would like to describe the problems which I 
have seen resulting from the government's uncaring approach to 
health care over the last seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when the Liberals came to power the federal portion of 
the Canada health and social transfer was $18.8 billion.  Within 
four short years the Liberals had slashed away over $6.3 billion 
annually.  Today the transfers are still $3.3 billion lower than 
when the Liberals came to power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total they have stripped away $24.7 billion and, according to 
their budget plans, will continue this pattern with the removal 
of another $9.9 billion over the next three budget years.  The 
total is an incredible $34.6 billion gouged out of Canada's 
health care system over a projected 11 years.  That works out to 
$1,100 less in health care for every man, woman and child in 
Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, can you imagine what another $1,100 spent on health 
care for every person in your riding would do to alleviate the 
pain, the suffering and the discomfort which many Canadians feel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan there are approximately 
100,000 people.  That translates into $110 million missing from 
health care that should go to the people of my riding.  That $110 
million could have been used to hire more nurses, to maintain and 
reopen operating rooms.  This is money that could have been used 
to ensure that more people were not subjected to longer than 
necessary waiting lists, and for the opportunity to purchase or 
upgrade new medical technology equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a region in this country that has not been 
negatively affected by the callous financial approach that the 
Liberal government has inflicted upon Canadians from coast to 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Cowichan District Hospital in Duncan a dialysis unit sat 
idle.  The primary reason it sat idle, simply put, was because 
there was not enough money in the system to hire trained 
personnel to operate the equipment.  I ask my hon. colleagues 
here today to imagine the sense of concern that runs through a 
parent's heart when their child requires a dialysis machine to 
live and yet the equipment in the local hospital has never been 
used because of the lack of funding by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what that feeling is.  My daughter is one of those who 
may have required dialysis, and yet, even though the dialysis 
unit was only 15 minutes from our home, the stark reality was 
that if her one remaining kidney had shut down we were over one 
hour away from the nearest dialysis unit, and that was not always 
available to children. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It costs approximately $630,000 to purchase a dialysis unit. The 
annual operating costs for 36 patients totals approximately $1 
million.  Can we imagine if a portion of the $110 million the 
Liberals have ripped out of the system in my riding alone over 
the last seven years could have been used for dialysis in the 
Cowichan District Hospital?  Can we imagine the sense of relief a 
parent or patient feels when a unit is finally opened and put 
into operation?  Unfortunately this unit is already approaching 
capacity and it is expected that in less than one year new 
dialysis patients will once again be required to make the one 
hour trip to Victoria for dialysis treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another situation.  In 1991 in my riding of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan Mr. Pat Carson donated $861,000 for the 
purchase of a CT scanner.  Unfortunately Mr. Carson's wife had 
died of cancer.  While there are no guarantees it was thought 
that earlier treatment for her could have been initiated through 
a faster diagnosis by way of a CT scan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know hon. members are wondering how the scanner is working and 
if it has indeed saved lives.  I am sad to say that the scanner 
has never been purchased.  The money has now accumulated to over 
$1.3 million and will continue to grow until the operating budget 
is put in place that can operate this equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What budget is needed?  All that is needed is approximately 
$500,000 annually.  On behalf of the constituents of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan I can easily imagine $500,000 could be found in 
the $110 million the Liberal government has taken out of health 
care for my riding alone over the last seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these were the only stories then the story of health care in 
Canada today would not be such a sad tale of woe.  Unfortunately 
this is only one of thousands of stories across the nation. 
Through the rest of today as we speak to this most important 
subject the House will hear of surgery waiting lists, cancelled 
surgeries, long waiting periods to see specialists, pain, 
suffering, and unfortunately even death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of British Columbia we have had patients 
lying on gurneys in the hallways and in the linen closets of 
local hospitals.  Cancelled surgeries at the hospitals in my 
riding in Nanaimo—Cowichan are a daily occurrence.  We have done 
better in the past but we must do better than this in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The track record of the Liberal government speaks loud and 
clear.  On the occasions when I have raised at the Standing 
Committee on Health the issue of studying the overall system of 
health care in Canada unfortunately the Liberal majority said no. 
During the discussion at the agenda planning subcommittee one day 
one Liberal member actually had the audacity to state that health 
care was too big a topic for the committee to study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can members imagine that?  Canadian health care was too big for 
the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health to study.  If 
the Standing Committee on Health cannot study health, may I ask 
who should study health? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this month the Canadian Institute for Health Information 
released a report which stated that the number of health 
professionals from 1988 to 1997 did not keep pace with Canada's 
population growth, resulting in fewer health professionals per 
capita in 1997.  Over that 10 year period the number of 
professionals per 10,000 population declined by 1.7%, from 185 to 
182.  Based on these numbers today we are short 9,000 health 
professionals in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further ask hon. members to consider our aging population. 
According to Statistics Canada the demographics of Canada for 
2001 will have 13% of our population aged 65 or older. By 2026, 
just a few years down the road, this same age group will rise to 
21% of our overall population. 
In real numbers this is a rise from 3,945,000 to 7,759,000, 
almost a complete doubling of this age group.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that with a few exceptions it will 
probably include all of us here.  It includes our peers, our 
personal friends, our neighbours and many family members.  If we 
really want a universal health care system when we reach age 65, 
we must do something to heal the hurting health system right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the Canadian Medical Association has noted with 
concern that the number of doctors leaving Canada is roughly 
equivalent to the graduating classes of six medical schools per 
year.  That amounts to almost 40% of our medical school 
graduates.  It now takes half the output of all Canadian medical 
schools to replace the physicians who leave the country annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason is simply the high cost of medical education.  The 
president of the CMA asserts that the debt of a graduating 
medical student can rise as high as a $140,000.  Other reasons 
given by the former director of research at the Association of 
Canadian Medical Colleges of Canada are health care cuts and 
plunging morale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some other facts.  Some 731 doctors left the country in 
1996 and 659 in 1997, for a total of 1,390 doctors in just two 
years.  Doctors moving south of the border represent one-quarter 
of all medical personnel leaving the country every year.  Most of 
those leaving are nurses.  A 1997 study of 489 orthopedic 
surgeons graduating between 1985 and 1994 show that one-quarter 
had moved to the U.S. and 70% of the rest were considering it. 
The most common reasons were restrictions on operating time, 
unavailability of beds and other frustrations with practice 
restrictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMA has also stated that there is a severe shortage of high tech 
physicians capable of reading the results of the latest findings 
in medical technology.  There is currently a shortfall of 150 
full time radiologists in Canada with an expected shortfall of 
500 over the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that it takes a great deal of time to train 
the doctors and nurses we need in Canada.  Regular training for a 
general practitioner is at least seven years and specialist 
training takes thirteen or fourteen years.  We are short of 
trained staff now, not in seven to thirteen years.  A crisis 
looms on the horizon.  Yet the government remains intent upon 
destroying rather than renewing our stressed health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has attempted to make the claim that it 
is the only party willing to support the five tenets of the 
Canada Health Act.  That is just not true.  The 1997 red book 
stated the Liberals' commitment to: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the five fundamental principles of our medicare system, and on 
our commitment to the continuing role, in financing and other 
aspects, of the federal government in health care. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is indeed what the Liberals meant in 1997, why have they 
misled the Canadian public?  How far is that from the reality of 
today when the government is truly the architect of the demise of 
the Canada Health Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the country there are examples of abuses of the Canada 
Health Act.  In my province of British Columbia where the NDP 
government reigns supreme the workers' compensation board is 
allowed by the Canada Health Act, and supported by the 
government, to send its patients with knee problems to a private 
clinic either in the United States or the province of Alberta. To 
me that is queue jumping.  To me that violates the whole 
principle of universality.  The government ought to do something 
about that if it is indeed the protector of the Canada Health 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who need MRIs should be careful.  There may be a three or 
four month line-up, or perhaps they can pay $800 cash at a 
private clinic and avoid the line-up.  If they do not like the 
waiting time involved, they can take their credit cards and head 
south of the border. 
Many Canadian doctors and nurses are there already.  When they 
get there, there will perhaps be a reunion of friends they have 
not seen for a while.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who then is responsible for the two tier system in Canada today? 
It is not this side of the House.  It is the other side of the 
House.  Has the Liberal government attempted to resolve these 
issues?  The simple answer is no.  Rather than working with the 
provinces and attempting to ensure that all Canadians have 
quality health care, the Prime Minister and Minister of Health 
prefer to antagonize, to cause dissension and not to build unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a press release yesterday and in an article in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> the Premier of Saskatchewan, Mr. Romanow, is quoted 
as saying that he has been pushing the federal government for 
several months to create a national inquiry but was turned down. 
I am not surprised.  I was turned down in the health committee 
over the last two and a half years.  Why should it give me that 
privilege when it will not even give it to the Premier of 
Saskatchewan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are starting to see past the Liberal smoke and mirror 
show when it comes to health.  I think they are getting tired of 
it.  Canadians are now starting to turn to other people, to other 
groups in the country and to other levels of government to try to 
right the wrongs the Liberal government has forced upon them. 
Corrective actions cannot be implemented immediately, but they 
could begin immediately if there were some kind of consensus 
building shown by the leadership of the government to do 
something about the most important problem for Canadians today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I recognize that money alone is not the whole 
solution.  We cannot deny that many of the problems were caused 
by the significant reduction in funding that the Liberal 
government has slashed from health care.  What a drop it has been 
from 1996 when it committed to a 50:50 split to now when 
approximately 11% of health care dollars going into the system 
come from the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the solutions will require funding.  Yes, further 
efficiencies can be found in the system.  Certainly we need more 
trained professionals.  Indeed we face challenges that we have 
not even previously encountered.  Yes, we have an aging 
population.  Yes, the delivery of health care services remains a 
provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What positive role has the federal government put forward?  Can 
we name one thing it has done?  To date it has been nothing.  It 
has been irresponsible in its lack of solutions to the health 
care crisis we now face in Canada.  It has been inconsistent in 
the enforcement of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They do not think we have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Yes, they do not think we have a problem. 
The Minister of Health stood in the House today and said there 
was not a crisis.  I was on a radio talk show not too long ago. 
That is not what Canadians are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been hypocritical in its actions with the 
Standing Committee on Health.  Even past Liberals such as Tom 
Kent state that the Liberal government is the biggest threat to 
medicare in the country.  In short, the Liberals have continually 
thrown roadblocks in front of every possible means of finding a 
positive solution to the greatest problem we currently face in 
Canada today.  It is time to walk the talk, but talk is all we 
seem to get from the Liberal government on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can Canadians expect to receive from the Canadian Alliance 
when it becomes government?  As my hon. colleague from Red Deer 
previously stated, health care has been on the back burner for 
far too long and must be moved to the front.  It is the issue 
that concerns Canadians the most.  It is the issue, contrary to 
Liberal rhetoric, on which Liberals have spent the least amount 
of constructive time, energy and financial resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has made every effort to destroy any 
possibility of a healthy, co-operative relationship between the 
federal and provincial governments in health care.  If it were 
really concerned about co-operating with the provinces, it would 
have had a high level meeting between the Prime Minister and the 
premiers a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canadian Alliance, Canadians expect two central 
themes, patient centred and results based health care.  I believe 
that for far too long the patient has taken the backseat in 
health care, and yet the patient is supposedly the focal point of 
the entire system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we need to move beyond traditional thinking.  We need 
to remember why we have a health care system.  Is it to create 
newer technology?  Is it to create jobs for health care 
professionals?  Is it to create an industry for the drug 
companies? 
The simple answer is, no.  The health care system should be 
centred on the patient first.

we have right now.

for having put such an important issue in front of this House on 
the opposition day.  It is something we need to work together on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member from Ontario, I think about the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars, perhaps millions, that Premier Mike Harris 
spent on advertising to attack the health care system.

asking his provincial colleagues to work with the federal

need to work together on it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, to begin with, I am 
surprised that this member heard my speech considering the fact 
that he carried on a fairly long, loud conversation with somebody 
else while I was speaking, which disturbed me greatly.  Other 
than that, I will try to answer his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>   Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. It is probably the last day in the House and I see some 
smiles opposite.  I proudly say, when I go back to my riding or 
across this country, that I do have friends in all parties of 
this House.  However, it is not right to make a comment like 
that.  In the six years that I have been here, it would be untrue 
for me to say that I have not been interrupted vocally and loudly 
during one of my debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that is 
not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will try to answer the 
question put by my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been informed by the provincial health ministers that 
they have asked, on several occasions, for a meeting with the 
Minister of Health and the Prime Minister on this issue and have 
always been refused.  The dates keep being put off and are being 
put further and further in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, through the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Health, should be concerned about the health care in Canada.  All 
Canadians believe it is in a crisis, contrary to what the health 
minister may think.  The government has had seven years to deal 
with this deteriorating health care system and it has done 
exactly the opposite.  It has let this thing go and go, to the 
point where the provinces now have to take matters into their own 
hands and do things themselves.  All one has to do is to look at 
bill 11.  Whether we agree with it or not, the provinces had to 
take things into their own hands and finally do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just look at the inquiry that the province of Saskatchewan has 
to do because the Liberal government is not showing leadership on 
this issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciated a lot of what the deputy critic said about 
health care, and he said it so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the deputy critic have the same interpretation as I do 
concerning the fact that the Minister of Health got up today and 
said that he was going to oppose this motion.  The motion says 
that health care is not sustainable in its present form, the 
status quo is not an option and that the health care system is in 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By saying he is opposed, is he in fact saying that the status 
quo is just fine, that it is sustainable and that there is in 
fact no crisis?  It seems to me that is what he is saying, or 
what the Liberal members across, who will be opposing the motion, 
will be saying with their vote.   They should really think about 
their vote if that is the message that they are sending today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, I must say that I was 
appalled to hear the minister's comments.  It was like me going 
to my doctor with a severe case of pneumonia and him giving me a 
sugar pill instead of penicillin. 
That is the way his speech came across today.  It was syrupy 
sentimentalism.  It spent a quarter of the time on the American 
system.  We do not want to hear about the American system.  We do 
not want the American system.  We want a fixed, made in Canada 
system.  We have people in the House who are willing to work 
toward that solution.  We would like the Liberals to get on 
board.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to participate in a dialogue in the House today on 
our health care system.  It is the most important challenge that 
members of parliament have before them.  Some may describe it as 
crisis, others will describe it as a challenge, but I will 
describe it as dynamics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understand that we are not a static nation and it is a 
truism to say that the status quo is not an option, which is part 
of the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a dynamic system now.  We do have an aging society. The 
technology of medicine has changed dramatically.  The cost of 
pharmacare is very significant now and it is growing because of 
the technology of drugs.  As an example, there is a drug called 
TPT which is for heart attack victims. It costs something in the 
range of $3,000 for one dose, whereas the standard drug used in 
the past for heart attack victims cost only a few hundred 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the members and the motion are 
correct, the status quo is not an option.  I cannot imagine that 
anything that we have in Canada will remain the same forever and 
a day.  We obviously have to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the premise of the motion, which I think the prior 
speaker stated when he closed off his speech, was what positive 
role has the federal government played on behalf of health care. 
The member's answer was “nothing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament and a member of the health committee 
throughout the 35th parliament and for the last year or so, I 
have taken a special interest in the issue of health.  Prior to 
becoming a member of parliament, I served on the board of 
directors of my local hospital for nine years.  I was 
vice-chairman, the treasurer and I was involved in the finances. 
After nine years I felt very comfortable that I had an idea of 
what the costs were of delivering health care through a hospital 
to Canadians, our constituents.  When I became a member of 
parliament I wanted to follow through on the experience I had in 
my community and become part of the health committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first things that happened in the health portfolio, 
and in direct response to the member's rhetorical question about 
what the federal government has done, in 1994 the National Forum 
on Health was established.  That was exactly what the government 
had included in its platform of the 1993 election.  The forum had 
health experts from all across Canada who spent two years 
consulting with each and every vested interest group in the 
health care sector to determine what the state of health care 
was, to determine what resources were there and to determine what 
the needs or deficiencies were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the significant things that they found about the health 
care system was that, in their words, “There seemed to be enough 
money in the system”. 
At that time, the forum reported that there could be as much as 
$11 billion of waste in health care spending because of how it 
was being spent.  It was not being spent wisely.  It was not 
getting good value for the dollar.  The forum identified a need 
to change the system and to start thinking about what fundamental 
principles had to be dealt with in order that our health care 
system would continue to be dynamic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the debate that has gone on so far has had a lot to do 
with money.  Members will know that the province of Quebec had, 
from the 1998 budget, some $800 million available for health care 
which was in a bank account in Toronto.  This money was never 
used.  The province of Ontario was sitting on $400 million that 
it never used.  The province of Newfoundland was sitting on money 
that it had not used, money that was was transferred and 
available to it immediately as a result of the budget initiatives 
in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think members here will argue with the premise that 
dollars alone are not the solution.  We have provinces that are 
in surplus positions.  How can they say they need the money? If 
health care is the number one priority of Canadians, why is it 
that the provinces have priorities which do not match those of 
the people themselves?  Why does Ontario say that its priority is 
to give $4.3 billion in tax cuts to Ontario taxpayers when they 
are also saying that health care is in a crisis.  If health care 
is in a crisis, why have the provinces not responded?  The money 
was there. If it was simply a matter of money, they would have 
done it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By their actions alone, the provinces do not agree that there is 
a crisis.  The provinces do not agree with the premise of the 
motion.  However, they do agree, as do all Canadians, that we do 
have some challenges.  The health care system has to respond to 
the growing realities of Canadian society, an aging society, a 
society where technology is taking over and non-invasive 
practices are taking place.  The costs of MRI machines and CT 
scanners are substantial.  Canadians have to understand that the 
cost of pharmacare is growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first on the board of directors of the Mississauga 
Hospital, the average length of stay per patient was something 
like 7.2 days. During the nine years that I was on the board, the 
average length of stay of a patient at the Mississauga Hospital 
went down to 4.8 days.  Concurrently, the 650 bed hospital was 
reduced down to 550 beds.  However, at the very same time that 
100 beds were reduced, and this is a significant number of beds, 
they concurrently introduced an ambulatory care system that 
provided day surgery.  Instead of people arriving at the hospital 
a day before the operation, being there for their operation and 
then convalescing at the hospital, this was eliminated with the 
ambulatory care system.  People now come in the day they need 
surgery and convalesce at home.  However, this has created other 
problems and other challenges for us to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all members know and understand, if patients have shorter 
lengths of stays in hospitals and convalesce at home, this puts a 
tremendous burden on families because they are supposed to be 
there to provide support.  Home nursing care may not be readily 
accessible.  There may be some difficulties in providing that 
kind of service.  These are some of the challenges that we have 
to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else has the federal government done?  In 1993 we started 
with a $42 billion deficit.  There was no question that we had to 
deal with that fiscal crisis so that we could sustain the kind of 
health care, and social program and support systems for Canadians 
that reflected the values of Canadians.  As soon as we fixed 
that, what happened in 1998?  Some $11.5 billion was injected 
into health care.  In the last budget, $2.5 billion went into 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister has met with his provincial counterparts, 
exactly what the motion says we should start to do. 
We cannot agree with the motion because we cannot say we should 
start doing something that we are already doing.  To agree with 
the motion would be to say that we have not done anything.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby,

propositions to the member about the big squeeze the federal 
government made in the reduction of transfer payments concerning 
the health care envelope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it in the parental mode saying that it knew best, implying 
that Canadians were getting too much health care, that the 
provinces were actually wasteful and that the federal bureaucrats 
in Ottawa knew how to run local hospitals in a much better way? 
Was it implying that there was a lot of slack and excess in the 
system because of what the federal government gave?  Is it asking 
now for a more dynamic system, yet saying it is not money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are the five principles of the Canada Health Act going to be 
enhanced and maintained unless we are prepared to give the 
provinces the wiggle room? The federal government cannot have it 
both ways saying that it is going to cast things in cement but it 
is not going to give them much more money and it is not going to 
give the provinces who have the constitutional jurisdiction to 
deal with health care any wiggle room either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member implies that 
somehow the federal government operates hospitals.  He should 
know that the provinces have the responsibility for the 
administration of the health care delivery system.  The federal 
government's responsibilities are to maintain the five pillar 
principles of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also should know that in 1993 the transfers to the 
provinces for health care were about $28 billion.  In 2000 the 
transfers to the provinces for health care will be $30 billion, 
more than they were in 1993.  Over the last two years there has 
been a full 25% increase in the cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should also know that the federal government has made 
it very clear that there is more money available for health care. 
The federal government will be contributing more money to health 
care. All we need to do is make sure that the health care money 
that is going to be transferred to the provinces will be spent 
wisely and that there are standards that can be monitored so that 
all people, whether they be in federal or provincial governments, 
will have the means to demonstrate to all Canadians that their 
health care dollars, their tax dollars, are being spent wisely.

listened to my colleague's remarks with great interest.  I know 
of his knowledge of the financial side of health care. It is my 
understanding that although Canadians are more than willing to 
pay for good health care, the most economical way to deliver good 
health care to all citizens is a single publicly funded system. 
Would he care to comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, that conclusion was 
reached by this House in its discussions on Alberta's bill 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance party is demanding that Canada look at 
some of these innovative two tier models. The fact remains that 
the two tier philosophy of the Canadian Alliance would create 
longer waiting lists and would be more costly and less productive 
for Canadians in terms of health care. That is a fact based on 
those jurisdictions in which there is a parallel private two tier 
health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question this government is committed to the 
principles of the Canada Health Act:  universality, portability, 
accessibility, comprehensiveness and publicly funded, to the 
exclusion of the two tier health system that is being proposed by 
at least one Canadian Alliance leadership candidate. 
One of the reasons the Canadian Alliance web page on the health 
initiative is blank is that its members have not decided what 
they will do until they find out who their leader is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity 
to speak to the number one concern of Canadians and that is 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take the time to recognize the great work of the 
health care professionals in my riding and across Canada. We live 
in a better country because of the work of our professionals.  In 
rural and small-town Canada they often go the extra mile without a 
lot of thanks and I say thank you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key roles of the Government of Canada is helping 
Canadians to maintain and improve their health.  It does so in 
several ways, most notably by ensuring the continuing 
availability of our publicly funded health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Providing leadership in the areas of health protection and 
promotion, the federal government fulfils its mandate in health 
through various approaches, always respecting the primary roles 
of the provinces in health care delivery.  For example, it 
contributes financially to the provinces and territories in 
support of their health care systems and through fiscal measures 
for individuals such as health and medical expense allowances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It interprets and enforces the principles of the Health Care 
Act. It ensures that Canadians have the benefits of timely access 
to safe, effective drugs and products, and that Canadians are 
protected from health risks associated with pharmaceuticals, 
blood products and various medical devices and consumer products. 
It conducts and funds health research.  It develops national 
disease control strategies in collaboration with the provinces 
and territories.  It ensures access to the community based health 
care services for first nations and Inuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When exercising its leadership and responsibilities in the areas 
of health promotion, disease prevention and overall management of 
risks to health, the federal government acts in the spirit of 
partnership with the provinces and in collaboration with health 
stakeholders and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some recent concrete examples of federal-provincial 
collaboration include the development of a strengthened blood 
system in Canada, intergovernmental action on tobacco control and 
smoking cessation, and initiatives such as the health transition 
fund supporting provincial-territorial innovations in home care, 
pharmacare, primary care and better integrated health services 
for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada often acts as a facilitator and at 
times as a co-ordinator on health issues with pan-Canadian 
dimensions.  It has done so on a range of issues in the past, for 
example to support the development of universal health insurance 
dating to the 1940s and research and support in areas including 
child, maternal, mental and dental health also dating to the 
1940s. In fact, there is a long tradition of federal-provincial 
co-operation in the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles and values which have long guided the federal 
government in intergovernmental collaboration in the health arena 
are also consistent with those outlined in the social union 
framework agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An excellent current example of the benefits of 
federal-provincial co-operation are two initiatives announced 
recently by our federal Minister of Health.  They are the 
innovations in rural and community health and the Canadian health 
infostructure partnerships program, known as CHIPP.  Both 
initiatives are meant to ensure that all Canadians no matter 
where they live in Canada have access to top health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The innovations in rural and community health is a $50 million 
investment.  Two-thirds of this money will go toward supporting 
innovations in community health care such as access to home and 
community care, affordability and accessibility of 
pharmaceuticals, and improvement in integrated service delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another $11 million will go toward rural health.  The objectives 
of the rural health grants and contributions programs are to 
promote integration and accessibility of health services, to 
explore ways to address workforce issues and to examine system 
reforms to improve the delivery of health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has been working closely with the provinces and 
territories in the development of our rural health grants and 
contributions program to identify areas of shared concern. 
All provinces and territories agreed that the objectives and 
priorities for the funding program complement and support their 
own.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian health infostructure partnerships program, CHIPP, 
is a two year $80 million shared cost incentive program which 
will support the implementation of innovative applications of 
information and communication technologies in the health sector. 
It will focus on two priorities:  telehealth and protected 
electronic patient records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telehealth is a key element in improving access to health 
services for all Canadians, especially those in the rural and 
remote areas.  It represents a great opportunity for our country 
to improve access to care, as well as to develop a cutting edge 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic patient records will also facilitate improved patient 
care through improving the integration of services, avoiding 
needless tests, and better prescription benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chair of the rural caucus on this side of the House and as 
someone who lives in a rural area of Canada, I have had the 
opportunity to speak to a lot of my constituents and often with 
other rural Canadians across the country, about the health care 
challenges which face rural and remote Canada.  We know about the 
difficulties that rural areas have in attracting and keeping 
health care professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a long period of consultation we recommended to the 
Minister of Health that an effort be made to move to multi-use or 
multidisciplinary primary care approaches.  The minister 
supported our recommendations and I thank him.  It will be a 
priority area of discussion at the federal-provincial level.  May 
I also say that I am delighted that the Canadian Institutes of 
Health Research interim governing council has recommended the 
creation of an office of rural health to promote and support 
rural health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are only a few ways that federal, provincial and 
territorial co-operation has produced results in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude my remarks by saying that Canadians no matter 
where they live expect health services of the highest quality. 
They want their governments to work together and not play 
politics.  They want them to come up with lasting solutions to 
ensure the future of publicly funded health care.  The Government 
of Canada is committed to federal-provincial partnerships to 
serve the health care interests of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, once again we are reminded why the federal Tories 
went from 211 seats to two in the House.  The House leader of the 
fifth party has tabled motions to reduce the operating 
expenditures of specific government departments. Let us look at 
these specific motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories want to take $1 billion out of health care.  They 
want to slash the operating budget of our military by $7 billion. 
However, when it comes to the mismanagement of the human resources 
department which has been wasting taxpayers' dollars all year, 
would the Clark Tories significantly reduce that department? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again Joe Clark is proving just how out of touch he is with 
ordinary Canadians by gutting health care, destroying our defence 
department, yet ensuring there is plenty of money to continue 
with the legacy of the billion dollar boondoggle in HRDC.  With 
policies like that, it is no wonder that 130,000 people have 
signed up to join the Canadian Alliance in hopes of a new 
government, a change they have been looking forward to for a long

Mr. Speaker, the NHL's New Jersey Devils captured hockey's Holy 
Grail Saturday, beating Dallas 2 to 1 in overtime in game six of 
the Stanley Cup finals.  This year's final showcased passion and 
excitement for every player who stepped on the ice, and two 
players in particular epitomized the very best of that spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colin White and Jon Sim of New Glasglow, Nova Scotia played big 
parts in their team's performance.  Colin, a towering defenceman, 
and Jon, a fearless banging winger, took regular shifts and were 
solid performers in the playoffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As teammates in the Pictou County minor hockey system, 
particularly with Scott Weeks Triple A Midgets, both Sim and 
White acquired the skills and determination that made them 
outstanding hockey players and poised young men.  Add to that 
maturity and class, and they are local and national fan 
favourites.  Both players won the recognition and praise of many, 
including Don Cherry and Ron Maclean, for their play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the New Jersey win, Colin's name will be engraved on the 
cup, joining Jon's as a result of New Jersey's victory.  Adding 
to Colin's joy, he is getting married this summer.  All expect a

assets have been saved again.  The supreme court upheld her 
flawed gun registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims her registry has stopped hundreds of 
undesirable characters from obtaining firearms permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those undesirables was from my riding.  He was repeatedly 
rejected because his name appeared on too many files where 
firearms were involved.  The computer did not realize this 
applicant was an RCMP corporal and the firearms verifier for his 
detachment, hence his name on the firearms files.  I know that I 
will sleep better knowing the system will not licence an RCMP 
officer's sporting rifle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's outrageously expensive outreach program is 
another sham.  A quick check of her Internet site found 
shopowners and individuals who received cartons of registry files 
in the mail from the minister with no explanation as to what was 
expected.  That is a lot like the heritage minister's flag 
fiasco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registry budget has skyrocketed and public support has 
plummeted.  The Canadian public is aware that this whole exercise 
is more about saving political face than public safety.  The 
majority of Canadians say “Just scrap it”.

to not only Canadians but to his own caucus colleagues.  He

bankrupt, one company in receivership, rubber cheques to

considered his Liberal connections: a picture with the Prime 
Minister, an $8,000 donation to the Liberal Party, and using 
company time and staff to assemble lawn signs for Liberal

he is not a good businessman.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
one of the arguments used by the Prime Minister to refuse to

there is nothing to negotiate. We have a program that will be

receive money from the federal government during 12 months.

which rarely happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Prime Minister to not look at the past, to not 
remain frozen in the past. Let historians deal with the past. 
Will the Prime Minister think about the future, about young

under his own legislation? Will he think about young families,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
a few years ago, we undertook negotiations on this issue with the

we acted accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal program is in effect. The money is collected by the 
federal government across the country and is distributed in the 
same fashion in all the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Quebec government wants to add on to our program, fine. 
Nothing prevents it from doing so. Families will then receive 
money from the federal government and whatever amount the 
provincial government is prepared to give them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal

that that proposed by the Government of Quebec.  Ottawa's comes 
from the employment insurance program, and is therefore funded 
by the contributions of employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Prime Minister, stubborn as he is, acting as if this 
were his own money, when it is the money of young families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>

the EI fund is contributed to by all workers and all employers

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, it is my understanding that the provincial 
program they want to put into place requires more contributions 
by employers and employees.  That is up to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have our program, and if they want one that is more specific, 
they can add very easily onto what we are already doing.  The

a third prime ministerial crony in the Placeteco Inc. deal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember members of that party talking about the fact that 
they are not interested in supporting Canadians in need.  They 
said that through grants and contributions we are wasting

full damage control mode over a billion dollar boondoggle audit. 
Their communications department had prepared an action plan to 
handle the crisis and officials were hunkering down for the 
coming storm.  The minister was obviously terrified of the

missing $1 billion. The Minister of Human Resources Development 
waited until two days after we submitted an access to information 
request before she announced the existence of the billion dollar 
bungle audit.  She then tried to postdate the acknowledgement of 
our access requests.

think the access to information request spawned the audit.  It 
did no such thing. That was discussed in this House many months 
ago. Again we see the reiteration of falsehoods and misdirection.

devastated the civilian population.

setting up of panels to study the conditions in Iraq and we 
re-opened the resolutions.

dominated by the Liberal Party.  Particularly throughout the 
1990s the people of Canada saw no viable, electable alternative.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that after six months of attacking my 
department, the Canadian Alliance has proved two things:  first, 
that this government is prepared to take administrative issues 
seriously because we are accountable; and two, that it does not 
believe that investing in Canadians is the right thing to do. 
That party sees it as a waste.

the $1.2 million grant to Placeteco upon receipt of invoices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But despite our repeated requests, we have still not received 
copies of any invoices, whether through access to information or 
through the minister herself.

that any information that can be made available, will be made

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take this opportunity to thank all hon. members for their 
constructive approach in recent days which has produced the 
results that make it such that the House will be adjourning later 
today for the summer recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I want to pay tribute to all House leaders and 
whips of all parties in the House.  Their contribution toward 
parliamentary democracy, notwithstanding our disagreements from 
time to time on policy issues, has been immense.  I think that 
this is the kind of collaboration the Canadian people expect of 
all of us in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to address a short list of some of the bills to be 
addressed in the House, and not necessarily in the appropriate 
order, I would have to say:  Bill C-14, respecting Manitoba 
claims; Bill C-8, respecting marine parks; Bill C-3, respecting 
youth justice; the bank bill; Bill C-31, respecting immigration; 
and Bill C-33, respecting species at risk.  Those issues are all 
priorities for the government, and so of course will be the 
concerns that Canadians will bring to our attention this summer. 
All these things will be the subject of the immediate 
attention of the government when we return in the fall.

I have a supplementary question for the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I remember asking the government House leader about a 
year ago when legislation would be forthcoming to deal with the 
multiplicity of reproductive technologies that are available.  He 
said at that time that something would be forthcoming.  It is now 
many months later.  Perhaps he could address that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am on my feet, could he give us the assurance that after 
the House adjourns the Prime Minister will not be making a raft 
of appointments to the other place for various Liberal hacks and 
flacks that are needed to accomplish the government's agenda 
there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will answer the second 
question first.  It is certainly my hope that the Prime Minister, 
as I am sure he will, will fulfil his constitutional 
responsibility in ensuring that there are members to serve 
adequately and very well in the other House.  I am certainly very 
confident that he will do so, but I will take the hon. member's 
suggestion as representation to ensure that the other House has a 
full complement of able Canadians to serve this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the second point, there is not a bill on reproductive 
technologies presently on the order paper.  The hon. member 
opposite will recognize that.  I will discuss the issue with the 
Minister of Justice, the Minister of Health and others in an 
effort to bring such legislation to the floor of the House as 
soon as possible.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK335"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order arising out of question period and 
arising out of many other question periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Chair to take some time over the summer 
to reflect on the advisability of a practice which has grown up 
in question period of the Chair ruling or observing that 
questions are out of order and then asking ministers of the crown 
whether or not they would then like to answer the questions that 
are out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Chair rules a question out of order, it seems to me that 
should be the end of the matter.  It is not a question of the 
question being out of order and answering it anyway, or he may 
answer it anyway.  It puts the minister on the spot.  If the 
question is out of order, if it is so ruled, that should be the 
end of the matter.  The time of the House should not be consumed 
with ministers answering questions that have been ruled out of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Chair to consider that matter over the summer. 
Perhaps a new practice, depending on what conclusions the Chair 
arrives at over the summer, might be implemented in the fall. 
<P><A NAME="LINK336"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on the same point of order.  I noticed the same 
thing as the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona.  I also noticed 
that on the first question the Speaker ruled out of order the 
Prime Minister was signalling to the House leader of the 
government to answer it.  The Speaker did not allow an answer at 
that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the second question ruled out of order, the House leader for 
the government was on his feet, very anxious to answer the 
question.  I do not think that it was a discretion of the Speaker 
at all.  It was a matter of the minister asking for an 
opportunity to answer the question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK337"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona raises a point that obviously has been of 
some concern to the Chair on occasions in the past.  As the hon. 
member knows, it is not that often that the Deputy Speaker is in 
the chair for question period, so I do not normally have to deal 
with this matter.  On Fridays members are so well behaved that I 
very seldom have to rule a question out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, today, as the hon. member for Wetaskiwin has pointed 
out, on one occasion the question in my view was beyond the 
competence of the government and I did not permit an answer.  In 
my view it was an improper question and should not have been 
asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other two questions that I thought were out of order, 
they were out of order because of the language in the questions 
and not because of the content.  In those cases I allowed the 
government to respond, particularly in the one case where the 
minister exhibited considerable enthusiasm for responding, not 
just to the one that was out of order but to the second one which 
was out of order because of in my view the language. 
That is why I permitted a response.

will spend many nights lying awake thinking about what to do the 
next time I get one of these questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  As the hon. member says, only I 
would.  I suspect there may be others who would do the same.  I 
suspect he may be one of them.  I know he will have more advice 
for the Chair on other occasions, and I appreciate the advice.  I

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVILEGE 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK339"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK340"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege.  I am asking you to rule 
on whether MPs may have been wilfully deceived by the Department 
of Justice because of a document received on MPs' desks just 
prior to the June 6 vote on Bill C-206, which falsely attributed 
to the privacy commissioner the expressed concern that opening up 
30 year old records would make vulnerable to disclosure personal 
information, including income tax returns, unemployment insurance 
records, charitable and political donations, and income 
investment information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this document emanated from government, the comments on 
the privacy commissioner's position can be traced to a justice 
department talking points document to cabinet of May 26, which 
reported that the privacy commissioner considered Bill C-206 to 
be a “serious threat to the privacy of Canadians” and cited as 
an example the release of “personal income tax returns which 
would include information on dependants, charitable and political 
donations, not to mention income investments and so on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is the privacy commissioner was not in official 
communication with the Department of Justice on Bill C-206 until 
10 days after the May 26 memo outlining his position and never 
described his concerns as a “serious threat” nor ever gave the 
example cited in the document above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At issue here is whether it is a breach of privilege if the 
officials of a ministry are found to have given advice to MPs, 
both the government and MPs in their places in the House, that 
negatively characterizes legislation based on statements, 
expressed and implied, that were improperly attributed to an 
officer of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of documents which I wish to table for your 
examination.  The first we will call exhibit A.  It was found on 
every MPs desk at the commencement of the vote on Bill C-206 and 
comprises 14 pages in English and French consisting of three 
documents: a one page excerpt from the privacy commissioner's 
1999-2000 report mentioning Bill C-264, the predecessor of Bill 
C-206; a letter dated June 5 from the privacy commissioner to the 
justice minister outlining his concerns with respect to Bill 
C-206; and a covering two page government note entitled “Summary 
of Bill C-206”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will note that the letter to the justice minister is dated 
June 5.  The vote took place in the evening of June 6.  Thus it 
could not have been received by the justice minister much earlier 
than 24 hours before.  Also, and very importantly, the privacy 
commissioner assures me that this letter is the only official 
exchange of correspondence between him and the justice minister 
or between his office and the justice ministry pertaining to Bill 
C-206.  We need look no further for the sum total of the privacy 
commissioner's position on Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might also say the sponsor of Bill C-206, which was myself, 
put no document on MPs' desks, relying on his colleagues to know 
the bill through the debate that occurred in the House and by 
letters he had sent to their offices.  That is a point you might 
also wish to contemplate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paragraph in the government covering letter that I wish to 
draw to your attention is that subtitled “Privacy Concerns” 
which then attributes to the privacy commissioner the concern 
that making 30 year old records accessible could result in the 
potential release of personal information.  Privacy commissioner 
and personal records are boldfaced for emphasis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it goes on to give examples of personal information that 
because of the 30 year provision would be “vulnerable”: income 
tax returns, unemployment insurance records, charitable and 
political donations, and income investment information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These examples had a tremendously damaging impact on opinion of 
the bill.  Two MPs, the member for Carleton—Gloucester and the 
member for Broadview—Greenwood, told me afterwards that the 
examples influenced them to vote against the bill.  I am sure 
many other MPs likewise reacted and may have voted accordingly, 
but nowhere in any official communication from the privacy 
commissioner will you find reference to a concern linking the 30 
year provision to tax returns, unemployment insurance records, 
political donations and income investment information. 
Moreover, the privacy commissioner has assured me that he has 
never personally used these examples, period.  Indeed well he 
would not.  The political donations of individuals are already 
readily available from the Elections Canada website.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It turns out, however, that the damaging examples in this 
document that was put on MPs' desks have a history.  I refer now 
to exhibit B.  This is a justice department's talking points memo 
to cabinet dated May 26 which says that, and I give you the 
entire sentence, “The privacy commissioner believes Bill C-206 
is a serious threat to privacy”.  That is the exact quotation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner assures me that although he takes all 
issues of privacy seriously, neither he nor his staff has ever 
said that Bill C-206 is a serious threat to privacy.  Indeed, if 
you examine his letter of June 5 you will find that he says that 
his “greatest concerns can be met with by amendments” and that 
he is looking forward to “outlining his concerns to the 
appropriate committee”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say that it is directly the privacy commissioner's 
mandate to consider all legislation that gets on the order of 
precedence for its Privacy Act implications.  He expresses 
concerns on legislation all the time, and those concerns are 
supposed to be dealt with as the legislation makes its way 
through committee and report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further in these talking points to cabinet which were shared 
with some MPs, which is how I got this document, you will see the 
statement that the privacy commissioner believes “For example, 
the release of personal income tax returns would include 
information on dependants, charitable and political donations, 
not to mention income investments and so on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner assures me he did not say that, and yet 
three days after the date of these talking points the sponsor of 
Bill C-206, that is myself, was summoned before the Deputy Prime 
Minister, the justice minister, the treasury board president and 
the government House leader and for the first time asked to 
account for the fact that the privacy commissioner says that Bill 
C-206 is going to open up personal income tax forms, personal 
investments and so on more than 30 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite my thorough knowledge of the bill and despite my 
explanations, how could I make convincing argument against the 
supposed word of the privacy commissioner expressed in a document 
that was not then shared with me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two days later the government announced to the Liberal caucus 
that it was not supporting Bill C-206.  Then, for the next four 
days before the vote, the whip and cabinet ministers directly 
approached backbench MPs and told them not to vote for Bill C-206 
while citing the privacy commissioner's alleged beliefs reported 
in the justice department talking points of May 26. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the privacy commissioner's actual, official, written 
position on Bill C-206 was only received by the justice 
department at most late in the afternoon the day before the vote 
and two days after the government began whipping the backbench to 
vote against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raised these issues with the privacy commissioner he 
recalled that there may have been informal talks between his 
staff and justice department staff.  He later informed me that on 
inquiry he had learned that such talks had occurred in October 
1999 and that issues related to income tax returns and other 
types of personal information had been discussed.  The privacy 
commissioner was not at those talks, and they were of so informal 
a nature that no record of them was taken by privacy commission 
staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the privacy commissioner if such talks by his staff, 
which occur from time to time on various items of legislation, 
could be or should be construed as being his opinion.  The 
privacy commissioner replied, and I give the House his exact 
words, “If it is not under my signature and seal I did not say 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There you have it, Mr. Speaker.  Documents from the justice 
department which falsely purported to reflect the privacy 
commissioner's stated position on Bill C-206 came before the 
government and MPs in the House and probably affected a vote that 
was before the House.  I believe that this constitutes a prima 
facie case of privilege.

will certainly review the documents that he has presented with 
his argument.  It may be that a member of the government will

contained in the documents that he will be tabling.  If that is 
the case, I will certainly be prepared to hear those arguments

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I regret that I was not present but I understand, 
and I stand to be corrected if I am in error, that my colleague 
may have charged that as the chief government whip I would have 
lobbied or given instructions to government members on how to 
vote on a private member's bill under his signature.  If that is 
the correct interpretation, I want to unequivocally deny such an 
accusation in this instance or in any other instance affecting 
Private Members' Business. 
<P><A NAME="LINK342"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair may be wrong but I do 
not think that was the nature of the allegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are documents that were referred to by the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington which I think he alleged were the ones that 
were used to influence the thinking of members of parliament.  I 
do not recall from anything I have heard him say that any of 
those documents emanated from the chief government whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I think it is appropriate that we review the 
documents.  I know the chief government whip may want to look at 
them as well, but I think a member of the government may wish to 
respond to this.  We will give time for that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will take the matter under advisement at this time and we 
will deal with it when there is some indication of the 
availability of a response and when we have had an opportunity to 
review the documents that have been presented.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my hon. colleague's speech 
on health care.  As we all know, the quality of health care 
really went downhill when the Liberal government made all the 
cuts back in the early 1990s. Would the hon. member accept 
responsibility for all the cuts that were made to the health care 
system which created the situation that exists today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the 
House accept the responsibility of fixing a system that needs to 
be enforced.  We ask for co-operation from all colleagues in this 
House to take the politics out of health care and to fix the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives me an opportunity to thank the people of the 
beautiful town of Chesterville for their hospitality this past 
Monday.  Chesterville is in the beautiful riding of 
Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh where the government announced 
the investment of $50 million into the innovation fund for rural 
and community health and an additional $11 million for the 
projects under telehealth.  This is so very important. 
Telemedicine is necessary to help fix the situation with respect 
to health care in rural and remote communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have had much debate today on 
health care, the subject of the official opposition supply day 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member for 
Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington about health in a more 
general way.  It relates to the fact that when people think about 
medicare and health care services, most often they are thinking 
about physical health, but in actual fact what has happened in 
Canada has been a tragedy in terms of mental health care 
services.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a shrinkage of resources.  What the provinces 
have been able to secure from the federal government, if there 
has been a prioritization, it has been away from mental health care 
services.  There have been some very tragic examples recently of 
what has happened.  People with obvious and known to themselves 
mental health problems have been crying out for help but have not 
been able to receive it.  Consequently they have carried out 
criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have something of 
interest for the member's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an announcement made on Monday this week about rural 
Canada. It would certainly apply to beautiful Vancouver Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new system has been set up to deliver an ultrasound service 
into northern Alberta, probably about three hours north of 
Edmonton. The technology is now available to transfer the 
ultrasound images from the town via satellite, across the Equator 
and back into the clinic in Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sat in Chesterville and all Canadians were able to watch the 
ultrasound images being transferred. A doctor who specializes in 
interpreting these images received them and sent them back to the 
doctor in the home town.  It saved the patient travel time of 
three and a half hours to have the ultrasound tests conducted. 
Also, in front of Canada and with television coverage, an hon. 
member of this House said everyone wanted to know if it was a boy 
or a girl, but someone in northern Alberta said the mom and dad 
did not want to know. We all have to work together to address 
health care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK349"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to the health crisis in Canada.  I want to 
speak from the Manitoba perspective.  Having actively been 
involved with this issue for many years in Manitoba, I can 
certainly tell the House that Manitobans are not happy campers 
when it comes to their health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts from the federal government have had a huge impact on 
all the people of Manitoba.  The whole health care system in 
Manitoba had to be reconfigured to deal with the drastic cuts the 
government made to the tune of about $24 billion in the early 
1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It forced the provincial government to centralize the health 
system.  It is sad that this was forced upon the Gary Filmon 
government.  Unfortunately it may have been one of the factors 
that cost him the last election because people are still angry 
about the health care delivery system in the province of 
Manitoba. As a result we now have a number of regional health 
authorities who are unelected and appointed by politicians.  It 
is another political game which we have to put up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did I do about this, going back six or seven years?  At 
that time I organized a provincial health meeting with municipal 
and aboriginal leaders to deal with the health crisis. We had a 
forum on health.  We asked the then Manitoba minister of health, 
Darren Praznik, to appear before the angry delegates and he did. 
He found himself in a very difficult situation.  He had been 
appointed to that position about a month prior to the meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately all the municipal and aboriginal leaders attacked 
the province of Manitoba and blamed it for the problem, which in 
essence was wrong. 
I can see with 20:20 vision in hindsight that the blame should 
have been put squarely on the federal government.  In fact, no 
one even wanted to hear that the problem was created by the 
federal government.  Can you believe that, Mr. Speaker?  We still 
need to place the blame on the government that created this 
problem in the first place, the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the problem still exists.  People are still not happy with 
the system that is currently in place.  There are still long 
waiting lines.  There are still shortages of beds.  There are 
overcrowded clinics.  Doctors are overworked.  In other words, we 
need to remind Canadians how this big problem started in the 
first place.  It all started with the big cuts at the federal 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about a client central health care system 
that exists in my riding of Dauphin—Swan River, the Hamiota 
District Health Centre.  It has been around for at least 50 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we measure the health of a community?  Do we look at the 
number of medical office visits and days of hospital care and 
assume that greater activity indicates better health?  Or is the 
reverse true?  Current priorities in Canada's health care system 
are contested by community health centres which nurture health as 
a positive attribute to be protected, restored and enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medical health centres are not new.  Most of the dozen or so in 
Manitoba are unique in scope, ranging from a single specialized 
service to the Hamiota District Health Centre, the classic 
example of a comprehensive integrated centre.  Located in 
southwestern Manitoba, the HDHC has been around since 1974.  It 
provides a broad range of services geared to community needs, 
limited only by available means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay tribute to Dr. Ed Hudson who in 1945 took 
over his father's practice in Hamiota.  His father, Dr. E.D. 
Hudson, began his practice in 1907.  Dr. Ed Hudson is still 
actively involved in helping to deliver quality health care. 
Between his horses and the health centre, he certainly keeps busy 
in his senior years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hamiota District Health Centre began with a belief in the 
health centre potential for improved quality of care.  The 
providers of that care know the satisfaction of delivering care 
programs that are effective but definitive assessment is 
difficult.  An evaluation concentrating on results of programs is 
limited in scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1972 white paper on health policy states, “a health system 
must also be judged by the numbers of people who in fact never 
succumb to disease or accidents or social distress”.  A method 
of measuring quality of care is elusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cost saving efficiencies were envisaged.  There is the 
co-ordination of care by many disciplines, resulting in decreased 
numbers of diagnostic tests, the pooling of supplies and 
equipment, and more efficient use of physical facilities. There 
is the ability to use the most appropriate care provider in 
patient care and the appropriate level of care for the patient. 
There is the freeing of physicians to use their time and 
expertise more efficiently in preventive care and health 
promotion to reduce hospital stays.  There is the use of home 
care, mobile meals and support services to reduce hospital 
patient days.  There is the economy of using only one 
administration and one governing board in an expanded system of 
care.  There is the active involvement of the community in 
establishing support for the programs and identifying needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty years of experience seems to support all these tenets. 
Controlled spending has to date precluded any unapproved deficits 
that would become the responsibility of the municipalities of the 
district. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The centre lacks the information and statistics required to do a 
self-evaluation or a comparative one, but has co-operated with 
governments in several assessment surveys and questionnaires. 
Results of research, if any do exist, have never been publicized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite apart from statistics but evident to a visitor to HDHC is 
an atmosphere no one had predicted.  Staff morale is exceptional.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The current position is to devote half a day per month to a 
strategy meeting to critically assess the role in terms of 
efficiency, effectiveness and goals.  It is expected that gains 
in health care in the next decade will be in preventive care, 
with emphasis on nutrition, health promotion, physiotherapy and 
occupational therapy, as resources are geared to keeping people 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expansion of existing programs or the introduction of new 
ones in times of fiscal restraint are largely matters of 
trade-off between priorities.  The flexibility of the system is 
conducive to change to improve care and to respond to community 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turn of the century health care in rural Manitoba was delivered 
by the dedicated and selfless family medical doctor.  As the 
century closes we find a burgeoning multiplicity of health 
disciplines in a tangled web of administration by government 
departments, subsidized public offices and private agencies.  The 
system has grown without plan or co-ordination in an expensive 
add-on fashion which encourages health care professionals to 
concentrate on protecting the turf of their own specialty, 
competing for limited resources and denying any vision of total 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One health worker suggests “I am sure if I were to start all 
over again in health care there would be no doubt as to the 
direction it would take.  Interdisciplinary health care 
management would be the only way to go”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wishful thinking, you say, Mr. Speaker?  Perhaps, but this small 
community in Hamiota, Manitoba, has found it to be possible.  I 
would invite hon. members, if they have the time this summer, to 
visit this place to see how client-centered health care takes 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close by quoting from a letter that was sent to 
me from the Council of Chairs of the Regional Health Authorities 
of Manitoba.  The letter reads in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day, members of the RHAM see the serious effects that cuts 
in federal transfers are having on our national healthcare 
system.  The significant decline of public confidence in our 
healthcare system is compelling evidence that Canadians feel the 
system will not be there for them and their families when they 
need it.  Federal/provincial/territorial co-operation to build a 
truly accessible, integrated, client-centered continuum of care 
is essential to restore the confidence of all Canadians in our 
health care system. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK350"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, is the hon. member aware of the increase in spending 
through the CHST, the Canada health and social transfer, to $11.5 
billion in the previous budget?  As well, the last budget 
increased spending by an additional $2.5 billion, for a total of 
$14 billion over a period of about five years.  Is he aware of 
that?  Does he not consider that to be significant spending for 
health? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I would like to ask the member if he is in favour of 
private health care for profit, yes or no?  If not, does he 
support the privatization bill in Alberta which could lead to the 
very situation of a two tier health care system in the future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, our health critic indicated 
this morning in his speech that we are not in favour of a two 
tier health system.  We have said that over and over again.  I do 
not know why the member opposite keeps asking the same question 
about a two tier, American-style health care system.  We are 
opposed to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that we need to put money back into the system.  The 
Liberal government indicated in its budget that over five years 
it will put money back into it, but it seems to have forgotten 
that it took out more than $24 billion.  That is what I said in 
my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the problems we have today stem from the day when the 
government made that huge cut.  I do not blame the government for 
all of the problems that exist, because there are increasing 
demands on the system, but certainly that is what started the 
problems and the crisis we have today.

Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I only have 10 minutes to 
speak to the motion of my caucus, the Canadian Alliance, which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize that the health care system in Canada 
is in crisis, the status quo is not an option, and the system 
that we have today is not sustainable; and, accordingly, that 
this House call upon the government to develop a plan to 
modernize the Canadian health care system, and to work with the 
provinces to encourage positive co-operative relations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot cover the scope of the problem at this time, but I can 
briefly say that we must first understand that medicare is the 
constitutional responsibility of the provinces.  The federal 
government, through the Canada Health Act, controls a declining 
portion of the funding in exchange for the famous five 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As predicted at the start of medicare, the principles have been 
abandoned by all governments, yet the hollow phrases are fought 
over for the political advantage of posturing before the public 
about what party or government is more caring, wiser, and 
therefore should be trusted and supported by the voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles are:  accessibility, portability, universality, 
comprehensiveness, and public administration.  However, we must 
look at the five principles of the Canada Health Act and question 
if they are working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning accessibility, in the nineties there was an increase 
in people waiting for care.  In 1993 the average wait was 9.3 
weeks, but in 1998 the average wait was 13.3 weeks, an increase 
of 43%.  Patients wait months to see a specialist.  There is a 
huge shortage of technology that is available in other countries 
but is spread thinly in Canada.  People are dying because they 
cannot get timely access, or they suffer needlessly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about portability?  This supposedly means that every 
Canadian has the right to be treated anywhere in Canada. 
However, Quebec patients outside Quebec are required to pay 
upfront because the Quebec government did not sign the 
portability agreement and cannot be counted on to pay up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told the reverse is even worse, about a person from B.C. 
who gets sick in Quebec and about how that person is seemingly 
discriminated against in the Quebec system.  In other words, the 
interprovincial payment system is full of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next we have so-called universality.  There are great shortages 
of services in outlying areas of Canada, far beyond the expected 
concentration of special services in regional centres.  Where one 
lives, how and where one acquired the medical need and one's 
personal legal status all undermine universality because these 
affect what one gets from the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about comprehensiveness?  That has never been followed from 
the beginning.  Each province has a different list of things that 
are covered and those that are not.  As the pressure has mounted, 
provinces have been forced to delist services.  In other words, 
there is no operational, national working agreement of core 
services.  Consequently, Canada does not have comprehensiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, what about public administration?  Most of it is 
public, in theory, except that there is a lot of contracting out 
that goes on for efficiencies such as computer services and 
financial support, and the labyrinth of personal cash payments 
for services mixed with tax dollars.  As well, about 80% of total 
public spending for health care is consumed by labour costs for 
doctors, nurses and administrators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public administration of the complexities of medicare should be 
held accountable for cost and efficiency, but since there is no 
real competition how do we know what is happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main point of a recent national study was the huge list of 
things that the system really did not know, could not account for 
or measure.  In other words, medicare is administratively in the 
dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Heidi Oetter outlined the situation eloquently when she said 
in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the year I turn 40. It is a reflective year, a time to 
take stock of the past and ponder the future.  When I was 20, I 
chose to stay in British Columbia and finish my education at the 
University of British Columbia's faculty of medicine.  When I was 
30, I chose to stay in Canada, unlike many of my classmates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, I've participated in more committees than I care to 
count, provincially and federally, to try and make Medicare work. 
Sadly, as my fourth decade comes to a close, I have to publicly 
say Medicare is decaying rapidly, and if we don't act now, its 
future is bleak... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each new discovery, medication, diagnostic machine or operating 
device is expensive.  For example, the additional equipment to do 
laparoscopic gallbladder removals—the cameras, TVs and 
laparoscopes—typically costs $100,000.  The new neurosurgical 
equipment that will use computers to assist in brain surgery will 
cost upwards of $1 million.  A magnetic resonance imaging machine 
(MRI) costs $1 million.  B.C. has nine MRIs and should have 18... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality, it is difficult to fund research and new 
technologies when the Medicare system cannot even keep up with 
today's demands. 
Already we have medications and new technologies that Medicare 
simply cannot afford.  Three times last year I referred patients 
to the United States, not to avoid the long Canadian waits, but 
to obtain a service that just was not available here.  There now 
is better technology with improved outcomes for the public, but 
it's so expensive that Medicare cannot provide it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt my parents' generation will accept anything less than 
the best for the management of their heart disease, diabetes, 
cancers and chronic illnesses.  Yet, my boomer generation, by 
sheer numbers alone, will challenge the sustainability of 
Medicare, as we age into our costliest health consuming years... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, what do I want for my birthday?  I would like to see further 
serious public debate on the issues as we have some serious 
decisions to make.  We have to ask:  “How much will we spend on 
Medicare?  How will we fund new medicines and technologies?  How 
do we decide what is necessary?  What will our spending 
priorities be?...Our reality is that Medicare is decaying and is 
at risk of imploding.  So, let's talk sustainability”.

and chair of the British Columbia Medical Association General 
Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do, especially for those who really care about 
health care rather than health politics?  We can be very watchful 
of the motives and the understanding of those who rant and 
derisively point the finger, saying “Someone wants two tier, 
American-style health care”.  All agree that Canadians want 
great health care that is provided fairly and without 
catastrophic personal cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution of Canada gives the provinces jurisdiction over 
social services, including health, education and training, and 
social assistance.  We need to respect our constitution and 
refrain from intruding into the provinces' jurisdiction, 
including the formulation of social policy.  Is Quebec listening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public sector now spends about $60 billion on health.  A 
cheque the size the premiers want would boost that sum by a 
little more than 5%.  Their report says that at a minimum 
“health spending could increase by close to 5% per year during 
each of the next 27 years”.  The premiers estimate that by 
2026-27 health expenditures will be 247% higher than today.  That 
prospect is not sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe all Canadians should have access to quality health 
care regardless of their financial situation.  We need to provide 
greater freedom of choice because it raises standards.  The needs 
of patients must come first in the delivery of health care 
services, before restrictive union contracts and administrative 
empire building.  We must work co-operatively with the provinces 
so that they have the resources and the flexibility to find 
effective approaches to the financing and management of health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be afraid to allow the greatest freedom possible 
to Canadians in their choice of natural health products.  We need 
to introduce restrictions only on those products that the 
government can clearly and scientifically demonstrate to be 
harmful.  With the right incentives we can learn to manage for 
health rather than for sickness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can fix the national economy for real growth through tax 
reduction and spending reallocation so that we nationally can 
create the wealth to pay for the medicare economic challenge and 
create a reliable long term funding base.

it, rather than borrow it from the next generation.  We can bring 
standards and independent auditing for greater transparency in 
the delivery of health care.  We can initiate relations with the 
provinces to support and co-operate, not punish.  We can examine 
and challenge the traditional roles of administration to get 
better efficiency and productivity.  We can become more patient 
focused with the timely use of comparative measures.  We must 
give evaluative tools to patients so they can make the local 
system more accountable and responsive to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes that families should get the best 
health care when they need it, regardless of their ability to 
pay.

accept the need to innovate and change through co-operation 
rather than coercion, local adaptability rather than condemnation 
of others.

the top one-third of OECD countries for health care, with no 
waiting lists, services that are not in jeopardy of being

health care providers through wise incentives rather than 
defensive, punitive rules and barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who we are as Canadians and our standard of living will depend

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to engage in the debate today on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of hosting a health care forum in my riding 
only a few weeks ago, so I am very familiar with some of these 
issues.  In attendance were the former Ontario deputy minister of 
health, some of the leaders of our hospitals, some primary care 
workers and some home care workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now having the debate in the House.  Members have talked 
about money.   They seem to think that the simple solution is 
just to put more money into health care and suddenly all the 
problems will go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will be interested to know that the health care workers 
themselves, while they of course would like more money, made the 
statement that it was not about money.  Indeed, Canada is the 
fourth highest spender on health care in the world.  We spend 
9.6% of our GDP on health care, $86 billion a year.  I have heard 
members of the Alliance, surprisingly enough, who are so cost 
conscious, say that maybe it should be 12%.  I was quite incensed 
by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the conclusions of the health care forum that I put on 
was that we could not continue to put money in the top of this 
thing because it was not coming out the bottom and it was not 
being delivered to the patients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have a problem in health care?  Yes, we do.  We have a 
problem getting the newest technology. If we look at the waiting 
lists, we see that they are getting longer and, at the same time, 
we are paying more money for the system.  There is definitely 
something wrong with the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see that our health care costs have been rising at the 
rate of about 5% a year and are scheduled, because of our 
demographics and our aging population, to continue to rise. 
People say it will rise as high as 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not have to tell you, as I know you have 
studied the economy quite a bit, but our economy is only 
expanding at the rate of 3% a year.  In other words, health care 
costs are actually rising twice as fast as the economy is 
growing.  Obviously, we cannot continue that because instead of 
talking about tax cuts, we would be talking about tax increases 
to maintain a system like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we need some changes in the health 
care system but what changes are needed?  Maybe some doctors are 
listening to this today and I do not want to offend them, but one 
of the comments I heard was that a normal doctor-patient ration 
is about 2,000 patients to 1 doctor.  There are differences 
depending upon specialization and so forth, but as a general 
comment, as a quick working tool, based on the province of 
Ontario's population base, we should have about 5,000 doctors. In 
fact there are 9,000 doctors in the province of Ontario and I am 
told Ontario is screaming for more doctors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the problem when we look at that quantitative analysis? 
One of the other members actually mentioned some of the 
structural problems.  It would appear that many doctors are not 
engaged in the practice of medicine or, seemingly, not on a full 
time basis.  In fact, it is thought that almost 40% of their time 
is taken up with administrative duties, such as filling in forms, 
pushing papers and so forth because of structural problems.  By 
the way, these are structural problems that provinces have put in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare say that the whole question of malpractice also creeps 
into this, the question of how to protect oneself in public 
liability cases.  This has created a big paper burden as well for 
the medical profession.  The reality it that these structural 
problems have basically created a health care system which, quite 
frankly, is broken and is not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I will be splitting my time with another member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can agree on a number of things.  First, I do not think we 
have full agreement about money.  I hear politicians of all 
stripes saying “Another $4 billion on the table will solve all 
of our problems”.  That is not so.  If it were $4 billion this 
year, it would be another $4 billion year after year after year. 
It will never go away and the system will not get any better 
because we will not have changed the structural problems with 
health care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the problems in health care as I perceive them? 
Some of them are that we do not have an integrated health care 
system.  In many of the regions we do not integrate the health 
care system itself.  In other words, when somebody gets sick at 
home and has to go to the hospital, a bunch of health care 
providers are involved in that:  ambulance drivers, paramedics 
and so forth.   In fact, by the time the person actually ends up 
in the hospital almost 40% of the costs have got nothing to do 
with health care workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we integrate those services to ensure a proper delivery 
of the system?   What occurred to me is that in many parts of 
this country we do not have a fully integrated health care 
system.  We are not using some of our best technology.  We know 
that we are in a technological revolution but if we go to some of 
our hospitals, although we do see doctors working on computers 
rather than working on patients, we also see a lot of people 
pushing paper around.   We also find that we cannot track 
patients.  In other words, we do not have the simple technology 
of a health card with a computer chip on it that gives 
information on our health record when we travel from one place to 
another in this country.  We have the technology to do that but 
we are not spending the money on the technology to make it more 
efficient. In that sense, we are not using the new technology 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have so much inefficiency within the health care 
system, we have also made choices on how we spend the money.  We 
have spent money in areas where it is not very efficient and we 
have neglected to spend money on those things that are important, 
like investing in new technologies.  I am not just talking about 
information systems, but also the newest equipment that we need 
to keep our people healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that people are healthier today than they 
were 15 years ago.  We would rather be sick today than 15 years 
ago.   All the talk in the House about the health care system 
being a terrible system has been a little bit overexaggerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are people looking for?   They understand that the system 
is not up to speed.  They also recognize that the Canadian 
population is an aging population and that this problem is just 
going to continue to get worse.  The reality is that they do not 
really care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I had my health care forum, I was amazed that people did 
not care whether it was the federal or provincial government that 
was presenting the health care forum.  All they wanted was 
somebody to take some leadership on this file, solve these 
problems and stop all the finger-pointing back and forth between 
governments about who is responsible for what.  It is not about 
private health care as opposed to public health care.  It is 
about how we can make the existing system work better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some ways we can make the system work better.  We must 
have an accountability framework to find out what people are 
concerned about in this country.   People are concerned about 
getting 24 hour primary care.  They are concerned about the long 
waiting lists that they are suffering in getting to see a 
specialist, in getting specific knee transplant operations, or 
whatever the case may be.  We can define the targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have to do as a government?   Unfortunately, or some 
may say, fortunately, we do not administer the health care 
system.  We are simply the givers of money.  People are fed up 
with that kind of attitude.  It is not about giving money.  The 
federal government must re-impose a vision of health care in this 
country.  That vision must be from sea to sea to sea and it must 
be based on basic standards that people find acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we put the money on the table we are going to say that we 
are putting it on the table but under certain conditions.  The 
conditions will be that these objectives may not be met today, 
but that over a period of time we must see progress in creating a 
better health care system or there will be no more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe some of the provinces will not buy into this 
accountability network.  We must also get the provinces working 
together.  The provinces must have their own permanent registry 
system so that they can determine best practices between 
provinces.  One of the other members talked about the 
inter-transfers between provinces not working well.  The sharing 
of best practices between provinces does not exist.  The sharing 
of medical records does not seem to exist.  We have to do these 
fundamental things in order to have a better health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is what the Canadian people want.  They want to 
stop this silly debate that we are having in the House and in the 
media about money, money, money.  This is not just about money. 
It is a much more difficult problem to solve.  We have it within 
our power to solve it.  That is the vision that this government 
has going forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening very closely because I think the whole idea of 
accountability is an important one.  My focus would be on 
accountability toward the health of Canadian citizens, not 
necessarily a focus just on money.  I do not know if that was 
what the member was pointing to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should have accountability and integration.  I was 
one of the MPs at the ecological summit.  We heard reports from 
various doctors saying that to have better health for Canadians, 
we have to integrate our food, our agriculture, our environment 
department and our health departments.  We cannot exclude any of 
them or look at them independently because when it comes to our 
health, they are interconnected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along the lines of preventative health, our health care system 
should include naturopathic doctors.  That has not been done. 
These doctors have to get a bachelor of science degree.  They 
have to train.  We have an eminent institution for naturopathic 
medicine in Toronto. The doctors have to train there for three 
more years and then they have to specialize.  They are doctors in 
their own right.  We should be able to connect with them as well 
as with our medical doctors and have that integrated to add to 
the health of our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep hearing that we cannot just throw money at it.  Nobody is 
saying that we should just throw money at it.  That is not 
happening.  Medicine and care is labour-intensive.  People cannot 
be left sick and alone.  There has to be money for primary care. 
I would like the member to respond to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I respect some of the 
things the member for Yukon has said.  Indeed, our definition of 
health care, if we expanded it, although I think it has expanded, 
most people, if asked about health care, would include 
naturopathic medicine even though traditionally it has not been 
included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her concerns about the doctors recognizing naturopathic medicine 
goes beyond that.  I know in my own province, my own audiologist, 
who grew up in New Brunswick and has a three-year university 
degree, cannot prescribe a hearing aid without a doctor signing 
the certificate.  This is ridiculous.  These are structural 
problems that would exist within the purview of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I understand what the member is saying, I have heard her 
party say that we should simply restore the funding to health 
care.  I do not think that is all that is needed.  I think we 
want to do more than just restore or increase the funding to 
health care.  We want to go beyond that to an accountability 
framework. 
<P><A NAME="LINK354"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the hon. member was speaking, he talked about certain targets. 
When we talk about the infusion of money needed into the health 
care system, quite often we hear people say that the best bargain 
we have in health care is in proper home care and in such things 
as personal care homes, which really cost very little in relation 
to keeping the same individuals in major nursing homes or 
hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government seems to hesitate putting adequate 
funding into programs where we can keep individuals in their own 
homes and in their own communities where they will be happy, 
where they will have their own families and where the cost to 
government would be minimal in comparison to putting them into 
different institutions.  The people who are charged with 
caregiving are given a meagre sum to carry out their work.  It is 
almost minimum wage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wonder what plans this government might have or what the 
member's idea would be in relation to developing a health care 
system where everybody plays a part and those who are involved in 
caregiving— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member.  A one minute response, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I might not have 
specifically mentioned home care in my speech.  Indeed, home care 
is one of the answers.  There is no question that various studies 
that have been undertaken confirm the member's finding that it is 
a lot cheaper to maintain an adequate home care system rather 
than institutional care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>After all those barriers it was also found that patients prefer 
to be in those places.  In my province the estimated average 
savings is $2,500 per patient if they were on home care rather 
than institutional care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is part of our government's thought process on how to enhance 
health care and how to do away with the so-called geriatric beds 
within our institutions to get those patients out of there and 
into better areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The  big problem about universal home care is how to define it 
and what is included and what is not.  We are still— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon member's 
time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK355"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to this motion.  It gives me an opportunity 
to set the record straight on the federal government's share of 
Canada's health care funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was announced in the 2000 budget that the government 
strengthened for the fourth consecutive time the cash transfers 
to provinces and territories through the Canada health and social 
transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 28, 2000, the federal government announced a $2.5 
billion increase to the CHST for provinces and territories to use 
over four years for health care and post-secondary education. Let 
us not forget that $2.5 billion increase flows from an investment 
made through the 1999 budget, an $11.5 billion increase in 
funding over five years specifically for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada health and social transfer provides support in the 
form of both cash and tax points to the provinces and territories 
for health care, post-secondary education, social services and 
assistance programs.  The Canada health and social transfer is 
block funding.  It gives provinces and territories the 
flexibility to allocate payments and to choose priorities of 
their own among social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the year 2000-01 the Canada health and social transfer will 
reach a new high of $30.8 billion.  Of this amount, $15.3 billion 
will be in the form of a tax transfer and $15.5 billion will be 
in the form of cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transferred tax points are not easy to understand, but they do 
form a fundamental part of the federal contribution to establish 
programs in both health and post-secondary education.  This is 
how we have been transferring money to the provinces since 1970. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax transfer occurred in 1977 when the federal government 
agreed with provincial and territorial governments to reduce its 
personal and corporate income tax rates, allowing them to raise 
their tax rates by the same amount.  As a result, revenue that 
would have flowed to the federal government to be redistributed 
began to flow directly to provincial and territorial governments. 
It continues to flow in line with the growth of the Canadian 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces and territories maintain the flexibility on when they 
draw down the $2.5 billion.  They can draw upon it to meet the 
most pressing needs in health care and in universities.  At any 
time over the course of the four years they may do what they see 
fit.  It is anticipated that the increase of $2.5 billion to the 
Canada health and social transfer will be drawn down by provinces 
and territories in a somewhat gradual manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does all this really mean?  The bottom line is that the 
federal government spends in excess of 34 cents of every public 
health care dollar spent by governments in Canada.  That is 
clearly more than the 7 cents or the 11 cents that some provinces 
and the opposition are claiming the federal government spends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us review the facts.  It is projected that governments will 
spend $64 billion on public health care in the year 2000-01.  The 
federal government will transfer $30.8 billion through the CHST 
to provinces and territories.  Based on the historical allocation 
this will translate to $18.5 billion for health care in the year 
2000-01.  In addition, the federal government spends over $3 
billion directly each year on aboriginal health care and health 
services for the armed forces and the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal direct funding combined with the $18.5 billion means 
that about $22 billion of next year's projected $64 billion 
public health care expenditure, or 34 cents for every dollar 
spent, will be financed by the Government of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we factor in the $9.5 billion the federal government will 
transfer to the less prosperous provinces and territories to 
invest in health care and other priorities, total federal 
transfers in the year 2000-01 will be over $40 billion.  All 
told, federal spending on health is at least 34 cents of every 
dollar spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government recognizes the need to ensure that health 
care continues to meet the needs of Canadians well into the 
future.  However, additional money is not the only solution.  In 
a word, our health care system requires innovation.  We must find 
new ways of responding to the health needs of Canadians.  With 
this in mind, the federal government remains committed to the 
five principles embodied in the Canada Health Act: public 
administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability and 
accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments at the federal, provincial and territorial levels 
cannot afford to spend their limited resources on health care 
ineffectively.  This is why the federal government is strongly 
committed to partnership.  It is through these efforts at reform 
and renewal that our health care system will carry Canadians well 
into this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many premiers have stated that in their view there is a need to 
reshape Canada's health care system and make necessary changes to 
ensure that it is sustainable over time.  The Government of 
Canada welcomes their view.  It is their leadership on this 
subject and our determination to work with them that will give us 
the vision that is required for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both federal and provincial governments recognize that over the 
longer term future decisions about investments in health care 
must be based on a plan that responds to the desire of Canadians 
for a more integrated approach to health care.  New resources in 
the future must be based on the shared objective of meeting the 
needs of Canadians for quality health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is the first to say that innovation in 
itself will not sustain public health care unless it is supported 
by adequate funding and a comprehensive plan of action.  Let me 
emphasize, as the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have 
said before me.  If more money is needed to ensure an accessible 
and sustainable high quality health care system in the 21st 
century, the Government of Canada will contribute its share 
toward long term financing based on this comprehensive plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that the status quo is not an option, but we will not 
go down the path of the Canadian Alliance.  We will not go where 
it would take the country.  The Minister of Health has shown that 
he is ready, willing and able to work with his provincial and 
territorial counterparts to achieve the kind of vision that will 
result in sustainable, renewed public health care for all 
Canadians.  The minister met with provincial ministers in March. 
He has spoken with many in recent days and will continue to 
teleconference.  As a matter of fact he is teleconferencing with 
all provincial health ministers tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to work co-operatively.  Canadians are 
tired of having different politicians at the multiple levels of 
government point fingers at each other.  They are interested in a 
spirit of co-operation in achieving something that will make all 
Canadians proud and serve our needs as we are an aging 
population.  That is the kind of health care system that the 
government is prepared to support and defend.  We are showing 
leadership and we will continue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK356"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is my privilege to speak to the amendment.  I thank the many 
members who have spoken to the motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members have made somewhat the same points.  The system 
does need a lot help.  I am disappointed that the health minister 
would choose to say that he would not support the motion. 
Therefore I guess he is saying that he does not believe the 
system is in crisis, that he believes the status quo is an option 
and that he thinks the system is sustainable. 
Obviously by opposing the motion he is saying those things.  I am 
rather surprised that all members of the House could not agree 
that this is a non-partisan issue.  It is an issue that we should 
be looking at because 78% of Canadians are saying that is their 
number one issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summarizing what we have heard today, basically there are 
problems between the federal and provincial ministers talking to 
each other.  We have heard about some of the turf wars that go 
on, whether it is between governments, between various 
professions or something much smaller at a very local level.  We 
have heard about the lack of long term funding, the 
sustainability of that funding, and a major disagreement as to 
who is funding what and how much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also heard from members that we are spending an adequate 
amount comparable to many of the OECD countries.  We have had 
comparisons to some of them.  We must recognize that the World 
Health Organization has said that we are falling in terms of our 
position in the world on health care.  The OECD puts us in the 
bottom third for a great many areas within health care delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a great deal of rhetoric and promises.  We have 
not heard very many solutions or calls to action.  We have not 
heard what we will do about the brain drain, technology, 
demographics and increasing drug costs.  We really have not 
addressed a key factor, the extremely growing cost of health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada today says that the costs will increase at 3% a 
year for the foreseeable future.  With our present spending of 
$86 billion on health care, by the year 2020 that figure will be 
$160 billion.  That is our total budget of today.  We are saying 
in some 20 years that will be the figure for health care alone. 
How will we deal with that?  How will we come up with some 
solutions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me try to put some of them on the table today.  Obviously we 
do not have all the answers, but we are saying that someone had 
better start looking at them.  We are saying it should be 
non-partisan.  We are saying it should be for Canadians. 
Canadians do not care whether it is federal or provincial.  They 
do not care whether it is one party or another party.  They care 
about a system which 78% of them agree is broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the solutions.  I will try to summarize them.  I 
remind members of the House that the former Reform Party had a 
task force report on health care entitled “New Directions: 
Setting the Course for Canada Health Care in the 21st Century”. 
I recommend that people read it.  It has been condensed down to 
about 90 pages.  It set some targets and goals.  I certainly wish 
members of the House would quote it as opposed to quoting some of 
the other fictitious statements we have heard here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To emphasize what I am talking about, our party would put 
forward to the House a patient centred, results based health care 
system.  In a patient centred system the patient is number one. 
What helps the patient?  What problems is the patient having?  It 
is not the systems, not the government, not the various 
organizations, but the patient.  The patient is number one.  Then 
we need to look at the results.  What are we achieving?  We do 
not need to keep protecting the Canada Health Act and hiding 
behind it.  We need to ask whether it is getting the results for 
the patient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start with two recommendations.  The first one is to 
promote federal-provincial co-operation.  How will we do that? We 
could go back in history and obviously say that in the sixties we 
came up with a formula where the federal government would provide 
50% and the provincial government would provide 50%. 
Then we worked up to another system where we used cash and tax 
points.  I do not think I need to go through all those figures. 
Then of course by 1995 we got to the CHST. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the 1993 figures, the federal government was 
transferring $18.8 billion.  In 1998 it went to a low of $12.5 
billion.  Now it has been raised back to $15.5 billion. If we 
take all that into consideration, no matter how we do the math, 
had we stayed with the 1993 figures we are $24 billion short of 
what we would have been had we kept it at the 1993 figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how the government twirls that around and hides that, 
those are facts that the provinces have recognized and 
identified.  It does not matter whether it is Mr. Romanow's 
government, Mr. Harris' government or Mr. Tobin's government, 
they are all telling the federal government the same thing. We 
have to stop antagonizing the provinces.  I certainly commend Mr. 
Romanow who said, I suppose in frustration, that he wanted to 
start a national study on this and at least hopefully get the 
ball rolling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that people do not care about whether the 
jurisdiction is provincial or federal.  They want it fixed.  The 
need is obvious.  The problems are obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the solution to this federal-provincial co-operation? 
Let me put five things forward for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we believe as Mr. Romanow does, that we need a health 
care advisory board, a group made up of federal and provincial 
citizens and of course health care workers.  We need to have that 
advisory group to look at the situation immediately.  The federal 
government should be taking the leadership role, not the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we need to restore long term stable funding to help 
federal-provincial co-operation.  We cannot go to the table with 
the provinces and say, “We are not giving any more money”.  We 
do not have to say how much we are giving them but we need to put 
all the cards on the table and talk about the money issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we need to have an independent auditing of the health 
care system.  It needs to be audited.  It cannot simply have 
money thrown at it and no one knows what anything costs.  I have 
visited many hospitals in the last three months and I keep 
asking, “What does that cost?  What would that cost?  What would 
it cost if we did this?”  No one seems to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister talked about the U.S. system and its 
administration and that all the costs are known.  I am not saying 
that is what we want.  I am saying we need to know.  We need some 
accounting.  We need to know what things cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we need to learn about the innovations in other places. 
I was very fortunate to visit the Swiss health care system a few 
weeks ago.  I was rather shocked at what I found. I was shocked 
that when a gentleman with heart pains came to the emergency ward 
he was immediately met by two cardiovascular surgeons, two 
doctors and two trained nurses.  There were eight MRIs and he was 
in an intensive care unit within six minutes.  All of his medical 
history was on a card. They knew exactly what medications he was 
on and what treatments he had had.  Now that is technology.  That 
man's life may well have been saved because of those improvements 
in that health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to learn from those innovations.  We need to look at 
what Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and other 
countries are doing.  Please, Mr. Speaker, advise the members on 
the other side to stop talking about the U.S. health care system 
as the only example.  There are many other much better health 
care systems we should be looking at that are spending the same 
amount of money that we are.  Switzerland spends 10.2% of GDP. 
We spend 9.8%.  That is awfully close for those two different 
health care systems.  We need to look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, I would recommend that we appoint a health care auditor. 
He should be empowered by the Canada Health Act to standardize, 
co-operate and modernize the Canada Health Act. 
He should have that kind of authority.  It is important to 
Canadians so that should be in place.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are concrete recommendations.  There is a great deal of 
detail that can go with those which we will be providing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to modernize the Canada Health Act.  That is a complex 
issue which I can only touch on in the minutes I have left.  We 
oppose a two tier American style health care system, one for the 
rich and one for the poor.  Nobody wants it and nobody is talking 
about it or suggesting it.  It certainly is not this party's 
position. There, it is said.  I could repeat it three or four 
more times, but I am sure the crowd across the way still will not 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will state our position on the Canada Health Act. We believe 
in the tenets of the Canada Health Act, but we are saying it is 
not working.  It needs to be modernized.  I have heard many 
people say that in the House.  I have heard many provincial 
health ministers say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is not accessible the way it is today.  Some 200,000 
people are on waiting lists. A lady in my riding wrote me a 
letter saying she had just come from her doctor and she needed to 
see a specialist and her appointment with the specialist was 
scheduled for April 11, 2001. That is not accessibility.  That is 
a system that is broken, that is not working, that is in crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about the shortage of MRIs and other technology. 
The average age of specialists is 59.  It takes 14 years to train 
them.  We train 1,600 doctors and some years 800 leave. We cut 
the number of spaces available for training doctors.  We need 
2,200 doctors just to replace what the system is going to 
require.  It is not an accessible system.  We need to fix these 
things.  We need to fix the brain drain.  We need to get the 
technology.  We need to be prepared for what we are going to be 
facing in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a portable system and many have talked about that, 
whether a person is in rural Canada or whether they need 
specialized treatment or whether they are in Quebec.  I have 
asked doctors in hospitals here about patients from Quebec.  They 
told me that they encourage them to pay first and then to go back 
and fight with their government to get the money.  That is not a 
portable system.  That is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the system universal? In Alberta there are 333 positions open 
for rural doctors right now.  It is certainly not very universal. 
The presence of specialists is not very universal, as I have 
touched on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the system comprehensive?  There are a number of delisted 
items from health care.  We have a real problem with a 
comprehensive health care system.  We are suggesting again that 
we must fix it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home care is another major issue.  My mother is in Saskatchewan 
and is presently having serious problems.  That province was a 
founder of health care and if that is how people are treated, it 
is inhumane and very troubling.  We need to look at the home care 
and palliative care issues and see what we can do.  The Senate 
just reported what it thinks about Canada's palliative care 
system and the report card was pretty dismal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about public administration.  It is fine to say that 
the system is fine the way it is, but we need to look at how we 
administer health care.  We have to open that up.  We have to 
look at the options.  I mentioned the Swiss system and I do not 
have time to go into that.  This summer I intend to visit other 
systems and look at how they work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the principles contained in the Canada Health Act, 
but they are not working.  There is not a Canadian who is not 
touched by that.  What are the solutions?  Let me summarize them 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One solution is a long term stable funding commitment with a 
minimum term of five years.  We must work out that deal 
collectively with the provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must develop technology so that we enter the 21st century and 
not stay in the 1960s where we seem to be mired. I have talked 
about that. There is a surgeon who did a heart operation in New 
York and the patient was in Idaho.  A robot did the surgery.  The 
surgeon is able to do three of those a day just by running that 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On education I have mentioned what we need to do in terms of the 
financial commitment to fix that problem.  It is not the only 
answer but we must come to the table with some dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to show leadership to modernize the Canada Health Act, 
to demonstrate co-operation between the federal and provincial 
governments.  The health minister talks about it but then he goes 
out and does something dumb which makes the provinces that much 
madder.  That will not fix the Canada Health Act and it will not 
fix what Canadians want fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a health care auditor.  As I said, we need independent 
auditing to make sure the provinces are abiding by the Canada 
Health Act and to make sure patients are not abusing the health 
care system.  We need to know what things cost if we are to have 
a health care system like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to reinvent the wheel; we can learn from others. 
Many innovative things are happening in Sweden where the system 
now is 50% public, 50% private.  I do not know if that is the way 
we should go, but we need to look at it.  There are various 
insurance options.  We need to look at those.  We need to have 
open minds and not live with a 1960s socialized state run health 
care system such as those in North Korea and Cuba.  We have to 
move out of that mindset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to modernize the whole system.  We need patient centred 
health care.  We need to be prepared to look at medical savings 
accounts and patient guarantees.  We have to fix the waiting list 
problem.  We need to be prepared to look at new technology and 
decide if that is a solution to the problems we face.  Above all, 
we need to work with the provinces and not work against them.  We 
have to stop the drive-by smears.  We have to stop the $2 million 
advertising campaign against the provinces. We have to stop 
antagonizing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Canadian Alliance stands for fiscal 
responsibility.  Members know that.  We have developed our 
principles there but I want to say in the House that we have a 
social conscience.  There are no hidden ghosts, as my colleague 
from the health committee might intimate.  There are no ghosts. 
There is no hidden agenda.  We believe in a patient centred, 
results based health care system instead of the Liberal two tier, 
turf dominated, non-sustainable, deteriorating health care 
system.  Remember that we spend the fourth most of the 
industrialized countries and we are in the bottom third in terms 
of rating our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we develop this policy collectively with the help of other 
Canadians, with the help of the provinces, we must remember that 
this patient centred health care system will result in something 
that is sustainable for Canadians.  It shocks me that the 
government or any member in the House would not support that kind 
of co-operative policy to do what is best for health care for 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have waited all day for the promise from the Canadian 
Alliance of solutions to the health care situation we find 
ourselves in today.  I have waited all day to hear what members 
in that party really mean when they talk about innovation.  I am 
still waiting.  I have rarely heard, except from perhaps the 
Minister of Health, such empty rhetoric and flowery statements 
with no substance. I have listened very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Like the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my alliance friend 
said, “Like the NDP”.  This morning we gave him a detailed list 
of an entire program for renewing our health care system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have expected Canadian Alliance members by now would be 
somewhere close to the point of putting some flesh on the bones 
and telling us what they plan to do with our health care system. 
We are no further ahead today than we were this morning or last 
week or last month when their leadership candidates talked 
publicly about creating a parallel private health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am left with a question.  Is the motion today a euphemism for 
their intent to destroy the health care system?   Are they trying 
to destroy the health care system in order to save it?  Is that 
what they are proposing today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the list of suggestions, it is worse than the 
Liberal government in terms of the studies and reviews they have 
promised.  The solutions are setting up an advisory board, an 
independent audit, learning about innovations, getting a health 
care auditor, modernizing the CHA, fixing health care, fixing the 
brain drain and fixing technologies, with no specifics.  Surely 
by now we should have some details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will see some details from them?  When will we know the 
direction in which they intend to take the health care system? 
While we are at it, could I have a very clear answer from members 
of the alliance reform party on whether they support bill 11? Yes 
or no.  At least then we might have a good indication from where 
they are starting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr.  Speaker, as I mentioned to the hon. 
member earlier, she should not have written those questions 
before she heard the speech.  The problem is that they were 
prepared this morning.  Again it is partisan politics.  It is a 
perfect example of why there are so many turf wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put partisan politics aside.  Many members in the 
House today, in fact pretty well all of them, dealt with the 
issue of health care.  They came up with what they thought should 
be examined and what the solutions might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the member to take a look at our health care task 
force report.  I encourage her to sit down with me and go through 
it point by point.  We only have 20 minutes to talk about it in 
the House.  I understand her frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill 11 is no different from what Mr. Romanow did yesterday.  He 
said he was frustrated.  Basically he took Saskatchewan party's 
idea and said that we needed a study because the feds were 
showing no leadership.  Mr. Klein was desperate and thought we 
must try something new.  We support his going ahead with bill 11 
as a pilot project to see if it works.  If it does not work, it 
could be scrapped.  If it does work, it could be implemented 
across the country. If Mr. Romanow comes up with some weird idea, 
he could try it to see if it works.  If it does, he could use it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have to do.  We need an open mind, not a closed 
mind, not a mind stuck in the sixties as many of the NDP and CCF 
policies are. 
<P><A NAME="LINK358"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to say a 
few words about the Canadian Alliance motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  If my hon. colleague from the NDP would 
quick heckling long enough, she might hear what I have to say. I 
listened very intently to the comments of the member for Red Deer 
about what we really needed in Canada.  He did a great job of 
fleshing out the alliance position and providing some real 
direction for the government if only it were willing to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the legacy of Liberal health care funding cuts in 
my riding of Prince George—Peace River.  As many members House 
know, my riding covers nearly a quarter of the land mass of 
British Columbia.  The communities in my constituency are 
isolated in relation to those in the rest of the country.  Access 
to adequate health care is not only hampered by geography but by 
funding as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A surgeon must go through a check list of criteria before an 
operation, so let us look at the check list for health care in 
Prince George—Peace River.  The average ratio of doctors to 
patients in Canada is about one to a thousand.  Yet in my riding 
it is one to fifteen hundred.  Universality, I do not think so. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for over twelve full time nurses, at least two 
general practitioners, two internists, an orthopedic surgeon and 
a general surgeon.  There is one orthopedic surgeon to service 
68,000 people.  The waiting lists for an appointment to see him 
takes a year, not to mention the wait for the actual operation. 
The same 68,000 people have access to only one OBGYN surgeon and 
one psychiatrist.  There is such a shortage of nurses that beds 
are being closed.  The critical care unit in Fort St. John, my 
home town, is contemplating closing due to staffing shortages. 
There are also shortages of physiotherapist and pharmacists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem is more than just money, despite what the NDP is 
saying.  It is about taxes, access to education, immigration 
barriers for medical professionals from other countries and the 
brain drain.  Those are all contributing factors to the critical 
shortage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural Canadians need more than platitudes from the health 
minister.  They need the federal government to take a leadership 
role and stop playing politics with the health of Canadians.  I 
can say as the representative of a huge rural riding that this is 
not unique just to northern British Columbia.  The problem is 
inherent from coast to coast to coast, but it is especially 
reaching epidemic proportions in rural Canada.  We need some 
answers and some assistance from the federal government.  For too 
long it has sloughed it off to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in hearing specifically from my colleague, 
the health critic for the Canadian Alliance, what his thoughts 
are about the problems of health care in rural Canada and the 
fallacy of the universality of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously the frustration has 
been well demonstrated.  That is why 78% of Canadians say that 
the system is in crisis.  To have the health minister quote a 
little paragraph today saying that it is not in crisis is 
shocking.  The other opposition members should be attacking a 
government that would let that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we deal with the brain drain?  Who cut the seats in 
universities for training doctors?  Who cut the training in 
specialist programs?  I have talked to a number of hospitals and 
universities.  Sixteen universities teach medicine.  All of them 
have said they have had to cut their programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nursing program in the college in the town I come from had 
450 applications but only 60 places for training.  That is a 
problem that has come from the federal government.  We need to 
collectively attack the federal government to fix that problem. 
The system is broken.  We have a two tier health care system or 
maybe, as most professionals would say, a five or six or ten tier 
system.  That is what we should be focusing on.  That is the 
frustration of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that there will be frustration in the House if the 
motion on which we will be voting does not receive 100% support. 
The system is in crisis.  The system is not sustainable.  Status 
quo is not an option.  If anybody in the House says that it is 
not true, he or she is saying that the system is not in crisis, 
that the system is sustainable and that status quo is all right. 
Those members will hide behind the Canada Health Act and say it 
is wonderful.  They will say “Tommy, you did it for us”, but 
that was in the sixties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get into the 21st century.  We have to do it 
collectively and all come up with the answers.  As mentioned by 
the whip of the Canadian Alliance, the cry is coming from 
everybody. 
<P><A NAME="LINK359"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am torn a bit between saying congratulations to the member for 
Red Deer and questioning where the backup is to those remarks. If 
there is one thing we are about in this place, it is words. When 
the member says that the Canadian Alliance is opposed to a two 
tier American health care system, I really want to believe him. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT96"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT96"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1655

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is articulate.  He put his thoughts forward.  He 
justified his case.  It is just a shame that he did not decide to 
run for leadership of his party.  Maybe then the words he spoke 
would somehow miraculously find their way into the policy book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem.  How do Canadians make a judgment on whom 
to believe when the provinces are saying different things about 
who is at fault if there are problems in the health care system? 
The opposition parties are blaming the government.  The 
government is naturally defending its position by saying that it 
is prepared to sit down and talk about how we can fix the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members are calling federal-provincial co-operation some 
kind of magical thing.  What was the nation been built on if not 
federal-provincial co-operation?  There have been some 
exceptions, I say to my hon. colleague from the Bloc, but even 
then there were examples when there have been good Liberal 
governments in the province of Quebec and relations were 
excellent between them and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members are calling for something that is the very 
foundation of the nation.  Yet they claim the changes they would 
put in place would somehow not lead to a two tier system. If the 
words match the music, if the pants match the suit, maybe 
Canadians would have some sense of confidence that they are 
saying what they really mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the examples.  I saw the most incredible display 
the other night while watching the debate on the pension issue on 
TV.  Members of the Canadian Alliance were attacking the Tories 
and back and forth.  There were accusations about promises made. 
They indicated that they would do politics differently when they 
arrived in this capital city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were not to accept Stornoway as the residence for the 
Leader of the Opposition.  We know what happened there.  The 
leader lives there now, or at least entertains there perhaps. 
There were not to accept the limo for the Leader of the 
Opposition.  We know what happened there.  After the great 
demonstration of handing the keys over and saying that it would 
not be used, we know what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they are saying does not match the actions we have seen in 
the past by that party.  I believe the critic for the alliance 
who just spoke personally believes what he is saying.  He is 
dedicated and committed to his community and to the health care 
system.  I believe he has credentials which say that. 
Notwithstanding, it is just a shame that the rest of his party 
will not come to the same conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just look at some of the facts, if we might.  The former 
health critic is a man who I also think is a respected person in 
his community, the hon. member for Macleod. What did he say?  He 
is a doctor and here was his solution to fix the health care 
system: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about a medisave account?  I would equate this to an 
insurance policy on a car.  We do not insure our cars for oil 
changes.  We insure them for major catastrophes like an awful 
crash that would break us if it happened.  We insure for the 
repair bills on a major issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if we insured for catastrophic things in Canada? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Words are really important, but what do they mean?  We do not 
have to read between the lines.  We can just read the actual 
lines.  They would provide health care insurance for major 
catastrophes.  They would provide health care insurance for life 
threatening situations, diseases, injuries, heart attacks or 
cancer, but they would not provide it without some additional 
payment for other issues.  Perhaps they would knock emphysema off 
the list.  According to them patients on oxygen could live on 
that and do not need the health care system; maybe that is one 
thing that could be delisted.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Picture the single mom sitting at home.  Perhaps she has a job 
or is on welfare.  She may have a child who has a fever of 103 or 
104 degrees, is burning up, coughing and is ill. What does she 
do?  Does she ask “How much money do I have in my medisave 
account?”  Can she afford to take Johnny or Mary to the hospital 
when they are showing all those symptoms?  It is just so bizarre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says he does not support a two tier system, whether 
it is called American or anything else, I do not really care, but 
it is clearly a two tiered system that the Alliance Party is 
talking about, unless it is adhering to what I heard the other 
night in the debate when a member was asked about his party's 
position while debating pensions.  The member actually stood in 
this place and said that the Alliance no longer had that policy 
because it was a new party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are hearing is that it has thrown out the former Reform 
Party blue policy book, or whatever colour it is, and that the 
new party has no policies on any of these items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day in the House our finance minister, in response to 
a question about health care and financing, held up a copy of the 
Canadian Alliance's web page.  In the section that was laid out 
for health care policies, the words were something to the effect 
that its position has not been developed yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we developing policies for, admittedly what the vast 
majority of Canadians consider to be a most important aspect, the 
health care system?  Are we down to developing policy based on a 
critic's speech on an opposition day, on a concocted motion that 
has been written in such a way as to make it perhaps politically 
difficult to vote against?  Is that how we are formulating policy 
for the development of this country's health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned Premier Romanow.  I watched the premier on 
the news last night and I was quite impressed.  I say to the 
member from Regina that I readily and openly admit that 
Saskatchewan is really the seat of medicare.  It is the founding 
province of medicare. The NDP had a lot to do with that under 
their former great leader Tommy Douglas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting now to see that province, one of our smaller 
provinces in terms of population, coming up with some 
constructive ideas about establishing a national report, about 
looking for ways to work co-operatively with the federal 
government.  I do not see that province flying a bill like bill 
11, which everyone in the province of Alberta is frightened to 
death about because they fear that it will lead to 
Americanization.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we have is that we have another document, a federal 
document called NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. I 
guess the greatest fear of the people in Alberta is that when 
bill 11 is put into force, the American health care company 
service providers will have the ability to come in and open up 
clinics that will provide surgery, and more than than just day 
surgery, they will be able to provide beds and care for patients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once NAFTA is opened up in terms of the health care services, I 
submit to all members in this place that we will run a very 
serious risk.  For the members opposite to say that they are not 
supporting this, let us just pretend that we can take them at 
their word.  The member for Red Deer says that the Alliance is 
not in favour of a two tier American health care system.  How do 
we stop it once we open the marketplace up to for profit American 
or even Canadian health care company providers. How do you stop 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member for Macleod's solution for some form of 
medisave bank account would be the only solution.  We would have 
to go to Canadians if we wanted to ensure that they had 
accessibility, portability and all the things that are so 
important in our system:  universality, accessibility, 
portability and comprehensiveness. 
If we want to ensure that is all there, we will have to write 
them a cheque if we allow the provision of health care services, 
through the political games that are being played here, to go the 
route of privatization.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not convinced one way or the other on that bill.  I have no 
problem having a debate on the issue.  I do not really agree with 
the hysteria that we see coming from the NDP and the 
demonstrations that we see happening in Alberta.  I think we do 
need to look at new ideas, such as the idea that Premier Romanow 
has floated recently in having a national study put together to 
see how we can best work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should not stand in this place as the critic, as 
a representative of the official opposition, and make statements 
that are not backed up by the words of the people who are running 
to be the leader, that are purportedly running to be prime 
minister, they think in their wildest dreams.  One cannot make 
those statements while there is an all-candidates meeting going 
on on television and the opposite is being said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have one program where we would have a medisave account.  Let 
us talk about some of the other solutions.  Again I say to the 
members opposite, it is wonderful for them to stand in here and 
make a claim that they are not in support of an American two tier 
health care system, but what about the member for Esquimalt—Juan 
de Fuca?  He has made privatized medicare, private for profit 
health care a plank of his campaign to stand for leader of the 
Canadian Alliance Party.  What has he said?  In March 2000 in 
this place, in <I>Hansard</I>, he called for us to amend the 
Canada Health Act to allow for more private services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really interesting is that at the conclusion of that 
member's speech, he admitted that it would be an unfair, unequal 
system.  This is person who is running to lead the official 
opposition who would try to put forth what can only be described 
as a fraud on the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance members have tried to mislead Canadians by 
saying that their party will somehow, in some magical way, save 
medicare and that they are not in support of for profit 
Americanization and two-tier health care, but that is not what 
their leadership candidates are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca then goes on, in that 
same speech, to ask, rhetorically, if it was unequal.  “Yes, it 
is”, he said.  “I would argue that it is better to have an 
unequal system that provides better access to health care for all 
Canadians than we have today”. That was said by one of the 
candidates, a sitting member of this place, who was clearly 
standing up for what could only be described as the two tier 
Americanization of our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to some of the members who are perhaps in a better 
place to win that leadership.  Let us talk about the former 
treasurer of Alberta, Stockwell Day.  When asked recently what he 
would let provincial governments do when it came to health care, 
a provincial politician, he bluntly stated that health care was a 
provincial jurisdiction.  What does that mean?  Does that mean 
that he would perhaps follow the policy book of the former Reform 
Party which, when it came to how much it would increase health 
care funding in its policy book, the amount was zero, not a dime, 
not a cent, not a loonie, not a toonie, nothing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is Stockwell Day saying that is his commitment to how he would 
improve health care?   Would he turn it all over to the 
provinces, turn it over to Ralph Klein or to Mike Harris, and 
allow them to once again put in place what could potentially open 
the floodgates under NAFTA to allow for for-profit health care 
providers to take over the marketplace?  I suppose that is 
clearly an option and one that we do see.  The reason that we 
talk about Americanization is because that is where we see it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very close friend who was the best man at my wedding 
30-some years ago.  He moved to the United States and has a 
business there.  He has lived in Los Angeles and other places for 
many years.  He comes home to Canada all the time.  A couple of 
years ago my friend's wife found out she had breast cancer and 
had to go for treatment in the United States.  This is a family 
with a small business.  They are not multi-millionaires.  The 
treatment to save his wife worked, thank God, but it cost over a 
quarter of a million dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does a family come up with resources like a quarter of a 
million dollars?  Where do they find that money?  Imagine the 
agony of a family in the United States finding out that a loved 
one has contracted a disease that is going to take a quarter of a 
million dollars to cure and they have no possibility, no access, 
no hope of ever coming up with the funding for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian Alliance truly is opposed to that, I am happy. I 
just do not understand why we get so many different messages from 
different people in that party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the former leader of the former reform party, 
a current sitting member, although one would find it hard to say 
that the word sitting is appropriate, the former member for 
Calgary Southwest.  In May, in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, he was 
quoted as saying that if he was ever elected prime minister, God 
forbid, that no province would ever receive penalties for 
violating the Canada Health Act.  He called for user fees, 
deductibles and private delivery services in a speech to the 
Ontario Hospital Association Convention in Toronto in November of 
1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  He got a standing ovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  He might have got a standing ovation. 
I am not saying that there are not some people, particularly in 
the health care industry, who might support user fees, but it is 
the Canadian public, the small business, the families who are on 
welfare and the working poor in this country who we must be 
concerned about.  What are we going to do with them, let them 
sink or swim?  It is absolutely unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that is most interesting when we talk in 
terms of financial contributions to the health care system.  The 
Alliance has recently joined the Bloc and the NDP in demanding 
that a cheque for $4.2 billion be given to the provinces, yet 
this is another area where it simply does not match the policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the commitment in the policy of either the new Canadian 
Alliance or the former reform party to funding health care?  I 
have said it before.  It is zero, but it wants to stand and say 
that even though it would not be prepared to do it if it were 
ever the government, that we should do it, that there should just 
be a blank cheque with no concern about whether or not that money 
is used to try to help mental health patients, as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone think that there just might be a correlation between 
the fact that Mike Harris closed 6,000 mental health beds in his 
first term in office in the province of Ontario and the number of 
homeless people on the streets in Toronto, Ottawa, Vancouver and 
Montreal?  Does anyone think that in Ontario at least there might 
be a relationship there?  Does anyone live on the street in 
Canada in February unless they are ill or involved in some kind 
of substance abuse? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a mental health problem and it is caused by a provincial 
cutback in the area of delivering services to mental health at 
the same time that the provincial government slashes income taxes 
to its rich friends by 30%.  There is a correlation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is not prepared to write blank cheques.  We want 
to know what the provinces are going to do to deliver the proper 
quality health care to all Canadians.  To that end, we will work 
with the provinces to ensure that happens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the Liberal member who just spoke. 
I agree with his criticisms of the Canadian Alliance, the old 
Reform Party.  Far be it from me to come to its defence, but it 
was very interesting that he kept blaming the Canadian Alliance 
for its very conservative agenda.  My question for the member is, 
why is the government basically being driven by the Reform Party? 
Why has it followed the Canadian Alliance agenda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has a background that is very sensitive to the trade 
union movement, ordinary working people and progressive movement, 
but the government across the way is more conservative than Brian 
Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was here in the Mulroney days and Brian Mulroney would never 
have cut back on health care like the Liberal government has 
done.  Brian Mulroney would never have cut back on the CBC and 
Radio Canada like this government has done.  Brian Mulroney would 
never have cut back any of the social programs like this 
government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this government so afraid of the Reform Party, the new 
Canadian Alliance?  Why has it adopted so much of the Canadian 
Alliance agenda?  Why is it so conservative?  I hope the member 
will answer that question rather than just provide a bunch more 
rhetoric because it is a curiosity and I hear that question often 
from my constituents.  They ask me “Why is this government so 
conservative?  Why is this probably the most conservative 
government we have had since the second world war?  Is it because 
the government is so afraid of the Alliance and the Alliance 
agenda?  Why has it picked up so much of that agenda?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know that one 
could say it is a conservative agenda to support universality, 
accessibility, portability, comprehensiveness and public 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says he does not want rhetoric.  How about the facts? 
We have restored funding, with an additional $2.5 billion in the 
last budget on top of the $11.5 billion for the provinces.  We 
have said that we are prepared to commit more money to health 
care.  I sat in this place today and heard the minister say that. 
He is prepared to commit more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no fear on this side of the House of that party.  Let 
the member give his head a shake if he thinks there is one 
scintilla of fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the member that the Canadian people expect us to be 
fiscally responsible.  If we were to adopt the NDP way we would 
wind up in a situation after five years like that in the province 
of Ontario when Bob Rae was the premier and the debt went from 
$39 billion to $110 billion, with continuous deficits.  We will 
not act like the former Mulroney government and run $42 billion 
deficits.  We will be fiscally responsible and committed to 
social programs such as health care. 
<P><A NAME="LINK361"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, may I say at the outset of my very 
brief remarks that I cannot believe the audacity of the member 
opposite.  He talked about how parties on this side want to write 
blank cheques and the Liberals are above that.  I would submit 
that if they were not so used to writing blank cheques to all 
their friends through the HRD department and all their grants and 
contributions to big business and rewarding friends of the Prime 
Minister in Shawinigan, maybe there would be a little money left 
over for health care.  People know out in the real world that his 
statement that they are not prepared to write blank cheques is 
absolute foolishness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his brief remarks he referred to a mental health problem in 
Ontario.  I think the mental health problem in Ontario is with 
some of the Ontario MPs who are in this Chamber.  That is where 
the problem lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is, and I referred to it briefly in remarks that I 
made earlier today, in rural Canada, in rural British Columbia we 
have a real problem.  Earlier this week my hon. colleague from 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley brought up the issue of how short 
we are in our hospitals in northern B.C. and north central 
British Columbia, specifically in Prince George.  The fact is, 
the cuts from the federal government have created this problem in 
health care in Canada and it is not living up to its 
responsibility to provide adequate services so that we can have 
the doctors we need in hospitals in Prince George. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I thought the member 
had just a bit of a sense of humour I might not be upset about 
the comments about mental health.  To somehow denigrate mental 
health or try to turn it into a political issue is disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a brother, the member should know, who died because of a 
mental illness.  It is a very serious problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He should stand in his place and apologize.  He really should. 
The mental health issue is one which I think has been ignored, 
not only by the provinces but by our own government.  I am quite 
prepared to admit that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to sit down with the provinces to ensure that, if we are 
going to transfer money, some it goes to mental health.  We need 
to ensure that the money is tied to services for mental health. 
The money should go directly to help the people who need it most, 
instead of having spurious remarks made by people like the member 
opposite about those people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was stunned to hear the speech made by the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easier to see the mote in one's neighbour's eye than the 
beam in one's own. I think the member said nothing but lies. I am 
sorry to have to use that word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After his government has cut transfers to the provinces by $33 
billion since 1993, the member is trying to teach these same 
provinces a lesson. Enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member should look at what his government is doing 
in the area of health. It took money and put it in its own pocket 
when it is the provinces, and not the federal government, that 
are responsible for delivering services to the public. It padded 
its purse at the expense of the sick and at the expense of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to say he is sorry and admit that what 
he just said is nonsense. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am a little surprised 
at you.  She said that I lied.  At least the English translation 
said that.  I do not know what she said in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the hon. member 
for Jonquière alleged that the member for Mississauga West had 
lied—and I have forgotten the French term because I try not to 
remember it—I am sure it would be withdrawn. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I meant to say he 
misrepresented the truth. That is what I meant. He misrepresented 
the truth. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I certainly accept 
that.  I know that the hon. member would never knowingly descend 
to that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if there 
was something lost in the translation, but I know what I heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not at all surprised.  If I make a speech in this place and 
I do not get the Bloc members upset, then I really think I have 
not done my job.  We all understand what their agenda is.  We 
understand that they want to rip the country apart and they will 
use the health care system to do it or the day care system or any 
kind of system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most disgusting comments I have ever heard a politician make 
about another politician were made by Premier Bouchard in 
referring to the Prime Minister of this country.  It was 
unbelievable.  He should apologize and this party should demand 
that he apologize and not use those kinds of remarks when 
referring to the Prime Minister.  I do not care about the 
partisanship.  It was totally cheap, personal and uncalled for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It has been brought 
to my attention by others that in fact the word “lie” was used 
and I wonder if the member for Jonquière would withdraw the 
remark because I know it is not in keeping with her character. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologized. I 
explained that I meant to say he misrepresented the truth. I 
apologized. I withdraw the word “lies”, but the member 
misrepresented the truth. That is what I meant to say. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is absolutely 
no problem.  I just wanted to make sure it was on the record so 
that it would be finished.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion, and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK373"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to engage in this debate on the health care system 
and its future.  I fear that with less than four minutes left in 
the time allotted I will not have the opportunity to address a 
lot of the issues that I would like to address, but I will try to 
address as many as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 9 provincial and territorial governments issued an 
interim report on understanding Canada's health care costs.  Let 
me first say that the Government of Canada very much welcomed 
such efforts.  Health policy decision making in Canada needs to 
be informed by better evidence, a better understanding of the 
issues and a better understanding of the prospects we face.  This 
report is a good step along the road to that better 
understanding.  I know that federal and provincial governments 
and their officials will continue to work toward enriching our 
understanding of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start with what the report called the base cost 
drivers.  The report takes a very broad cut at estimating what 
those drivers could be.  It argues that health care costs in 
Canada will be pushed up by four key drivers:  inflation, 
population growth, population aging and a catch-all category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is general inflation.  As the overall cost of living 
rises, so will the amount of money that needs to be spent on 
health care.  The report pegs this pressure at about 2% a year, 
which is consistent with the policies of this government to keep 
inflation between 1% and 3% so as to keep interest rates low and 
the economy strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is population growth.  As the number of Canadians 
grows so will the need for health care spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is population aging.  It is well known that older 
Canadians have more health care needs than younger Canadians by a 
wide margin.  They are more likely to have chronic health 
problems, those that persist and cannot simply be fixed by some 
procedure like setting a broken limb, and are more likely to need 
some ongoing form of care as health problems cost them some of 
their independence.  The aging of Canada's population will thus 
inevitably add to health care cost pressures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report estimates that between now and 2026 aging will add 
around 1% a year to health costs, somewhat lower for the next few 
years, and more further out as the baby boomer generation moves 
into their sixties and seventies and beyond.  One of the reasons 
there will be more older Canadians in the future is not only 
because we are living longer, but because we are healthier and 
indeed having more years of life in good health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last base cost driver the report mentions is a catch-all 
category.  The report assumes that we will spend more on health 
care year in and year out between now and 2026 to cover off 
increases in the available health care technology and for a 
variety of other pressures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, health care costs in Canada have risen faster than 
just population growth, the effect of aging and general 
inflation.  These four factors together, general inflation, 
population growth, aging and this other component, gave a base 
estimate that health care costs in Canada will rise about 5% a 
year from now until 2026.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to speak in 
support of this motion this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has made a commitment to improve the 
quality of life of all Canadians.  We have developed a complete 
and cohesive vision to enable us to attain that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That vision was defined in the throne speech and given concrete 
form in the budget.  The supply bill we are debating today is 
proof of that.  This vision is a clear one.  We are striking a 
fair balance between expenditures, tax reductions and paying 
down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our government came into power, we inherited an impressive 
deficit of $42 billion.  With the support of Canadians in every 
part of the country, we have eliminated this deficit.  After 
years of austerity, we are now in a position to make 
investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not investing carelessly, however.  It is not our 
intention to go back to the spending policies of the 
Conservative government of that time. 
Instead, we will be investing strategically and responsibly in 
health and in programs that will enable us to create employment, 
to improve people's feeling of security, both individual and 
collective, and to promote prosperity in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have told us what they wanted: a prosperous country 
with well-protected communities, a country with a healthy 
environment, and opportunities for their children's future. 
They also want a country with a heart, a country with 
compassion, one with a shared and profound feeling of collective 
responsibility.  Those are the objectives of Canadians, and 
those are our objectives as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we are talking numbers today, but we cannot lose sight 
of the real meaning behind those numbers.  It is easy to 
consider major expenditures as merely abstract figures. 
It is sometimes harder to see the human aspect that lies behind 
the columns of figures presented to us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to do it however. We must never forget that the 
expenditures we are discussing today will have an impact on the 
everyday life of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investments proposed in the supply bill will increase the 
ability of the RCMP to ensure the safety and security of our 
communities. They will help prairie farmers who have fallen on 
hard times. They will reinforce native communities. They will 
help young people to have access to post-secondary education and 
good jobs. They will make access to government services easier, 
and will thus bring citizens and their government closer 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I support the bill before us today. It is a good 
bill that will help people across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members 
are aware, the government is asking for $34.5 billion in this 
supply bill. It represents a huge portion of this year's main 
estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main estimates reflect most of the spending plan 
presented by the government in the March budget. The main 
estimates for fiscal year 2000-01 amount to $156.2 billion, or 
nearly 99% of the total projected expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This includes the government's request to parliament with 
respect to a sum of $50.1 billion for which an annual 
authorization is required, and $106.1 billion worth of 
expenditures authorized under current acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting, in passing, that this year's main estimates 
show a $4.6 billion, or 3%, increase over last year's estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that we are going backwards and spending 
wildly. This is not how this government is managing its 
operations. In fact, the total expenditures as a percentage of 
GDP has decreased over the last four years, from 17.1% in 
1997-98, to 15.8% now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same for program spending, with expenditures to reach 
$116 billion in 2000-01, or $4 billion less than in 1993-94. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reasons why this year's main estimates are 
$4.6 billion higher than last year. 
For one thing, we have put $1 billion more into the Canada health 
and social transfer, and $700 million more into old age security, 
the guaranteed income supplement and the spouse's allowance 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of our ageing population, we see that the number of 
beneficiaries and the mean rate of benefits are increasing. 
Canadians have told us what their priorities are: a strong 
social security net, and reliable, quality health care. We have 
listened to them and, as you can see, we are making the 
necessary investments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our commitment to serving Canadians is also clearly reflected in 
the funding that we are seeking approval for today.  A 
significant portion of these funds will go to maintaining and 
preserving the levels of service that Canadians expect from their 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of this money will go to ensure the sustainability of a 
number of core federal services.  We intend to improve among 
other things the safety of the country's public infrastructure. 
We want to augment the safety of food inspection.  We want to 
speed up the response times and capacity of search and rescue 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plans outlined in the supply bill will allow us to do this. 
Let me stress again the supply bill is not just about numbers; it 
is about people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funds we are seeking approval for are not arbitrary amounts. 
These funds will help us administer and fund programs and 
services that increase our general prosperity and 
competitiveness.  We made a commitment to do this in the Speech 
from the Throne and these were not idle words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I close my remarks, I would like to touch briefly on a 
related topic.  There has been concern of late about the policies 
and frameworks that guide government expenditures.  Concerns have 
been raised, particularly about grants and contributions.  It 
would be remiss of me as President of the Treasury Board not to 
address this issue for a moment this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians work hard for their money.  They expect the government 
to manage their tax dollars wisely and with great care. Canadians 
have a right to expect their government to administer funds 
judiciously.  This principle is one of the pillars of good 
government.  It is something this government takes very 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why on June 1 I announced measures to strengthen the 
management of public spending through a revised policy on 
transfer payments.  The revised policy will strengthen the 
supervision of grants and contributions, focus on results, 
promote responsible spending and heighten effective control. 
Above all it will provide for increased accountability and 
transparency to parliament and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a knee-jerk response to recent headlines.  The 
revisions we have implemented were not hastily put together. 
Rather they are a result of the review of the policy of grants 
and contributions that was initiated in 1999.  This was many 
months before the Human Resources Development Canada internal 
audit raised concerns about the grants and contributions issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government routinely reviews its policies and frameworks to 
ensure that they are up to date and serving Canadians well.  The 
review of grants and contributions was part of an initiative 
aimed at updating all policies related to the comptrollership 
function of the treasury board.  We are taking measures on the 
broad front to identify ways to improve the stewardship of public 
funds.  I should note that the revised policy on internal audits 
and evaluations is also forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revised policy on transfer payments requires that 
departments guarantee that measures are in place to ensure due 
diligence in approving payments.  There must also be due 
diligence for verifying eligibility entitlement whenever a new 
contribution program is being established or renewed. Eligibility 
criteria for receiving assistance must be predetermined, made 
public and applied on a consistent basis.  We want to ensure that 
grants are made in a fair and transparent manner. The playing 
field must be level and everyone must know what the rules are. 
Canadians should tolerate nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before funds can be allocated, departments must demonstrate that 
they have a results based accountability framework in place. 
Accountability is essential to effective stewardship.  These 
frameworks must include performance indicators, expected results 
and outcomes, as well as evaluation criteria to be used in 
assessing a program's effectiveness.  After all, we cannot give 
public funds to projects that do not produce some sort of 
quantifiable results. Furthermore, departments must recommend 
specific limits to federal assistance where recipients receive 
funding from multiple levels of government, including other 
federal sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other important aspects of the revised policy.  All 
programs will be required to be formally renewed through the 
treasury board at least once every five years to ensure ongoing 
relevance and effectiveness. 
If there are concerns about a program, this renewal process may 
be considerably less than five years.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concentrating on transparency.  The Government of 
Canada is committed to operating in an open manner.  We have made 
improving reporting one of our main management priorities.  This 
commitment is clearly reflected in the policy on transfer 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departments must report on each transfer payment program which 
transfers in excess of $5 million in their annual departmental 
reports on plans and priorities.  This must include descriptive 
materials such as stated objectives, expected results and 
outcomes, as well as milestones for achievements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departments must also follow up on this later in the year in 
their departmental performance reports.  They must look at the 
commitments they made in their reports on plans and priorities 
and show evidence of the results achieved.  In this way we ensure 
that all major programs are showing progress.  If they are not, 
we will know why and be able to respond accordingly. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This revised policy on transfer payments only represents one 
element of our broader efforts aimed at modernizing the 
practices of the comptroller's duties. That element, in turn, is 
part of a larger and co-ordinated initiative aimed at modernizing 
public management in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expectations and requirements of Canadians are changing and 
public management practices must follow suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we developed a new management framework, which will 
allow us to take up the challenges of the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last March, I tabled the new management framework in parliament. 
It is entitled “Results for Canadians”. This document shows how 
management practices change to adapt to the changing priorities 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It describes our new management philosophy, which stresses the 
need to maintain a strict control while using tools that enhance 
initiative and creativity in government departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It describes our management commitments, the way we strive to 
create a government more focused on citizens, on results and on 
values, intent on spending responsibly the funds made available 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this management framework shows how we honour our 
commitments, by working assiduously on many fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some respects, the supply bill is a major component of that 
process. The items for which we are seeking approval will help 
us meet our objectives. They will help us fund programs that 
will improve our capacity to serve Canadians. In short, they 
will also help us improve the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what citizens of this country want, and that is also 
what they deserve. Finally, without any doubt, that is what this 
government has committed to give them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the speech of the 
president of the treasury board. I would like to draw her 
attention to the grants and contributions issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that, after the situation at HRDC was revealed, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development said the situation was 
serious. This was directly contradicting the Prime Minister, who 
had talked about a $101 problem. Her attitude, at least at the 
time, seemed to be more responsible than the Prime Minister's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, she talked a lot about having instituted a review of the 
policy for the future. But she also talked about control. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The control function involves, among other government 
responsibilities, imposing sanctions when mistakes are made and, 
more than mistakes, when unacceptable behaviours occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be great if the government could manage to rectify the 
situation in the future, but until today, it has not done 
anything to stop the use of funds for partisan reasons, which 
has been revealed, verified and demonstrated here in the House 
through a number of questions, particularly in the Prime 
Minister's riding, where public funds have constantly been used 
in an inappropriate and unacceptable fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the president of the treasury board 
thinks something could be done to correct the situation. I have 
read reports in the paper this week, which I found alarming. 
There are people in the present Liberal government who say “We 
should get rid of job creation programs, because we really 
mismanaged them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the president of the treasury board share that opinion? 
Does she agree with the members of the Liberal majority who say 
that there should be no more job creation programs to stimulate 
economic growth in areas of high unemployment? Or would she 
agree that better control mechanisms and penalties are necessary 
to make sure that the present situation does not repeat itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does she agree with me that there should have been an 
independent public inquiry and that concrete measures should 
have been taken to condemn such use of public funds for partisan 
purposes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B> Mr. Speaker, let us try to clarify 
things here.  My colleague has several different elements to his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, the situation that was brought to our 
attention related to an internal audit.  It is totally normal for 
a minister to have an internal audit done.  I would say it was 
the ABC of administration for a department to have an internal 
audit.  It is an essential administrative tool for proper 
knowledge of what is going on as far as departmental programs are 
concerned, in order to see what is going well or less well in the 
application of those programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put ourselves into the proper context.  This was an 
internal audit carried out by the department, which had decided 
on its own to audit seven separate departmental programs. As soon 
as the internal audit report was completed and submitted to the 
minister concerned, it was made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister herself considered the situation so important that 
she released the report to the public, immediately proposing an 
action plan to remedy the problems.  As far as I know, nowhere in 
the internal audit report was there any proof that there had been 
problems relating to partisan funding, as my colleague over there 
has said.  These are his own conclusions, and I do not share 
them, absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the programs addressed by the internal 
audit were not strictly job creation programs, but also ones for 
other clienteles.  I am thinking for instance of the literacy 
program.  Various HRDC programs were covered in the audit report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The programs covered by the internal audit were evaluated. 
Nowhere was this program mentioned.  These are national programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the situation became known, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development called on treasury board for help in putting an 
appropriate action plan in place.  And that is what we did.  We 
worked very closely with Human Resources Development Canada.  I 
even delegated a very senior official from my department, who 
worked with Human Resources Development Canada to put the plan in 
place. In addition, the plan was approved by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see no need anywhere for a public inquiry.  We are aware of 
the administrative problems of this program, and we have, 
accordingly, formulated an action plan that, at the moment, is in 
place and rectifying the problems in the system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask a question of the minister.  She 
talked about all the improvements, which was fine, but we still 
have a fundamental problem regarding the approval of the 
estimates and the fact that the motion that is being debated is 
actually a motion by the President of the Treasury Board to 
reinstate the $992 million for her department.  That is the first 
motion that will be voted on because the Canadian Alliance put 
forward a motion to strike $110 million from that department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on this evening when the first vote is called it will be 
on the $992 million, which I think is fundamentally wrong. That 
is the main motion.  After the main motion is agreed to, we will 
be asked to vote on our amendment, which is totally converse and 
upside down to everything else that happens in the House. The 
amendment to the main motion is voted on before the main motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of all the improvements the minister has suggested 
are taking place, will she tell tell House that she will 
undertake a study to ensure that the standing orders are amended 
so that when it comes to supply we vote on the amendment to the 
main motion before the main motion? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague knows very 
well that he can refer this matter to other committees of the 
House, which will study the whole regulatory question.  We are, 
at present, in a position to follow exactly what is going on in 
the House and therefore to follow the regulations before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians have had the main estimates before them for a 
number of weeks, and I am sure that they have looked carefully at 
this government spending and will monitor it carefully.  For this 
reason, I thought it important in my presentation, given the 
recent concerns expressed particularly with respect to the grants 
and contributions program, to inform the House of the 
improvements we have made in recent policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that my colleague in opposition will study this 
policy closely, and perhaps take it to the public accounts 
committee which he chairs, to see the benefits of implementing 
this policy in all government departments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK381"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
would love to understand what the minister is saying. Whenever I 
inquired about a project involving the Department of Human 
Resources Development, I was told time and time again that, in 
the past, they followed treasury board guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister just told me that they revised their guidelines for 
the future. Is this to say that, in the past, there were no 
guidelines or that the guidelines were not followed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should point 
out to the hon. member that a policy existed before June 1, in 
fact there has always been a policy on transfer payments with 
respect to grants and contributions. Such a policy has always 
existed and has been reviewed over the years. The last time was 
in 1994, six years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, a group of outside consultants who had been asked to 
see how we could modernize the control function submitted a 
report in which they strongly recommended that we review our 
policy on grants and contributions, which we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear therefore that there is a treasury board policy with 
very specific requirements, which applies to all departments and 
which has been significantly strengthened compared to the former 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the problems that have occurred at Human Resources 
Development Canada— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry, but time has 
run out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not often that I start this annual debate on the business 
of supply by congratulating the minister but I would like to do 
that on the progress she has announced this evening in the things 
that she is undertaking, about new policies to administer grants 
and contributions. While she has made these initiatives, they 
have been at the encouragement and coaxing of the public accounts 
committee which has been talking about these issues for quite 
some time.  It has been telling the minister to make some real 
progress in ensuring that the door for grants and contributions 
is narrow and specific and is not five miles wide so that anybody 
can drive through and help themselves.  It seems that we are 
making some progress in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to commend her because obviously the minister 
has read my private member's bill on program evaluation which 
talks about four things.  First is that the public policy shall 
be determined and articulated.  After we know what the program is 
trying to do we then ask how well we are doing it. Then we can 
ask, are we doing it efficiently and can we achieve the same 
results in a better way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have given talks across the country and people are appalled. 
They ask, “Are you not doing that already?”  I have to say no. 
Such enlightenment has been beyond the government. Therefore I 
have to congratulate the minister, because that enlightenment 
seems to be shining through the window, albeit a small window. 
Progress is being made and I would like to congratulate her on 
that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are approving approximately $50 billion worth of 
non-statutory spending.  Let us remind the general public that 
the government is working its way through $156 billion of its 
money this year.  That is what it intends to do, which by the way 
is up $5 billion from last year, and up from the year before and 
the year before.  It has always increased.  This year it is $156 
billion and I expect that we will see some supplementary 
estimates between now and next year for another $4 billion or $5 
billion, so no doubt it will get to $160 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of that $160 billion, $116 billion I think the minister said, 
does not even come to the House for a vote.  That has to be 
changed too.  We have to have the authority in the House to speak 
about the $116 billion of taxpayers' money that is being spent 
without parliamentary review.  Periodically an audit surfaces, as 
one did last January, and we find that because there is no 
parliamentary review there are such things as billion dollar 
boondoggles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would not happen if the committees had greater input into 
the spending and we were able to look at that $116 billion.  Then 
there is the rest, some $50 billion that is called non-statutory, 
to pay the rent, salaries, phone bills and the grants and 
contributions, that the minister has suggested we authorize 
tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance party has said we do not mind grants and 
contributions by and large but the transitional jobs fund has 
been an absolute disgrace.  It has embarrassed the government and 
has shocked Canadians.  That program should be just plain old 
scrapped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have suggested in our motion that $110 million be removed out 
of the $160 billion.  It is not a lot in the whole scheme of 
things but because it has been such a total shambles, let us cut 
that program now.  There have even been some hints in the 
newspapers that the government will cut it.  Let us do it 
tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the process of the House is skewed so that the minister 
reaffirms that we spend the money before the House is asked to 
cut the money.  We cannot speak out of both sides of our mouth 
and therefore the government wins the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time a nickel was cut out of the estimates was in 1972 
when Prime Minister Trudeau had a minority government. 
The opposition had a bee in its bonnet about the CBC and $1,000 
was knocked off the president's salary.  The last time was in 
1972.  That is how ineffectual the House has become.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approving the estimates has become a perfunctory joke. Because 
of that there is the billion dollar boondoggle at HRDC. That is 
the only one we have uncovered.  Maybe we could go down the whole 
line of cabinet ministers on the front bench and find that each 
department is hiding a billion dollar boondoggle which we have 
not been able to uncover.  That is why we need more parliamentary 
authority to investigate these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian Alliance have tried to be prudent and 
intelligent by saying cut the $110 million.  We will live with 
the rest of the expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take a look at the fifth party, the Tory Party.  It 
is suggesting in its amendments that 90% be knocked out of 
national defence.  It is suggesting that 80% be knocked out of 
fisheries and oceans and that $1 billion be knocked off health 
care.  What kind of responsible party is that? Those members are 
not responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fight this evening is largely with the government because 
taxpayers deserve better.  They deserve to have more openness. 
The minister is now telling us that we are going to get more 
openness.  The government has been in office for six years and it 
is only after $1 billion has gone down the proverbial drain that 
it is now talking about openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only after the government spent $145 million on the 
millennium fund that we are finally getting some accountability. 
The government was doling out money the week before last.  I am 
talking about $25 million.  Who is celebrating the millennium 
today?  The Liberals had their big party on December 31. They had 
a good time. The lights did not go out and everything continued 
on as normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is still celebrating the millennium with Canadian 
taxpayers' money. What did we get?  We got trees worth $1 
million. We got balloons floating out of New Brunswick at a cost 
of $215,000.  We got the celebration of fire in downtown 
Vancouver for $25,000. The idiocy went on and on. The government 
authorizes anything.  If money is going to be spent around the 
millennium, it is called a millennium grant. The idiocy of some 
of these things makes me weep.  We hope that idiocy is behind us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to congratulate the minister because she is trying.  She 
is bringing in some new rules and she is listening to the public 
accounts committee.  She is listening to my private member's 
bill.  She is listening to the Catterall-Williams report in which 
I played a fairly major role. After seven years in this place I 
am starting to see the government is finally listening to some of 
the proposals we are making to make the process better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still want to see the process of approving the estimates 
through the House change.  I will work on that on another day, 
but we have started.  On that note, I thank the minister.

member had to say and I would like him to repeat what the 
official opposition party members think about the management of 
grants and contributions programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that we do not share the same point of view on the 
relevance of these programs, but would we not both agree that, 
in the end, the present federal government is the one that has 
most undermined their relevance?  Whether or not one believes in 
the relevance of the programs, whether or not one believes in 
any particular program, one has to ensure that they are managed 
properly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, when the government manages job creation programs, 
it undermines them terribly, it devalues them and, ultimately, 
it lays itself open to criticism from those who think these 
programs are not relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois think that these kinds of programs are 
relevant, but I know that Canadian Alliance members do not 
necessarily believe in them. 
Regardless of the intrinsic value of these programs, has the 
federal government not done serious harm to their reputation and 
contributed to the present debate within the Liberal Party of 
Canada as to whether or not it should continue to have them, is 
management lax, and is this not what damages the reputation of 
these programs in the eyes of the Canadian public? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said, it is not so 
much that we are totally opposed to grants and contributions in 
principle provided they are an investment in Canada and an 
investment in Canadians, rather than just spreading the largesse 
around the country where it can buy the most political votes.  We 
have heard that.  We heard about it in question period today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get back to my private member's bill which says that it does 
not matter if it is the grants and contributions program or any 
other program the federal government is involved in, we must ask 
four simple but fundamental questions. First we ask what is the 
program designed to do?  Once we know that and the program is 
running, then we ask how well are we achieving what we want to 
do?  Then we can ask if we are doing it efficiently. We should 
always be asking the question of whether we can achieve the same 
or better results in a better and different way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have asked these four fundamental questions and we find 
out that a grants and contributions program is beneficial to 
Canadians, then perhaps we should support it.  That applies to 
any program.  But this pouring money down the proverbial drain 
with no thought whatsoever to the fact that the taxpayers have to 
sweat to make that kind of money and with no thought to the 
benefits that we are getting for that kind of money, that is the 
problem with the management of the grants and contributions 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found that with the HRDC billion dollar boondoggle.  There 
was no grant application on file. We do not even know why they 
wanted the money, but we gave them the cheque.  We did not know 
what they were going to do with the money when they got it, but 
they got the cheque anyway.  And the list went on.  It was 
absolutely deplorable that the government would spend taxpayers' 
money without the proper criteria being in the file to justify 
that it was value for money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I say to the hon. member that we want value for 
money in the spending of taxpayers' money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK384"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, could the member for St. Albert share with us the 
position of the Canada Alliance with respect to bill 11?  Does he 
personally support bill 11 in Alberta which is moving to 
privatize our health care system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that some of the Reform members, including 
his former and perhaps future leader, embrace bill 11.  One of 
the leadership candidates, the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca supports bill 11 and a dual privatized health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he feel about the results of the byelection? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry, I am 
interrupting because the hon. member for St. Albert has one 
minute for his response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will apply the rule of 
relevance and not talk about the byelection.  We are talking 
about the business of supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised the issue of bill 11 and there is a 
motion on the table to deal with health care.  He is right in 
saying bill 11 is not the privatization of health care but to 
provide accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few private institutions are going to be competing for 
business with public health care. The private institutions are 
going to have to cover their capital costs out of the exact same 
fee that the public sector is going to get.  Hopefully, the fees 
will be enough to make a little bit of profit.  They will have 
some profit.  They will have to pay tax on the profit, on exactly 
the same fee that the public sector only has to cover its 
operating costs with.  The public sector is having a hard time 
covering its operating costs, and the private sector on the same 
money will have to cover its capital costs as well.   If that can 
be done, we ask why the public sector cannot do it so 
efficiently.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as you know, we will be voting later 
this evening on almost $160 billion worth of government spending, 
and we will be voting after only three and one half hours of 
debate.  We are given three and a half hours to examine $160 
billion worth of spending.  That is because parliament has lost 
control of government spending.  There is no meaningful 
examination of government spending.  We just vote it through as a 
matter of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has introduced a motion to reduce 
government spending by $110 million.  Out of $160 billion we are 
saying that $110 million should be taken from the grants and 
contributions program of the Department of Human Resources 
Development.  It would be a tiny reduction, but it would be very 
significant.  That $110 million represents the annual expenditure 
by the Department of Human Resources Development on the 
transitional jobs fund and the Canada jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at this TJF/CJF program.  First, 51 of 122 ridings 
across Canada which received TJF grants had been identified by 
the 1996 census as having less than 12% unemployment.  In other 
words, 51 of 122 of those grants did not meet the criteria for 
the program.  That is number one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number two, the riding of the member for Edmonton West, who 
happens to be one of only two Liberal members in Alberta, 
received three grants worth over $2 million from the TJF.  All 
but $70,000 of the moneys were given three months before the last 
election, and the unemployment rate in that member's riding was 
7% at the time, not 12% as the program required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of the leader of the Bloc Quebecois had an 
unemployment rate of 15% in 1996.  That riding received only 
$100,000 over three years.  However, the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration, having the neighbouring riding right beside the 
riding of the leader of the Bloc, and having a lower unemployment 
rate, received over $5 million.  It was $100,000 for the Bloc 
leader's riding, and the Liberal riding next door received $5 
million.  That is how the program is being applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister signed off on 49 grants during the writ period of 
the last election, which is almost twice the program period.  In 
other words, there was an accelerated approval that nearly 
doubled during election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total, $13 million in TJF grants were approved by the 
minister during the election.  Six grants were approved by the 
present minister the day after she was briefed on the disastrous 
audit of this program.  She then approved nearly another $1 
million worth of grants, the very next day, knowing that there 
was a serious lack of controls in the way this program operated. 
By December 3 she had approved a total of 19 grants worth almost 
$3 million.  Yet the minister stated in the House many times that 
she took the audit very seriously and was going to make sure that 
everything was all right with the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the grants that were given.  First of 
all, there was the Auberge des Gouverneurs.  This was a $6.4 million 
hotel project owned by a Belgian businessman and confessed 
embezzler.  He received $600,000 in March 1997, which was first 
announced under the HRDC targeted wage program, but then later 
changed to the transitional jobs fund program because he needed 
the capital immediately.  He did not want to wait until he 
actually created some jobs to get the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he lobbied for and received another $100,000 under TJF. 
This is a confessed embezzler and the subject of 
some real concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the Auberge Grand-Mère.  This is a hotel beside a 
golf course, one-quarter owned until September of last year by 
the Prime Minister himself.  Even after the sale of his golf 
course fell through in January 1996, he helped get a TJF grant 
for the hotel worth $164,000, knowing that improvements to the 
hotel might improve the value of the golf course beside it. 
The grant was announced by the Prime Minister's friend, René 
Fugère, just two days before the election, but it was only 
approved by the minister afterward in July 1997.

<A HREF="#LINKT112"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was Globax and its daughter companies Placeteco and 
TechniPaint.  They got over $2 million from TJF, which was 
announced just a month before the election.  They gave nearly 
$20,000 to the Liberals, including $4,000 to the Prime Minister's 
personal campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the last day of the fiscal year over $1 million was placed in 
a trust, contrary to treasury board guidelines, set up by a law 
firm headed by a two-time political appointee of the Prime 
Minister and administered by that individual for a handsome fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the companies that got some of this money went bankrupt 
and was then repurchased by someone who had been involved in this 
whole business.  The purchaser said that he was not bound by any 
of the conditions of the grant and set up business with half of 
the jobs that had existed previously.  In other words, public 
money went into a company that cut jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is Les Modes Conili, which was given three quarters 
of a million dollars in 1997.  It gave $7,000 to the personal 
election campaign of the Liberal member of parliament for 
Ahuntsic, who had lobbied for the grant.  All of the workers from 
company <I>A</I> were simply moved to company <I>B</I>, and in the 
process they scooped up three quarters of a million dollars of 
taxpayers' money.  The RCMP is now investigating this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is Iris Hosiery Inc., which got the largest single 
transitional jobs fund grant.  It was over $8 million.  It was 
supposed to create 3,000 full time jobs.  This company gave over 
$21,000 to the Liberals, including nearly $6,000 to the Liberal 
candidate in the riding.  This grant helped to put an undisclosed 
number of competitors out of business and killed untold jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have Duchess Foods, which helped the HRDC minister 
entice a company from Hamilton to her riding.  The federal 
government financed 90% of that move.  The unemployment rate in 
Hamilton at that time was 5% and in Brantford it was 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was a call centre that was induced to move into the 
HRDC minister's riding, RMH Teleservices.  It got $1 million.  It 
later said that it was just icing on the cake.  Now we find that 
this same prosperous American company has received another $1 
million in TJF money to operate another call centre in Sault Ste. 
Marie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have Media Express Telemarketing, which gave $10,000 to the 
Liberal Party and got nearly a million dollars of the TJF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have Superior Industrial Rail, which got over a million 
dollars from the TJF and the CJF.  It just closed its doors on 
June 9.  HRDC said that it needs to meet with the company to find 
out where the money went and whether it met the terms of the 
department.  This is a good time to try to figure out where the 
money has gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that it has been over 25 years since the House 
voted to reduce any of the main estimates.  If anything begs to 
be cut it is this boondoggle program of $110 million a year for 
CJF and TJF which has been the subject of untold scandal and 
political pork barrelling.  We are asking the government to 
finally stand on its hind legs, on behalf of Canadians who have 
to foot the bill for this kind of nonsense and wrongdoing, and 
simply say that it will cut a program that is clearly not in the 
best interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members have been complaining that they are voting 
machines and trained seals and have to do whatever the government 
tells them to do.  Here is a chance to vote down $110 million. 
It is a small amount, but it would send a very big signal that 
wasteful programs will not be tolerated by members of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the overview given by our colleague from 
Calgary—Nose Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brought back to the fore, on this last day of this 
parliamentary session, everything that has happened in this 
government over the past months with regard to grants, and 
everything the opposition parties have denounced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very happy that the member for Calgary—Nose Hill 
summarized all these events. This shows these programs are there 
for a purpose. However, I realized that no matter what their 
purpose is, this government has lost control. It made sure these 
programs, which were necessary, designed to help taxpayers, and 
were supposed to meet very specific criteria, had no established 
rules to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no audit and no treasury board standards. They were 
left to the whim of the individuals who made the decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed. I come from a riding where we need programs 
to help communities. It is important to help people who have good 
ideas, but who do not have the money to bring them to fruition 
and create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague for Calgary—Nose Hill if, in 
her great wisdom—I saw how wise she was during all the debates 
we have had in this House—she could tell us how it should go in 
the future, even if this government loses the next election? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which criteria should be put in place to ensure it will not 
happen again and these programs truly help communities in need? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question and I think it is true that Canadians are quite willing 
to help each other, particularly in areas of need, when that help 
actually delivers what it is supposed to deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board had some nice talk about the 
need for rigorous control and verification and the need to fund 
only programs with quantifiable results.  I think that is what my 
friend would like to see.  However, that definitely does not 
apply to the transitional jobs fund.  In fact there is plenty of 
evidence that this fund has been politically used and that it has 
not created jobs—real, long term, sustainable jobs—which, as my 
colleague pointed out, is what Canadians really need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I say that the government can show, and we can all show 
that we are serious about cutting waste and mismanagement.  We 
can show that we are serious about getting value for our dollar, 
that when we invest money in job creation it actually produces 
some results for the people who are supposed to be assisted. 
Unless we can assure Canadians that there is value for our dollar 
and that we have a process in place that says they spent this 
money, they have got their money's worth, be happy, then we 
should cut programs that are shown to be totally contrary to that 
principle.  That includes the $110 million for the TJF and the 
CJF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleagues in the Bloc will support our motion to cut 
that pork barrel program out completely so that money can go to 
programs that really help Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak this evening on the 
estimates, particularly in connection with grants and 
contributions.  I regret to say that I am opposed to this vote 
for the grants and contributions program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that they are not good programs in themselves. I 
believe it is important and essential for there to be programs to 
help people in areas where there is a high rate of unemployment, 
to give them the opportunity to get back on their feet and 
improve their economic situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, in the case at hand, the problem is not that the 
budget is too high, but it lies instead in the way the government 
is administering that budget.  Let us keep in mind the constant 
scandal the government has been involved in for the past six 
months.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we came to realize that from the administrative 
point of view they had lost control of $1 billion.  We came to 
realize that the treasury board directives that had been in place 
previously were not being followed by Human Resources Development 
Canada.  What is more, they were full of holes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the President of the Treasury Board has already 
admitted this.  In early June, she had to do her homework over 
again, and put other programs in place.  But she has not 
corrected what went on before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot vote in favour of these budget allocations, as long as 
we have no guarantee that there will not be the same funny 
business as there was in the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the situation before us at the moment, the Minister for 
International Trade, the former Minister of Human Resources 
Development, is responsible for the loss of government control 
over the program of grants and contributions and for the use for 
partisan purposes of the funds allocated to the transitional jobs 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister, who is continuing along as Minister for 
International Trade, is not accountable for his action as 
Minister of Human Resources Development.  However, in my opinion, 
he is primarily responsible for the crisis that has befallen 
Human Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is getting away with it at the moment, because he does 
not want to get to the bottom of things.  They refused do conduct 
an independent public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So long as the government does not correct this situation, we 
cannot give it additional votes for job creation programs. 
Although the programs may be relevant and essential, we must be 
sure that they operate within an acceptable context.  But we have 
seen no sign of this, either in the government's attitude to the 
behaviour of the former Minister of Human Resources Development, 
now Minister for International Trade, or in the behaviour of the 
current Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, instead of assuming her responsibilities in the 
fall of 1999, a month or two after her appointment, and saying 
“I have just discovered a situation that must be rectified.  I 
will take a stand quickly and we will get to the bottom of 
things”, she simply helped the federal government's operation 
camouflage along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No appropriate corrective action has been taken. 
One may well wonder why it has come to this.  The situation is 
indeed tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than one dozen RCMP investigations on grant handouts and 
the fraudulent use of the funds paid out have been opened to 
public scrutiny.  This was one serious situation that was 
uncovered, but many others still under investigation, and there 
are still unanswered questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of questions have been raised in the House, repeatedly, 
in order to find out how $1.2 million in funding could have been 
paid out to Placeteco and used solely to pay off a debt.  It 
created not a single job.  In the past two months, the government 
has never managed to produce a single invoice to prove what it 
has claimed, although it was apparently so very simple to spend 
the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again today, the minister is telling us “Well now, those 
invoices, you can get them through access to information”. If I 
were accused of the same sort of thing that the government is 
today, and if I had proof in my possession, I would make it 
public and put out the fire right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot do the same, because there are no invoices. How then 
could they produce them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Placeteco is not unique.  There is Modes Conili Star as well, 
another case the Bloc Quebecois exposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acted more or less as if we were the investigators, and we 
were able to demonstrate that an investigation was required. Now 
the RCMP is looking into it, as a result of the questions raised 
by the Bloc Quebecois, because indeed most of the jobs that ought 
to have been created were merely transferred from one company to 
another. 
It is as though grants had been awarded to move jobs instead of 
to create jobs.  The investigation was initiated because of 
questions asked by the Bloc Quebecois. There we have another case 
of pieces missing and things not working right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were only these cases appearing one after the other, we 
could say that they were exceptions.  But we discovered that, 
during the period leading up to the last election, in 1997, 
suddenly, 54% of all amounts earmarked for the Transitional jobs 
fund over a three year period was spent.  During the election 
period, they spent the funds, especially in the ridings they 
wanted to win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In ridings represented by Bloc Quebecois members, 63% of the 
funds were spent during that period. If this is not buying an 
election, I do not know what is and how we could prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a public inquiry into this whole issue, so that 
we can get to the bottom of things and see, for example, the 
links between grants obtained and contributions to the Liberal 
Party of Canada.

refused to answer fully. The Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development conducted an extensive study on the 
administrative aspects. The Liberals were ready to look into 
that thoroughly. They were even ready to pass the buck to civil 
servants. But as far as the government's responsibility is 
concerned, they systematically tried to avoid debate and 
rejected witnesses that the Bloc Quebecois wanted to hear, so 
that they would not have to answer questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the administrative problems that were found, some were 
serious. 
I have here a list of about 15 companies. I will not name all of 
them, but I will name some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland, Forest Renewal Sylviculture saw a project 
approved in November 1998. Yet, as early as 1996-97, $2,164,500 
in funding had already been paid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take this other company, Powel Nestle Farms. In November 1998 
also, funding was approved, while $30,000 had been paid out in 
1997-98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing with one company after another, where final 
approval was given a long time after the money was paid actually 
paid out. How can this be explained? Often, a decision is made 
based on whether or not they liked someone, during the election 
campaign. One Liberal candidate would meet company officials and 
say “Yes, I will handle this matter”. The civil servants were 
left to look after the situation after the election. 
They had to spend money without the authorizations having been 
signed, which is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this is not a situation with some specific cases only. Funds 
were, in my opinion, systematically used for partisan purposes. 
This is why it is unacceptable to continue to vote supply for 
grant and contribution programs, without knowing how the money 
will be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another election is coming up. If the same situation occurs 
again, it will be totally unacceptable. We cannot in any way let 
such a situation continue if we are to ensure a proper quality 
of democratic life, a quality that Quebecers and Canadians 
expect. This situation must be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see many problems in the ridings that the Liberals were 
desperate to win. One such riding is that of the Prime Minister. 
The Prime Minister's riding is among those under suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I mentioned Placeteco, which received $1.2 million. 
That transaction is being condemned for many reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the payments were made in violation of treasury board 
rules. The establishment of a trust is against treasury board 
rules. The trustee himself is in a conflict of interest 
situation and no jobs were created. Moreover, there is no 
evidence to establish whether the payment was fair and to 
determine the overpayment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When such a situation exists, it is very clear that light must 
be shed on the whole matter. Otherwise, it undermines the 
credibility of the elected member, in this case the Prime 
Minister, and of the whole system, since funds were used for 
partisan purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And that is not all, a grant that had been awarded to a business 
in the riding of Rosemont ended up in the riding of 
Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister's riding, without any jobs 
being created. That business committed fraud at the expense of 
another business that was expanding, and this case is now the 
focus of an ongoing RCMP investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we have here several deplorable situations that must be 
rectified, but the federal government is ignoring the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report issued by the human resources development committee 
in June was a true reflection of the government's actions since 
January: trying to hide the truth; systematically refusing, 
through the minister, to answer questions; minimizing the 
seriousness of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the Prime Minister first talked about a 
$101 problem. A few weeks later, it was $5,000. There are now 12 
RCMP investigations, and amounts to be recovered are in the 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. In the case of Placeteco alone, 
we are talking about $1.2 million. I think we are faced with a 
situation that warrants a thorough review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This exercise should not have been performed only by the 
committee. We needed to go beyond that, to go to an independent 
public inquiry, as called for by all the opposition parties. This 
would have helped give job creation programs the credibility they 
are currently lacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human resources development committee report says nothing 
about the cases of fraud, late approvals, violations of treasury 
board directives, political pressure, patronage, the partisan use 
of public funds, attempts to hide information, the withholding of 
information, the falsification of documents, the absence of 
supporting documentation, and influence peddling.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are confronted to a serious situation, a tragic situation. 
Since we are dealing with the business of supply, we cannot 
simply authorize expenditures. We have to ensure that things are 
done properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the treasury board commented on this earlier, 
in her speech. In terms of the principle itself, what she said 
was interesting, except that she in no way remedied the past 
situation and did not put forward any concrete solution to 
ensure that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many mistakes were made. There have even been convictions. 
Pierre Corbeil, for instance, was eventually convicted. Then, 
there was another conviction in the case of Mr. Fugère, an 
unregistered lobbyist, concerning an amount of $1,277,463. The 
company from Rosemont we were talking about earlier received 
$165,984. There was the CITEC case which was brought to light, 
and the Force Group, again in the Saint-Maurice riding. There was 
also Modes Conili Star, and the whole issue of jobs that were 
transferred instead of created. A Liberal from Cape Breton is 
also said to have received a $1.3 million contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there are plenty of examples everywhere, several in the 
ridings where the Liberal Party wanted to win in the last 
federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all these facts, I think it is important, before votes are 
adopted, that we be well-aware of the impact of our decision. 
Before supply is concurred in, the government will have to 
assure us that the money will be properly spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government talks of new directives from treasury board, 
why does it not provide for regular monitoring, month by month, 
of the situation by elected officials, those who speak for the 
people in this situation?  I think the government refused to do 
so in the past and is still refusing to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the most negative thing—and I stress this—is that the way 
the Canada jobs fund was used by the government allows people in 
favour of the abolition of this type of program to argue, by 
saying “You see, it serves no purpose to put this money in this 
sort of program, because each time they do, it is wasted in the 
end”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that in my riding, in my region, the Canada jobs 
fund was quite properly used.  The projects people submitted 
were correctly analyzed, and appropriate action was taken in the 
end, because the fund was not established in an election period 
and so was not subject to the pressures of an election period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, in the next election—and we are a few months away from 
then—the same scenario is not to occur, the Canada jobs fund must 
not become a tool to win elections for the Liberal Party of 
Canada, but continue to be a tool to create jobs in areas of 
high unemployment.  There must be guarantees of transparency in 
the use of this fund, which we do not see on the table at the 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great pity that the government has refused to shed more 
light on this, that it feels free to come and ask us to adopt 
these votes, when we do not have any guarantee that they will be 
used properly.  The best example of this perpetual state of 
affairs is that there are plans to dismantle the Department of 
Human Resources Development.  I personally am in favour of such 
a move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said at the beginning of the crisis, a few months ago, that 
the Department of Human Resources Development was a bureaucratic 
monster with a cancer that could only be cured if we got to the 
bottom of things.  Dismantling the department is an interesting 
solution.  I made this suggestion myself to the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of 
Persons with Disabilities when it came time to write the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is another bridge that must be crossed, and that 
is an independent public inquiry.  And that, the government has 
refused. 
Today, we are looking at a situation where, even if the 
department were dismantled, even if responsibility for these 
grants and contributions programs were to be given to another 
department, the management of grants and contributions would not 
have been resolved.  The last step has to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem has not been resolved, if we are to go by the 
attitude of the President of the Treasury Board, who has issued 
a new directive on the management of grants and contributions. 
But what is there to say that these public funds will not be 
used for election purposes?  There is absolutely no guarantee 
that they will not.  There is no commitment from the government 
to respond because it is not going to look into what went on 
during the last election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a public inquiry were able to analyze how they managed to 
make use of the funding program systematically in ridings where 
they wanted to win the general election, if we were able to get 
to the bottom of the phenomenon of using these funds for 
partisan purposes, then we could develop some barriers, set some 
limits so that this did not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, however, refuses to go that far.  It thinks that 
it may still have a tool for winning over some ridings in the 
next general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, my answer will be the same as last time.  The voters of 
Quebec and of Canada are not going to be taken in. 
They will not allow themselves to be bought off by the federal 
government, by the Liberal Party of Canada.  They insist that 
light be cast on what happens to their tax money, to what they 
pay into the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing to which our fellow citizens are entitled, 
it is that the money they provide to the federal government for 
the administration of all these programs is put to proper use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why—and on this point I will conclude—it seems to me that 
the Liberal government does not deserve our confidence as far as 
administering public funds is concerned, and does not deserve to 
be given a blank cheque for the authorization of funds. 
Authorization will be given when we have the assurance that they 
will be managed in such a way as to ensure maximum benefit and 
transparency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before asking a question to the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, I want to 
congratulate him for his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell him that it is extremely important to have a 
person like him as the Bloc Quebecois critic on Human Resources 
Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening, my colleague stressed a very serious point when he 
said that there was no transparency in that department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a serious thing for my colleague to tell all the Canadians who are 
listening to us that this government, with money that belongs to 
them, was not transparent in the management of these programs. 
But it should have been very transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These programs were created to help the communities that need 
them. My region benefited from the Canada jobs fund. I can say 
that, in my area, the public servants who administer this program 
ran a tight ship. It was said that this is money that belongs to 
everyone and that it ought to go to those who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is happening right now? People are suspicious. They ask 
themselves if the things they hear are true. The government did 
not act properly in the past and people wonder if it will do so 
again in the future. If things were not right in the past, people 
wonder if they are going to be penalized with the guidelines. 
Will the government go too far in the other direction by 
implementing excessive controls? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable. My colleague accurately described the 
situation and I want to ask him what this government should do so 
that Canadian taxpayers can finally regain confidence in the 
government's management and transparency, which should be a given 
on the part of a government that claims to be there to help, to 
be full of compassion and to be receptive to the needs of the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Jonquière 
for her kind words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this fight has been the fight of the whole Bloc 
Quebecois team. I want to acknowledge the efforts ,particularly 
of the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, the member for 
Laurier—Sainte-Marie, our House leader, the member for Roberval, 
the member for Quebec, the member for Rosemont, who exposed the 
matter of the company being moved to the riding of Saint-Maurice, 
members of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, and more 
specifically of the opposition parties, who presented a unanimous 
report asking for an independent public inquiry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite an accomplishment when parties such as the New 
Democratic Party, the Canadian Alliance Party, the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Progressive Conservative Party, members who 
represent all sorts of trends in society, are asking for the same 
thing. They felt it was fitting to have one position on the issue 
of an independent public inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know people in Quebec and Canada can rest assured there are 
still members who are concerned and represent their interests 
here in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now for the solutions. I believe the government, or the Prime 
Minister, should appoint as quickly as possible a new minister at 
HDRC, someone who has not lost all credibility in the recent 
chain of events. The new minister should be given a mandate for a 
specific period of time to preside over the dismantling of the 
department and launch an independent public inquiry to get to the 
bottom of the whole situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new minister should have a limited mandate, for six months, 
and say “Yes, I am going to dismantle the department. Yes, we 
are going to shed light on past events. I know that at the end of 
this period, my mandate will be over. I might be given other 
responsibilities, but I will have done what I had to do.” It 
will not be as tempting to look out for friends of the party and 
to avoid getting to the bottom of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we need these kinds of solutions. I think people expect 
us to do these things in a parliament such as ours, to show them 
that, unlike this government, we are not puppets of the Liberal 
Party of Canada or those who fund that party, but that we are 
simply here to work for the people of Quebec and Canada, for 
those who elected us and who will re-elect us—and by us I mean 
members of the Bloc Quebecois—in the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have waged this battle in a very open manner, using all the 
parliamentary tools available to us. We will continue to do so 
until we get all the relevant information in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will give a concrete example. 
As long as the government is unable to produce a single invoice 
after having been asked to do so over a period of several 
months, as in the case of Placeteco, we will continue to 
maintain that this is proof of a serious lack of transparency in 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are expecting a drastic change in 
direction, which does not seem to be happening right now. I 
think the Liberal government will have to answer for that in the 
next election, in a few months.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in 1993 the people of this country threw out the 
Conservatives and re-elected the Liberal Party because they 
disagreed with the Tories always trying to cut spending that 
helped people.  They disagreed with the Tories for spending like 
drunken sailors when it came to their friends and large 
corporations.  They disagreed with the Tories because of their 
patronage-like approach and their big boosting of the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals on the other hand promised to kill the free trade 
deal.  They promised to eliminate the GST.  They promised to 
repeal Bill C-91, which would bring back protection for low cost 
generic prescription drugs and reduce some of the costs to health 
care.  They promised to protect and enhance medicare.  This is in 
their red book of 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we see in this debate the budget almost seven years after 
the Liberals came into office.  Did they end the free trade 
agreement?  No.  Did they eliminate the GST?  No.  Did they kill 
Bill C-91?  No.  Did they enhance and protect medicare?  No.  I 
will get to that later. Did they do anything for education?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They carried out the policies of Brian Mulroney and extended 
free trade, made billions from the GST, and extended the patent 
drug protection to the international multinational drugs 
companies for two more years.  Just last week former Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney gave an hour and a half speech 
congratulating the Liberal government for fulfilling all the 
Conservative planks.  Not one Liberal plank from 1993 was carried 
out.  Personally I would not want to be bragging about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals went on a porkfest in the last six years, with 
millions to their friends in Cape Breton although it ended up 
with Mr. Dingwall losing his seat to the NDP.  Instead of 
spending millions on coal miners in Cape Breton they gave it to 
their rich friends and their Liberal connections, and the coal 
miners got crumbs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals provided millions in tax cuts to the big banks 
while western farmers were going bankrupt by the thousands and 
were ignored.  We see now, as we speak, on the agenda of the 
Liberal government yet another bill before the House that will 
give another $500 million in tax cuts to the banks that are 
achieving record profits, quarter after quarter after quarter, 
year after year after year, on their balance sheets.  They have 
also given millions to every living, breathing Liberal they can 
find out west.  There is not many of them, I might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health system is in critical condition.  Literally hundreds 
of questions have been posed of the government requesting it to 
take some action on medicare.  We have been asking it to take 
some action to review the situation for the last three years now 
and to reconsider its drastic cuts.  In Saskatchewan alone it cut 
$1.2 billion to the health care system.  Saskatchewan has a 
million people.  That is $12,000 for every man, woman and child 
that was not committed to health care as was previously promised 
in the budget of 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are now sort of talking about doing something about 
health care.  The federal NDP has been fighting under the 
leadership of the member for Halifax to get medicare fixed and to 
have the Liberals pay some attention.  Rather than spend $500 
million a year in tax cuts to banks, perhaps they could give it 
to the health care system where it is very much needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Romanow in Saskatchewan spent the last two years trying 
to convince the government to do a review.  We have waited and 
waited while he continued to hound the government.  Then today he 
said that enough was enough.  He believes as we do in the NDP 
that a family's health should not have to depend upon a family's 
wealth.  The Liberals and the reform alliance believe that a 
family's health should have to depend upon a family's wealth. 
That is a fundamental difference between the NDP and the right 
wing parties of the Liberal and alliance coalitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Premier of Saskatchewan today is taking the lead in defining 
a new vision of medicare to meet the challenges of the 21st 
Century.  Premier Romanow announced a commission on medicare 
which will be headed by health consultants and a former deputy 
minister of health in two provinces, Ken Fyke.  It will identify 
challenges facing medicare, outline potential solutions, and 
engage public and health care providers in a discussion of new 
ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan pioneered publicly funded, publicly administered 
health care in Canada.  Today Saskatchewan once again leads the 
way in finding solutions to strengthen medicare and protect its 
core values into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that in 1961 under Woodrow Lloyd the NDP brought 
medicare to the country.  We started in Saskatchewan.  We funded 
it 100% in Saskatchewan for six years before the NDP forced the 
Liberal government of the day to adopt and embrace the health 
care system and the medicare system for all Canadians.  At that 
time the funding for health care was 50:50.  The provinces paid 
50% and the federal government paid 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last six years Saskatchewan has lost $1.2 billion in 
underfunding by the federal government.  It went to the banks, 
the bond dealers and all the rich friends the Liberals want to 
send the money to.  The NDP, whose vision established medicare in 
Canada and who made it work for six years before the country was 
able to adopt it, is now leading the way in terms of this 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medicare faces many challenges today including new medical 
treatments, rising costs, an aging population and shortages of 
key health professionals.  Identifying those key challenges will 
be the commission's first task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it will recommend an action plan for the sustainable 
delivery of health services across that province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it will identify long term opportunities for reform that 
will ensure a strong future for a publicly funded and 
administered medicare system.  The commission will deliver its 
first report, a preliminary report, in six months and a final 
report in the year 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today in the House, the Liberal member for 
Waterloo—Wellington, who is the chair of the health committee, 
had the gall to talk about what a great job the Liberals were 
doing on health care.  He took personal credit for “redoubling 
our efforts in helping to rebuild health care”.  He said “I 
want to make it happen.  I want to make it work”.  Let us review 
their redoubling efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the member to define those words in a question and 
comment period.  I asked him to define for the House and 
Canadians what redoubling their efforts in butchering health care 
meant.  The Liberals have cut $1.2 billion in health transfers to 
Saskatchewan alone.  They have cut $9 billion or $12 billion, who 
knows what numbers are now, in health transfers to the rest of 
the country.  However, the member says they are going to redouble 
their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Saskatchewan are worried because instead of losing $200 
million a year in health transfers, we are faced with losing $400 
million a year because of this Liberal member who chairs the 
Standing Committee on Health for the Liberal Prime Minister and 
the Liberal Minister of Health.  They are going to redouble their 
efforts and finish off the system.  What do these Liberal members 
do?  They embrace bill 11 in Alberta which is meant to privatize 
our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Waterloo—Wellington should perhaps be sitting in 
the back row of the House with his back against the wall. Even 
his Liberal committee members do not like what he is doing.  He 
dictates in terms of what happens in committee.  For three years 
he has been asked to undertake a review of medicare.  What has he 
been doing?  He does not even call a meeting of the health 
committee.  Medicare is in crisis.  The Liberals are passing the 
buck every time they get asked a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the reform party do?  The reform party has not asked a 
question on health care in the House for the last three years 
until just recently.  The leader of the opposition has never 
asked a question on health in the this House.  His number one 
priority is making sure that the banks get more money, the oil 
companies get more tax breaks and all the wealthy families in 
Canada continue to be allowed to take their billion dollar trust 
funds south of the border.  We see a coalition here.  It is the 
Conservative-reform-Liberal-Alliance coalition.  They are all 
looking for the same sort of objectives to defend and enhance the 
position of their very wealthy friends while ignoring the 
concerns and priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may notice that we never heard the words health care 
come out of the mouths of Liberal members between 1993 and 1997. 
They never talked about it but boy did they cut it.  Since the 
NDP asked about health care back in 1997, we are starting to hear 
them talk about it again.  The NDP has been the only party that 
has been raising this issue in the House with an action plan to 
fix health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members do not care if the health care system is strained 
at the seams.  The Liberals do not care if the system is hurting 
people.  They do not care if nurses are being run ragged and 
understaffed.  They do not care if hospital employees cannot 
cope.  They just want the political credit and they would like to 
assume to get that credit if they sink in some dough this fall 
with the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to sum up the Liberal's record in the last six years.  It 
can be summed up basically in four words:  All pork, no vision. 
Pork barrelling is all the Liberals want to do.  They send money 
to all their friends through HRDC.  They give money to their 
friends through the Western Economic Diversification fund. They 
give money to all their rich friends, but do not look after the 
needs of people in Canada.  The Liberals will be called to task 
come the next election for their approach to Canadians in the 
last six years, which is all pork, all patronage and no vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are so busy looking over their shoulders to see who 
might be ready to pat them on the back—or stab them in the back 
as the member for Waterloo—Wellington is probably worried 
about—that they have forgotten to look forward.  They have no 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about grain transportation.  The Liberals spent 
hundreds of millions of dollars fixing up rail lines in western 
Canada and then they privatized the CNR.  CNR then closed those 
rail lines, ripped them up, and now the Liberals expect farmers 
to not only pay more in freight rates, but they want farmers to 
pay more to truck their grain to elevators further away on roads 
that were never designed for the transportation of these heavy 
products. 
They also want farmers to raise more cash to buy back the short 
line rail lines and fix them up again.  They are just waiting for 
the provincial governments to upgrade the roads.  This is the 
Liberal's vision for grain transportation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view it is an incredible situation.  The banks are getting 
$500 million a year more in tax cuts from the Liberal government 
and the farmers in western Canada are getting destroyed roads 
because of the Liberal plans and no rail lines to take their 
products to market.  By the way, the railways made a killing in 
profits because the government subsidized their capital costs and 
reduced their operating costs but they were allowed to hike rates 
to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To whom did the railways gave big political donations?  They 
gave donations to the Liberal Party and, to shut the Alliance up, 
they gave donations to the Alliance Party as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan we have fewer rail lines, thousands of very 
angry and almost bankrupt farmers, very wealthy railway companies 
and probably the worst roads in Canada now because of the 
downloading of transportation costs to the very farmers who do 
not have any money because the government has abandoned them with 
respect to grain subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France in 1995 
with parliamentarians from all over Europe.  They meet on a 
regular basis.  I went to the agriculture committee.  I said to 
them at that time that we were told by the Liberal government, by 
the minister of agriculture at that time from Saskatchewan, that 
Canada had to eliminate its transportation subsidies right away 
because of the World Trade Organization legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked those European parliamentarians what they were going to 
do, because their subsidies at that time were three times the 
rate of Canada's subsidies to farmers.  Those parliamentarians in 
the agriculture committee said to me “Under the WTO we have five 
years to address the subsidy issue for farmers, but if you think 
after five years we are going to sacrifice our farmers for the 
sake of the U.S.A., you are greatly mistaken.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are five years later and the chickens have come home to 
roost.  This is a very sad situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, Canada's highway system is deteriorating 
rapidly.  The government collects nearly $5 billion a year in 
gasoline and diesel fuel taxes.  Does anyone know what percentage 
of that money it puts back into roads?  It is about 4.5%.  Does 
anyone know what they spend in Saskatchewan?  They say that they 
spend about $3 million over a five year period, but if one were 
to stop on a dime on a Saskatchewan highway, one could bet that 
dime would not be a federal dime building any highways.  As a 
matter of fact, the other 95.5% of the $5 billion is spent 
elsewhere, not on transportation and not on highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite embarrassing.  We are the only country in the 28 
the OECD countries that does not have a national highways 
program.  I see that the government House leader is acknowledging 
that his government is the only government that does not have a 
national highways program and it does not expect to have one.  I 
wonder if the minister might go to cabinet and put in a lobbying 
effort on behalf of Canadians to rebuild our infrastructure on 
our highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rail lines used to be the ribbon connecting our country.  It 
is now the highway system and we do not have a highway system 
that we can be proud of.  I am not sure if Canadians have driven 
through northern Ontario or British Columbia lately.  Those roads 
need money.  They need twinning.  They need lots of cash to make 
them safe for people to travel on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is so morally bankrupt that it cannot spend 
public money getting the RCMP involved either in terms of looking 
at what is happening with this patronage or with this port.  No 
wonder the government is starving the Mounties of cash, but it is 
so devoid of vision that it puts legislation through the House of 
Commons at the speed of light so its backbenchers do not have 
time to think about it before the debate is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People think, “Thank goodness we have an official opposition in 
the Alliance”.  Our parliamentary system allows the official 
opposition to take over government at any time if there is any 
kind of an election that might support that.  They think that but 
when they would look over there what would they see?  There is an 
old saying in Saskatchewan that describes the alliance 
conservative reform party, “Big hat, no ranch”. 
Do members know what that means?  It means those members think 
they know what they are doing and what they are going to do, but 
they do not have any idea of what they are really going to do. 
However, they wear a big hat pretending they know what is going 
on but they have no assets, no knowledge and no resources to 
support holding up that hat.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform alliance conservative party is the big hat with no 
ranch vision.  The Liberals are the all pork, no vision party.  I 
think Canadians are really worried about what is happening in the 
country but they are not as worried as they might be because they 
have the federal NDP to hold those two parties accountable for 
their lack of vision and to provide them with a significant 
amount of vision on every major policy in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of things I would like to say, but in summary, 
we have a very serious situation but we also have an opportunity 
to correct the lack of vision or the poor vision of the Liberal 
government.  If the government would consider doing what Roy 
Romanow and the NDP are doing in Saskatchewan, which is studying 
health care and committing resources to make sure that we have a 
universally accessible health care program, it would address the 
very serious concerns of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government introduced a national highways program and 
spent some of the $5 billion that it collects in fuel taxes on 
the road system, that would help to build our country and make it 
stronger from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government established a national agriculture program to 
defend our farmers, in view of the subsidies farmers in other 
countries receive, and not to match them but to provide even 
one-fifth of the subsidies other farmers from other countries 
receive, our farmers could be competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more money for education.  Does the bill before us 
tonight address Bill S-9 that was before the House?  No.  Do 
members know what Bill S-9 was all about?  The reform alliance 
conservatives and the Liberal Party in the last parliament passed 
Bill S-9.  It provided Canadians with tax deductions on Canadian 
incomes for making contributions to U.S. universities and 
post-secondary institutions.  Meanwhile, post-secondary funding 
in this country is being cut back.  This is their vision.  They 
want to support and prop up the American institutions and they 
are sacrificing Canadian institutions.  University and 
post-secondary institution students have, on average, $25,000 per 
year of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not do what Ireland does and many 
Scandinavian countries do?  Why do we not have free tuition for 
our post-secondary students?  The government could phase this in 
over five years.  A 20% reduction every year for all students for 
the next five years would bring them down to zero.  High quality, 
easily accessible and universally accessible post-secondary 
education and equipping youth with the skills they need is what 
built Ireland's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go on because I have many other issues.  This is 
just the tip of the iceberg in terms of some of the visions that 
the Liberals and the reformers do not have, and the vision that 
the NDP has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all members for paying attention.  I thank all ministers 
who are here tonight for doing the job that they have to do in 
the future, which is taking instructions from the NDP and 
building a stronger country from coast to coast to coast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK390"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member 
opposite go on and on and I was surprised by some of his 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, he made a comment that the government just blithely 
accepted bill 11 in Alberta.  I am not here to defend the 
Minister of Health, but the member opposite knows that our 
government has intervened in the strongest way with respect to 
bill 11 and we will be responding over the next few months and 
years to ensure that what Alberta is doing meets the principles 
of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about the federal contribution to health 
care.  He said that the federal government used to contribute 50% 
to health care costs in Canada.  He must know that while we did 
contribute 50% to certain prescribed health care costs, in no way 
was it 50% of the total health care expenditures in Canada.  In 
fact, it related to hospital expenditures and certain medical 
services covered under medical services plans but it was well 
below 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also conveniently neglected to talk about the tax point room 
in 1977 of 13 points of personal income taxes, which the 
provinces asked for, and about 1 point of corporate income taxes 
so that the provinces could move in. 
The provinces moved into that tax room immediately.  It was 
totally transparent to the Canadian taxpayer.  The federal 
government stopped taxing by these percentage points and the 
provinces moved in immediately to take that tax room.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time in 1977 the agreement with the provinces and the 
territories was that was in contemplation of the provinces and 
territories spending that money on health care, post-secondary 
education and social programs.  There was no ambiguity about it. 
The tax points were there for health care, social programs and 
post-secondary education.  There was not a lot of questioning and 
debate at the time.  It was very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who leave out the tax points that the federal government 
vacated conveniently forget the huge contribution the federal 
government is making still to health care and social programs 
within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member opposite if he would like to 
check his notes again.  I am sure he would find that what I have 
said is true and that the 50% was only certain prescribed 
services and not the total health care expenditures within 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Canada Health Act 
prescribes a minimum amount of health care services to every 
province.  It used to be that the federal government would fund 
50% of that.  The provinces always had the option of doing more 
over and above that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Saskatchewan under Allan Blakeney and the NDP, in 
the mid-1970s started a dental program for children up to 18 
years of age through high school. That was free to every 18 year 
old and under in Saskatchewan.  It was administered through the 
school system.  It was a very good system.  It drew raves from 
around the world.  People were coming from around the world to 
study our system until the Liberal-Tory coalition of Grant Devine 
bankrupted our province and shut down the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there is some relevance to the comment with respect to the 
basic minimum requirements.  However, the minimum requirements 
now are no longer 50%.  They are far less than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody I have talked to in Canada, except the Liberal MPs who 
are given their briefing notes by the Minister of Health, 
believes that we are spending enough on health care.  Not a 
single Canadian believes that health care is funded adequately. 
Not a single Canadian whom I have talked to believes that the 
Liberal government is doing a good job in terms of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Liberal premier of Newfoundland, who is a former 
Liberal member of parliament and a former minister of the Prime 
Minister's cabinet, has gone on record as saying that medicare is 
in crisis, that there is not enough money and not enough federal 
attention being paid to it.  We need a fix on medicare from the 
federal government.  Where is it and when is it going to come? 
We need it now. Brian Tobin said this, a former Liberal MP and 
cabinet minister and the current Liberal premier of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised a good point, but again this is the 
typical vision of the Liberals.  They want to pass the buck. They 
do not believe they should take responsibility for their actions. 
When the manure hits the fan, they want to duck and blame 
somebody else, even though its their fan and their manure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as something good happens, like the NDP in Saskatchewan 
starting medicare and the dental plan for children, then the 
Liberals want to take credit for it when they fought tooth and 
nail year after year, to kill the medicare plan in Saskatchewan. 
The Liberals did.  The Liberals right here fought tooth and nail. 
There were demonstrations in front of the legislative building. 
Ten thousand people were shouting, “Don't give us medicare 
because it is going to be too expensive.  The doctors are going 
to go.  Don't give us medicare because the big multinational 
corporations will not make as much money”. Whoops, we do not 
want to say that.  That is what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought in medicare in spite of the Liberals leading the 
charge across western Canada, spending thousands of dollars to 
defeat Woodrow Lloyd's government in 1964 because he had brought 
in medicare.  What happened in 1964?  Mr. Thatcher, the Liberal, 
became premier.  He got elected as a result of Liberals across 
the country trying to fight medicare.  What did he do? He 
embraced medicare.  Mea culpa.  It was, “Oh, we were wrong a 
couple of years ago and medicare may work”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  We do not want to get the GST in there 
because it was not as great as the medicare plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the member's question and I look forward to more 
interesting questions like that one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK391"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed the member's debate. He spoke about history 
but he forgot that it was at a Liberal convention in 1919 that 
the concept of medicare was born in Canada.  He forgot that piece 
of history.  I acknowledge that it was introduced by Tommy 
Douglas in Saskatchewan.  The member did not even mention the 
name of the Liberal prime minister, the Right Hon. Lester B. 
Pearson, who introduced medicare for the whole nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about the lack of vision or poor vision on the part of 
the government.  He forgot the recent history of the national 
forum on health chaired by the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Health at that time.  He also forgot the history that in 1990-91 
the Liberal Party introduced a resolution in the House to 
preserve medicare.  I remember vividly that the NDP critic at 
that time said that my motion was facetious.  He sided with the 
Tories in trying to condemn the Liberal Party for medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of history, let us remember history correctly. Does the 
member not remember that in March the ministers of health met to 
renew medicare, that they will be meeting again tomorrow and that 
in September there will be a first ministers meeting on medicare? 
Let us remember recent history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the Liberal 
version of history.  The Liberals may very well have had some 
kind of resolution in 1919 talking about everything under the 
sun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The medicare system was introduced in Saskatchewan in 1961. 
Federally, Tommy Douglas and the NDP forced the Liberals to 
introduce it in 1968.  That is about 40 years.  Are all the 
promises the Liberals made to the country in 1993 to do away with 
NAFTA, to abolish the GST, to put more money into health care, to 
do better for education and to repeal Bill C-91, going to take 40 
years?  Because if it is going to take 40 years, you ain't going 
to be around.  That is the simple history of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals can claim to be everything to everybody, but in the 
end they should hang their heads in shame for what they have done 
to medicare and to the many hundreds of thousands of Canadians 
who rely on medicare for their very existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I remind members to 
address each other through the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK392"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to say a few words on this motion, a motion which is 
from a motionless party, a party whose stock is not doing too 
well right now and its tom is long gone.  After a daylong battle 
on the 24th, it will have to preston with the same group they 
have right now.  As we have always said, I guess if it walks like 
a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.  It will be the same 
party it was previous to the reforming of Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is not what we are hear for tonight.  We are here to 
talk about the record of the present government.  Today is an 
extremely interesting and exciting day in Newfoundland.  In this 
honourable House yesterday, I had the privilege of asking the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans a question about the shrimp 
stocks off the coast of Labrador and whether or not he intended 
to bring in some new players to catch a stock that is rapidly 
declining.  Through the various departments of the government, 
including fisheries and oceans and with heavy involvement, just 
to be relevant, with HRDC, we saw the decimation of the 
groundfish stocks in 1992. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT125"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought we would have learned from that.  Some of the funding 
that has been channelled out over the last seven or eight years 
we would think would have gone into fishery research.  We did not 
see any.  We saw cutbacks.  Instead of learning from the past, we 
went ahead and made the same mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People say if we do not learn from history, we are doomed to 
repeat it. Right now the government opposite is repeating the 
mistakes of the early 1990s and we are doomed to suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we talk to any person fishing northern shrimp off the coast 
of Newfoundland and Labrador, they will tell us that the shrimp 
stocks are declining, that the size of the shrimp is smaller than 
it was and the large shrimp seem to have either been caught up or 
are moving away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an extremely serious situation.  What does the minister 
do to alleviate this situation?  Does he bring in more scientists 
to study the cause of the problem?  Does he reduce the catching 
effort?  No, he increases the catching effort.  He does not 
increase it to benefit the coastal communities, many of which are 
without product.  He does not increase it to benefit the three 
major communities on the south coast of Newfoundland, Burgeo, 
Gaultois and Ramea, where there are fish plants in isolated areas 
that have not operated since the moratorium.  These areas are 
devastated with the inhabitants moving out on a daily basis. 
Communities last year were promised crab stocks or access to the 
offshore crab stock, the crab stock outside the 200 mile limit, 
to keep their plants going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was put on hold when studies showed the crab stocks were in 
hard shape and there is an overall reduction this year.  That 
quota could not be granted to the companies wanting to operate 
those plants.  They put their hopes on the fact that maybe they 
could get some shrimp.  Is there extra shrimp this year?  Yes, 
there is.  Does it go to the south coast plants?  No, it does 
not.  It goes to Prince Edward Island, which has not had any 
attachment to the stock before.  Why is it going to Prince Edward 
Island?  Simply because there are four Liberal government members 
from Prince Edward Island who are holding on to their seats with 
their fingernails, knowing that in the next election they, like 
every other Liberal in Atlantic Canada, will be gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why shrimp went to Prince Edward Island.  It is not 
because the government has any great affiliation for Prince 
Edward Island or its people, or any other part of Atlantic 
Canada.  It is simply because Liberals are trying to buy the 
seats that they hold. It is to save their necks and their 
fingernails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another interesting side to the story.  In almost every 
battle and confrontation, five will always beat four if they are 
any good.  There are four Liberal members in Prince Edward Island 
and five Liberal members in Newfoundland.  The question is, how 
did four beat five?  The only answer is that the five must not be 
as good as the four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate thing about this is that three of the members 
from Newfoundland and Labrador represent districts that are 
adjacent to the shrimp stocks.  They are seeing somebody else 
take the fish, bring it past their plants where their plant 
workers cannot find employment, and outside the island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other members who is not adjacent to the shrimp 
stocks represents the three communities I talked about where the 
people are starving and looking for work.  What happened when 
they saw extra shrimp being allocated?  They thought maybe they 
would get some to re-open their plants as they should.  But did 
the member deliver for them?  No he did not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If members are wondering why the people of Atlantic Canada and 
the people of Canada generally are so cynical about the 
government, that is just one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is this going over in Newfoundland?  That is an interesting 
question.  The main person in any province is the premier.  The 
Premier of Newfoundland is extremely upset with his colleagues 
opposite.  He is extremely upset with those people who sat with 
him for years when he was a Liberal member and Liberal cabinet 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact he was a Liberal cabinet minister in 1993-94 when the 
vicious cuts were made to health care.  I give him credit for 
championing the health care cause at the present time. Maybe it 
is because he wants national recognition so that he can take a 
seat opposite again.  However, he cannot forget that he was also 
sitting there when the vicious cuts were made.  He was also 
minister of fisheries and oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Captain Canada, he called himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Captain Canada got his picture all over 
the world because of an international event.  He sent out the 
coast guard to capture the <I>Estai</I>, a Spanish boat, bring it 
back into port and seize its catch. Drastic action was taken so 
nobody would ever dare catch a fish in our waters illegally 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went down to New York and had his picture taken with little 
tiny turbot to show how small the fish really were that were 
being caught.  Everybody said he was a wonderful minister, that 
it was about time somebody stood up and took action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press fell asleep on what happened next.  We gave the 
<I>Estai</I> back to the Spaniards along with their catch.  We 
compensated them for their losses and gave them extra quota in 
our waters. That is not a bad deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  In the meantime Brian went back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Of course the minister went back home, 
became the premier of the province and, as the story goes, lived 
happily ever after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is not living very happily these days because he knows the 
word is out that come the next election he will not be the 
premier.  He might be the prime minister.  As a Newfoundlander, 
if he wants to be the prime minister I will be one who will 
support him.  The unfortunate thing is that the party he wishes 
to lead will not be the party in power.  Therefore he cannot be 
the prime minister.  Forgetting all that, he is very upset today 
with his colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of fisheries and aquaculture in Newfoundland, John 
Efford, a well known name across the country, is quoted as saying 
he is completely and utterly dissociating himself from his 
federal Liberal brethren.  The head of the fishermen's union in 
Newfoundland-Labrador, Mr. McCurdy, is completely irate with the 
decision of the minister.  Representatives from industry have 
said that there will not be a Liberal elected in Newfoundland in 
the next federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked a question of the minister of fisheries yesterday 
he should have listened.  He should have gone back and talked to 
his colleagues.  Despite the fact that five members from 
Newfoundland were not saying anything, he should have told them 
that he would not let any more Newfoundland and Labrador shrimp 
go to any extra entrants in the industry because the industry 
cannot sustain it.  If the quota is increased, which it should 
not be, it should go to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador 
who are adjacent to the resource and who so badly need the work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can understand why everyone is so upset.  We saw our Liberal 
colleagues huddling behind a curtain today when their own 
minister made an announcement.  I presume it was with their 
blessing.  Surely a minister would not announce it if the five of 
them were against it. 
I will get away from that issue as they are a number of other 
issues.  Because it is such a current issue it points out clearly 
the way in which parts of rural Canada in particular are being 
treated.  My colleagues from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick know 
only too well how their areas are being treated by the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the emphasis tonight has been on health care because it 
is the most important issue in the country.  The state of our 
health care is definitely the most important issue facing the 
country.  I will not repeat what I have said in the past, but my 
province has been decimated by the cuts.  The change in formula 
in 1993 devastated Newfoundland despite the fact that our premier 
was one of those who was here in cabinet and perpetrated the 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland, with its declining population, suffers more than 
any other province in Canada.  Despite the fact that every 
province is suffering because of the CHST per capita arrangement 
Newfoundland is suffering more than any other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is great demand upon the few dollars that each province 
has for the health care system in order to look after the sick 
and the aged.  As the provinces have to put more and more money 
into the escalating health care budgets it leaves less money for 
them to put into anything else.  One of the groups suffering 
tremendously is our youth.  CHST funding is supposed to be for 
health and post-secondary education, but nobody talks about 
post-secondary education and nobody is interested in investing in 
our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few days ago in Toronto, Credit Counselling Canada was 
set up.  The president is Mr. Fifield from Newfoundland.  One of 
its main objectives is to help young people who have a great 
burden of financial debt as a result of borrowing to go to 
school.  Across the country from sea to sea to sea, students are 
trying to better their lot.  They know that we are in a 
competitive market.  They know that competition is not from the 
person next door any longer.  It is not the next community.  It 
is not the next town.  It is not the next province.  It is all 
around the world.  We participate in a global economy.  When we 
search for jobs we are competing with people from all over the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our young people have to be trained.  They have to be confident. 
They have to come out with an optimistic outlook on life.  How 
can they be trained if they cannot afford to be trained?  How can 
they be optimistic if they do go through the process of borrowing 
for an education and come out of college or university with a 
$30,000, $40,000, $50,000 or even $60,000 loan hanging around 
their necks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way to build the country.  We have to build the 
country on our resources, and our main resource is our young 
people.  In order to build on a solid foundation, it must be a 
well structured and well educated one.  It is up to all of us to 
make sure that each and every child, regardless of where he or 
she is born in this great country, has the opportunity to receive 
a full and proper education without any encumbrances from the 
outside, especially financially.  We should be there to assist, 
to promote and to encourage.  It is something we are forgetting 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at HRDC.  I wish my friend with the boondoggle echo 
was here, because there is a lot more to HRDC than the billion 
dollar mix-up.  I will not say it is a loss because HRDC says 
that it was not a loss, that it was just poor paperwork.

said that everything was perfect except there was no paperwork to 
cover a billion bucks?  I am not sure how long that employee 
would be working, but with the Liberal government it is okay.  A 
$1 billion mistake does not matter because most of the next year 
can be taken to adjust it.  That has happened during the past 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have asked why the JCP applications they submitted, or 
their constituents submitted, were not being approved? Why are 
Canada jobs fund applications, which used to be the old 
transitional jobs fund, not being approved?  Why are targeted 
wage applications not being approved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions go to the people who work in the local offices 
of HRDC.  When we call we may not get an answer.  They are so 
busy going back through the records to try to find where all the 
money went that they cannot do the job at hand.  Staff was caught 
over and over and over.  It is exceptionally hard for a handful 
of people to try to do a job the minister should have done years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been told to go through the files, to crawl through 
the drawers, to get into the closets and to go under the beds to 
find the files with the missing information that will justify the 
expenditures.  Some of them off the record will tell us that it 
was suggested to them that perhaps they could make a few changes 
while they were doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of government we are looking at.  These are the 
kinds of examples we face.  I know my time is up.  If I had

Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from St. John's on his 
very eloquent speech in the Chamber and on the contribution he 
has already made on behalf of all Newfoundland and Labrador 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has spoken with a very strong voice.  I know he has a great 
deal of credibility, particularly in the area of education.  As 
an education minister in his home province he was very intimately 
aware of the challenges that face students.  He obviously has a 
continued grasp and understanding of the serious problem of the 
brain drain that affects Newfoundland in a very significant way 
and the country generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are losing our best and our brightest to countries like the 
United States and to Europe.  We train and invest in young people 
and then they leave to make a contribution to another economy, in 
the hopes of maybe someday coming back when the employment 
situation improves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would elucidate further on what we 
could do with respect to the brain drain issue that is facing his 
province and facing my home province of Nova Scotia.  We are 
losing our best people before they have a chance to make the 
contribution that will build the country that we all want to see, 
to reach the potential that exists but somehow eluded our grasp 
for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recall that we were told the 20th century would belong to 
Canada.  We are not there yet.  It does not look like we will get 
there under the unsteady hand of the current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell us what is the first step we will 
have to take?  I am not only referring to the area of education, 
but what can we do to bring about change that will help us reach 
this potential?

this very Chamber, when we see the way the government is going 
downhill, as even he agrees, when we see the slippage of the NDP, 
and when we see the fiasco that we call the reformed Reformers or 
the Canadian Alliance, is it any wonder that people believe 
there is salvation ahead and that the party which has always 
stood for this great country—

</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is only step one.  What any elected party has to do is 
this.  First, we have tremendous resources which we must develop.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  While I do that, Mr. Speaker, I feel 
rather unfortunate for the hon. member because he represents that 
particular party down there in the corner.  He talked about how 
great it is.  I am looking at vote No. 3 which will come up 
tonight.  The President of the Treasury Board wants to spend $905 
million on Fisheries and Oceans.  What does his party want to do? 
It wants to cut $822 million out of that budget and leave less 
than $100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the fishing industry in his part of the country is 
experiencing serious problems.  While we do not always agree and 
sometimes seldom agree with what the government proposes, I just 
cannot for the life of me understand why that party thinks that

be beneficial to St. John's West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member thinks

facts and figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read the papers of the last few days, looking at the facts

Canadian Alliance.  What is happening is this.  They are getting 
representatives of all the candidates running around, giving out 
membership cards like chocolate bars.  They are saying “Will you 
have one of those?  If you do, we will say that you are a

It will facilitate the transfer of knowledge to those who manage 
our health care system.

do not even come close to bringing it back to the 1993 levels 
when this government took over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he wants to know what we can do for our young people, one of 
these days I will send him over a good old Irish tape with a song 
called the the Flight of Earls, which talks about the young 
people 15 to 20 years ago leaving Ireland in droves to find 
employment elsewhere.  They were not giving up on their country; 
they were giving up on the possibility of finding work.  They 
were saying “Some day we might be able to go back”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland believed in its youth.  This government does not. 
Ireland invested in its youth.  This government is not investing,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this 
opportunity to rise in support of the supply bill.  We are here 
this evening to talk about government expenditures; the money the 
government will spend this year on its many programs, services 
and initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I continue I want to take this opportunity to clarify a 
term that has been used.  There has been much discussion about 
government money.  There is, in my opinion, no such thing as 
government money.  There are only public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we are well aware of this fact.  The vast 
majority of the funds that we discuss in this House are tax 
dollars of our neighbours, colleagues and friends, farmers, 
fishermen, high and low tech workers, small business persons and 
others who work across this country from coast to coast to coast. 
They have the right to expect their government to spend this 
money judiciously, wisely and fairly.  They have the right to see 
that their tax dollars are making a difference and improving the 
standard of living in their lives, in their children's lives and 
in the lives of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to investing in programs, 
initiatives and services that Canadians want and need.  This 
commitment is reflected in the supply bill.  The funds for which 
we are seeking approval in the supply bill are essential to our 
ongoing efforts to improve the lives of all Canadians and to 
deliver good government to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is realistic to state that these funds will have an impact on 
each and every Canadian in some tangible way.  This money will 
help continue the fight to make sure that our accomplishments are 
achieved; accomplishments in continuing to make our streets 
safer, preserving our environment, or furthering the development 
of our programs which help the less fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are investing in numerous initiatives.  Why?  Because each 
contributes to a common goal, the goal to provide Canadians with 
the high quality programs and services they need and expect in 
their daily lives.  These are the investments that continue to 
make us the number one country in the world with the United 
Nations rating systems for literacy, distribution of wealth, 
education and the many forms of tolerance and compassion that 
make us who we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I will echo my colleagues' sentiments when I stress how 
important it is to ensure that these important investments are 
being made responsibly.  It is not enough for this government or 
any government to simply say “Trust us”.  We know the 
importance of having clear accountability in place.  We also know 
that having the appropriate control of frameworks and regulations 
is essential to ensuring that funds are being administered in a 
way that best serves the public good.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you, my colleagues and most Canadians know, we 
have those frameworks and regulations in place.  They are in 
place and they work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the framework and smart spending that allows for all of 
these improvements in the daily lives of Canadians.  We know that 
the job is not complete.  We know that there are further 
improvements to be made and that is why we need to continue to 
build on our success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome this opportunity to elaborate on some of the comments 
my hon. colleague, the President of the Treasury Board, made a 
few moments ago.  I would like to focus for a few moments on the 
Treasury Board Secretariat's revised policy on transfer payments 
which came into effect on June 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revised policy is important to strengthening the management 
of public spending.  The member opposite has helped in the 
process of formulating the new policy that the government has put 
forward and has commended it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The origins of the revised policy can be traced back to the 1997 
report of the independent review panel on modernizing 
comptrollership in the Government of Canada.  This report 
recommended that the Treasury Board Secretariat establish 
government-wide administrative standards and policies.  As a 
result, we started a review of our policy on transfer payments, 
particularly as it related to grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That review began in the summer of 1999.  It built on the 
panel's recommendations.  A working group was struck, composed of 
both the departmental and central agency representatives.  The 
idea was to obtain broad input and balanced viewpoints.  The 
working group met to review, provide input and ultimately 
facilitate the drafting of a revised policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective was to develop a policy that would meet 
departmental needs while fulfilling the government's requirements 
for accountability, managing for results and ensuring responsible 
spending.  This policy meets the objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the departments involved in providing input to the 
revised policy included Health Canada, Indian and Northern 
Affairs Canada, Industry Canada, Natural Resources Canada, 
Environment Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Western 
Economic Diversification, Canadian Heritage and Finance Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to note that feedback on an earlier draft of the 
policy was provided by the office of the auditor general, which 
fully supported its direction.  The revised policy has a single 
but very important objective:  to ensure the sound management of 
and control over accountability for grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy on transfer payments applies to all Government of 
Canada departments and agencies, as well as to all transfer 
payments, including those between the Government of Canada and 
other levels of government.  While it does not apply to crown 
corporations, several are using it as a guide to develop their 
own policies.  This is a model that is being copied far and wide. 
This is how we continue to reinvigorate government and its 
processes to ensure Canadians get the government they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from what the President of the Treasury Board has already 
explained from her overview of some of its most important 
features, let me elaborate a little on certain points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The revised policy affects grants and contributions.  In this 
respect it requires several things of departments.  As my 
colleague has pointed out, it requires departments to guarantee 
that measures are in place to ensure due diligence in approving 
payments.  Departments must also ensure diligence in verifying 
eligibility and entitlement whenever a new contribution program 
is being established or renewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it requires that departments have a results based 
accountability framework in place.  This framework must include 
performance indicators, expected results and outcomes, as well as 
evaluation criteria to be used in assessing the effectiveness of 
any given program. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2000"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT133"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT133"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2000
<A HREF="#LINKT134"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT132"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the revised policy requires that departments recommend 
specific limits to federal assistance in instances wherein 
recipients are receiving funding from multiple levels of 
government, including other federal sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all positive measures and it does not stop there.  The 
revised policy also adopts the principle that funds are provided 
only at the minimum level required to achieve the expected 
results and not in advance of need.  In addition, eligibility 
criteria for assistance must be predetermined, made public and 
applied on a consistent basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the programs must be formally renewed through treasury 
board once every five years, or more often should it be deemed 
necessary.  This ensures ongoing relevance and effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individually these are all important steps forward. Collectively 
they represent considerable progress.  These measures will make a 
difference for Canadians.  They will help ensure that funds are 
administered responsibly and that Canadians can have confidence 
that their money is being well invested by their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I know that some questions remain.  I have had several 
colleagues ask me about how this policy affects programs that are 
already in existence.  There are three important ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, effective June 1 as I mentioned earlier, departments must 
commence a review of their transfer payment management regimes to 
ensure they reflect all aspects of the revised policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, agreements entered into on or after June 1 should 
respect the principles of the revised policy.  A three month 
transition period is provided however before new agreements must 
reflect all the revised policy requirements. This is only fair. 
It is a recognition of what is realistic from an administrative 
point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, departments must obtain treasury board approval to 
replace or renew the terms and conditions of existing transfer 
payment programs by March 31, 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has introduced some broad though necessary 
changes.  Many of the requirements contained in the revised 
policy, such as the need for results based accountability and 
risk based audit frameworks, are already in place since they were 
implicit in the old policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is likely to be an initial workload increase as 
departments work to ensure existing management control frameworks 
are adequate and appropriate.  They will also have to make sure 
that they have the data required to evaluate programs and to 
report to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For renewals as well as for new programs, departments will need 
to provide fuller proposals when coming to treasury board for 
approvals.  This will no doubt require greater attention to 
detail and as a result, more work for departmental staff.  This 
is essential however.  Treasury board needs to be provided with 
the necessary assurances that the programs are sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there will be some initial expenses but I believe that 
these expenses will be relatively inconsequential compared to the 
savings we will ultimately enjoy as a result of more efficient 
and effective management of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by once again stressing my emphatic support for 
this supply bill.  It is good and necessary legislation.  It will 
allow the government access to essential funding, funding for 
programs that are important to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a clear vision.  We have a clear appreciation 
of what Canadians want.  That is why our policies have helped 
produce the lowest unemployment rate in over 25 years.  It has 
enabled us to deal with a surplus and in effect have more 
efficient and effective government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the policy of transfer payments demonstrates, we have the 
mechanisms in place to ensure that funds are administered 
effectively.  Together these elements will ensure that Canadians 
get truly exceptional value for their tax dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Motion No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK406"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was listening to the speech by the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board.  He was 
basically reiterating what the president had already told us 
about the improvements they are going to be implementing. I have 
two questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is what assurance do we have that treasury board is 
going to police these new rules to see that they are implemented? 
We all know about the billion dollar boondoggle at the HRDC 
camp.  It was because the rules were there but ignored that all 
this happened.  It is fine to introduce new rules, but if they 
are just rules on paper and nobody says they must be followed, 
then what is the point? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question I have deals with grants, not contributions. 
Treasury board has a rule that when it hands out money in a 
grant, the person receives it but it will never audit the 
recipient to find out if it was spent in accordance with the 
grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions and billions of dollars in grants are handed out every 
year.  They are sometimes for old age security which is a grant. 
We do not want to worry about auditing that.  They get it and 
they spend it the way they want.  All kinds of grants are given 
out, such as $145 million to the millennium fund to celebrate the 
millennium using Canadian taxpayers' dollars virtually all of 
which was a waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, treasury board does not even know after it wrote the 
cheque whether the money was spent in accordance with what the 
applicants said they were going to do with the money. Treasury 
board says it does not want to audit after the fact to find out 
if they actually spent the money or put it in their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are two simple questions to ensure that Canadians can 
expect value for their money because quite often that is not 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure to 
get a question from the hon. member considering that he helped in 
giving direction to some of the policies.  The hon. member has 
commended the President of the Treasury Board and the government 
for doing such a great job in listening to him and implementing a 
great policy.  That is step one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have done is taken some of his ideas, along with some of 
the ideas that we already had in place, to ensure that there is 
effective expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government understands it is important that we spend 
taxpayers' money effectively, unlike the past government of which 
I am sure the hon. member was a supporter, even though he may not 
have had a membership card.  They had a philosophical 
understanding on that side to the point where they were actually 
trying to align themselves.  They get confused the odd day but 
generally speaking, they are on the same wavelength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order with regard to the subject of relevance here.  I had two 
specific questions on the process of implementing new policy and 
now we are on to membership in political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sure the 
learned parliamentary secretary is about to make the link.  We 
are all fascinated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am.  The member gets all 
hot under the collar when we talk about the alliance between the 
Conservative Party and the reformed Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically what I was getting at was that party of the past that 
he may have supported was in a deficit of $42 billion and it 
helped the debt rise tremendously.  Canadians basically rewarded 
that group with a cleaning out of the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put in place many things to ensure that our dollar is 
very effective and that we are spending the way Canadians want. 
For the last seven years they have continually said that they 
agree with many of the policies we have put in place because we 
are looking at the dollar as if we were entrepreneurs.  In a way 
we are trying to ensure that we get multiple returns from a small 
business person's dollar.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I alluded to the Canada infrastructure program which all members 
on the other side have commended the government on.  We took a 
federal tax dollar and multiplied it sometimes three to four 
times to ensure that many of the municipalities which Canadians 
live in have the required infrastructure to ensure they have 
clean water, a safe environment and many other things so that the 
standard of living of Canadians can continue to improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also asked a question about the $145 millennium fund. 
I must mention one in my riding, the Evergreen Foundation.  It 
has allowed for many schoolyards and unused urban areas to be 
regenerated. It has encouraged Canadians in urban centres from 
coast to coast to coast to give us back the green, to help us 
with the environment that we need for our daily living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been doing a lot of good work to ensure that 
Canadians benefit in many ways.  We will continue to do that with 
the support of the hon. member on the other side. 
<P><A NAME="LINK407"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to debate about the government spending some $50 
billion.  Of course money has to be spent in order to run the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a comment with respect to the Liberal member who 
last spoke.  He was trying to attribute a $42 billion deficit on 
this side of the House, especially to the Canadian Alliance. That 
is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that I was 11 years old and in grade school 
when the Prime Minister was first elected to the House.  That was 
the year there was any significant debt. That is when the debt 
started to skyrocket.  Half of the $600 billion can be attributed 
to the Liberal Party of Canada under Prime Minister Pierre Elliot 
Trudeau.  That is when it started. The Canadian public was sick 
of that debt and elected the Tories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I would ask to have a little 
bit of respect from that side of the House, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> He does not deserve respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I think hon. members 
have to give and take.  There has been a fair amount of giving 
and I think this is the taking time.  If the hon. member for 
Saanich—Gulf Islands needs me to admonish the other side of the 
House, I would be glad to do so, but the member has never needed 
it in the past and probably will not need it in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will continue, but just 
because the decorum in this House gets down to the bottom of the 
trough does not mean that members have to participate or support 
it.  Hon. members can actually try to show some decorum in this 
House, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the $50 billion that is frustrating 
Canadians. What is frustrating Canadians is the lack of 
accountability and how the government spends money and the tax 
increases that have been forced upon them.  There has been one 
hidden tax increase after another. It is the taxpayers who 
actually got the deficit to zero.  It was not the government.  It 
is the sneaky, hidden tax increases that have frustrated 
Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last year in the House of Commons we have started to see 
the real skeletons of the Liberal Party of Canada come out of the 
closet.  How the Liberals spend money is being exposed. 
We have seen billions of dollars go out to friends and 
contributors of the Liberal Party of Canada.  There is absolutely 
overwhelming evidence.  It is all documented.  It has been 
revealed in the House that people who have received significant 
grants, most important, in the Prime Minister's own riding, and 
what have they done?  They have turned around and donated part of 
that grant money straight back into the Liberal Party.  If this 
happened in the private sector it would be called fraud, it would 
be called criminal, it would be called corruption and the people 
would be thrown in jail, nothing less.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me show the arrogance of all this.  Day after day we watch 
the government members not try to correct it, laugh at it, make 
fun of it and ridicule it.  They are not laughing at us.  Yes, we 
can see them, but they are looking into the cameras behind me. 
They are looking to the Canadian people.  They are making a 
mockery of the whole system.  They are laughing at the Canadian 
people as these grants happen day after day in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars.  The grants and contributions are 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has caused an incredible burning passion in the Canadians I 
speak to no matter where I go, whether it is in western Canada, 
in Atlantic Canada, in Ontario or in Quebec.  It happens 
everywhere.  People are very frustrated.  We have to change that 
and that is why we will be voting against this bill, the $50 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the February budget that the finance minister brought in, the 
government increased the grants and contributions in the fiscal 
year 1999-2000 by $1.5 billion.  That is how much money is in its 
own government documents for grants and contributions but health 
care supposedly only receive $1 billion.  It is absolutely 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to bring in accountability.  We have to depoliticize 
the process.  These grants and contributions are going out to 
people who are personal friends of the Prime Minister and who, as 
we have heard day in and day out in the House, have absolutely 
incredible histories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to emphasize is that the Canadian people are looking 
to us to bring some respect, integrity and honesty back to this 
institution so that they will get value for their taxpayer 
dollars.  People want to see a truly national health care system, 
whether they get sick in Newfoundland, in Winnipeg or in my home 
province of British Columbia, that they know they are going to be 
treated and that they are not going to have to die on waiting 
lists.  Our health care system is an absolute state of chaos 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is happening in my own riding.  In Sidney where I live, and 
in the greater Victoria area, they have had to make changes. They 
have had to close down health facilities that have been there for 
a long time.  They have had to close the intensive care unit for 
children level 2 at one of the only two children's pediatric 
centres in British Columbia.  When I asked the CEO at the 
Victoria Regional Health Board why that was happening, he said 
that it started because of one reason, no money and the lack of 
funds.  Those critically ill children will now have to be 
airlifted to Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is happening over and over again.  The frustrating part is 
that it does not need to be that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals stand up and laugh at the grants going into hotels 
and golf courses in the Prime Minister's own riding.  They make a 
mockery of it.  They think it is a big joke.  Well, it is 
completely unacceptable.  It is time to bring change to this 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last government that did this was the Tory government in the 
early 1990s.  The Tories became arrogant and believed that they 
were above everyone who brought them here.  They forgot about the 
people who voted for them.  They put themselves on a pedestal so 
high that they thought they were untouchable.  Well, the Canadian 
people judged them in October 1993 and they were not re-elected. 
The Canadian people threw the federal Tories so far that it was 
not even funny.  They took a government with 211 seats, one of 
the largest majorities in the history of Canada, and brought them 
down to two seats.  Why?  It was because the Tories became 
arrogant, unaccountable and showed no respect for the Canadian 
taxpayer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is happening today but 10 times worse.  If Canadians think 
what happened then was bad, they have not seen anything yet.  It 
is pitiful what has gone on in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really pitiful is the Liberals' reaction to all this. 
They stand up and make a mockery of question period.  They laugh 
and make jokes and do not give answers in question period.  We 
heard the Minister of Veterans Affairs, when he stood up in the 
House in the last two days, just make a big joke about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to talk about anything they want, and we will let the 
Canadian people judge.  They can continue to laugh, make jokes 
and yell across the House but their day is coming.  As we all 
know, we are less than a year away from an election.  We will 
stand on our record and they can stand on theirs.  Their record 
is a health care system that has disintegrated and is in a state 
of chaos.  We have rising taxes and personal family incomes and 
disposable incomes have gone down.  Frustrated Canadians have 
watched unaccountable grants go up.  That is their record, and 
they cannot step away from it because there is too much evidence 
and hard facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the next federal election when the government 
will be judged and we will see who gets the last laugh, the 
taxpayer or the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK408"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was interesting to 
listen to the hon. member on the other side, who got very 
sensitive, taking into account that he is supporting the person 
who was an assistant to Brian Mulroney, and who, of course, must 
have advised him on how to do government.  He is protesting that 
the Conservatives were voted down from 211 seats to two, but he 
is basically knocking one of the three people running for the 
leadership of his new party who was an adviser to Brian Mulroney. 
I do not understand how that works.  I am curious.  He despises 
the arrogance to which he was referring.  He joined the new 
reform party, but the new reformed reform party is now trying to 
choose someone whom he detested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to figure out how he reconciles that.  What has 
changed?  Does it have anything to do with the mindset that the 
new party actually is dealing with when the pension reform is 
taken into account, and things that its members fought very hard 
about until they realized that in reality many of the things that 
they had in their minds were really figments of their 
imagination? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to state that I was 
elected on June 2, 1997 as a member of the Reform Party of 
Canada.  I was as very proud of that then as I am today, and I 
will be forever.  I have no shame being a member of the Reform 
Party of Canada.  It brought a lot of influence on the 
government.  I am awfully proud of that fact.  I am very proud 
that the former leader of the official opposition, who is now a 
candidate, had the vision to move the party forward and offer 
Canadians a choice. I am proud that he was able to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has asked me about one of the candidates, Tom Long. 
Let me tell the member a little about him.  I am quite proud to 
tell the member about the $50 billion that he would not sink down 
a toilet.  Was he involved in the 1984 election when the federal 
Tories were elected?  Yes.  Did he come to Ottawa after that 
election and work for Brian Mulroney personally?  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Long told me that after what Pierre Elliot Trudeau did in 
the House, that he would have done anything to get him out.  I 
want say on the record that Mr. Long was employed by former Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney's office for 18 months.  Eighteen months 
after he arrived in Ottawa he resigned for for his own personal 
reasons.  I believe he wanted to see certain things done but he 
left 18 months after he got here and went to work with the 
provincial Tories. 
As we were building the Reform Party of Canada in the early 
1990s, he was out there working side by side with the provincial 
Tories in Ontario building a parallel track.  They have been very 
successful.   I think they should also be applauded for what they 
have accomplished.   They are one of the first governments that 
made promises and stuck to them.  They did not get sidetracked. 
They did not succumb to the pressure.  Did they make mistakes 
along the way?  Yes, they did, and they are fixing those now, but 
they kept their promises.  They promised to cut—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is picking up on the 
point made by my colleague for Trinity—Spadina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the member for Saanich—Gulf Islands I think for a very 
short period of time was supporting some Ontario cabinet minister 
but that only lasted a couple of weeks.  I am not quite sure 
about his overall sense of judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am flabbergasted that the member would stand here and have the 
nerve to talk about respect and honesty.  He draws the example of 
the grants and contributions being upped in the budget to, I 
think he said, $1.3 billion, drawing the conclusion or the 
inference that the money is for HRDC, when he knows full well or 
he should know that $900 million of that $1.3 billion is for the 
Canada Foundation for Innovation and the Genome project where we 
are investing in new technologies and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on but I will give the member a chance to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, his number is not quite 
accurate, it is $1.5 billion.  The point that I made was that in 
this fiscal budget, the grants and contributions of all 
departments went up $1.5 billion.  How much did health care get? 
It got $1 billion.  There is something wrong with that when our 
health care is in the state of chaos that it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This only exemplifies the point.  They want to talk about 
everything else but the budget and the $50 billion that we are 
supposed to be talking about.  Again, we need to bring back 
respect and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grants that have gone out under HRDC are just the tip of the 
iceberg.  We know that is happening in all kinds of departments. 
The system is fatally flawed and it needs to be fixed.  I look 
forward to the day when we are going to bring about those 
changes.  I will stand on my record and my party's record to the 
voters of this country.  We look forward to that in the coming 
months.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure to speak tonight to these 
estimates, to the spending of money.  I would like to be able to 
speak about the great move in tax reductions but we do not see 
that.  We see a lot more spending.  Spending is the topic that is 
on the minds of a lot of Canadians today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember arriving here in 1993 and hearing the Liberals say 
that they were going to do something about the million children 
that are living in poverty.  We are now in the year 2000, and 
they are still saying that they have to do something about the 
million and a half children living in poverty.  It sounds to me 
like something is wrong here.  They went backwards.  They are 
going the wrong way.  In 1993 we had a million children living in 
poverty.  Now we have a million and a half children living in 
poverty and they want to pat themselves on the back and applaud 
the great things they have done in this category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I arrived in 1993 they were quite upset about the poverty 
and the lifestyles that existed on some Indian reserves. I have 
seen most of these reserves.  I have seen the ones that are 
really good and I have seen the ones that are really suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 we said that we need some accountability.  The Liberals 
said that they were going to address that issue.  They said they 
would take care of the situation.  We are now in the year 2000 
and we have coalitions building out there trying their best to 
get some accountability to make it happen, but it is getting 
worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My, my, my, what a track record.  It would take hours to talk 
about the Liberal spending that really makes a lot of sense, like 
hanging dead rabbits in a museum.

our famous stars to perform in the film <I>Bubbles Galore</I> 
which was authorized by the Liberal government.  We could go on 
and on and on to talk about wasteful spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about the millions of dollars going into wonderful 
ridings, most of which are Liberal ridings, particularly 
Shawinigan, to build new fancy hotels for the sake of job 
creation.  The Liberals are spending millions creating hotel 
beds.  In the meantime they are spending nothing as we close 
hospital beds.  What kind of priority is that?  Maybe the million 
dollars to build a fancy hotel in Shawinigan would have been 
better spent in an area that could use more help with hospitals.

have the freedom of expression.  We have many freedoms, but who 
is responsible for them?  It is soldiers.  It is not reporters 
that gave us freedom of the press.  It was the soldiers.  It was 
not orators that gave us freedom of speech.  It was the soldiers 
who put their lives on the line to make sure that all the 
freedoms we enjoy as Canadians were in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet look at what is happening in the department of defence.  The 
way they treat that body of people is a disgrace.  It is 
underequipped.  We read about them being in soup kitchens.  While 
the Liberals continually pat themselves on the back about the 
wonderful job they are doing, our defence is becoming the 
laughing stock of the world.  They have no respect for the 
soldiers who made all these things happen.  It was not the 
politicians. It was not Trudeau.  It was not Mulroney.  It was no 
one but the soldiers.  When they start respecting the people of 
this land to the extent that they ought to, maybe we will see 
some sensible decisions made with regard to spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could look at the areas for which my friend from 
Okanagan—Shuswap and I are responsible and what is going on in 
our penitentiaries.  I am absolutely amazed by the amount of 
money they spend looking for dangerous offenders who walk away 
from a golf course.  They are sentenced to penitentiary and when 
they are out playing golf they walk away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about one who walked away.  He was a bank robber. He 
went to Edmonton and found himself a nice young lady whom he 
viciously raped.  I am sorry for the incorrectness.  He sexually 
assaulted her, viciously.  Now a big search is on to find this 
guy because of decisions made by a government that has no 
priority for the safety of Canadians and allows those kinds of 
things to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Oh, come on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  I hear the hon. member.  A dangerous 
offender walked away from a golf course and he says “Oh, come 
on”.  He should go back to the office and smell some more cork. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the laughingstock of it all.  The Liberals came out with 
a report on recidivism.  This guy will not be included in the 
recidivism count because he was a bank robber and when he went 
out again he became a sexual assaulter.  He is not a repeat 
offender because he did not commit the same crime.  This 
information is fed into Statistics Canada, out come the reports 
and away they go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all a bunch of baloney.  Every day people continually ask 
me if I feel safe in Canada.  No.  I am asked if my wife and I 
like to take walks in the park.  Yes.  I am asked if we do.  No. 
When asked why, I say that we like to look forward and see what 
we can see rather than having to watch over our shoulders to see 
who is coming.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Correctional Service Canada spend its money on?  What 
does it do?  Let us take a look.  Some $78,000 were spent on 
millennium calendars that were sent to penitentiaries.  I went 
into several penitentiaries after the calendars were sent and we 
did not find one calendar hung up in any cell because they did 
not want them.  At one penitentiary they boxed them all up.  We 
brought them back here and delivered them to the solicitor 
general.  I told him that the guards, the penitentiary people and 
the inmates said they did not need the calendars.  For inmates to 
have calendars it just made the days longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the commissioner came up with the bright idea of spending 
$4 million on a plane for Correctional Services Canada.  He did 
not have to spend that much.  He could have spent $2 million on a 
used one.  I do not know what they ended up getting but I know 
they got it.  It is my understanding that it was such an 
embarrassment that they are not using it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  They haven't flown it yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Isn't that wonderful?  They spent 
$200,000 on a task force on security and $70,000 for 
international travel by the commissioner in one year.  They have 
a plan in place to get more and more inmates into the 
communities.  They are reducing the number of inmates.  The cost 
of running the system has gone up tremendously.  Expenses to 
operate penitentiaries have gone up but there are less inmates. 
It does not make sense.  Should they not be going down? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the correctional officers, the professional people 
who work on the frontline, who put their necks on the line every 
time they go to work?  They have not seen a raise for ages. There 
was a time when they were fairly comparable to the RCMP and other 
police forces.  Now they are a way down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they ask for such things as vests that will protect them 
from knife wounds, the answer is no, that there are no funds. 
They ask for protective equipment when they make their rounds. 
They would like to carry more than just a flashlight in dark 
corners in the event they run into problems.  When they ask for a 
little better backup, the answer is no, that there are no funds 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an easy solution.  The commissioner should be fired and 
a guy put in there who will do the job.  No.  He follows fuzzy, 
touchy-feely, good Liberal stuff.  It is all a bunch of nonsense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian

and I have to concur with everything he said.  I fully agree that 
we like to say Canada is a nice country to live in, that it is 
the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member mentioned in his speech, more and more the 
elderly talk about a fear of going down to the corner grocery 
store at night even to pick up a loaf of bread or a quart of 
milk.  During my travels to schools I hear that even children are 
feeling unsafe going to and from school.  Some parents are now 
taking their children to and from school themselves.  Has the 
member heard such things during his travels? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, I certainly have 
heard those very same things.  I visit schools quite often.  They 
ask me to speak on justice issues, particularly the Young 
Offenders Act.  I ask most of them if they are fearful going 
downtown or going back and forth from school.  The majority of 
them are quite frightened.  They like to travel in groups as a 
safety factor.  In some cases they are fearful in their own 
school because of the bullying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of fear out there.  We need to concentrate on 
doing the right things to protect Canadians.  After all, our most 
elemental duty as members of parliament is to provide legislation 
that protects people and their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government over there that figures the best thing to 
do is to register property.  Now the supreme court has come down 
with a ruling that what the government has done is legal. 
Because of the supreme court decision I am sure criminals are 
shaking in their boots.  They are all going to run down and 
register their guns tomorrow morning.  Of course they are not. 
They do not give a hoot about it.

after honest law-abiding people and ignore the criminals.  That 
is another brilliant decision.  It spends millions and millions, 
and it is going to be billions of dollars, to try to accomplish 
something with money that could have well been spent on real 
protection of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of 
visiting the Joyceville prison in Ontario with the hon. member. 
We were there about some complaints and concerns with regard to 
the safety of the guards.  While we were there we had the 
opportunity of seeing a system that was in place.  Perhaps the 
hon. member can correct me on the costs, but I think they were 
between $65,000 and $85,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A system was put in place to detect drugs as people came into 
the prison.  I asked the warden at that time, since it had been 
in place for a few months, how much in drugs had been 
confiscated.  She said none.  That is not what they do there. 
When the alarm goes off they do not search the people or 
anything.  They tell the people to go back home and try again in 
24 hours to see if they can come through the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just wondering if the hon. member had heard whether or not 
they have changed the program at all.  Perhaps now at least they 
will stop and search the people and confiscate the drugs on them 
at that point in time, or do they still just let them go back 
home? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr.  Speaker, I believe they can 
search them if they have the desire and the direction from the 
authorities to do so.  I do not think that direction is given out 
very often because we have a group of people who are running the 
show and they are called Liberals.  They have hired a 
commissioner who is very soft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted to know whether correctional officers should be 
uniformed, whether they should wear a military style uniform or a 
police uniform or golf shirts.  The commissioner has said that as 
long he is commissioner they will wear golf shirts.  He does not 
want them to look like authority and scare the poor little 
inmates to death.  What kind of an attitude is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the scanners my colleague is talking about are set off when 
someone comes in as a visitor, there ought to be some serious 
action taken immediately to determine what it is.  It is true 
they may pick up a five dollar bill in my pocket.  It might 
detect that someone had their hands on it at one time.  They 
should find out what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a zero tolerance for drugs.  Have we ever hear 
anything funnier in our lives when drugs are more available in 
penitentiaries than they are on any street in our country?  There 
is no real genuine effort to stop them.  Their zero tolerance is 
nonsense.  It does not exit.  I wish they would quit saying that 
is their policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
opposition's interventions in this debate are very depressing. 
They speak of waste, of scandal and of chaos.  According to them 
nothing is good in the country.  I beg to differ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has at present the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years. 
Inflation is negligible.  The annual deficit has been eradicated. 
Indeed the economy is producing surpluses.  Canada is leading the 
G-8 in economic growth and the UN names us as the best nation in 
the world in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By focusing on the negatives the opposition is avoiding the real 
issue of how government might assist those Canadians who are in 
need.  When the Prime Minister was in Berlin recently he 
reiterated our Liberal approach which searches for a middle 
ground between the extremes of left and right, an approach which 
focuses on real people with practical solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian model is about more than making money.  It is about 
accommodating diversity.  It is about a partnership between 
citizens and the state.  It is about a balance that promotes 
individual freedom and economic prosperity while sharing in the 
risks and in the benefits.  In other words it is about an 
understanding that government can be a positive instrument for 
serving the public interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of HRDC grants and contributions, I want to remind 
all Canadians and my hon. colleagues that the standing committee 
fully explored the question of the administration of grants and 
contributions.  This review was conducted to ensure that the best 
interests of Canadian taxpayers would be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the surprise of no one on this side of the House, the report 
of the standing committee, entitled “Seeking a Balance:  Final 
Report on Human Resources Development Canada Grants and 
Contributions”, concluded: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although some of the government's critics allege that HRDC grants 
and contributions were dispensed to achieve political ends, proof 
supporting this allegation has never been provided to the 
Committee....In an overwhelmingly vast majority of cases, HRDC 
grants and contributions are properly administered and spent. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These findings should have put an end to this protracted and 
politically motivated debate.  Certainly, they reinforce what the 
original internal audit indicated; that information, not money, 
was missing from many project files.  Do not get me wrong. 
Proper administration is central to ensuring proper 
accountability for public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless anyone has forgotten, it was precisely because HRDC was 
committed to strengthening business practices that it initially 
ordered and conducted the internal audit of its grants and 
contributions.  It was the minister of HRD who first alerted 
Canadians to concerns that the department's administrative 
systems needed improvement and who insisted her staff correct the 
problems quickly and comprehensively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same minister who sought the expert advice of 
respected outside experts on ways to improve management, 
including the design and implementation of a six-point action 
plan, a plan that has been endorsed by the auditor general.  He 
told the standing committee that the plan represents an 
exceptional response and a very thorough plan for corrective 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC is working hard to implement the action plan and to bring 
the department's procedures up to the standards Canadians expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administrative clean-up is well under way.  As the minister 
explained when she released the first progress report on the 
action plan, the department has reviewed not just the audited 
files, but all 17,000 active files, worth $1.5 billion.  Where 
information was missing, it was obtained.  Where approvals were 
not recorded or were carried out incorrectly, they were 
corrected.  Where further monitoring work was called for, it was 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most important to recognize is that of the $1.5 billion 
worth of initiatives we reviewed, we identified only $6,500 in 
outstanding debt to the government, not $1 billion as the 
opposition claimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that we will not see a repeat of the old paperwork 
problems, we have trained more than 3,000 program and financial 
staff on the action plan directives and clarified their 
accountability.  We have put to use expert advice from the 
auditor general, from the treasury board's Comptrollership 
Standards Advisory Board, and from Deloitte & Touche.  We have 
put in place new conditions to ensure that each and every payment 
meets all financial and administrative requirements before it 
goes out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this process we have worked hard to ensure 
accountability for the tax dollars of the Canadian people, while 
at the same time trying to avoid unnecessary red tape and 
bureaucratic bottlenecks so that we can continue to provide the 
programs Canadians need to improve their quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also made a commitment to keep Canadians informed of our 
comprehensive response to this issue.  In addition to quarterly 
reports, every effort has been made to make as much information 
available as humanly possible.  HRDC has put more than 10,000 
pages of details on specific grants and contributions on the 
Internet.  Anyone wanting further information need only visit the 
department's website to find out more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who takes the time to do so will discover the real story 
behind grants and contributions; the stories of personal triumph 
of people living in every riding in the country, people who count 
on federally funded projects to help them overcome challenges 
that would prevent them from achieving their potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are that the dollar values of the grants and 
contributions projects range widely from hundreds of dollars for 
targeted wage subsidies to million-dollar agreements with 
national organizations.  More than 60% of the projects are funded 
for amounts less than $25,000, and more than 80% are for less 
than $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our grants and contributions serve a wide interest, such as 
vulnerable children through community based initiatives delivered 
by organizations such as Big Brothers and the YMCA.  Youth 
employment strategy projects reach out to youth at risk, enabling 
them to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to lead 
productive lives.  There are programs for Canadians with 
disabilities, such as the opportunities fund.  The aboriginal 
human resources development strategy improves aboriginal people's 
employability.  There are literacy projects run by local literacy 
groups that are equipping Canadians with the skills they need to 
function effectively in the job market.

grants and contributions would be to punish the most 
disadvantaged.

persists with this long, drawn out debate, based on worn out 
misconceptions and wrong information.  I am not perplexed.  It is 
clear to me that the reason is their basic disagreement that 
Canadians want their tax dollars used to help others who are in 
need.

to read <I>Hansard</I> of Tuesday, June 6, when the Alliance's 
lead critic for finance said that government activity should be 
restricted to three things:  the maintenance of law and order, 
running the criminal justice system, and a strong national 
defence.  In other words, more policemen, more jails, more jail 
guards and more soldiers and sailors.  In other words, people in 
uniform.

view of the world and their pessimistic view of the future of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary gave a long diatribe against other 
parties in this House.  I really would like to know how she feels 
about a billion dollar boondoggle, gross mismanagement in the

other than the fact that there is a cancelled cheque.  How does 
that actually benefit Canadians?

cash.  When she has no real idea where the money has gone, why it 
has gone to any particular area, or what benefit it gave to 
Canadians, why would we want to support the estimates which will 
give more money to this department?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister acknowledged that there were pockets of 
unemployment which she used to justify money going into areas in 
and around her riding.  At first she stood by those grants as 
following the rules, but then she had to admit that they did not 
follow the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the parliamentary secretary, how can 
we believe that department when it says it is going to live by 
the rules from here on in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown:</B>  First, Mr. Speaker, I disagree with the 
premise of the hon. member's question.  He calls HRDC an infamous 
department.  It is not infamous.  Rather, it is famous to all 
those senior citizens who get old age security cheques every 
month and to all the unemployed who get employment insurance 
cheques.  It is helping people to keep the wolf from the door. 
Millions and millions of Canadians have been the recipients.  To 
those people, when the cheque comes, HRDC is their best friend. 
It is not infamous at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is infamous in anybody's eyes, it is because the hon. 
member's party has been irresponsible in blowing up 1/60 of this 
department's budget into what it incorrectly calls a billion 
dollar boondoggle, despite proof that has been put forward in the 
House day after day that a billion dollars is not missing and 
that there is no boondoggle.  Even tonight, on the last night of 
the House, those members disgrace themselves by reiterating that 
discredited phrase that no one else in the House believes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it odd that the hon. member suggests that my speech, 
which had one paragraph pointing out what that party has been 
doing, was a long diatribe against another party.  Actually, I 
find it odd that he said that because his party is the expert on 
long diatribes.  We have been exposed in the House and the 
Canadian public on television to a five month long diatribe from 
that party which was filled with incorrect information, personal 
attacks on the minister and the lowest possible form of 
unintellectual debate that the House has ever witnessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have to know whom they can trust.  We are the ones who 
care about those in need.  We are the ones with programs and they 
are the ones who would cut those programs and stick to policemen, 
jail guards and the army.

of Human Resources Development who defends the department, not 
the present minister, who neglected to warn the public of this 
scandal.  Although she had been aware since August 1999, she

forget to tell the House.  The minister first heard about the 
problem on November 17, ordered a stronger action plan than the 
department had brought forth, and on January 19, I believe, 
announced these things to Canadians.  The minister did not forget 
to tell anybody.  The minister has been the most open and clear 
minister that probably this House has ever seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member talks about cases that were troublesome and 
referred to the RCMP, he forgets to mention that there are but a 
few of them.  Out of 17,000 there are a few.  We are not happy 
about it.  We have referred cases where there was any evidence of 
mishandling of money.  We have required receipts.  We have done 
everything we can to make sure that everything is up and above 
board.

officers if the chief government whip—and I think the other 
whips would agree—would state that the vote that we are applying 
is the one that was taken on the third reading of the supply 
bill.  I think it would be clearer and it might assist in 
avoiding these different counts, subject to the people who might 
not have been here for that vote.
