</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present to parliament the 
solicitor general's annual statement on national security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public safety is the mission of my ministry and it has been a 
priority of the government since we took office.  The Prime 
Minister has said that safe streets are one of the things that 
define the health of a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne the government said it would 
continue to work to fight criminal activity which is becoming 
more global in scope, including money laundering, terrorism and 
the smuggling of people, drugs and guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will focus on the government's response to the report of 
the Special Senate Committee on Security and Intelligence.  The 
special committee, chaired by Senator Kelly, conducted a review 
of our security and intelligence sector and released its final 
report earlier this year.  We studied the report and 
recommendations and prepared a response which I will be tabling 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see the strong support of the government's 
progress on security and intelligence matters, but the committee 
quite rightly pointed out that Canada like other democracies 
needs to stay alert to emerging threats and to take appropriate 
action. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our security is something that we cannot take for granted.  It 
depends on a strong security intelligence capability, law 
enforcement readiness and international co-operation.  Our 
national law and security agencies have effective mechanisms in 
place to meet their intelligence requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the international front Canada has been working hard with 
like-minded nations with the leadership of the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs in a co-operative effort to share 
intelligence and deny terrorists the support and sanctuary they 
need for their operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee noted the close co-operation between Canada and 
the U.S. to ensure our special border relationship remains up to 
the task of detecting terrorists and organized criminals who move 
between our countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cross-border crime forum has helped both countries improve 
security and law enforcement along our borders.  For example, I 
announced last April an extra $15 million a year to post 100 more 
RCMP officers at three of our largest international airports. 
While Canada has been relatively free from terrorists attacks, in 
today's world we must be watchful and prepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also praised the government's work on the national 
counterterrorism plan developed in co-operation with other 
jurisdictions.  It is the key crisis management plan for 
responding to terrorist incidents, setting lines of communication 
and policy direction to guide first responders, senior government 
officials and ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was pleased with steps taken to develop the 
operational readiness program but noted the requirement to do 
more in this area.  We are looking at strengthening the program 
to ensure a national level of readiness.  Through workshops, 
seminars and exercises to strengthen our counterterrorism 
response capacity, these activities aim to raise awareness and 
interagency co-operation on the threat of terrorists or criminal 
use of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The threat of such use is considered low, but all jurisdictions 
in Canada should still have a capacity to respond to the 
consequences of the uses of these weapons.  That is why the 
government will lead consultations with other jurisdictions on a 
national strategy to strengthen Canada's capacity to respond to 
potential terrorist incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Emerging technologies also present challenges to our efforts to 
ensure public safety and security.  New technologies such as 
wireless telephones, Internet and cryptography are being used in 
both traditional and new types of criminal and terrorist 
activities.  The government is dealing with this issue. 
Protecting Canada's critical infrastructure is a vital issue, and 
we are addressing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to working to develop the best 
possible options to ensure public safety and security, but in 
addition to being safe Canadians need to feel that their security 
agencies are working well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has arguably the best and most effective review and 
accountability framework in the world in the security 
intelligence sector.  The Security Intelligence Review Committee, 
an arm's length review body, issues an annual report on CSIS 
operations that is tabled in parliament.  The inspector general 
of CSIS provides an additional level of security and ministers 
are directly responsible to parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee noted that the public and parliamentary awareness 
of the activities of our security intelligence agencies is 
essential in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SIRC's annual reports, this annual statement and the committee 
reports from the other place demonstrate important efforts to 
raise the knowledge and close involvement of parliament in the 
reviewing the security intelligence sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter the new millennium, Canadians need to know that 
their government is protecting them and their national interests. 
I am pleased to note that the special committee recognized the 
significant progress made to improve our counterterrorism 
readiness and threat assessment capability.  The chair and 
members of the committee should be congratulated on their hard 
work and on a report that highlights a number of important 
national security issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, our security intelligence and police forces face 
many new challenges as we enter the new millennium.  CSIS, the 
RCMP and other federal agencies are working around the clock to 
preserve public safety.  I can assure the House that the 
government will continue to support them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as the solicitor general critic for Her Majesty's Official 
Opposition I find it very interesting to listen to the solicitor 
general's report to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He reported on December 3, 1998.  At that time I said that 
criminals involved in organized crime have successfully landed in 
Canada without any opposition due to our lax immigration policy 
and inadequate screening.  Organized crime with foreign origins 
poses a serious threat in many metropolitan areas of Canada, 
particularly on the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The danger imposed by modern day organized crime is a serious 
and destructive force.  It imperils the security of our citizens 
and our nation.  This threat attacks us on our streets, in our 
businesses and in our schoolyards.  Organized crime is a threat 
to our economic sovereignty because the cost of organized crime 
in our society is astronomical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The counterattack will require additional resources, legislation 
and co-operation provincially, federally and internationally. 
Canada cannot afford the continuing lip service the government is 
providing to the problem.  We need resources.  We need action. 
We need it now.  Canadians will feel safe and confident only when 
these resources are committed to this attack.  Crime is 
organized. So should government efforts be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were my words exactly a year ago.  Unfortunately the words 
of the solicitor general today belie what has happened in the 
intervening period of time.  We have discovered in the 
intervening year that in the early 1990s there was a compromise 
of CAIPS, the computer system in our Hong Kong office. This led 
to very free access to organized crime to be able to move its 
people into our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an RCMP review of the compromise of the CAIPS system 
which led to the Sidewinder project, a joint project of CSIS and 
the RCMP.  That project was making strong headway during the 
mid-1990s, right up to the point when CSIS decided not only to 
shut it down but to shred every piece of information that was in 
the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporal Robert Read, whom I brought to the attention of the 
solicitor general repeatedly in the House, did a review of the 
review of the project and arrived at some very bad conclusions. 
We also understand that in 1996 CSIS lost a disk of very highly 
classified information in a phone booth.  SIRC did the review the 
solicitor general has referred to in the House but interestingly 
the person who found the disk was never interviewed by SIRC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year there was a loss of a briefcase by one of the 
operatives of CSIS.  The CSIS director informed the solicitor 
general but the solicitor general, in his questionable wisdom, 
did not inform SIRC that would be responsible for reviewing the 
entire disastrous affair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the legislative front I quote the minister on December 3, 
1998 when he said “Early in the new year, 1999, the government 
will introduce legislation to curb money laundering”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not happen early in 1999.  In fact it happened in May 
1999, but due to the agenda of the government that legislation 
ended up dying on the order paper.  This vital legislation that 
was supposed to have been introduced, according to the words of 
the solicitor general, in early 1999 was finally reintroduced for 
passage by the House on December 15.  December 15, I remind the 
solicitor general, is not early 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He tells us he is spending $15 million to put 100 officers at 
international airports.  That is terrific except that the 
province of British Columbia alone has a shortage of 500 members 
at this point.  His $15 million for 100 officers at airports is 
very shallow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have traditions in the House.  For example, a meaningful 
tradition is when the mace is brought into the House by the 
Sergeant-at-Arms, followed by the Speaker.  This is to say that 
the people of Canada have given authority to the House to do 
something.  That is a meaningful tradition.  What I am talking 
about now is a meaningless tradition.  The meaningless tradition 
of this and previous Liberal solicitor generals with statements 
that are vacuous, meaningless mumblings simply form part of the 
tradition.  Those are my comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe I am entitled to say today that, with the exception of 
the Department of Intergovernmental Affairs, the department that 
is the most topsy-turvy, the one that is in the most turmoil and 
surrounded with the most controversy, the most disliked, is the 
Department of the Solicitor General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reporting to the solicitor general, in addition to the 
department itself, are the RCMP, Correctional Services Canada, 
the National Parole Board, CSIS, the Office of the Correctional 
Investigator, the RCMP External Review Committee and the RCMP 
Public Complaints Commission.  Out of all these, is there any 
one that is operating properly?  One wonders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What, for example, is going on with our secret agents?  How can 
our secret agents be losing documents by having their cars 
broken into or by leaving them in phone booths? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could students end up being pepper sprayed during Suharto's 
visit to Canada?  How can prisoners find it so easy to escape? 
How can there still be drug dealing inside our prisons?  What 
about the mess within the National Parole Board, whose board 
members themselves, duly appointed by this government, are 
telling us that a major cleanup is needed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that the auditor general, in his most recent report of 
November 1999, is still obliged to call the RCMP Public 
Complaints Commission to task, as well as the Office of the 
Correctional Investigator.  He comments, moreover: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—both inmates and Correctional Service staff still misunderstand 
the role of the Office. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a budget of $1.8 million, one might have expected inmates 
and staff to at least know what this office does on their 
behalf.  It seems to me that things are far from clear.  This 
leads me to conclude that the government is not all that clear 
in its supposed search for clarity.  Hon. members will realize 
what I am getting at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example of a clause that illustrates my point. I 
will read the whole thing and it will not be over until I say 
end of sentence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. (1) Where the government of a province, following a referendum 
relating to the secession of the province from Canada, seeks to 
enter into negotiations on the terms of which that province 
might cease to be part of Canada, the House of Commons shall, 
except where it has determined pursuant to section 1 that a 
referendum question is not clear, consider and, by resolution, 
set out its determination on whether, in the circumstances, 
there has been a clear expression of a will by a clear majority 
of the population of that province that the province cease to be 
part of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this is a single sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will have noticed that in that one sentence, the word 
clear or its derivatives is used four times. I say or its 
derivatives, because the term déclaré in French is a derivative 
of the word clair, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consulted a French etymological dictionary to find out if this 
was indeed the case. I found the dictionary of Jacqueline 
Picoche here, in the Library of Parliament. Ms. Picoche is a 
grammar research associate and has a doctorate in literature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the word clear, we see that it has two origins, a 
Greek one and a Latin one. Which is most appropriate in the 
present case? That is the question, but I am inclined to say the 
Latin one. However, I would rather rely on Ms. Picoche who tells 
us that in Greek, the origin is kalein—and now I need my 
glasses—the derivative is parakalein: to call for help, hence the 
word paraklêtos which means lawyer, protector, comforter, 
intercessor. There is also another derivative, ekklêsia, 
assembly by convocation, then congregation of the faithful and 
the place where that assembly meets, hence the adjective 
ekklêsiastikos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Latin root is calare, to proclaim, convoke, from which is 
derived intercalare, to proclaim an additional day or month to 
compensate for the discrepancies in the ancient Roman calendar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The verb calare must have had a variation, calere, from which is 
derived calendàe, first day of the month, and in turn 
calendarium, agenda.  And, in low Latin, calendar must have been 
a feminine, plural, verbal adjective in noun form; its root cal 
appearing as cil when combined with other roots, producing 
concilium derived from concalium, convocation or assembly, from 
which is formed conciliabulum, meeting place, and the verbs 
conciliare and reconciliare, to gather and to reconcile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The verb calare is combined with the archaic agent word calator, 
which appears in classical Latin as the second element, in a 
diminutive form, in nomenclàtor, a slave whose job it was to 
remind his Roman master of the names of his clients at meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have other derivatives, such as clamare, to shout, from 
which is derived clamor, as well as clamoris, shouting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are signalling that I have only one minute 
left.  But I cannot explain all this all this in one minute; it 
is not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to mention verbs like dêclamare, to speak 
aloud; exclamare, to exclaim; proclamare, to plead loudly; 
reclamare, to cry out in indignation.  Then there is clarus, 
clear or illustrious, an adjective that must have been used 
originally to describe the voice or sounds and have meant suited 
to call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also families of words such as the clarus family, 
which also includes the word clarine, a bell for livestock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with clarifier, or clarify, which means to make 
clear.  I hope I have been clear enough myself and that, from 
now on, in the House things will be unassailably clear.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask to share my time with my Bloc colleague. 
We have been talking a lot about clarity in the last number of 
days.  One thing is very clear and that is this is probably the 
most poorly written and vacuous report we have ever received from 
the solicitor general's department.  We do know one thing— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The Chair is having great 
difficulty hearing what the hon. 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has to say. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope hon. members can contain themselves.  I know everyone 
will want to hear his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one thing is very clear. 
There is an astronomical void in the solicitor general's 
department and it begins at the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This document indicates quite clearly that the department is on 
complete auto pilot.  We see meaningless comments littered 
throughout this document with respect to the priorities of the 
government and the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that cost cutting is the actual priority of the 
department.  Although we hear time and time again about public 
safety being the number one priority, it has become clear that it 
does not even appear to rank in the top 10 when we look at this 
document and what is being done by the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a place in society for private security, but private 
security should certainly not be replacing our police forces. 
This seems to be a direction in which the department is headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tabling of responses often comes after the fact, as we have 
seen in the case of leaked information in 1996 when a CSIS agent 
left sensitive CSIS documents on a disk in a phone booth.  Almost 
two years later a report was filed.  This report is even less 
relevant than the report filed on that lost information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the more recent leak that occurred at a hockey game in 
Toronto, I would think the solicitor general would be prepared to 
stand in his place to say “The puck stops here.  I am head of 
this department.  I will get to the bottom of this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it took almost a month before there was any action 
by the department.  There was no action whatsoever against the 
director of CSIS who was complicit with the solicitor general in 
keeping this information from SIRC, the watchdog that is supposed 
to oversee the actions of CSIS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That information came to the attention of the head of SIRC 
through no other source than the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, which 
belays again the fact that quite clearly these very 
interconnected and supposedly co-operative departments are not 
co-operating at all.  In fact they are operating in little 
fiefdoms separate from one another in an effort perhaps to try to 
compete for scarce resources.  Perhaps they simply do not 
communicate because they are not getting any direction from the 
head of the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general was armed with the information of the leak 
and chose not to pass that on to the head of SIRC.  We know that 
he did not even pass it on to the Prime Minister although the 
Prime Minister was overseas and making comments about this not 
being a serious matter, that he was not too concerned about it, 
and that it was something that should not preoccupy Canadians. 
Yet he did not even have the information from the solicitor 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolutely shocking revelation that this is going on at 
a time when we know that our borders and our coastlines are being 
inundated with the entrance of illegal immigrants and that 
organized crime is on the rise in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to a member of the RCMP from Montreal very recently who 
was involved in internal operations.  He told me that there has 
been a doubling of clubhouses of Hell's Angels in and around the 
city of Montreal in the past six months. 
We know that on both coasts the same is happening.  The Russian 
Mafia, the Asian Mafia and our age old motorcycle gangs are all 
on the rise.  All this is going on and the solicitor general 
persists in contemplating cuts to detachments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that for a period of time on his watch our national 
training facility in Saskatchewan was closed.  Very recently we 
had the rights of RCMP advertising turned backed over from the 
Disney corporation.  The government is running this most serious 
and necessary department like a Mickey Mouse operation, so it is 
very ironic that Disney held the rights to the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the solicitor general do today?  He comes before the 
House and tables a report that is littered with meaningless 
platitudes.  A grade nine student could have come up with a 
better document to set out the current situation within our 
national security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general took great licence with the word 
“immediately” when he spoke of the theft of the documents from 
a car outside a hockey rink in Toronto.  He told the House that 
he had informed the director of his department immediately. Weeks 
had gone by before the matter was even brought before the House, 
and it was not brought about because the solicitor general took 
any action whatsoever.  Why were CSIS and and SIRC not brought to 
task over their handling of this?  Serious communication 
breakdowns occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the RCMP and CSIS do not communicate well already. 
Obviously the solicitor general does not communicate well with 
his own department or with the prime minister.  We saw the worst 
breach of national security in 15 years.  Obviously our partners 
outside our borders, MI5, the CIA, the FBI and other national 
security agencies, are looking at Canada right now with a very 
jaded view as a result of the way we have handled matters in the 
last six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will we get some accountability and some responsibility 
from this department and particularly this minister?  It is 
obvious that the shortcomings of CSIS senior managers were seen 
directly without the discovery of the mishaps.  Yet the CSIS 
director has had no accounting and has never appeared before a 
parliamentary committee with any substance.  In fact when he does 
come, he folds his arms and says “Gee, I would like to tell you 
more but I would have to kill you”.  This is the attitude and 
the type of response we get from the director of national 
security to members of the House who are elected to serve the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former CSIS chief of strategic planning criticized the way 
the matter was being handled by the government.  This department 
and this office are on complete auto pilot.  This latest fiasco 
is an international embarrassment.  There is no mention 
whatsoever in this document, not even an acknowledgement, that 
there are problems within the department.  This document 
completely betrays the fact that this department is out of 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSIS and the RCMP in particular have had their budgets cut to 
ribbons by the government.  Agents and officers are working 
overtime and working with extremely large workloads.  The 
<I>National Post</I> reported that this was the fourth time in the 
last four years that CSIS and the RCMP had lost documents as a 
result of who knows what. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are worried about personal and national security. They 
should get little solace or little comfort from the document 
tabled today by the solicitor general and his hollow, meaningless 
comments in this regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to follow the comments of my hon. colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, who I think stated the case 
quite eloquently as to the problems with this report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught in a university for a little while.  When students did 
not have a whole lot to say, there were a few tricks they would 
use.  They would take their paper and double space it, increase 
the size of the font and pass it in, thinking that maybe they 
could trick the teacher into thinking there was something of 
substance there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the solicitor general has learned the same trick, 
because what we have presented to us today is a seven page 
statement on national security that for the most part is full of 
rhetoric.  If we want to contrast the progress of the government 
we should contrast it with the statement from last year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about some of the things the solicitor general said 
in his statement last year.  He talked about how one shipment of 
heroin landed successfully in Canada could lead to numerous 
deaths and human suffering in cities like Vancouver.  My 
colleague from Burnaby—Douglas is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What action have we seen taken to stop the importation of drugs 
into cities like Vancouver?  Absolutely nothing.  It has come to 
the point where my colleague who represents Vancouver East has 
had to stand in the House to talk about the way the drug trade in 
heroin is wide open like an old fashioned farmers market in the 
city of Vancouver.  Although the government recognized the 
problem a year ago, not a single thing has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what else was in the report from last year.  Last 
year the solicitor general talked about creating a seamless net 
against organized crime.  The seamless net has some pretty big 
holes in it, because this year we know of recent arrests and that 
a major organized crime ring dealing in bank and credit card 
fraud has been exposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are Canadians expected to feel secure when the ports on both 
coasts and the border along the United States are not safe from 
organized crime?  We know this is happening because even with its 
limited resources the RCMP has exposed rings that are using debit 
cards in fraud and are importing drugs into cities like Vancouver 
and Halifax.  My colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough 
has mentioned the motorcycle gangs that have increased in cities 
like Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to personal safety Canadians have every right to 
be concerned.  When it comes to combating organized crime the 
people who live along our borders and coasts have every right to 
ask the government what measures it has taken to protect them. In 
reality, the measures taken have been to cut and gut the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from Kamloops, Regina and Burnaby have had to 
stand in the House to pressure and plead with the solicitor 
general to ensure that programs in Regina like the training 
centre for the RCMP not be shut down.  My colleagues from Burnaby 
and Kamloops have had to stand in the House to plead for 
additional funding so their communities could have some RCMP 
presence where there are perhaps one or two for thousands of 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the government calls a statement on national 
security.  National security is in real trouble.  I made the 
point two years ago that the disbandment of the ports police 
would lead to an infestation of drugs on either side of the 
country through the ports.  Cutting the RCMP, disbanding the 
ports police, and leaving it to our customs officers who have 
also been gutted in the government's race to build a surplus to 
try to deal with a sophisticated and powerful international 
network of organized crime just does not cut it.  It does not cut 
it for the Canadians who live in Montreal, Halifax, Vancouver, 
Burnaby, Windsor, or anywhere along the border with the United 
States where we know that organized crime is winning the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose I thank the solicitor general for tabling his report. 
However, as I said, sometimes I would get such papers when I was 
teaching in university and unfortunately with the double spacing, 
the large font and because it does not say much, it would get a 
failing grade.  At this point I think that is what Canadian 
citizens would have to give the government.

the third time since I have become a member of parliament.  I 
would like to thank the member for Lakeland for seconding my 
firearms law sunset act.  I would also like to thank Canadians 
from coast to coast, right across Canada, who have supported this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last 20 years government has established an unimpressive 
track record of passing costly, ineffective gun control laws. 
When its ineffective laws do not reduce the criminal use of 
firearms, it passes more ineffective gun control laws.

guarantees that scarce tax dollars will only be spent on gun 
control measures that actually work.  My sunset law would require 
the automatic repeal of any gun control measure after five years

safety test administered by the Auditor General of Canada which 
proves the measure is cost effective in achieving its stated 
objective.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What programs are currently available to provide assistance to 
fruit growers converting their old tree stock to new varieties? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-food, Lib.):</B>  The farm improvement and Marketing 
Cooperatives Loans Act, FIMCLA, can provide assistance to fruit 
growers with the purchase and planting of fruit trees for new 
varieties. Conditions of the loan are summarized as follows: the 
maximum term is ten years; the cost of loan is either prime rate 
plus 1% or at a fixed rate equal to the residential mortgage rate 
plus 1%; loans must not exceed 80% of the value of the asset 
being financed; the maximum loan is $250,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fruit growers can plant now, pay later through an FCC loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm Credit Corporation, FCC, has expanded the plant now pay 
later loan to include all fruit and berry varieties grown for 
commercial production across Canada. This unique loan was 
originally introduced in 1996 to help vineyard expansion projects 
in Ontario and British Columbia. Fruit growers can use the loan 
to renovate or expand orchards, vineyards, berry farms or other 
types of production that take several years to yield a comercial 
crop. The loan allows clients to better manage their cash flow. 
It offers flexible terms and conditions to match production 
cycles and an amortization period that matches the life cycle of 
farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repayment options include total payment deferral for up to three 
years or interest only payments for the first five years. With the 
deferral option, no payments are required in the first three 
growing seasons including the replant year. Interest that accrues 
during this period is capitalized at the end of the third growing 
season. in year four, an interest only payment is made and in 
year five blended payments begin with up to 20 years to repay. 
For example, a loan of $25,000 accrues approximately $5,000 of 
interest in three years. Thus at the end of three years, the loan 
becomes $30,000. Payments are then based on this loan amount and 
may be made annually. The loan covers all planting costs 
including the costs of drainage, land improvement, plants, 
planting costs, trellising, irrigation and maintenance in the 
first three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those eligible for the loan include producers of grapes, apples 
and pears, tender fruit trees, including peaches, nectarines, 
apricots, cherries and plums, and all berries, including 
rasberries, blueberries, saskatoon berries and cranberries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plant now pay later loan was initiated through consultation 
with primary producers and agricultural groups to develop an 
innovative lending product that addresses specific financing 
needs.

documents. The Department of Justice does not keep specific 
statistics on the number of federal laws that have been 
challenged in the courts for alleged violation of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms since 1982. For example, to

Under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 1982-88” (1990), 28 
Alta L. Rev. 396 to be of particular interest. The article 
assesses the effect of the charter on federal and provincial 
legislation and analyses all reported federal and provincial 
appellate decisions between 1982-88 in which a statute was 
declared wholly or partially invalid due to a charter violation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Since its inception in 1978, the scope and mandate of the 
court challenges program has evolved significantly. Originally 
established to fund test cases on constitutionally protected 
language rights, the program today covers charter equality based 
challenges of legislation, programs and policies of the federal 
government as well as federal and provincial legislation, 
policies and programs involving constitutionally protected 
language rights. The program has been administered at arm's 
length from government by five consecutive managing 
organizations. By negotiated agreement, the closed files were 
sealed and sent to Public Archives and cannot be accessed by 
government. As a consequence, except for illustrative individual 
cases incorporated in the court challenges program annual 
reports, it is impossible to identify court cases that received 
financial assistance from the program. Those annual reports are 
public and can be found in public libraries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) Since it is not possible to identify individual cases having 
received financial assistance from the court challenges program, 
one can only speculate on the effective impact of such funding on 
the jurisprudence trend in the areas of linguistic and equality 
rights. The evaluation report of the program for the period 
1994-97 presents the most comprehensive assessment of impact for 
the review period and very few court cases are identified in its 
pages. To obtain a copy of this report, write to the Department 
of Canadian Heritage at 15 Eddy Street, Hull, Quebec K1A 0M5 or

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan—King—Aurora, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 11 years ago when I was first elected, the then Leader 
of the Official Opposition told me that I should spend the first 
few years of my political career listening to the people of 
Canada, travelling the country region by region, understanding 
the issues and appreciating the diversity of opinion which is 
expressed daily throughout our country.  For the past 11 years I 
have done just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been across the country many times and have spoken with 
thousands of Canadians from every region and every walk of life. 
For me it has been a continuous national dialogue.  In fact, it 
is their stories and their voices that have inspired me to make a 
long term commitment to a larger cause, that is, preserving the 
hope of Canadians that tomorrow can indeed be better than today 
and more important, that we all have an obligation to make it so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we prepare to welcome in a new century, there is much to 
celebrate about Canada.  We have shown the world how to balance 
freedom with compassion and tradition with innovation, how to 
provide health care to all our citizens and how to treat our 
senior citizens with the respect and dignity they deserve. 
In a world darkened by conflicts that literally tear nations 
apart, our country has stood as an example of how people of 
different cultural backgrounds can live and work together in 
harmony.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question in my mind that Canada's greatest strength 
is in fact her people, the people who have settled and developed 
this country.  Thanks to their imagination and determination, 
Canada has always moved forward, going from being an agrarian 
society to a leading industrial power during and after the second 
world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country has continued to push ahead with innovation in the 
years since, capturing leadership positions in such areas as 
telecommunications, aerospace and information technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this does not mean that we have not had our challenges, 
but what it does mean is that every time we have been challenged 
as a country the people of Canada have risen to the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not long ago that the international community doubted our 
ability to remain a player in the global economy.  I am sure we 
all remember in the House in 1994 when the <I>Wall Street 
Journal</I> compared us to a third world economy.  We as Canadians 
could have given up, but we did not.  That is not the Canadian 
way.  Instead, we rolled up our sleeves and we turned our country 
around.  We made an impressive comeback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have the best fiscal health of the G-7.  We have 
eliminated a $42 billion deficit.  We have balanced our books. 
We are paying down our public debt.  We have begun to lower 
taxes. Our inflation rate is the lowest since the 1960s.  Our 
interest rates are also the lowest in decades and, thanks to a 
dynamic private sector, over 1.7 million jobs have been created 
since the government took office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a difference six years have made.  Recently the 
<I>Financial Times</I> of London referred to Canada as the top dog 
of the G-7.  We are doing much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new global economy there is really not too much time to 
stop and congratulate ourselves on our success.  Canadians know 
that.  That is why they want an agenda that will see them enjoy 
more opportunity, a higher standard of living and an even better 
quality of life in the new century.  In order to achieve all 
this, however, we need a clear vision for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt in my mind that Canada stands at the threshold 
of a new century.  Within a few days our nation will enter a new 
era, a new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fall marked the sixth time that the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Finance sought the advice of Canadians in 
advance of the federal budget.  It was the third time that I 
participated as chair of the committee.  In a very short time I 
have seen the mood of the country and Canadians change, becoming 
increasingly optimistic about the prospects of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee's report, entitled “Budget 2000—New Era—New 
Plan”, is the result of our continuing conversations with 
Canadians, a national dialogue that has helped us to understand 
our fellow citizens' values and priorities and how the federal 
budget should reflect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want an agenda that will see them enjoy more 
opportunities, a higher standard of living.  In order to achieve 
all this we have put together, through our prebudget consultation 
report, a road map that will in fact achieve this vision.  This 
plan fosters sound financial management, promotes economic growth 
and a better standard of living by cutting taxes, makes our 
economy more competitive and ensures that Canadians will enjoy 
greater security and expanded opportunities.  It is my hope that 
this plan will inspire Canadians to confidently believe that 
indeed tomorrow can be better than today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While conducting our prebudget consultation the finance 
committee heard from a broad range of witnesses.  We listened to 
organizations representing businesses, children, industry, arts, 
culture and farmers. 
We heard from educators, health care workers, economists and 
individual municipalities.  We reached out to every single 
section of this great country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee crossed Canada and spoke with advocates who said 
that we need greater support for the homeless, public 
transportation and research and development.  Very importantly, 
we met with individual Canadians from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I really ought to be thanking the members of 
parliament who held town hall meetings across the country and who 
took the time to listen to their constituents, as well as the 
members of the committee who worked very hard to put the report 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say that I firmly believe that this report 
clearly reflects the values and priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are very happy with the fact that we have ended an era 
of skyrocketing deficits and public debt for good, that we have 
brought down back to back balanced budgets for the first time 
since 1951-52, and that we have put the debt to GDP ratio on a 
permanent downward track.  The fiscal turnaround, coupled with 
low inflation and interest rates, has really helped this country 
to create over 1.7 million jobs and to bring back prosperity to 
the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also very strong support for measures taken by the 
government, whether we are referring to the $16.5 billion tax cut 
that was introduced or the investments we have made in innovation 
and skills development through the Canada foundation for 
innovation and the Canada millennium scholarship fund.  There was 
also very strong support from the people of Canada for the extra 
commitment made by the government to provide an additional $11.5 
billion over five years to the provinces and territories 
specifically for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues that was raised often and was strongly 
supported was the national child benefit, not to mention the 
appreciation of Canadians for the government modernizing the 
employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee is committed to making sure that we are never 
going to let the nation's finances get out of control again.  We 
will keep the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also introduced a multi-year plan for tax 
reduction, which I will elaborate later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of government is to continue to create opportunities 
for Canadians, to access foreign markets and to promote Canada as 
an ideal place in which to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada also called for further investment for 
lifelong learning to continue to build the most highly skilled 
workforce in the world, and that is one of the greatest 
advantages that this country has in the knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about an issue that is extremely important to the 
people of Canada, that is, the issue of health care.  In the 1999 
budget, as I said earlier, the government made the largest single 
new investment since coming to office by committing $11.5 billion 
over five years.  As well, the Prime Minister chaired the 
national forum on health and implemented key recommendations of 
the forum, including the health transition fund, the Canada 
health information service, the community action program for 
children and the Canada prenatal nutrition program.  These 
programs and the balanced approach by the government to these 
issues were also applauded by the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest resources a country has is its 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the thrust of the Canada opportunities strategy, a 
comprehensive plan to provide Canadians with greater and more 
affordable access to education and skills, the millennium 
scholarship fund, the tax relief on interest payments on student 
loans, the Canada education savings grant, the work done on 
SchoolNet, which has connected every public school and library in 
Canada to the Internet, the first nation in the world to 
accomplish this, the community access program, which will have 
public Internet sites connected to 10,000 rural and urban sites 
by the year 2000, and computers for schools, whose goal is to 
provide 250,000 computers for Canadian schools by the year 2000, 
which is 60% complete.  These measures taken by the government 
have certainly been welcomed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of children and families came up during the prebudget 
consultation hearings.  There was support for the national child 
benefit.  Many referred to it as the most innovative of national 
social programs in this generation.  Many other projects like the 
aboriginal head start initiative, the Canadian prenatal nutrition 
program and the community action program for children were also 
supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put this debate in its proper context.  In my opening 
remarks I talked about a higher standard of living for Canadians. 
There is a responsibility on the part of government to use all of 
its levers to make sure that Canadians will enjoy a higher 
standard of living and a better quality of life in the new 
millennium.  It is important to have a well set and well thought 
out strategy to achieve these ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, as is reflected in the prebudget consultation 
report “A new era—A new plan”, has those levers.  We as 
members of the committee ask the government to act on these 
particular issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to generate the type of wealth and the type of 
economic growth required to address all the social issues and 
challenges we heard about from coast to coast to coast, then 
there is no question in my mind that the only way we can do that 
is to put a plan together that speaks to the issue of improving 
the standard of living for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the components of this strategy?  Where should the 
government go to make sure that we as individual Canadians will 
enjoy a higher standard of living? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at fiscal and monetary policy.  If there is one area 
in which this government has done well, and about which we can 
say we are heading in the right direction, it is the area of 
fiscal and monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may ask why it is an important component of the 
finance committee's strategy to improve the standard of living 
for Canadians.  A stable macroeconomic environment with low 
inflation brings lower interest rates and boosts confidence.  It 
encourages investment, which enhances productivity growth and 
boosts employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that any government, here in Canada or abroad, 
must get those fundamentals right.  As we enjoy the low interest 
rates and the great boom we have had in employment growth, we 
must recognize that this is not something we do on a part time 
basis.  We must remain vigilant. 
We must make sure that the debt continues to go in a downward 
projection because it is very important not only for Canadians 
but people throughout the world to recognize that Canada has its 
economic fundamentals right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have been the accomplishments of the government?  The 
deficit has been eliminated.  We now have a surplus.  This is one 
of the major reasons we travelled across the country seeking 
input and asking Canadians what the priorities should be, what 
were their values as Canadians and where we should make 
investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier the debt to GDP ratio is clearly on a 
downward path.  It is also important to note that provinces have 
had substantial fiscal progress in the past five years, not to 
mention that we are benefiting from the low inflation of the 
1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean to everyday Canadians?  When Canadians 
renewed their mortgages they understood the actual meaning.  They 
understood the difference between the theory of fiscal 
responsibility and the practice.  Throughout the country people 
are happy with the fact that they are finally regaining some 
financial freedom to make decisions that are right for them and 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another lever the federal government has to deal with is the 
issue of taxation policy.  Everywhere we went throughout the 
country, whether I was talking with someone in a coffee shop or 
at my local parish or visiting workers in factories it did not 
matter to whomever I spoke.  Canadians want tax cuts and 
Canadians deserve tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  It is because Canadians have worked very hard for 
a number of years to defeat the deficit.  It is thanks to the 
hard work of Canadians that today we enjoy a surplus.  It is 
right for the federal government to help Canadians restore some 
of their lost disposable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the exception of the past two or three years during which 
people have begun to feel the impact of federal government 
policies, they have seen their incomes go up.  It is also 
important to note that for the past 10 years the average 
disposable income in Canada has gone down.  It is our 
responsibility as members of the House, trusted legislators of 
the country, to restore some of that disposable income so 
Canadians can begin to understand that their sacrifices are 
rewarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax policy in a country that is dedicated to improving the 
standard of living of people is extremely important.  Taxes can 
affect the allocation of resources and alter the incentives to 
work, to save and to invest.  I emphasize this point because it 
is part of the $46 billion tax cut plan the finance committee 
tabled in the House of Commons. 
It is important to understand the components of the plan because 
they take into consideration that tax cuts should not only cater 
to a section of Canadian society.  Tax cuts belong to all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the finance committee that is reflecting the needs, 
desires and aspirations of Canadians say about tax cuts?  The 
first measure was to increase the basic and spousal amounts by 
15%, raising the limit to $8,200.  That is the amount of money 
people can earn tax free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this news so great for Canadians?  It is because over 
half a million people will not be paying taxes any more.  They 
will be off the tax rolls as a result of this measure.  Is that 
important?  It is.  I have spoken to those individuals who are 
paying taxes on relatively low incomes.  It is not who says what 
that really makes the difference.  We have to do what is right 
for the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we increase the thresholds by 15%, when we increase them 
from $29,000 to $34,000 and $60,000 to $68,000, what are we 
doing?  In technical terms we are compensating for inflation.  We 
are reducing marginal tax rates.  We are reducing the one 
earner-two earner tax disparity.  What is really important is 
that it is fair.  Canadians will benefit from it.  Canadians will 
have more money in their pockets to realize their dreams and 
their families dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also appreciate that if they work hard, take risks and make 
the necessary effort in a country like Canada then they will be 
rewarded.  When this type of philosophy takes hold and when 
governments reflect the thrust of the argument I have outlined, I 
sense that there will be energy within the people of Canada to 
become more entrepreneurial and take greater risks because they 
know they will be rewarded for their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many speeches in the House we talk about Canada's hard 
working middle class.  We have to put our words into action.  For 
this reason the finance committee recommended that we reduce the 
middle tax rate by three percentage points to 23% over the next 
five years.  This will lower the taxes paid by middle income 
Canadians.  This point has been raised in every town hall meeting 
that members of parliament have held across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also eliminate the 5% surtax by gradually increasing the 
threshold.  Why does the finance committee want the surtax to be 
eliminated?  There can be tax reform and tax cuts but in this 
case it is also the issue of governance.  The surtax was 
introduced when we were in a deficit position. 
Now that we have a balanced budget, now that we have a surplus, 
we as legislators must get rid of the surtax because it makes 
great economic sense but it is also a question of governance, of 
acting on a promise that was made.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Families and children are very important to the social and 
economic fibre of the country.  Any budget that does not address 
this issue would fail.  It is for this reason that the finance 
committee once again made a recommendation which would lower over 
a five year period the CTB phaseout rate by one-half to 2.5% for 
families with more than one child and 1.25% for families with one 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is kind of a technical version of this recommendation. What 
this means in real life is that more families will be helped to 
raise their children, that more families will have greater 
disposable income to do what they need to do.  They will have 
more disposable income to get ahead and to make the personal wise 
investments they need to make.

talking about the personal side—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
point of order. Unless I am mistaken, Standing Order 43 relating 
to the process of debate states that the first person speaking 
for the government—if he is the Prime Minister—the Leader of the 
Opposition, a minister moving a government order, and the member 
speaking in reply immediately after such a minister have no time 
limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I can tell, the hon. member across the floor is not 
the Prime Minister, nor the Leader of the Opposition nor the 
minister proposing the motion, nor the member speaking in reply 
immediately after the minister, and thus ought not to be exempt 
from a time limit.  He should have 20 minutes like the rest of 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The point of order raised by the hon. member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is a very strict reading of Standing 
Order 43. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been the practice for many years in the House for the 
first person speaking on behalf of the government following the 
proposal of a motion to have unlimited time and the first member 
of the opposition speaking in reply to have similarly unlimited 
time.  That has been the invariable practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall having had that opportunity to speak, and accordingly 
the Chair has interpreted this as applying to the hon. member for 
Vaughan—King—Aurora who is the first member speaking on the 
motion following it being put by a minister who did not speak. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, even in the Projected Order of 
Business, Standing Order 43 is specified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If what is meant to guide us in the process of debate is 
obsolete, and tradition allows us to do the opposite of what it 
says, things are all wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have seen in the past, Standing Order 43 has applied 
when the speakers involved were the Prime Minister, the Leader 
of the Opposition, the minister making the motion or the member 
speaking in reply to the government. They had an unlimited 
amount of time but not an ordinary member of the House.  It is 
all very well that the member in question is the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Finance but that is not covered by the 
standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I can recall, this standing order has always been 
applied in relation to the work of the finance committee.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
For the Speaker's information and for members of the House, I 
remember very recently the Speaker ruling on another matter 
having to do with splitting speeches in the House.  At that time 
when he gave his ruling on that point, he did mention that 
convention will supersede the standing orders in longstanding 
practices and traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that might be something to consider in regard to this 
point as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has carefully 
considered the matter. I have had recourse to the Annotated 
Standing Orders of the House of Commons where, if hon. members 
looked, they would see it is stated quite clearly that in 
instances where the parliamentary secretary makes the first 
speech on behalf of the government, he or she has unlimited time, 
as well as the opposition member replying immediately thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that the hon. member is not the parliamentary 
secretary.  The difficulty with the position advanced by the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is that the member speaking 
immediately after the minister would be the hon. member for 
Vaughan—King—Aurora.  He would therefore have unlimited time on 
that guise if he were not the first person speaking for the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member would find himself in the position where the 
hon. member for Vaughan—King—Aurora would have unlimited time 
because he is the first person speaking in reply to the 
government, and then the opposition would not get a similar 
opportunity. In the opinion of the Chair, this is not the result 
that should obtain in this case.  In the opinion of the Chair, 
there should be two speeches of unlimited time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I feel that it is appropriate that even though the 
member is not the parliamentary secretary, it has been the 
practice consistently in the use of this rule that when a 
government motion is moved, the first person speaking has 
unlimited time, as does the second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Vaughan—King—Aurora is the first person 
speaking on the motion.  Accordingly, I believe the ruling that 
he has unlimited time is correct in the circumstances.  I 
propose, since we have already exceeded the 20 minutes by some 
measure, to allow him to complete his speech. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
I respect your decision, but if this is the case, it would be a 
good idea to amend Standing Order 43. If we adhere strictly to the 
standing orders but they begin to change the rules along the 
way, like they are trying to do with the bill to establish a 
framework for the Quebec referendum, then nothing makes sense 
any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I take note of the hon. member's suggestion. 
I hope he will make his suggestion to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. If the committee tables a report, 
changes will no doubt be made to the standing orders. This would 
be helpful to everyone. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua:</B> Mr. Speaker, I probably would 
have finished my speech by the time this decision was rendered 
but having said that, this is another case in point where 
Canada's productivity rate could have been helped if we had just 
got down to business instead of wasting a lot of time on that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to the point about the Canada tax benefit. 
I do not want to lose the opportunity to say that this particular 
measure will extend the number of families that will benefit from 
it. It will also bring in many more middle class families that 
have not been able to access the Canada child tax benefit.  This 
will literally help millions of families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of my comments this morning have dealt with the personal 
side of taxation.  We live in a globally competitive economy. 
Business, commerce, is very much a part of our everyday existence 
as a nation.  Budgets should also take into consideration the 
important role businesses play in our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason the finance committee for example would 
like to reduce EI premiums by 40 cents over four years.  At 
maturity this would be a $3.1 billion cut.  It will reduce the 
marginal tax rates.  It will reduce the amount of profit 
insensitive taxes faced by business.  Workers will also benefit 
from this cut. We need to begin with some profound reform of the 
business tax system and we say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also would like to increase the RRSP limit by a total of 
$2,000 over a five year period.  We want to lower the general 
corporate rate by five percentage points over five years. This 
will help restore tax neutrality.  It will provide our businesses 
with greater international competitiveness and it will stop 
penalizing new economy firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures in this tax package include increasing the 
foreign content from 20% to 30%.  This will increase returns to 
retirement savings at reduced risk.  We also want to lower the 
inclusion rate for donation of appreciable property which will 
promote charitable giving, consider expanding eligible properties 
for a lower inclusion rate, and as I said earlier, also work with 
the provinces to establish a common capital tax base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that I am very sensitive to the time I have taken 
thus far, I would like to say that this $46 billion tax cut 
package is clearly an indication to the people of Canada and the 
businesses of the country that this government, or this 
committee, is very serious about establishing a competitive tax 
regime, about rewarding Canadians for their effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only because I am mindful of the time, I will end now and say 
very simply that “Budget 2000—New Era, New Plan”, the report 
of the finance committee, is an excellent road map. I hope the 
Minister of Finance will seriously consider its elements.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise again and debate the issue of the prebudget 
report of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I stood and delivered a speech which I thought was my 
response to this issue but as it turned out, it was not. 
Nevertheless I am happy to be here again today to address some of 
the issues that my friend has raised and which are contained in 
the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point I want to make is the same one I made yesterday. 
The basis of the entire report is a faulty one. 
It is so glaring a contradiction it is almost surprising that my 
friend across the way and other Liberal members of parliament are 
able to stand in this place and make a spirited case for what 
they believe in.  It is that bold. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT26"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT26"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1210

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of the contradiction is that on the one hand the 
government is calling for a $46 billion in tax relief, which of 
course is laudable and the Reform Party completely and 
unequivocally supports that.  In fact we have championed tax 
relief for 12 years, ever since we came into being.  I am proud 
of that fact and I would like to think we have helped influence 
the government to start to think about these things. The 
contradiction is that on the one hand the government calls for 
tax relief of that scale, and on the other hand it says it will 
maintain its 50:50 spending promise, which means that 50% of any 
future surplus would go to new program spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot have it both ways.  It cannot have its 
cake and eat it too.  Government members cannot speak out of both 
sides of their mouths, but that is what they are trying valiantly 
to do. We cannot let them get away with that.  It is double-talk. 
That is all there is to it.  It is just an attempt to win over 
all the various constituencies at once, even though they are 
recommending things that are completely contradictory.  They 
cannot get away with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a pattern from the government.  We have seen it over and 
over again.  I would categorize it as Liberal rhetoric versus the 
Liberal record.  We see completely different things when we 
compare the record to the rhetoric. The Liberals speak on one 
level that is completely disconnected from the reality the rest 
of the country has to live with. It is as though they are in 
court somewhere completely cut off from the rest of the 
population.  I would suggest that is exactly the case.  I think 
it was reflected in the statement the member for 
Vaughan—King—Aurora just delivered in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to run through the Liberal record to underline what I 
have just said.  When we run through the bare facts, people will 
see very clearly that what my friend has just delivered here in 
the House was a lot of rhetoric. He can say all he wants about 
how he feels it is important to cut taxes, to be more productive 
as a country, to deal with the debt as an important issue and to 
re-allocate spending because we do not want to see money wasted 
on projects that are not important.  He can say those things, but 
if he never does anything about them, they are empty words.  They 
are hollow husks.  I submit that is exactly the case here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to run through some of the facts so that members in this 
place and people watching can draw their own conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend said that he wants to see tax relief and he has made 
an argument for that.  I remind members that the government has 
been in power for six years, that we have had a balanced budget 
for two and a half years going on to three years now, but still 
we have had no tax relief. I know my friends across the way will 
say that we have had tax relief.  It is simply not so.  Here are 
the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD in its reports that came out in June and September said 
that Canada must cut taxes, that taxes in Canada are growing with 
every passing day.  Three or four days before the finance 
minister delivered his fiscal and economic update in November, 
the economics branch of the Toronto Dominion Bank delivered a 
report.  It showed that the federal government today takes more 
money out of people's pockets than any federal government has 
ever taken in the history of Canada.  It showed an upward trend 
too. In fact that will be realized on January 1 when the 
government helps Canadians celebrate the new millennium with a 
tax hike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see the Canada pension plan taxes go up on January 1. 
We will also see income taxes go up because of bracket creep. 
Canadians will be poorer.  The federal coffers will be enriched. 
Unfortunately that is bad news for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It puts the lie to what we have heard in this place, which is 
that the government is somehow committed to lowering taxes.  It 
is completely the contrary. 
What we are seeing are taxes ever ramping upward.  That is a 
shameful fact, but it is a fact.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada today the average family spends more on taxes than it 
does on food, shelter and clothing.  That is the Liberal record 
versus the Liberal rhetoric.  It is a fact that in Canada today 
disposable income languishes.  It has barely grown since the 
recession of the 1990s and it is barely above where it stood in 
1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are paying a dear price for the high tax record of the 
government.  When it says that it wants to cut taxes, we know by 
its actions that tax cutting is very low on its priority list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the government's record on the debt.  In 
Canada today we have a debt of $577 billion.  That is a 
staggering amount of money, 64% of GDP, which is one of the 
highest levels of debt to GDP in the industrialized world, only 
behind Italy in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also point out that in Canada today the finance minister cuts 
a cheque for $40 billion a year to pay the interest on the debt. 
That $40 billion is by far the largest payment that the 
government makes of any kind.  Old age security is about $23 
billion or $24 billion a year.  That is our most expensive social 
program.  Of course, the transfers to the provinces for health 
care and education are much lower than that, certainly a lot 
lower after the government cut transfers dramatically.  They are 
around $15 billion a year, much lower than what we pay in 
interest on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of that is that Canadians have to pay a big chunk of 
their taxes toward the interest on the debt.  One would think 
that if the government truly was concerned about helping 
Canadians and ensuring the long term fiscal stability of the 
country that it would have some kind of plan to pay down the 
debt.  What is its plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan is that if there is any money left over after it has 
gone on its spending sprees, then it will pay down some debt.  We 
have the situation now where, after having run on paper what 
should have been big surpluses, the government has paid down $3 
billion one year and $3 billion another year toward the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that rate it will take approximately 190 years to deal with 
the problem of the debt.  I do not think Canadians want to wait 
that long.  I think they want to deal with this issue now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should take a look at what happened in 
Alberta, where the government poured billions upon billions of 
dollars into beating down a huge debt, the result being that it 
has one of the healthiest economies in Canada and in North 
America.  In Alberta we are seeing jobs created with every 
passing day.  People are coming from across the country to enjoy 
the fruits of the Alberta advantage.  It truly is a spectacular 
and amazing success story.  My friends across the way should pay 
attention because they would learn a tremendous amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends mentioned health care in Alberta.  I point out that 
even despite the big cuts of the federal government, which shut 
down hospitals across the country and forced people to recuperate 
in hallways, the Government of Alberta has actually raised its 
health care spending to record heights.  Alberta has never spent 
more money on health care than it spends today.  That is because 
of the dramatic improvement in the fiscal situation in the 
province of Alberta, due to the actions of the provincial 
government, not the actions of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the spending record of the government. 
Today in Canada, and this may surprise some people, according to 
the national accounts, all levels of government are spending more 
money per person than has ever been spent before.  That is a very 
important point to make because when we have the debate about 
what to do with the surplus that is coming our way, many people, 
including members of the Liberal government, say that we have to 
increase spending dramatically.  The government has the 50:50 
promise which, if enacted, and let us hope it does not keep this 
promise either, would mean $47 billion in new spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the headlines in the <I>National Post</I>.  Amazingly, 
that was the same number that the 50:50 formula would lead us to 
if it were ever enacted.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty-seven billion dollars in spending is a tremendous amount, 
but according to the national accounts for all levels of 
government, we have never spent more per person in Canada on 
program spending than we are spending today.  I would argue that 
Canada does not need more spending because we have never spent 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that relative to other countries in the world we spend a 
tremendous amount on programs of various kinds.  I would argue 
that if we have a big surplus coming our way and we have a 
tremendous debt burden and extraordinarily high taxes, then it 
makes sense to devote that money to lowering our debt and our tax 
burden.  To me that makes sense.  I do not see why we would need 
to go beyond the record high levels of spending in which we are 
already engaging.  Just because we are spending all that money 
does not mean we could not spend it a lot better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at how this government spends, one of the things 
that concerns me the most is its willingness to sacrifice 
necessary things to unnecessary things, or high priority things 
to low priority things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government insist upon spending billions of dollars 
in grants and subsidies for its political friends, while farmers, 
for instance, in the prairies are left wanting?  It makes no 
sense.  Why do my friends across the way insist on spending 
billions of dollars on empire building for huge bureaucracies 
that do not deliver any kind of service to the public, but which 
burn up all that money, when those funds could be used for good 
things like health care, education and restoring funding to 
defence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that on the one hand the government stands at 
every opportunity to take a bow for the work of our peacekeeping 
troops around the world, while on the other hand it punishes them 
by putting them into perilous situations without proper 
equipment.  That has to be the most hypocritical thing I have 
ever seen, but the government does it day after day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is profoundly wrong that the government cloaks itself in the 
proud heritage of the RCMP on the one hand, while on the other 
hand it deprives it of the basic tools it needs to do the job. We 
see more and more that investigations are being called off 
because of cost.  There is not enough money to finish the 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Kootenay—Columbia is constantly pointing 
these things out in the House of Commons, but sadly the 
government does not get the message.  It burns up billions of 
dollars in wasteful areas and at the same time deprives necessary 
programs of proper funding, which is fundamentally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone once said, those things that matter most should never 
be at the mercy of those things that matter least.  We should 
engrave that over the doorways of the offices of many federal 
departments because sadly that happens all too often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is more on Liberal rhetoric versus the Liberal record.  I 
want to talk about productivity.  My friend, the chair of the 
finance committee, gave an impassioned speech in this place about 
why we need to be more productive.  He said that the government 
is doing all kinds of things.  But consider this.  If the 
government is so concerned about productivity, why did the 
finance minister in his 1995 budget speech announce that he would 
be hiring all kinds of auditors to audit businesses across the 
country in order to scrape every nickel out of them, when they 
were trying desperately to simply make a go of it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Lakeland has raised the following issue in the 
past, and he knows it is a fact because he has constituents 
coming to him about it, as do I.  They tell us that they are 
being harassed by Revenue Canada.  People who have never had a 
problem with any kind of late payment are suddenly subject to 
incredible, ridiculous scrutiny by people from Revenue Canada, 
and they are tied up for days and days and weeks and weeks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about the chiropractor in Winnipeg who faced a negative 
judgment by the tax courts.  Revenue Canada's people swooped down 
on his home, even taking the cereal out of the cupboard.  They 
took his 12 year old son's award for heroism, which was given to 
him by the governor general.  That is the real record of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The case to which the hon. member refers has been dealt 
with by the courts and has been found to be untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is debate, not 
a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I assert that it is true. 
I would be happy to talk with my friend about it later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about productivity and helping business, we 
should consider the situation in Alberta of Mr. Nickerson.  Mr. 
Nickerson mortgaged his home and his farm to purchase a limousine 
from the United States, which he transformed and now calls the 
longhorn limo.  He brought the vehicle into Canada to rent it 
out.  He was making a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The limousine passed the Alberta transportation safety 
inspection standards with flying colours.  All of a sudden, the 
people at Transport Canada got wind that Mr. Nickerson had become 
a successful entrepreneur and they decided to impound his 
limousine.  They are not convinced that it will pass certain 
safety standards.  They will not tell him what the specific 
problem is.  In fact, the bureaucrat who made the decision, Mr. 
Boily, decided that he would impound the car without having seen 
it for himself and without providing any kind of detail on what 
exactly was the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man basically mortgaged his entire life savings for this 
business and now the government has snatched his dream away with 
absolutely no explanation.  Mr. Boily, who is 2,000 miles away, 
will go home tonight and sit down with his family for dinner.  It 
is no sweat off his nose.  But in Alberta, Mr. Nickerson has to 
live with friends because he has lost his business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the type of arbitrary, ridiculous regulation and 
bureaucracy that people in this country run into all too often. 
It is shameful that members across the way would sit and mock 
this situation.  It is shameful and they should be embarrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Program after program which the government brings forward 
retards productivity in Canada.  The Liberals talk about a 
productivity covenant.  Virtually all of what members on the 
other side do in some way gets in the way of business and making 
the country more productive.  Liberals find ways to build massive 
bureaucracies which take days, weeks and months to make decisions 
which people in the business world would make in a few minutes. 
That slows things down.  Is it any wonder we trail the United 
States when it comes to productivity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been pointed out by the Minister of Industry.  My 
friend across the way is heckling.  Let him heckle the Minister 
of Industry.  He has pointed to the fact that Canada is falling 
further and further behind the United States when it comes to 
productivity.  This means that our standard of living is falling 
as well.  Friends across the way know it.  They are upset.  I 
have obviously touched a very sensitive area.  They are very 
upset about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals are concerned they should talk to the Minister 
of Industry because he raised it first in this place.  The 
minister pointed out that if our standard of living and our rate 
of economic growth had stayed even with those of the United 
States over the last many years, the average family of four in 
Canada would have a standard of living $28,000 higher than it is 
today.  That is $7,000 a person. 
My friend across the way doubts it, but I invite him to talk to 
the industry minister because he raised it in this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the impact of all this horrible Liberal record on 
Canadians?  It is absolutely devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read into the record a couple of letters that I have 
received from people across the country who are concerned about 
where the government is going on the issue of taxes.  The first 
letter is from a gentleman from Clarenville, Newfoundland.  He 
writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand you were interested in how much taxes Canadians were 
paying.  Have a look at this.  I work at the oil refinery at 
Come-By-Chance, Newfoundland.  Last month there was an error in 
my paycheque due to a mix-up in the number of hours I had worked. 
When the mix-up was straightened out, payroll issued me a 
separate cheque to make up the difference.  They owed for eight 
hours regular time and sixteen hours overtime.  My gross pay came 
to $801.92.  There was $536.20 taken out for income tax and 
$10.42 for union dues.  My net pay was $255.30.  This is a tax 
rate of 67%. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite my friend over there, who thinks of himself as an 
expert on these things, to come and check the pay stub because he 
is welcome to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  One pay stub doesn't show the whole 
thing.  Tell the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Now, Mr. Speaker, they are justifying 
it by saying that one pay stub does not tell the story.  Over the 
course of a year, the hon. member knows what the story is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read another letter from a gentleman from Montrose, B.C. 
who writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have enclosed a copy of my two most recent pay stubs.  I think 
they stand as a good example of how high taxation rates in Canada 
can be a disincentive to productive workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unbelievable, and I know my friend across the way will 
heap scorn on it because it is profoundly embarrassing to his 
government, but I will read on. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the two week period ending November 5, 1999, I was paid 
for 40 hours work, while in the following period, I was paid for 
40.5 hours work, having put in a half hour overtime.  The half 
hour overtime increased my gross pay by $19.66.  Amazingly, this 
resulted in my federal income tax increasing by $20.13.  In 
effect, I paid (the Prime Minister) 47 cents for the privilege of 
working a half hour overtime. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is so incredible that one would think I am making it up. My 
friend can come over and examine the pay stub. He is so 
embarrassed his face is red with rage. I do not blame him.  I 
would be embarrassed if I was a Liberal as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that this is an anomaly caused by steps in the tax 
tables, but the very fact that a step could result in an apparent 
marginal tax rate of 102% tells me that our tax rates are too 
high.  As a resident of British Columbia with a good salary, my 
actual marginal tax rate is well over 50% and the pay stub is 
included. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be happy to table these letters in the House if my 
friend would like.  I will voluntarily table them for my friend 
and he can have a look at them and explore them all he wants.  I 
offer these to the Clerk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the hon. member 
for Medicine Hat requesting the unanimous consent of the House to 
table the documents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have the unanimous consent of the House to table the documents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it will be noted that the 
Liberal member for Provencher said “No, we won't allow that to 
be tabled in the House of Commons”, because they are so 
embarrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As the member for 
Medicine Hat is well aware, we do not refer to the absence or the 
presence of any specific member during debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Well, I am here, Mr. Speaker, and I 
hope that is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice to say that members across the way are profoundly 
embarrassed by their record of taxation and they should be.  Do 
members know why?  It is because people on the Liberal side of 
the House spend hours, days, weeks professing how much they care. 
They care so much. 
They care about the poor, the downtrodden and the middle class. 
My goodness, if words of concern were dollar bills, we would be 
millionaires.  We hear it every day from that side of the House. 
We saw it in the throne speech.  Oh, they care so much, but when 
it comes down to action, my God, they tax the hide off people. 
We see it every day.  We get these kinds of letters every day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of bracket creep, on January 1, 85,000 low income 
Canadians, who have never paid taxes in their life, will be 
dragged onto the tax rolls for the first time.  They will start 
paying taxes.  Six billion dollars a year is what this government 
takes from Canadians who have incomes of less than $20,000 a 
year. That is shameful.  It is shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should be embarrassed, especially when they get up 
and rant and rave about social justice and concern for the little 
guy.  No one should believe it.  Those are empty words that we 
hear over and over again from the people on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a better way of approaching this.  The very first thing 
that needs to be done is for them to quit pretending they care 
about cutting taxes.  They should admit that they have no 
intention of cutting taxes in a substantial way and that they 
will continue to spend because Liberals are tax and spend.  It 
seems to be something genetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we ultimately want to see in Canada is a government that is 
committed to cutting taxes, paying down debt and holding the line 
on spending.  We are already spending more than we have ever 
spent before.  We believe that is the real way to help people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a few words about how to help some of the people who 
my friends across the way say they care so much about.  How do we 
help people who do not have skills and who really are people who 
suffered over the last many years?  The most obvious way is to 
create so many jobs that we have three jobs chasing every person 
instead of the other way around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to get this economy roaring so that we regain the 
heritage that is ours, although unrealized over the last 
generation.  It is the heritage of an economy that is prospering 
so much that Canadians can go out, sometimes get jobs without 
many skills and be trained on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Provencher can heckle all he wants.  He can 
heckle and make fun of people on the low end of the income scale, 
but that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are looking for is an economy that booms to the point 
where if people do not have skills or perhaps have not finished 
school, they can get a job and learn those skills on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most amazing examples of how that can happen is what 
has happened in the boom in the United States in the last little 
while.  The United States has an unemployment rate of around 
4.1%.  Our rate is about 75% higher and 75% higher than our 
historical average.  We used to have an unemployment rate that 
was lower than the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening now in the United States is that many people, 
the ones who were often the last to benefit when something was 
going well in the economy, are benefiting in a tremendous way. 
The bottom 20% of the black community in the United States, in 
terms of income, has traditionally been a group that was left out 
whenever there was any kind of increase in prosperity. There is 
no question that they were a downtrodden group. Since the economy 
in the U.S. has taken off, because it has been unfettered to a 
big degree by the regulations and taxes that we still bear, the 
bottom 20% of that group has an unemployment rate of 6.9%, the 
same unemployment rate that we have in Canada.  These are the 
poorest of the poor in the United States.  These people, who 
often have little skills, are now getting jobs, experience, 
contacts and are regaining pride. In many cases, they have had to 
rely on welfare in the past, but that is no longer the case. They 
now have real hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we denying that to people in Canada?  There are many 
places in this country where unemployment is through the roof. 
Everyone is in the same boat in places like Newfoundland, Cape 
Breton, parts of Quebec, the northern regions, the inner cities 
and in parts of every province. 
We see it all over the place in Canada.  Why are we denying those 
opportunities to people who need it most in Canada?  We can do it 
here as well.  We do not have to be second cousins when it comes 
to economic prosperity.  We used to be the economic betters of 
the United States.  We have it within us to do that again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we accept this malaise that we see coming from the 
Liberal government, this mediocre approach to everything?  Why 
not cut taxes?  Why not get the economy booming again and put 
people back to work in droves?  Why not do that?  Mike Harris 
does it in Ontario.  They do it in Alberta.  Why will the Liberal 
government not do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation as legislators in the country to do what 
is right for Canadians. We are failing in that job.  The Liberal 
government has let people down.  I members across the way will 
not do it for themselves then they should do it for their 
children and grandchildren.  We have a moral obligation to leave 
the country better than we found it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to have a 10 minute question and answer period.  The 
government has probably been so damaged by this speech that it 
should have a right to question— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As I should not have

we are going to ignore that because it did not really happen.

<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this last debate on the prebudget 
consultations that have been going on since the beginning of 
this session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, I would like to thank the thousands of 
Quebecers who, in September and October, contributed to one of 
the largest democratic exercises undertaken by the Bloc 
Quebecois, over the past two years now, which was meeting 
Quebecers to ask for their opinions on the federal government's 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year in particular, we asked those whom we met all over 
Quebec the following question: How should the Minister of 
Finance use the huge surpluses that he generated at the expense 
of the unemployed, the sick, the students, the provinces and 
everyone, except itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also taking this opportunity to thank my leader, the member 
for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, for giving us the opportunity to meet 
our constituents and for having established a practice which, we 
hope, will continue in the future. Finally, I would like to 
thank my Bloc Quebecois colleagues for agreeing to take part in 
this excellent exercise and for making a brilliant presentation 
of the conclusions of these consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conclusions were collected in a synthesis report presented 
by the Bloc Quebecois, through its leader and its finance critic 
as well as the hon. member for Lévis, who took the opportunity 
to promote a shipbuilding policy. I just wanted to point this 
out to my fellow Quebecers that we delivered the goods by 
tabling about three weeks ago on their behalf a document that 
includes the consensus reached and their main priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I want to go over the Minister of Finance's 
estimates concerning the surpluses for the years to come. With 
this minister, we have gotten used to the way he fiddles with 
the real budget figures and his forecasts, first with regard to 
the deficit and then with regard to the surplus. He has made us 
very conservative, because his forecasts are very conservative, 
but he has shown us in the past that he can be incredibly 
secretive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often, he has even juggled the figures to prepare an extremely 
summary and fragmented table regarding the options available to 
the federal government in order to fight the poverty to which he 
himself has contributed since 1994 by drastically cutting our 
social programs and to support economic growth and job creation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance tells us in his economic update 
that he expects a $95 billion surplus to be accumulated in the 
next five years, the truth must be even more amazing. For this 
year alone, the minister expects a $5 billion surplus. When he 
comes up with these sorts of things, he shows little respect for 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's surplus for the first eight months of 
the current fiscal year is already $8 billion, that is $3 billion 
over the minister's forecast surplus for the whole of this year. 
We can expect that the surplus will easily top $12 billion this 
year. This is more then twice what the minister had forecast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That gives the government considerable leeway. As a matter of 
fact, we did not wait. In September and October of this year, we 
made our own projections regarding the current surplus, next 
year's surplus and the leeway that could develop as a result and 
be used to improve the Canadian economy and social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that, with part of this year's surplus and with next 
year's surplus, which we think will reach $15 billion, and with 
a tax reform, which would not take ten years but a few months to 
achieve, the minister could have $25 billion to play with in the 
next fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consulted the people regarding this possibility. 
Everywhere in Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois, through its members 
who work hard to defend Quebec's interests, has consulted 
Quebecers regarding these projections and the use of that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the main things on which people agree with regard to 
the use of this enormous amount of leeway the federal government 
has over the next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Quebecers have always believed—and they still do, as shown 
in the latest survey—it is essential that the Minister of Finance 
restore transfer payments to the provinces for health, higher 
education and income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is important to return to a true employment insurance 
plan, one that really helps the unemployed. 
There is almost complete unanimity that the EI plan has to be 
revamped, because it no longer covers all the people it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we were hoping that there would be promising projects for 
the financial and social economy.  We are thinking in particular 
of a real shipbuilding policy for Canada, which does not exist 
at the present time, the construction of social housing, and 
infrastructure programs, including highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we called for a real tax cut for low and middle income 
Canadians and Quebecers, not just window-dressing, but lasting 
tax reform that would permanently end the injustices that have 
hit middle income families particularly hard in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through these four points, one by one, comparing them 
with what the Liberal majority is proposing in its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the issue of social transfers.  As I mentioned, 
the consensus is clear that this is top on the priority list. 
Quebecers want the CHST restored.  It will take $3.7 billion 
annually, starting next fiscal, to return to the level of the 
transfer in 1993-94, before the Minister of Finance slashed the 
payments that are used to help fund health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I listened to the secretary of state say that cuts to 
provincial social transfer payments were a athing of the past. 
What hypocrisy, especially from the secretary of state.  I hope 
he has some idea of the figures.  If not, his incompetence is 
shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts announced by the Minister of Finance in 1994 are 
ongoing and will continue to apply until 2003. Up until now, the 
cumulative drastic cuts to education, health and income security 
total $21.4 billion. By the year 2003, since the cuts are ongoing 
and despite the fact that parts of the cuts were cancelled, 
federal transfers to the provinces for health care, education 
and income security will have been reduced by more than 
$30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a thing of the past. The cuts are still being made, 
but in an underhanded way. As members know, we have gotten used 
to the Minister of Finance's vile hypocrisy. He makes one 
announcement only, but the cuts he announces are good for seven 
or eight years, and he does not have to repeat them year after 
year.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so revolting is that, because of the drastic cuts made 
by our Minister of Finance, a shipowner and a millionaire, 
Quebec is out by $6.3 billion to pay for health care, higher 
education and income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes to $860 per Quebecer and 37% of all the cuts made in 
Canada. The Quebec population accounts for 24.5% of the Canadian 
population, but the Government of Quebec was hit by 37% of the 
cuts to the Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder our health sector is having problems. Although these 
problems occur throughout the country, they hurt us a lot more. 
And the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said it before: 
Quebec has to hurt. Well, the government is certainly on the 
right track, particularly with its bill preventing Quebec from 
using the democratic process freely in a referendum. If Quebec 
has to hurt, the government is definitely on the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year alone, the Government of Quebec will have $1.7 billion 
less for health, post-secondary education and welfare. Based on 
the historic distribution before 1994, before the federal 
government's contributions in those three sectors were 
consolidated into a single transfer called the Canada social 
transfer, here is what it looks like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, the Government of Quebec will be short $875 million 
in federal transfers for health. Do members know what such an 
amount of money represents? It represents 3,000 jobs for 
physicians. It represents 5,000 jobs for nurses. It is a lot of 
money. And then people say that the Government of Quebec really 
has lots of problems in the area of health. But it is this 
government that is causing considerable harm to the sick in 
Quebec and to the finances of the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the historic distribution, $500 million of the $1.7 
billion would have gone to education. Do members know what we 
could do if we had $500 million more to put into education in 
Quebec? We could hire 5,800 university professors. 
And the cuts are a thing of the past? How hypocritical can one 
get? In terms of income security, the Government of Quebec is 
getting $325 million less to fight poverty in Quebec. Do members 
have any idea what could be done with that money? It would mean 
an additional $500 for each and every welfare recipient in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, $500 a year is not a lot of money for a millionaire 
like the Minister of Finance, but for those who are having 
trouble making ends meet, who are struggling, $500 a year is a 
fortune. And this is what they are being deprived of. Then the 
government goes around bragging that cuts are a thing of the 
past, that they have put their fiscal house in order and that 
they are on the right track. Give me a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the Liberal majority on the finance committee does 
not recommend that the social transfers to the provinces be 
restored. It does not say a word about poverty either, but I am 
going to come back to that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the report says nothing about reinstating a real 
employment insurance program. Despite the representations made 
here and elsewhere in Canada and especially in the province of 
Quebec where the Bloc carried out wide consultations, the report 
of the Liberal majority on the finance committee does not 
mention the need to reform the employment insurance program. It 
is shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 42% of the unemployed are eligible to benefits, even if 
100% of the workers pay premiums. The situation for women is 
even worse. Only 31% of them are eligible, but all of them do 
pay premiums. They are going after the men and women who are 
unemployed, as well as pregnant women. 
Their benefits are being cut because they have been on 
precautionary cessation of work under the CSST. Because the days 
and hours during which they were covered by the CSST are not 
factored in, they are not eligible to special benefits for 
pregnant women. This is scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, nothing on EI. The representations made by thousands of 
Quebecers and Canadians were ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the structuring projects. I mentioned earlier that the 
budget offers many great possibilities. The Minister of Finance 
is hiding more surpluses. He is hiding facts about his real 
leeway. He has much more flexibility than he cares to admit. He 
has more leeway than he knows what to do with. 
The liberal majority on the finance committee could have 
suggested to spend more than $500 million a year on structuring 
projects, on infrastructure projects. This is ridiculous.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the possibilities and flexibility anticipated for next year 
and the subsequent two, the committee could have suggested 
$3 billion a year, as we had. In this regard, we had the support 
of all stakeholders in civil society, including employer 
associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing either on structuring projects in support of a 
real shipbuilding policy for Canada. My Bloc colleague from 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has worked very hard for many years 
to promote such a policy. Canadians from sea to sea want a 
national shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago, my colleague informed me that he had gained the 
support of the Canadian Shipowners Association, of which our 
finance minister is a member. No one is asking him to secure 
privileges as a shipowner. There is a difference between passing 
legislation that favours him and his companies, as he did two 
years ago with Bill C-28, and developing a national shipbuilding 
policy to help create jobs in Canada and ensure, for instance, 
that the level of jobs at Lévis shipyards gets back to what it 
was before, that is 5,000 jobs, if my memory serves me right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Three thousand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> I am told there were three thousand. It is now 
less than half. What we need is a new shipbuilding policy with 
economic spinoffs. Not a word from the Liberals on that, though. 
Everyone agrees there is a need, but the Liberal government is 
turning a deaf ear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning social housing, it is a joke, there is nothing in 
here. It only says that a report is expected from the minister 
responsible for the homeless, who is still travelling all over 
the country to hear comments. The government recently announced 
that $500 million might be made available for community shelters 
where the homeless could spend the night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They earmark a mere $500 million to shelters. They completely 
ignore the whole issue of social housing and overlook the fact 
that there is a way of doing things. Opening shelters is one 
thing, but support must also be provided to help the homeless 
get out of that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague from Quebec 
for her excellent analysis on poverty, homelessness and federal 
government policies. Since 1994, this irresponsible government 
should have implemented policies and increased its contribution 
over the years, using the tremendous surplus it generated last 
year and will be generating in the coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to pay tribute to the members of the Accueil Bonneau 
choir, who honoured us with a visit on the occasion of the tenth 
anniversary of the anti-poverty motion passed by the House. They 
gave a wonderful concert. I want to remind members once again 
that it is because of the admirable work done by my colleague 
from Quebec and by the Bloc Quebecois in their fight against 
poverty. While we are fighting poverty, the government is creating 
poverty. The Liberals create poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to tax cuts, I notice that the Liberal majority 
members of the Standing Committee on Finance are the true 
reflection of their government. These are people who put on a 
big show, making suggestions that may look spectacular and 
generous at first glance. At one point, they even got us 
wondering if an election was not about to be called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a closer look reveals a big problem with the tax 
proposals put forward in the Liberal majority report on 
taxation. In our consultations, Quebecers told us “Yes, 
substantial tax cuts are required, but first tax tables and the 
whole tax structure must be fully indexed”. Since 1985 tax 
tables and tax structure are no longer indexed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as this issue remains unsettled there will be no 
lasting solution to the problem of tax fairness for all. We are 
not talking here about insignificant amounts. Since 1994 the 
bracket creep has resulted in extra tax revenues of $17.6 billion 
for the federal government. It is unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few minutes I have left let me explain what indexation 
is all about. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT36"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT36"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put it simply, as we should always do in this kind of 
demonstration. If a taxpayer earns $100 a week and his employer 
gives him a $2 raise, his new salary is $102. But in the 
economy, prices in general have gone up $3, which means that the 
taxpayer is actually poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a $2 pay raise and a $3 overall price increase, this 
taxpayer is in fact $1 poorer. 
Full indexation of the tax tables and the tax structure as a 
whole takes into consideration the fact that the taxpayer is 
poorer and not richer, even with an income of $102 compared to 
$100 the previous year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this increase in poverty is taken into account and the 
taxation level is reduced according to the inflation related 
rise in poverty. This measure was abolished and, since 1974, 
$17 billion in new taxes have been collected. The government 
cannot be blamed for doing something to increase taxation, but 
it can be blamed however for not reforming the tax system and 
restoring the full indexation that was abolished in 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what $17 billion represent? It is a lot of money. 
With $17 billion, one could give around $2,400 to each of the 
7 million Quebecers and that would make up for the money that was 
stolen from them. It represents about twice the education budget 
for Quebec and one hundred times its environment budget. It is a 
lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report does not address these issues but it does mention 
the elimination of the 5% surtax. That measure, along with the 
elimination of the 3% surtax announced in the last budget, will 
greatly benefit those who earn $250,000 or more. It will give 
them $9,300. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the taxpayers earning between $30,000 and $70,000 will 
see their taxes reduced by only $200. Even by increasing the 
ceiling to 15%, this solution will only last until 2001. 
After 2001, without full indexing, our tax system will become 
unfair again and taxpayers will continue to pay more taxes than 
they normally should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, we tabled a minority report, a dissenting 
opinion based on what we heard when we went to meet the people, 
putting our ideas together with theirs. We gathered different 
priorities and views and presented them, the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois and myself, to the Standing Committee on Finance on 
behalf of Quebecers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the member's speech.  It 
reminded me that we are in the House as members of parliament not 
just to speak for our own communities but to represent all 
regions of Canada when there is a particular crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems we have had in terms of changing the fiscal 
direction of the country have not just been difficult for the 
province of Quebec.  I acknowledge that we have problems in my 
community of downtown Toronto with a lack of affordable shelter. 
We have had lots of problems, but when we on this side of the 
House as well as members of the New Democratic Party and members 
of the Conservative Party stand, we speak for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is terribly unfair that the member positions his criticisms 
of us as a government.  By the way, some of those criticisms can 
be valid because we have had a very tough time with the economy. 
He should also position them in a way that acknowledges the 
province of Quebec over the last 10 or 12 years has been 
classified through the economic formula as a have not province. 
Those provinces in an advantaged position have transferred over 
$100 billion.  I have never heard any resentment on any side or 
from any other members of parliament about the fact that those 
transfers have been made, because that is the nature of a 
federation. 
I appeal to the member to consider that the House is the 
boardroom of Canada.  It is not just for us to come here and 
speak only for those people who are in pain in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should start to realize that the special privilege 
and responsibility of being in here is that it is as much my 
responsibility to care about his constituents as it is his to 
care about mine.  We have to remind ourselves and Quebecers that 
they are not a persecuted community or a persecuted province.  In 
fact all Canadians have shared happily with Quebecers over the 
last number of years, and we will continue to do so long after 
these separatists are put into extinction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are three main points in 
the member's question. First, yes, it has been more difficult 
for Quebec because it had to absorb 37% of cuts in the Canada 
social transfer, which is more than its percentage of the 
Canadian population, that is 24.5%. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  You only care about Quebecers.  Is 
that it? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Second—if the member could stop shouting, I 
would answer—the views I expressed on behalf of Quebecers, as 
the Bloc Quebecois is called upon to do and will continue to do 
and to fight for Quebecers in the years to come until we get out 
of this federation, those views are the same as the ones we heard throughout 
Canada. If they are not to be found in the Liberal majority 
report, it is simply because the member and his colleagues did 
not do their job. That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we have had quite enough of the kind of nonsense we have 
just heard. The recent adjustment in equalization payments is 
money that we were owed and that had not been given to us for 
two years because the parameters involved in equalization had 
not been properly assessed. That is the fact of the matter. 
That money was owing to us and more is still owing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give but one example, the harmonization of the GST with the 
provincial sales tax in the maritimes.  Since the early 1990s, 
we in Quebec have harmonized the GST and the Quebec sales tax. 
We should be getting $2 billion for that and they are refusing 
to hand it over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, the effort we are being asked to make with 
respect to the cuts has been $2 billion too high ever since 
1994.  That is another $2 billion they owe us, on top of the 
rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much more could be added.  There are the R and D laboratories, the 
productive spending in procurement of goods and services. 
Anyway, it is pointless.  We have been telling them this for 20 
years now and they refuse to believe it, even to believe their 
own statistics. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minority report of the Bloc Quebecois, and indeed the 
member's speech, discussed very briefly the aspect of 
deindexation.  He noted in his dissenting report that the federal 
government would collect an estimated $17.6 billion of additional 
tax, thanks to non-indexation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will accept the numbers subject to check, but the budget 
surplus in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999, was $2.9 
billion.  Since we have balanced the budget the surpluses have 
been quite modest.  If deindexation had not been in place, 
clearly the government still would have been reporting deficit 
positions each and every year because of sheer size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member concede that deindexation or indexation is 
simply a form of delivering tax cuts?  Is he in favour of tax 
cuts to the extent that they would put Canada back into a deficit 
position? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker.  I would, 
however, like to correct the figures the member has given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last fiscal year, 1998-99, the surplus is not $2.9 
billion but over $9 billion.  However, the Minister of Finance 
took $6 billion away during that same fiscal year, unexpectedly, 
and applied that amount to the debt right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point one, situations can be corrected and so they should be. 
The public finances must be put on a healthier footing, but 
when that is done at the expense of one category of taxpayers 
and the others are left to profit unduly from the taxation 
system, and by that I mean the people with the highest incomes, 
something is not working right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to correct problems by creating injustice and by 
maintaining that particular injustice. 
It is all very well but the ones who have had to pay are the 
people earning between $25,000 and $70,000 a year; those are the 
families that have borne the brunt of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>People with incomes of $250,000 and up have not had to pay. 
Point two, millionaires like the Minister of Finance have not 
had to pay either.  Point three, tax reform has been talked 
about since 1996.  Ideas had even been submitted to the Minister 
of Finance and he applauded these suggestions.  Since then, he 
has been standing there with his hands in his pockets.  He is 
looking out for himself first and foremost, but he has done 
nothing as far as the tax system is concerned. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In the response to the member's question he reputed the $2.9 
billion figure.  The public accounts report— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think that is a point of 
order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for his statement on what was said during the 
prebudget consultations. This is very much like what was 
said regarding the Canada social transfer in the meetings of the 
committee on children and youth at risk. They were told to give 
the missing money back to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They created six years of social deficit and this gave rise to 
poverty. Creating poverty has consequences, on the quality of 
services in hospitals for example, on special support for 
children who live in poverty and on thousands of women on 
welfare having a little extra money. For them, it means having 
more money to pay the rent and to buy groceries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a little earlier that the minister responsible for the 
homeless is going to announce a $500 million program for their 
benefit. What scares me is not the money to be invested in that 
project but rather the way this program will be adapted to the 
situation in Quebec. It is true that realities differ. We were 
saying a while ago that there was a shortfall, that Quebec did 
not get its fair share. In social housing, Quebec never received 
its fair share. I would like my colleague to tell us if he is 
worried about the federal government's flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the minister responsible for the homeless 
will be judged on the way this money is given to the provinces 
and on her flexibility with regard to the distribution of the 
millions of dollars invested for the homeless. I would like my 
colleague to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that having $500 
million is a good initiative but I am concerned as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this government increase the number of initiatives, 
of structures and, ultimately, the amounts that should be used 
to provide services to people were spent on buildings and public 
servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five hundred million dollars, that is good news, but it is not 
enough. Most witnesses appearing before the Standing Committee 
on Finance asked that 1% of the Canadian GDP be invested in 
social housing and that homelessness be considered part of a 
wider issue called social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1990, I was able to see, by looking at the numbers my 
distinguished colleague gave us, that the number of households 
that were putting more than 50% of their income into housing—these 
households are virtually living in poverty—has increased 
by 41%. The needs are great. The amount needed is $1.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned to see that the prerogatives and 
jurisdictions of the Quebec government are respected. Through 
the Société d'hypothèques du Québec, the Quebec government would 
be able to administer a real program that would help the 
homeless and people who are in need of social housing. We will 
work hard to have these amounts increased and to ensure they can 
be used effectively to get people off the street, to help and 
support them during the transition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to the people of 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar who elected me in the byelection on 
November 15.  It is a privilege to have the opportunity to serve 
them.  I will do so with all my energy and to the best of my 
ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it humbling to follow in the footsteps of the great 
parliamentarians who have preceded me in this vast prairie 
constituency.  The list includes honourable social democrats such 
as M. J. Coldwell, Woodrow Lloyd, Alf Gleave and Chris Axworthy. 
It includes as well the Right Honourable Ray Hnatyshyn, a former 
Progressive Conservative cabinet minister who later became our 
governor general.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Coldwell represented this riding in parliament from 1935 to 
1958.  He led the CCF in the 1940s and 1950s.  He worked 
tirelessly to bring about many of the great social advances that 
have shaped our country.  These include hospital and auto 
insurance, pensions, family allowances, labour and welfare 
reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Woodrow Lloyd served Biggar in the Saskatchewan legislature for 
20 years, from 1944 to 1964.  In 1961 he succeeded Tommy Douglas 
as premier.  With great patience and great courage, Mr. Lloyd 
prevailed over the tumultuous strike by Saskatchewan's doctors 
the following year.  Our cherished national medicare system is at 
least in part Mr. Lloyd's gift to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>M. J. Coldwell had an abiding commitment to social justice. 
Woodrow Lloyd had a clear and ringing view of social democratic 
philosophy.  “Ours is not just a gimme or a gouge the rich 
philosophy,” Woodrow Lloyd said.  “It matches claims with 
obligations, imposing on each of us a greater individual 
responsibility than is imposed by other political parties”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also guided by the legacy of Alf Gleave who represented the 
Saskatoon-Biggar area in parliament from 1968 to 1974, and who 
earlier was one of the pioneers of medicare.  When Alf died last 
summer, journalist Barry Wilson in his eulogy quoted Alf's own 
words, summing up his life as a family man, a farmer and an 
elected representative.  “At the beginning of the century,” Alf 
wrote, “the people who came to the prairies and those who 
followed them, the next generation such as myself, made a more 
secure and bountiful life here by working together, by sharing 
the load”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This need to balance claims and obligations, to work together 
and to share the load has never been more relevant than it is 
today, as the 20th century comes to an end and a new century and 
a new millennium are about to dawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere is this need to work together more evident today than in 
the farm crisis that now engulfs western Canada, a crisis that 
tears at the heart of so many of the families I represent in 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar.  What my NDP colleagues have said so 
often in the House is tragically true.  That is that western 
farmers are gripped by the worst crisis since the 1930s, and in 
some respects, a crisis that is greater than that of the great 
depression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pain and misery are unprecedented economically and 
emotionally.  Farm stress has reached epidemic proportions. 
Families are disintegrating.  Bankruptcy is driving people from 
their homes and from their way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An astonishing 46% of western farmers are now seriously 
considering leaving the land.  What this means, should it come to 
pass, is a mass exodus of as many as 16,000 farmers across 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba within the next short period of time. 
The impact of this calamity would be unimaginable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this crisis occurring?  It is happening because our 
national government, in its cult-like adherence to the ideology 
of free trade, has cut support for grain farmers by 60% over the 
last eight years.  The government has accepted the free market 
mantra of the Business Council on National Issues and embraced 
the global gospel of the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has played a destructive game giving away 
much more in trade negotiations than it has gained in return. 
Western farmers have been ambushed on the free market road. 
Consider that European farmers receive 56 cents in support for 
each dollar of wheat that is sold.  American farmers get 38 
cents. Canadian farmers today get a paltry 9 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is happening at a time of unprecedented federal wealth. Our 
government, as we have heard here today, is projecting almost 
$100 billion in surpluses over the next five years. 
If he wanted to, the Prime Minister could deal with the farm 
crisis and he would scarcely notice the amount of money that it 
would take. But he refuses.  He is caught like a deer in the 
headlights on the free market road.

I urge the Prime Minister to return at least $1 billion of the 
money that his government has scooped out of the Saskatchewan 
economy in recent years.  This is just 1% of his forecasted five 
year surpluses. Farmers need help desperately and they need it 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an immediate measure.  In the medium term the government 
must re-examine the AIDA program to see if it can be fixed.  In 
the longer term, a combination of supports and cost cutting 
measures and diversification will have to be adopted if western 
agriculture is going to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the deafening silence of the government in 
response to the plea of farmers also extends in many cases to 
society as a whole.  We see this only too clearly in the majority 
report of the Standing Committee on Finance with its empty 
rationale recommending $46 billion in tax cuts for mainly high 
income earners over the next few years. This is wrong as my 
colleague the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle pointed out in his 
minority report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee report continues the bogus philosophy of 
trickle down economics preached for the last 20 years by leaders 
such as Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, George Bush and Brian 
Mulroney.  This dreary message is always the same. It goes 
something like this: give the horse enough oats and the sparrows 
will eventually be fed. This has never been true and we will only 
make matters worse if we repeat the same mistakes again and 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax cuts that benefit mainly the rich will widen the 
unacceptable gap that already exists between the wealthy and the 
poor in our society.  This gap has gone from embarrassing to 
offensive to downright obscene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats advocate a fair and sane approach, one that will 
work, if only the government will adopt it and implement it.  We 
believe that the surpluses projected over the next few years give 
Canadians a rare opportunity to return to the philosophy of 
redistributing income to those who need it most.  We can undo the 
damage that successive waves of government cutbacks have 
inflicted on families, on public services and on living standards 
in the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one real test of any economy that matters and that 
is, does it serve its people?  New Democrats believe that the 
debate over surpluses must focus on improving the quality of life 
for all Canadians.  We can deal with the farm crisis, child 
poverty and homelessness.  We can give our children the best 
possible start in life. We can preserve public health and expand 
it to home care and pharmacare as the Liberals had promised to do 
in 1993.  We can foster world class education and training.  We 
can invest in roads and public transit.  We can provide tax 
relief by making an initial 1% cut in the GST. We can, as 
Canada's churches have asked, have our country forgive the debt 
owing to us by some of the world's poorest countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commit myself, as my social democratic predecessors have done 
before me, to work tirelessly to achieve these just and time 
honoured goals.  I will not rest and my predecessors will not 
rest in peace until we have built Jerusalem in this green and 
pleasant land.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to ask the hon. member his first question as a member 
of the House. I congratulate him on his discourse today. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is quite a simple one.  He has 
referred to the heritage of the social democrat movement.  In 
keeping with that, I would like him to reflect on the current 
realities incumbent in that movement and what is happening in 
both the U.K. and Germany with governments committed to corporate 
tax reform and reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chancellor of the exchequer in the U.K. has moved to lower 
corporate tax rates and capital gains taxes.  The finance 
minister in Germany reduced corporate taxes in the last budget. 
Does the hon. member join his social democrat friends in other 
countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the economist for the Canadian Labour Congress who 
recently spoke to the finance committee acknowledged that the 
greatest level of economic growth of any type of tax reform would 
come from reducing corporate taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree with his social democrat friends that 
Canada needs to reduce its corporate tax burden? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.  I would refer him to a very fine piece 
of literature, a document prepared for our national convention 
last summer which talked about fiscal responsibility. I am sure 
he might enjoy taking it home, reading it over Christmas and 
having it at his bedside at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that document we talked about targeted tax cuts for middle 
income and poorer Canadians.  As I have just mentioned, we talked 
about starting by reducing the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The Tory tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending:</B>  Yes, the Tory tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that middle class and lower income Canadians need 
some tax relief.  We would not extend that blindly as the 
previous Conservative and current Liberal governments have done 
to tax relief for big corporations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on the question of the GST, the hon. member will know that the 
GST collected about $24 billion in the last fiscal period. That 
means for each percentage point we are talking about just over 
$3.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the magnitude of the impact on reduced revenues of the 
government and utilization of the surplus that would otherwise 
exist, what exactly would the hon. member suggest we do in terms 
of either forgoing debt repayment or forgoing increases to health 
spending to be able to fund that significant tax reduction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.  I would respond to it briefly by making 
two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would refer to the surplus of almost $100 billion which 
the Liberal government is proudly crowing about at the moment. 
Second, I would remind him that it was his own party prior to 
1993 which promised to get rid of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my second question for the 
newly minted member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar is a very 
simple one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I do respect about the New Democrats is their 
consistency and sense of values and commitment to those values 
over a period of time.  That stands in stark contrast to the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member was quite right in pointing out that while he is 
opposed to the GST and would like to reduce the GST, so were the 
Liberals of similar persuasion before 1993.  Let me suggest that 
a potential replacement for those revenues may be gained from a 
hypocrisy tax.  If we were to have a hypocrisy tax that would be 
levied on politicians who break red book promises, perhaps that 
would be one way to help replace revenue from the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate his erudite views on my proposal for a 
hypocrisy tax which would serve two functions.  First it would 
force Liberals to keep their promises for a change.  Second, it 
would raise those revenues to reduce the GST, as the hon. member 
feels is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member again for his question.  I am sure that if our finance 
critic had had his advice in hand, he would have included that 
tax in his minority report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are talking about a hypocrisy tax, I have just 
recommended some literature to the hon. member for over the 
Christmas holidays.  I would refer him to a biography I wrote of 
Allan Blakeney, a fellow Nova Scotian, called <I>Promises to 
Keep</I>.  Perhaps we would like to put that into the minority 
report as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar on his maiden speech in the House of 
Commons.  He follows in the great tradition of prairie social 
democrats such M. J. Coldwell, the second leader of the CCF in 
Canada; Alf Gleave, a former national president of the Farmers 
Union and member of the House of Commons for six years; and the 
honourable Chris Axworthy, attorney general and justice minister 
of the province of Saskatchewan, his immediate predecessor.  I 
welcome him to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite struck by the majority report of the finance 
committee.  I see my Liberal friends are probably even 
astonishing you, Mr. Speaker, because they are recommending that 
$46 billion or about half of the $95 billion surplus should go to 
tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My good red Tory friend from Nova Scotia talked about hypocrisy 
tax in the red book promises.  Perhaps that is why you are in the 
chair today, Mr. Speaker, because you can remain neutral on the 
breaking of a great Liberal principle of balance.  Half of it was 
to go into program spending and half into deficit reduction and 
tax cuts.  Now, afraid of the Leader of the Opposition, the 
Liberal Party has become a very right wing Conservative Party and 
is advocating putting half the surplus into tax cuts primarily 
for wealthy people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in the country has paid for the fight on the debt and the 
deficit?  Is it the Conrad Blacks of the world?  Is it the 
wealthy people of the world?  Is it the wealthier banks or the 
big firms in Canada?  No.  It is the ordinary people of the 
country who have paid for the fight on the deficit through 
cutbacks in health care, through cutbacks in education, through 
cutbacks in our social programs, and through cutbacks imposed on 
farmers.  That is who has paid for the fight on the deficit. That 
is who has paid for the debt.  Now that we have a surplus it 
seems to me the people who paid the price should reap the reward 
of a fiscal surplus, the ordinary people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party is afraid of the Reform Party and the Leader 
of the Opposition and the tax cut agenda.  I see across the way 
the member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke who is shaking in his 
chair in fear of the Reform Party.  It is the same with the 
Minister of Finance who is implementing the Reform Party policy 
in terms of massive cutbacks in social programs like we never saw 
from any Conservative Party in the history of Canada including 
Brian Mulroney's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what has happened and there is no better example 
of that than the 60% cutback in support to farmers by the Liberal 
government across the way when their competitors in Europe and 
the United States have not been cutting back but indeed have been 
increasing support and subsidies to their farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar said, 56 cents of 
a dollar in Europe will come from the treasury in Brussels and in 
the United States 38 cents will come from the treasury in 
Washington to support farmers.  What is it in our country?  It is 
9 cents on the dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has called for the end of all farm subsidies. 
Now it is the Liberal Party that is implementing the Reform 
policy to get rid of subsidies and support prices for our 
farmers.  Farmers are leaving the land.  Farmers are going 
bankrupt.  We have heard time and time again that on the prairies 
we need $1.3 billion of immediate aid, a trade equalization 
payment to farmers to allow them to survive which would not even 
bring us up to the American levels or the European levels.  What 
has the Liberal Party done?  This message has fallen on deaf 
ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had in parliament in Ottawa a few weeks ago the premiers of 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, supported by all three political 
parties in Manitoba, three political parties in Saskatchewan, the 
farm organizations, the chambers of commerce and the trade 
unions, with a joint position of solidarity in support of $1.3 
billion for farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
What did the Liberal government say?  It said nothing in terms of 
extra assistance to farmers.  No wonder the Liberals are hanging 
their heads in shame.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a throne speech back in October.  I looked at it very 
carefully and there was absolutely nothing in it, not even a 
reference to the farm crisis.  Where do these people live?  They 
do not know the real poor people who are facing problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then a month later we got this media show by the Minister of 
Finance.  He flew to London, Ontario, to make a media statement. 
Again many of the Liberal members are wondering why all this 
money was spent for him to fly to London.  A big schedule was 
worked out for the Minister of Finance and he made a statement on 
national television.  In a 45 minute speech there was not one 
reference to the farm crisis despite the suffering, the pain, the 
demonstrations, the protests, the writings and the calls by the 
united front across Saskatchewan and Manitoba for extra 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance and the parliamentary committee on 
finance are more Conservative than anything I saw with Brian 
Mulroney or Conservative governments in the past.  It is not just 
the farm crisis.  Let us look at what they have done to health 
care.  It is enough to tear our hair out.  We have had the 
biggest cutbacks in health care in the history of the country. 
The cutback in federal funding to the provinces for health care 
is causing problems today in hospitals and emergency rooms from 
one part of the country to another.  The closings of hospitals 
and the lineups for surgery are because of the cutbacks by the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is there silence on the backbench?  The minister from the 
Northwest Territories never gets up to defend health care.  I 
have never seen her get up to say that the Minister of Finance 
should put more money into health care.  She should be ashamed of 
herself.  She represents ordinary people and knows that people 
are in lineups because of cutbacks in health care by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the farm crisis and the health care problem.  Where are 
the recommendations in this report for money for health care?  We 
have a $100 billion surplus, and what has been recommended for 
health care?  Nothing.  Even the Canadian Medical Association is 
saying that we need an extra $1.5 billion per year in health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  It is very difficult 
for the Chair to hear the debate.  I know the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle, in his most bombastic style, is being perhaps 
a little provocative and is causing some uproar in the House, but 
the Speaker has to be able to hear the remarks of the hon. member 
who has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
question of privilege.  I am deeply offended by the references 
made to me in a personal way.  If my mandate and duties are being 
called into question in a professional way, that is one thing, 
but to be slandered by the member who has done nothing for native 
people but use them for their votes is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have not heard anything here about 
a question of privilege.  I suggest we move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not even mention 
native people.  I am not sure where that came from.  I was saying 
that the member across the way like other Liberal members is not 
rising in the House of Commons and calling on the Minister of 
Finance to put more money into health care.  The record speaks 
for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party is implementing policies of the Leader of the 
Opposition and the Reform Party which call for massive cutbacks 
and a reduction of the role of government.  That is exactly what 
it is doing.  They are setting the agenda and that party across 
the way has implemented that agenda and knows it.  That is why 
its members are so sensitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just health care and the farm crisis.  Let us look at 
what happened in terms of the cutbacks to education.  The 
government is not investing in education like it should be.  That 
is why we are falling behind in public support of education 
almost every state in United States.  That is what is happening 
in Canada.  If we had more federal moneys going to the provinces 
for education we would have better training for our people.  We 
would have a more competitive and productive economy. 
That is not happening because of the cutbacks and the priorities 
of the government across the way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important point about the finance committee report is that 
it is supposed to be a framework and a vision for the next five 
years.  What will the government do?  It will continue the same 
right wing reactionary policies of the Reform Party in terms of 
handing out more and more money to wealthy people.  In fact, the 
member for Calgary Southwest said at one time in the House that 
Conrad Black deserved a tax cut.  The Reform Party is not 
implementing it but it is the Liberal Party across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we need a public debate in the country about our 
real priorities.  The priorities should be to invest in people, 
to create more equality in people, to invest in the health care 
system, to come to the assistance of prairie farmers and to 
invest in the education system.  Those should be our priorities 
and they are not the priorities today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear all this stuff about tax cuts.  I remember the Liberals 
in opposition, Mr. Speaker, and so do you.  The member from the 
Northwest Territories was there.  I remember when Brian Mulroney 
brought in the GST.  I remember the Liberal Party saying in the 
House that if Canadians elected the Liberal Party, and it is in 
the red book, it would abolish the GST.  Does everyone remember 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only member who had some honour in that regard was the 
former Deputy Prime Minister who resigned her seat and went to 
her people in a byelection.  The Liberals made that promise on 
the GST.  They promised to get rid of NAFTA, the free trade 
agreement.  They promised many other things that were in the red 
book, and they broke those promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, Mr. Speaker, I hope you agree with me that what we 
are seeing is a right wing agenda by the Minister of Finance 
implementing the policies of the Reform Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  In the member's presentation he indicated that the 
Liberal government is implementing what Reform would like to have 
implemented.  I am deeply offended by that presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member may be, but I do not 
think that constitutes a point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech made by my hon. colleague from the NDP, 
who made a sad assessment of the current Liberal government's 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to say more on the social transfer. Quebec is 
having a lot of trouble. The minister, Pauline Marois, is trying 
in every way possible to find the money needed to provide 
adequate health care to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the member from the NDP believes that 
these problems are in large part due to the Liberal government's 
mismanagement since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a good question. In 
1995, the current Minister of Finance cut more than $6 billion 
from Canada's national health program. This is in sync with the 
policy being put forward by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance, who is not a member of the Reform 
Party, made the worst cuts ever to health care, at the national 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well when the national health program was 
introduced under Mr. Pearson. The CCF with Woodrow Lloyd and 
Tommy Douglas, from my province of Saskatchewan, were the first 
ones to come up with the idea. It was created at the national 
level by Mr. Pearson, a true Liberal. A true small “l” liberal, 
not a capital “L” Liberal like the ones we have today. At the 
time, the provinces and the federal government came to an 
agreement whereby the federal government would pay one half of 
the costs of the national health program, and the provinces, the 
other half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do we stand today? The federal government only pays 12% or 
13% of the costs. There is no national unity. Our country has no 
great vision. Where are the old Liberals? Where is the old 
Liberal Party of Pierre Trudeau, of Mr. Pearson, of Laurier and 
King? Where is that Liberal Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Liberal Party has vanished completely. There is not a lot 
of difference now between the Liberal Party and the Mr. 
Manning's Reform Party. They are just about the same. We are 
stuck here with a government that is more conservative than 
Brian Mulroney's government was. Brian Mulroney never did such a 
thing. The government of the current Prime Minister is the only 
one to blame here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member as well as the member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar 
referred to a surplus approaching some $100 billion. The members 
will well know that is a projected surplus over the next five 
fiscal periods assuming no negative economic changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic and fiscal update shows that the surplus for the 
last fiscal year reported on was $2.9 billion.  It is estimated 
to be $2 billion for the next fiscal year and $5.5 billion for 
the year starting April 1, 2000 to March 31, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that we are talking about the upcoming budget and 
projecting for that year a $5.5 billion surplus, I would like to 
ask the member about the recommendation to reduce the GST by 1% 
which would cost almost $3.5 billion based on current revenue 
production.  That means of the $5.5 billion, $3.5 billion is 
going to tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the member square that with his demands that there 
should be relief for prairie farmers, for health care, for 
post-secondary education and for children? The member cannot have 
it all ways.  Is he suggesting that the government should be 
imprudent and go back into deficit financing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am surprised my good 
friend across the way who is an accountant interprets the numbers 
in the way he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows that the projected surplus will be around $10 billion 
in the next fiscal year.  If we take into consideration the 
contingency that the government is setting aside, if we take into 
consideration the prudence that it is setting aside and if we 
look at the history of the Minister of Finance, it might be even 
more than $10 billion.  The Minister of Finance consistently 
underestimates the revenues of the Government of Canada, so there 
may be more than $10 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member across the way knows that.  He is an accountant.  He 
is a good member of the finance committee.  Unfortunately he has 
become very, very conservative in terms of the tax cut agenda for 
wealthy people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST cutback by one point will cost around $3 billion.  That 
is about 30% of the surplus.  That is a good amount to put in tax 
relief at the federal level at this time.  Let us put most of the 
rest of the money into programs that are needed by the people of 
this country:  health care, education, the farm crisis, the 
homeless situation and a children's agenda.  That is what the 
people want.

with pleasure that I rise in the House to speak on the prebudget 
consultation report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is December 16, 1999.  There are 14 days left in this 
century, a century that was to have belonged to Canada.  It is 
important at this time that we reflect on what is occurring not 
just within our borders but around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate of global change facing Canadians is unprecedented. The 
challenges facing Canadians and the potential opportunities 
available to Canadians have never been greater. How are we doing 
in this environment?  The Liberals say that the fundamentals are 
strong.  The ex-patriot Canadian economist John Kenneth Galbraith 
once said that one should beware of governments who claim that 
the fundamentals are strong. That is an important bit of advice 
to heed at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this new globally competitive, interconnected environment the 
fundamentals are not simply esoteric statistics or unimportant 
numbers.  These are not distant trivia that we can afford to 
ignore. We cannot afford to ignore what other countries are doing 
to create environments for economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at those fundamentals the government boasts about. 
We have an unemployment rate that is 70% higher than that of the 
U.S.  We have the highest personal income tax rates of any 
country in the G-7.  We have the second highest corporate tax 
rates in the OECD, of those 31 countries.  Last year we were 
third highest but we are now second highest. Germany, a social 
democratic country of the same brethren as the New Democratic 
Party in this country, saw fit to reduce its corporate tax burden 
and create federal levels of economic growth and opportunity in 
Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in the history of our country, our level of 
personal debt on average in Canada is $43,200.  For the first 
time that is surpassing the average disposable income of 
Canadians.  In fact, we have the fastest growing levels of 
personal debt of any country in the G-7. While the government 
boasts about being in the black, Canadians are in the red to a 
greater extent than they have ever been in the past.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal disposable income in Canada has dropped by 8% since 
1990.  During the same period of time Americans have enjoyed a 
10% increase.  There has been a widening of the gap by about 10% 
in terms of personal disposable income between ourselves and our 
neighbours to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fastest growing economic engine is in the U.S.  We have an 
opportunity being a country that borders the U.S. to benefit from 
that growth, but not if we continually focus on the policies of 
the past and ignore the opportunities to build policies based on 
the realities of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some other fundamental areas.  Productivity 
growth rates in Canada have been lagging behind those of the U.S. 
In Canada the equities markets on the Toronto Stock Exchange have 
had a relatively anemic growth compared to the robust growth in 
the U.S.  During the same period of time the TSE was required to 
grow by 100%, the Dow Jones Index in New York grew by 300%.  As 
Americans are getting richer, Canadians are getting poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this government since 1993 there has been a 10 cent drop 
in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.  The Prime 
Minister's response was typically erudite, that it would be good 
for tourism.  The logical corollary of his argument would be that 
if we were to reduce the dollar to zero, we could become the 
greatest exporting nation in the world.  That logic simply does 
not work. Most Canadians realize it is impossible to devalue our 
way to prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brain drain issue is a very important fundamental.  It 
involves the choices being made by some of the best and brightest 
young people in Canada.  According to the report by the 
Conference Board of Canada last summer, the number of people 
leaving Canada and seeking opportunities in the U.S. has grown 
from 16,000 people per year a few years ago to 96,000 people per 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a very disturbing trend, the devouring of corporate 
Canada. At the end of the 20th century, which was a century that 
was supposed to belong to Canada, it is important to pause and 
think about some of these things.  It is sad that at the end of 
the 20th century Canada no longer really belongs to us.  That is 
largely due to the fact that the government fails to accept some 
of the market driven realities of a globally competitive 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the House an idea of the impact of the devouring of 
corporate Canada.  Back in 1994 the value of U.S. acquisitions of 
Canadian companies was $5.6 billion.  In 1998 the Canadian 
corporate value purchased by Americans had grown to $16.1 
billion.  This year it is $25.6 billion.  That is no accident. It 
has a lot to do with the reduction in the value of the Canadian 
dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the causes of the reduction in the 
Canadian dollar, that 10 cent precipitous drop and decline in the 
take home pay of Canadians since 1993.  A lot of that has to do 
with tax issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the 1970s and 1980s Canada was able to maintain 
approximately the same level of economic growth as the U.S. 
During the same period of time we had a positive yield in that 
our interest rates were marginally higher than those of the U.S. 
yet we were able to maintain that similar level of economic 
growth and prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in the 1990s and particularly since the election of this 
government, we have seen a gap between the currency values of the 
two countries and for the first time in a long time Canada has a 
negative yield.  We have lower interest rates in Canada. We are 
using monetary policy to compensate for some of the weak fiscal 
policies of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the reason the Bank of Canada needs to do that is that 
for the first time ever as a percentage of GDP in Canada, we are 
at 38% of our GDP in taxes. Compare that to the U.S. which is at 
28% of GDP in tax revenues. It is not sustainable.  Effectively 
we are heading toward a government that simply will not be able 
to continue the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. The Bank of 
Canada will not be able to continually use that mechanism. 
We need strong fiscal mechanisms and levers to be implemented 
now.

this kind of situation and that is to try to demonize America, to 
try to demonize the free market system and to try to somehow 
create a bogeyman in the people who are logically taking 
advantage of the situation that exists here.  The fact is that in 
a globally competitive environment, the responsibilities lie with 
each government to create the levels of economic growth and 
opportunity for their companies and individuals to succeed and 
compete globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that kind of environment the government is clearly failing. 
It is exposing the nape of Canadian investors, Canadian business 
people and Canadian individuals to the ferocity of global 
competition without providing the economic growth levers and 
productivity enhancement initiatives that they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is in stark contrast to the previous government that had 
the courage and vision to implement a free trade agreement that 
this government has embraced and accepted as being good policy in 
retrospect.  The previous government not only had the courage to 
eliminate the manufacturers' sales tax which was impeding growth 
and impeding the ability for Canadian enterprises to compete and 
succeed globally and replace it with the GST, it also deregulated 
financial services, transportation and energy.  All of these are 
policies that this government embraces.  All of them are policies 
that have been credited by economists as having been largely 
responsible for the ability for this government to eliminate the 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at what the achievements of the government have been, 
the only thing the finance minister can point to is the 
elimination of the deficit. If we accept, as most economists

the structural changes made to the Canadian economy by the 
previous government—

the Liberals.  Committees have been instructed to study it. 
Consultants have been hired to develop solutions.  Ministers and

industry that was once at the core of our Canadian identity but 
is now dominated by Americans and Europeans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What issue is that?  Is it agriculture or the farm crisis?  No. 
It is professional hockey and the campaign to cut even further

Liberal budget gave Canadian NHL players an average of $16,000 in

we already subsidize pro-hockey teams heavily from the federal

</I></B></P><P align=left>The departmental officials did not want to allow the grants, but 
in a memo to a departmental official one of the HRD minister's

inflated.  Why?  The memo stated that it was to keep the same 
amount suggested by the Prime Minister during discussions with 
the promoters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said that he was just doing a good job as a

</I></B></P><P align=left>The human resources minister's staff was concerned because the 
Prime Minister's announcements were forcing them to break the 
rules.  Robert Thériault wrote that it was a difficult decision 
since they departed from regional guidelines.  He said that they 
would have liked to have given another answer but that he had no

was an area of high unemployment.  These projects had broad

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

under investigation by the RCMP for illegal lobbying.  He has 
also received an $11,500 payback for arranging the last federal

they do not accept that there are areas of high unemployment in

Canada, in Quebec, in Ontario or even in northern British

the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration announced on December

December 1 a pilot project which would ease through the 
establishment of identification refugee claimants to the services 
that they need was put in effect.  This was as a result of 
conversations particularly with the municipality of Toronto to 
understand the stresses and pressures on shelter and hostel 
systems.  We will be evaluating this and after a period of three 
months, we will know whether or not this is an effective measure 
in responding to the needs of municipalities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to the attention of the House an incident that occurred 
at the scrutiny of regulations committee.  This is a very unique 
and important joint committee of the House of Commons and the 
Senate.  On Friday of last week I tabled a report and then I 
asked for unanimous consent to move concurrence in the report. 
The report was not concurred in because I could not get unanimous 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the committee meeting could not be held simply because we 
could not proceed with a reduced quorum.  As a result the budget 
could not be approved and during this holiday season the salaries 
of legal counsel who are employees of the committee could not be 
approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask for unanimous consent it should not create a

different motives or different objectives.  I seek some advice

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Usually the House finds a way around 
particular dilemmas.  I do not have responses for every question 
that is put, but do I understand that the hon. member wants to 
ask for unanimous consent to table a document today?  If so, I 
want him to forthwith tell me that and what the document is.  I 
do not want any more debate on it.  Is the hon. member seeking 
unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker.  In the spirit of 
the holiday season, if the House gives its consent I would move 
that the first report of the Standing Joint Committee of Scrutiny 
of Regulations, presented to the House earlier last week, be 
concurred in.

<P><A NAME="LINK309"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I now conclude my remarks after question 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's <I>Globe and Mail</I> editorial was very insightful.  It 
was entitled “The Surprising Legacy of the Minister of 
Finance”.  It describes the elimination of the deficit as the 
single accomplishment of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says specifically that the finance minister's triumph on the 
deficit is shadowed by wrongheaded policies elsewhere.  Of 
course, we have already established, as the <I>Economist</I> 
magazine reported, that the credit for deficit reduction in 
Canada belongs largely to the structural reforms made by the 
previous government.  Therefore, the finance minister cannot 
really claim that one-hit wonder because he did not really author 
that one success. 
Although the finance minister would like to claim being a one-hit 
wonder, he cannot claim even that to his credit.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the policies he has implemented.  While 
it is terrible for Liberals to shamelessly take Conservative 
policies, to implement those policies and then to take credit for 
the impact of those policies, what would be even worse would be 
Liberals implementing their own policies.  That is what I am 
concerned about, because we are starting to see a few of those 
policies rear their ugly heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago, the finance made his no decision on the bank 
mergers. What has been the impact of that decision?  I described 
earlier the complexities and challenges of the increasingly 
interconnected, globally competitive environment.  In that 
environment, since the minister's decision, Canadian banks have 
lost about $9 billion of shareholders' value.  During the same 
period, American banks have increased in value by about 10%. 
Again, as Americans are getting richer, Canadians are getting 
poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making his short-sighted decision on the bank mergers, and 
refusing to stand up to the banks to defend the long term 
interests of Canadians by negotiating a better deal on behalf of 
Canadians in exchange for mergers on issues like jobs, services 
to rural communities and those types of things, and in 
unilaterally and arbitrarily saying no, the minister has 
effectively put his own short term political interests and those 
of his leadership aspirations ahead of the interests of the 7.5 
million Canadians who own bank shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, 7.5 million Canadians, directly or indirectly, own bank 
shares and are depending on the returns of those shares for their 
retirement funds.  Again, that was the minister's decision on 
those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has failed to address some of the major crises 
facing Canada right now and the need for significant and 
broadbased tax reform and tax reduction.  On the personal side, 
we need significant levels of tax reform.  On the corporate side, 
we have, as I mentioned earlier, the second highest corporate tax 
rates of the 31 countries in the OECD.  Last year Germany had the 
second highest and we had the third.  Germany now has the third 
highest because it has reduced its corporate tax burden.  This 
country continues to cling to the notion that we can tax to death 
our companies and our individuals and yet still enjoy some level 
of economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this current environment, we should be undertaking 
significant levels of tax reform.  We should be taking the same 
courage and vision in our approach to policies that the previous 
government took with policies, such as free trade, GST and 
deregulation.  In our dissenting report, we discussed the need 
for broadbased and forward thinking tax reform both on the 
personal and corporate side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government received an excellent report on corporate 
taxation by the Mintz commission.  It addressed many of the 
significant flaws in our corporate tax system.  If implemented, 
it would address the distortionary nature of our corporate tax 
system, the profit and sensitive taxes that currently create 
significant distortions and damage productivity in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mintz report also identified the need to bring our corporate 
tax regime more in line with those of other countries.  At a time 
when other countries are using corporate tax reform and personal 
tax reform as vehicles and levers for economic growth, including 
Ireland and the Scandinavian countries, this country continues to 
cling to the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our minority report, we identified that tax brackets should 
be re-indexed.  In fact, there is a consensus both on the left 
and the right that we should be returning to full indexation of 
the tax brackets.  The Fraser Institute agrees with the Caledon 
Institute in this case.  The de-indexation of tax brackets took 
place during a time of deficit financing in a very difficult 
fiscal period.  In a post-deficit time now more than ever, we 
need to revisit and eliminate bracket creep which has 
unfortunately brought more Canadians onto the tax rolls than we 
have ever had before and we need to revisit that, eliminate 
bracket creep and re-index tax brackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to lower the capital gains tax rates.  I was pleased to 
see that the finance committee report did address this to a 
certain extent.  We would go further.  We would reduce the 
capital gains inclusion rate to 50% from the current 75%. 
The fact is that we could reduce our personal capital gains tax 
rates to be equivalent with those of the U.S.  It would cost 
about $240 million per year.  For the dramatic unlocking of 
capital that would occur and for the economic growth that would 
ensue with that type of visionary policy, $240 million per year 
is a small price to pay.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, public policy, in particular for the Liberal 
government, is focused more often on perception rather than 
reality.  There is a stubborn intransigence in areas of capital 
gains tax and corporate tax reform.  That is why the government 
has shelved the Mintz report and ignored many of its 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see the government set and keep firm debt 
reduction targets.  This is very important.  Our country is now 
in a worse debt to GDP ratio situation than those countries of 
the EU.  We would not qualify under the Maastricht treaty to 
participate in the common currency of Europe.  This is comparing 
Canada with bastions of fiscal fortitude like France.  It is not 
exactly a positive indicator that we have not been able to 
maintain the same or lower debt to GDP ratios than our cousins in 
Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would suggest that the foreign content limit be increased to 
50% immediately, and ultimately be eliminated once we have had an 
opportunity to evaluate the impact of it.  The finance committee 
is recommending some level of incremental increase over a period 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that at this stage, with the dramatic infusion of 
capital into the Canadian equity markets, with the Canada pension 
plan funds and the superannuation funds that we are going to be 
seeing, there has never been a better time than now to end this 
economic imprisonment that forces Canadians to accept lower 
returns, which have cost about $32,000 to the average RRSP over 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a time when the Dow Jones has appreciated 300%, the TSC 
has performed in many ways anemically, gaining about 100%.  I 
referred to it earlier as fiscal or economic imprisonment.  I 
think it is very important, in particular while the government 
clings to the types of tax and regulatory policies that will 
pummel initiatives in Canada, that it release Canadians and allow 
them an opportunity to invest some of their hard earned dollars 
to ensure that they can enjoy a relatively good quality of life 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would suggest that the government take very seriously the 
call for a national highway program and that it increase the 
proportion of gas taxes that are currently returned to the 
provinces for highway spending from the current 5%, which is the 
lowest of any industrialized country, to about 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an area of utmost importance.  While there is some need 
for new spending in some of the traditional areas such as health 
care, and the farm crisis and the highway system need to be 
addressed, the government should not engage in new spending 
programs, including the child care initiative in which some 
Liberal backbenchers want to engage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time like this in Canada, when we have never faced more 
fierce global competitiveness issues, we need to take time to 
step back and evaluate what is happening in other countries. 
Other countries are dramatically using innovative tax policies to 
create levels of economic growth.  Other countries are reducing 
and maintaining lower levels of government spending and lower 
levels of debt to create the economic environment that will 
ensure growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries are taking on regulatory burden.  One of our 
suggestions is that we have a regulatory budget to allow elected 
members of the House to debate the merits of individual pieces of 
regulation so that we do not see a continued growth of regulation 
by stealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my last speech of this millennium in the House.  I would 
hope in the future, in the next millennium, that we would take 
more seriously the competitiveness issues facing Canadians and 
that we would actually lead the global environment to create a 
better environment, instead of simply following and playing 
catch-up, as the government seems want to do at this time.

issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my friend.  Many of his colleagues in the 
Conservative Party have advocated enriching employment insurance 
benefits.  Would he tell me what his personal stand is on that 
issue and what is the stance of his party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I do not have another opportunity, I also want to wish all 
members a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Medicine Hat, my friend and colleague on the finance 
committee, for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance benefits, particularly those relating to 
seasonal workers, is a very important issue.  The Liberals 
slashed these benefits after 1995.  That created a situation 
which I do not think even the government expected, and the law of 
unintended consequences kicked in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the slashing of those EI benefits resulted in 
people who worked seasonally going on provincial social 
assistance rolls and not working at all.  I would assume that the 
hon. member would agree with me that that created a greater 
reduction in productivity and human enrichment than would have 
existed previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case, my personal views on this would be that we 
should investigate and revisit the notion of individual EI 
accounts.  There was a study done in the U.K. a couple of years 
ago.  It was reported in the <I>Economist</I> magazine in the fall 
of 1997.  It studied the idea of having individual EI accounts 
that people would pay into over their lives.  Some of the 
contributions would be taken from those individual accounts to 
top up those who draw more frequently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of change would provide an incentive for people to not 
draw frequently.  It would have some of the impact which I 
believe the Liberals were trying to seek in terms of reducing 
abuse of the EI system by way of an incentive method, as opposed 
to purely through a penalty or punishment oriented method that 
ultimately did not have the effect Liberals wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member agrees with me that shifting the 
burden of social assistance to the provinces certainly did not 
help in any way, shape or form.  In fact it prevented many of 
these people from participating in the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a complicated issue.  There is not a simple, 12 second 
answer to that.  However, I would enjoy exploring the issue with 
the hon. member at any time in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I understand that this may be one of the last few days or 
minutes that we have in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great amount of work has been expended by members from all 
sides of the House in committee to come to an agreement on Bill 
C-202, which is currently at report stage.  It is a private

there is unanimity among the parties and the members, I would

at third reading to pass on to the Senate.

prebudget consultation in my riding.  I wanted to hear from 
British Columbians their concerns and ideas on spending the 
surplus.  Those citizens discussed and shared what they believe 
the priorities should be for the next fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear priority which emerged from that discussion was the need 
for tax cuts.  However, tax cuts were not to be at the expense of 
important social programs such as health, education and poverty.

many of my constituents expressed grave concerns about this 
issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not only listen to the people in my riding.  As a member 
of the all-party Standing Committee on Finance I was able to hear 
from and speak with many Canadians from British Columbia, the 
western provinces and indeed across the country.  In this very 
public consultation process we heard the needs and wishes of many 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were very clear about the direction the next budget 
should take.  They want tax cuts and debt reduction.  They want 
infrastructure development and improvement in all provinces. 
They want homelessness and affordable social housing needs to be 
addressed.  They want the serious shortfall in core funding for 
universities and colleges to be reversed.  Canadians, whether in 
British Columbia or Newfoundland, know what they want and we 
listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the committee spent long and careful hours analyzing 
and discussing what we heard.  Our recommendations, based on what 
we learned from the public consultations and town hall meetings 
held in many ridings, including Vancouver Kingsway, are found in 
our committee report which was tabled in the House of Commons 
only a few days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to commend the committee chair and 
the members of the finance committee for their hard work and 
dedication over the last few months of the prebudget consultation 
process.  I would also like to thank the hundreds of Canadians, 
individuals and organizations, who took the time and effort to 
participate in the prebudget consultation process.  All made 
highly valuable contributions to the shaping of the committee's 
report and recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax reduction is a major part of the committee's 
recommendations.  We are suggesting that personal income tax 
reform be given a high priority.  Reduced personal income taxes 
would mean that Canadians would keep more of their hard earned 
dollars to invest and to spend in the economy.  We want to see 
the elimination of the 5% personal surtax.  Along similar lines, 
the child tax credit should be extended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a need for reduction in the business tax system. 
Canadian businesses are competing globally and they must be 
allowed the leeway to do so.  During the public consultations we 
were made clearly aware of how badly infrastructure 
revitalization is needed.  Comments were made by people from all 
regions of Canada about how roads and highways are in dire need 
of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation which relies heavily on roadway transportation, 
whether it is the automotive industry in Ontario or supplies 
being transported to Fort Nelson, B.C., we must invest in 
infrastructure.  Therefore we have recommended a $2.5 billion 
federal infrastructure program.  Not only would such a program 
mark an important contribution to the well-being and safety of 
all Canadians, it would create hundreds of new jobs and stimulate 
the local economy in many regions of the country.

undertaken a national survey to identify the challenges and help 
develop meaningful solutions.  We must support her efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have personally visited the Portland Hotel Society in 
Vancouver's downtown eastside, the poorest postal code in Canada. 
This noteworthy organization works with poor and low income 
individuals to provide housing and services.  It tries to address 
the needs of a group which faces numerous challenges such as drug 
and alcohol abuse, HIV positive, mental illness, poverty and 
social isolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day the personnel of the Portland Hotel Society work to 
rescue those who have fallen through the cracks of our social 
safety network.  The manager of this affordable housing project 
clearly expressed her concern for the plight of homeless 
individuals.  We must endeavour to build national partnerships to 
address this urgent problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased support for post-secondary education in Canada is 
needed.  Education is an essential element to ensure that our 
children will gain the knowledge to allow them to compete on an 
equal footing in the new global economy.  Knowledge is the key 
for the 21st century. Canadian universities and colleges must 
have a sustainable level of core funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the finance committee is recommending a 
balanced approach for our budget to ensure solid fiscal health in 
the future.  It is clear our Liberal government not only listens 
to Canadians for their financial interests and needs, we also 
will build a better future for our younger generation.

happy holiday season.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question for the hon. member, my colleague on the finance 
committee, has to do with the issue of leaky condominiums in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a recent visit there I met with some community groups. I was 
disturbed to learn that 50,000 condominium owners in British 
Columbia have been badly served by a systemic government failure 
at the federal, provincial and municipal levels which has left 
the 50,000 homeowners with repair bills in each case on average 
of $24,000 to $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party of Canada supports allowing eligible homeowners to 
withdraw up to $20,000 of their RRSPs without penalty for use in 
repairs to be repaid over 15 years. 
Additionally, we would support the government matching the 
provincial government's sales tax relief with a GST rebate on 
qualified repairs and renovations for leaky condominiums. We 
would also allow an income tax deduction for repair expenses for 
the condominium owners.

for his question.  This is an issue of concern in B.C. and many 
other places. As a matter of fact we in the B.C. caucus have 
repeatedly tried to address this issue. In the meantime, we will 
try to seek an increase in rent support.  At the present time we 
have $75 million. We are trying to see if this can be made 
interest free.  This is the direction we are planning to take and 
this will help some of the needy tenants.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take particular exception to the 
comments I have just heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned the Liberal members from British Columbia. 
I made a sincere attempt to get an all party, behind closed doors 
meeting to see if we would get one voice from British Columbia so 
we would not be fighting each other on the leaky condo issue.  I 
received a very curt letter from the chairman of the Liberal 
caucus in British Columbia saying that they would have nothing to 
do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to tell me why in trying to provide some 
relief for leaky condo owners in British Columbia it is the 
Liberal government that appears to be the sticky point.  We want 
some leadership from the government to pull all the players 
together because it is a system-wide failure.  It is a disaster 
that is analogous to the ice storm in this end of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like a clarification from the member.  Why did the 
Liberal caucus in British Columbia reject a sincere approach to 
try and get one voice from British Columbia on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague for his efforts.  I want the record to show that I do 
recognize his efforts in trying to solve the leaking condominium 
issue. We have not given up on this issue.  We are still working 
on it and we want to find the best solution. I thank the member 
for his continued interest.

Speaker, my colleague is talking about the budget.  I would ask 
her how she, as a member from British Columbia, could possibly 
defend the slash and burn approach the government has taken since 
1993 in the areas of health care and education?  The government 
has removed approximately $21 billion in this area while 
reinvesting, as the Liberals like to say, $11 billion.  This 
leaves a $10 billion shortfall. How can the member justify that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we all know the 
government has provided $11.5 billion over the next five years. 
I do not think we are cutting.  We are actually increasing the 
transfer payments.  In the meantime, we want all the provinces to 
join together and work together.

will say at the outset that you need not apologize to me for 
getting my point of order confused.  I was a bit confused myself. 
It was the spirit of the need for haste which threw me off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very honoured to participate in the prebudget debate. 
Having sat through the morning and now part of the afternoon on 
this issue, a couple of things strike me and I want to point out 
a few things. I am not on the finance committee.  This is not an 
apology, but I am trying to bring a different perspective to the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken a quick look at the document we have been 
referencing as well as the minority reports from the various 
parties.  It is very clear that it is an extremely hardworking 
committee.  Understandably and not surprisingly, various parties 
are taking traditional stands on issues.  I think if we put the 
entire package together, including the minority reports, we have 
a good handle on the numbers which make our economy work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of tax cuts, we have been around that a number of 
times.  That argument is over.  It is very clear the government 
needs to address the level of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We make a mistake if we assume that tax cuts are it.  I do not 
argue for a minute that tax cuts are not part of it; what I 
suggest is that tax cuts are not all of it.  What I am hearing 
from some speakers is that this is somehow a panacea to make the 
economy work in some magical way:  let us eliminate government 
altogether; let us cut taxes so much that we are actually giving 
money to be Canadians.  I do not know where this ridiculous 
argument ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the forces at play in our economy today, 
especially globalization, dismantling and devolving the federal 
government at this time is sheer lunacy. It is very opportune 
politics to go around and ask people if they think they pay too 
much tax.  We would have to go into many doughnut stores before 
we would find somebody who said, “No, I want to pay more”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fundamentally misleading to talk about American level 
taxation unless we want to talk about American level social 
spending.  If Canadians are confronted with that reality they may 
say that yes, everybody wants to pay less tax, but what they 
really want is to get value for their expenditures. I want to 
leave the numbers aside because it is not all about numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to my Reform colleague. I would 
suggest to him that somehow burying our heads in a pail of 
pay stubs is not going to provide the vision that Canadians will 
require in terms of leadership from the federal government on the 
verge of the new millennium.  We have to look for that kind of 
balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly had a short term crisis.  With a $42 billion 
deficit we were essentially up to our ass in alligators, but we 
are over that now.  Through the fiscal management and commitment 
of all Canadians and the hard work of the committee, we got 
ourselves to a crossroads.  The decisions we have to make at that 
crossroads are whether we will continue to have our planning 
horizon mirror the election cycle or will we think three, four, 
five, six, seven generations down the line and start making some 
of the decisions that will make our economy sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of people who are in on this debate is interesting. 
It took the premier of Ontario all of 24 hours to break his 
self-imposed rule that he was not going to comment on areas of 
federal jurisdiction.  The premier of Ontario is calling on the 
federal government to put in a balanced budget law which 
essentially makes it illegal to run a deficit.  It is big brother 
at its worst, that somehow we can come up with decision making 
algorithms and eliminate the human side of government altogether, 
that we can put these things in a formula and the computers will 
govern the country for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprisingly I have to say that I agree with Mr. Harris.  We 
should not go into deficits in this country but I would argue 
that his definition of deficit is far too narrow.  I would gladly 
support statutory regulations that prevent us from going into 
social deficits and from going into environmental deficits as 
well because that is where we have some very serious problems.  I 
would like us to address literacy issues with the same vigour 
that we are addressing some of the tax reforms that members are 
talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of specific areas for tax reform, as a member of the 
subcommittee on persons with disabilities I would offer as a 
suggestion, and unfortunately it did not make the report, that we 
need to look at the way the tax system treats people with 
disabilities.  They are required to use the medical exemption 
which is an exemption designed for catastrophic health events in 
a person's life on an ongoing basis.  This is a very difficult 
deduction for people with disabilities to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope and trust that our government, as we flavour the next 
budget as a children's budget, will make sure we capture in that 
envelope children with disabilities. It is important that all 
Canadians share in the economic growth that we have been enjoying 
in the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to my Conservative colleague who 
is, I understand, an economist.  I am not, although I must say I 
held up my end of the bell curve in a few economics classes.  He 
talked rather flippantly about having a hypocrisy tax on the 
Liberals and somehow that would get us out of debt. 
In all seriousness, I would suggest to him that maybe we should 
put in place a failure to learn from one's mistakes tax because 
of the Conservative's stand on the referendum law.  That party's 
members need to learn the lesson of sitting around the table with 
separatists when trying to run this country.  It is not too late 
for them to change their mind.  The Reform Party did it and it 
seems to have worked.  They need to come onboard, but I will 
leave that alone because it is obviously salt in a widening 
wound.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to recognize the NDP member for 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar on his maiden speech.  I thought it 
was an excellent speech.  The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle then 
got up and again picked up on some very positive themes.  They 
are themes I am mirroring here today in terms of there being more 
to it than economics and crunching the numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Regina then made a fatal mistake when he talked 
about half the surplus going to spending, half going to debt 
reduction and half going to tax reduction.  Apart from being 
impossible in terms of geometry, it is that third half of money 
that the NDP does not have a sense of reality about.  We have to 
pay for these things.  To somehow invent a new half, apart from 
the fact that it defies the laws of physics, it also does not 
resonate with voters.  Having gone through the debt and the 
deficit and the cycle of spending and taxing, the voters 
understand that at the end of the day we have to pay the piper. 
We cannot spend money we do not have.  It is a rather old adage 
but it does not hurt to remind ourselves of that from time to 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on the repeated references to the GDP.  It is a 
real fallacy in the country when we link our well-being to gross 
domestic product.  Economic indicators are important but they do 
not tell the whole story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the fact that when children get asthma because 
of air pollution, the price of their inhalers is added to the 
GDP.  When we have wells go bad in rural Canada because of 
groundwater problems, rural Canadians buy bottled water, and that 
is added to the GDP.  When people replace stolen property or put 
security systems in their homes, that increases our GDP.  When 
the insurance industry has to spend billions of dollars, as it 
did in eastern Ontario after the ice storm, because of 
increasingly violent weather events, our GDP goes up.  When 
planes crash off of Peggy's Cove, our GDP goes up.  As a nation 
and as the new millennium is looking us in the face, the beans 
need to be counted but we do not govern by the numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not unlike driving a bus full of Canadians barrelling down 
the road, staring at the speedometer.  From repeated 
consultations I have had with groups across the country, the 
people of Canada are looking out the windows.  They are expecting 
the government to take some leadership, certainly in the area of 
sustainable economies, but they also want to see us move toward 
sustainable social systems where all people share in the benefits 
that are generated and certainly in sustainable environmental 
policies.  At the end of the day, air, water and soil are 
fundamentally important to the well-being of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be

Dauphin—Swan River, Gun Control.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am splitting my time.  I am pleased to 
speak today on the prebudget allotted time.  However, I have to 
question this exercise which has gone on for months now.  The 
finance committee has travelled across the country hearing from 
every group of the political spectrum.  I was on this committee 
for some of its travels and I sat through many of the hearings 
here on the Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The all-party Standing Committee on Finance has now filed its 
prebudget report with the House.  It is entitled “Budget 2000: 
New Era, New Plan”, and has 45 recommendations.  My prediction 
is that the finance minister's budget will not resemble our 
committee's recommendations, just as it has been every year with 
the Liberals in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The feedback I received from across the country centred around 
tax relief.  Not every group that presented testimony called for 
tax relief.  Many Liberals and socialists were calling for 
further program spending. 
In fact, I am certain that some would like to see the entire 
surplus put toward spending initiatives.  They would choke us all 
with big government.  However, I would say that the majority 
spoke passionately about the need for tax relief.  Whether it was 
relief on the capital gains tax, income tax or just taxes in 
general, the theme was the same.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the committee, the members of parliament on both 
sides of the House spent much time listening to the grassroots 
tell them what was needed in the next federal budget.  At the end 
of the day, members will ask themselves if it was worth it.  We 
in the House know that the committee passed a controversial 
amendment on the unwise 50:50 plan of spending balanced with tax 
relief and debt reduction only to have this reversed the next 
when the word came down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees in this place are run like a dictatorship.  It is the 
government's way or it is no way.  Canadians need to know that 
their voices mean little to this administration as evidenced over 
the years by what the government has brought forward in policy. 
Walter Robinson of the Taxpayers Federation makes the parallel of 
the prebudget to a Hollywood movie.  The previews look really 
good, but when we show up and pay we are really disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has, from its inception, been calling for tax relief. 
Reformers are not alone in this view.  The Canadian Institute of 
Chartered Accountants said that tax reduction would significantly 
increase economic growth and employment.  The Certified General 
Accountants Association agree.  The International Monetary Fund 
is pushing for Canada to abandon its 50:50 plan and begin 
tackling the $570 billion debt more aggressively, in addition to 
giving extensive tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce does not want to see tax 
reduction take a back seat to new program spending.  The C.D. 
Howe Institute says that Canadians are underemployed, overtaxed 
and unproductive in comparison to many of our trading partners. 
The OECD says that Ottawa should give the highest priority to 
cutting personal taxes, accelerating its reductions in EI 
surpluses and work with provincial governments to lower business 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are respectable groups in the financial community.  They 
are all saying the same thing, of what is a wise course to build 
a better country for everyone, especially for those of low or no 
income.  How can the Minister of Finance, the Prime Minister and 
the caucus be so out of touch with reality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know about the Liberal plan and they know that is much 
about image, about favouring the sectors that support them and 
about playing the role of benevolence to an electorate that is 
supposed to be appreciatively grateful for what it has done for 
them.  In other words, the more surplus the more lolly the 
ministers can dole out to friends in their ridings.  A case in 
point is the transitional jobs fund for which the Liberals' 
behaviour with just that one program should be evidence enough 
for them to be sent packing after the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has a great plan, a plan that will bring Canada back to 
standing firmly on sound economics and fiscal responsibility, 
capable of protecting Canadians from troubles in other countries. 
Much of it has been laid out in the committee minority report and 
I urge everyone to read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues before me have spoken at length about our 
plan, and I will try again to highlight a few of the points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we would scrap the unwise 50:50 promise.  I think if we 
asked Liberal members today most would agree.  Members across may 
scoff at this, but if this were not true, why did such an 
amendment pass the committee last week?  This is an embarrassment 
for them because they know we are correct.  They know that the 
Liberal members who voted in favour of scraping the 50:50 in 
committee are correct. The kind of underhanded scheming that went 
on in the finance committee to change it in the last minute was 
deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Reform would reduce the capital gains tax.  I will refer 
to the United States for a minute to show a chronology of what 
happened when it tinkered with the capital gains tax rate. 
Between 1970 and 1977, the capital gains tax in the United States 
increased.  Revenues collected from this tax decreased.  In 1978, 
the rate was cut sharply and revenues soared.  In 1987, the rate 
was raised again and revenues stagnated.  In 1997, the rate was 
in the 10% to 20% range and the result was that revenues from the 
adjustment increased by 40%.  The numbers do not lie.  Why is the 
minister and the government ignoring what is so plain and simple 
to everyone else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Reform would eliminate bracket creep.  I will read what 
the OECD said about bracket creep.  It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The burden on Canadian taxpayers has increased over the last 
several years largely as a result of a non-indexed tax system. 
The lack of full indexation has pushed around 20 per cent of tax 
filers into higher tax brackets over the past ten years, 
resulting in increasing average tax rates at all income levels 
(although proportionately more for low- and middle-income 
individuals). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that the average worker receives a cost of living 
raise, that person could possibly be moved into a higher tax 
bracket, pay higher taxes and in fact probably never notice the 
raise.  That person may even see their income decrease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past 12 years, bracket creep has pulled more than a 
million low income Canadians into the income tax net.  Most of 
these are the working poor who, under the Reform plan, would pay 
no tax.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that the Liberals, who have always 
pretended to take the side of the disadvantaged, would not be 
doing everything in their power to eliminate bracket creep. 
Reformers, on the other hand, are advocating fairness for 
Canadians.  Why will the Liberals not follow suit?  They are 
raising revenue via the back door.  It is underhanded and it is 
simply wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, Reform would hold the line on spending.  This is 
something dear to the hearts of the Liberals, the desire to 
spend.  Next to the NDP, no other political party in the country 
spends like the Liberals.  Spending allows cabinet ministers to 
dole out sweet deals to their supporters.  We do not have to look 
any further than the transitional jobs fund, a program for 
creating jobs in federal ridings where the unemployment rate is 
supposed to be above 12%.  According to the national accounts of 
Canada, government program spending has never been higher than it 
is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the numbers.  In 1997-98, the Liberals 
overspent by $2.95 billion or 2.79%.  Budget 1997 planned 
spending was $105.8 billion; actual spending was $108.8 billion. 
It gets worse.  In 1998-99, the Liberals overspent by $6.9 
billion or 7%.  Budget 1998 planned expenditures were $104.5 
billion but actual spending was $111.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999-2000, all indications point again to overspending and a 
budget plan that already has in it fat, questionable categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in the prairies are suffering, yet the government says 
that it has no money.  The RCMP is understaffed in British 
Columbia, yet the government put millions into a flawed gun 
registration program.  The residential crisis of leaky condos in 
British Columbia cries out for help, yet the Liberals are 
nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is not saying that government should not spend money. 
What we are calling for is control on spending and a more 
reasonable reallocation.  Where is the expenditure management 
program that was once in place?  This needs to be a permanent 
fixture whether or not there is a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on about the fiscal mismanagement of the 
Liberals since they took office in 1993.  They are truly not wise 
managers of the public trust.  There needs to be a change in the 
leadership of this country.  I am not referring to the current 
Prime Minister stepping down, for when I look at the team bench, 
the replacements would not help very much.  Canadians are asking 
for a fundamental change in the direction of the country, not the 
Liberal version of the so-called balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us reform the budget so that some day the working poor will 
pay no income tax, so that some day seniors on fixed incomes will 
no longer fear the taxman coming, so that some day all taxpayers 
will pay the same percentage rate of taxation, so that some day 
the federal government will live within modest means and help 
rather than hurt, and so that some day we will have viable 
universal medicare for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's fiscal responsibility message has been virtually the 
same since its inception.  I can only imagine how strong Canada 
would be today had our policies been put into place.  Canada's 
story is one of missed opportunity, but we are ready and we have 
the plan.  We have the vision, the vision to lead, the competence 
to manage and the compassion to provide.

speech of the hon. member opposite.  Quite frankly, he has me 
really confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read different media releases that the Reform Party has 
put out and they are all contradictory.  Reformers talk about 
wanting to give a $2,500 tax break across the board to Canadians. 
They want to put new spending into defence, education, health and 
social services.  Let us take a look at what they are talking 
about, and then I will pose my question to the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada there are 30 million people.  Of those, there are 14 
million taxpayers. 
If we gave each taxpayer back $100 in a tax break across the 
board, it would cost the federal government $1.4 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a hundred bucks?  It is nothing.  The taxpayer will 
probably want $1,000 or close to the $2,500 the Reform Party is 
talking about.  That $1,000 would cost the Government of Canada 
$14 billion.  The $2,500 that the Reform Party is tossing about 
would amount to almost $40 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member does all this spending and cuts all this 
money out of revenue, does this mean to say that the Reform Party 
will take Canada back into deficit spending? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess we have heard the 
backward thinking of the Liberals who somehow think that ever 
increasing higher taxes brings higher revenue.  It is exactly the 
opposite.  I just pointed that out by using the American example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the unwise spending within the envelope.  I 
have pointed out how the Liberals cannot even keep to their own 
projected budget, but we need reallocation of wiser spending 
within that budget envelope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recount the story of the lost opportunity of growth 
in the economy because of high taxes.  It is not merely a dispute 
or discussion over dividing up the size of my share of the pie 
versus another portion of the pie.  It is also how we grow a 
bigger pie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue at this point in international economics looking at 
Canada's overall situation in the world economy is that we are 
overtaxed.  The highest priority at this point has to be giving 
real tax relief to average Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK323"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, once again I am also a little baffled by my Liberal 
colleague's inability to understand that the government is 
responsible for spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He seems to believe that tax cuts cannot be given to individuals 
because we have to keep spending more and more money.  That is 
the fallacy of the 50:50 plan over there.  They continue on the 
path of wanting to spend 50% of the surplus and on the path of a 
lot of other wasteful spending that they are doing right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. colleague expand on that misunderstanding?  The 
Liberal government just does not seem able to grasp that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will use the example of 
medicare which is dear to the hearts of Canadians.  When we 
describe the difference between an American and a Canadian, we 
often find Canadians saying that they have a wonderful medicare 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we provide safety and surety for medicare into the long 
term to ensure that it will always be there?  With increasing 
demands, looking at the changing demographic characterization of 
Canadian society, we will have quite an economic pressure on our 
medicare plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which party in the House will ensure in its economic plan that 
we have viable universal medicare?  It is the Reform plan, by 
first of all going after tax reduction.  That is how we will 
ensure and guarantee that we have the available resources to pay 
for medicare.  In other words, we need a vibrant economy to 
generate the wealth to pay for the social programs we so desire. 
<P><A NAME="LINK324"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is an honour to rise on behalf of the people of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla to speak to the prebudget debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate to mention that as we close the House that we 
have some 4,500 Canadians serving abroad in the Canadian armed 
forces on missions who will not be sharing this holiday season 
with their families.  I think the House would join me in 
congratulating those members of the Canadian armed forces for 
their hard work in the year 1999 and to wish them the very best 
this holiday season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My subject today on the prebudget debate will be defence. 
In 1994 the federal government formed the special joint committee 
to review Canada's defence policy to answer the question of what 
principles, purposes and objectives should guide our government 
in setting defence policy in a rapidly changing world. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special joint committee of which I was a member studied the 
issue for eight months and literally interviewed hundreds of 
witnesses from coast to coast and internationally.  The special 
joint committee concluded that there was a limit to which defence 
spending cuts and personnel reductions could go without 
compromising the combat capability of the Canadian armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommended to the Liberal government at that time in 1994 
that the Department of National Defence should maintain a core 
budget of at least $10.5 billion and personnel levels of the 
regular force were not to fall below 66,700.  I stress that at 
that time these figures were absolute minimums.  Any cuts below 
these figures would require a corresponding decrease in the 
commitments of our troops and any increase in commitments would 
require additional funding to the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response the Liberal government issued its 1994 white paper 
which laid out the groundwork for its declared official defence 
policy.  In the document the government went to great lengths to 
state officially that it was the policy of the Liberal government 
to maintain combat capable forces.  I quote from that 1994 white 
paper which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government has concluded that the maintenance of 
multipurpose, combat-capable forces is in the national interest. 
It is only through the maintenance of such forces that Canada 
will be able to retain the necessary degree of flexibility and 
freedom of action when it comes to the defence of its interests 
and the projection of its values abroad. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The white paper further states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs armed forces that are able to operate with the 
modern forces maintained by our allies and like-minded nations 
against a capable opponent—that is, able to fight alongside the 
best, against the best. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since making these lofty proclamations the Liberal government 
has broken its stated defence policy by consciously pursuing a 
defence policy that has literally stripped the Canadian armed 
forces of combat capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have accomplished this in several ways.  First, 
they have begun to pursue a foreign policy based on the fluffy 
and cuddly concept of soft power and human security.  I will 
quote the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the defence minister's 
senior, who sees little value in the concept of a combat capable 
force.  In the 1997 issue of the <I>International Journal</I> he 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A country's image is key to the use of soft power.  An attractive 
set of values and an image as a trustworthy partner encourages 
other countries to consider and weigh our views. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to soft power by saying that it: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—blurs, even counters, the perception of traditional power 
assets, such as military force. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that this idea of influencing other nations by 
using Canada's image as a country full of nice folks with nice 
values just does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at how influential the foreign affairs minister was 
with the military junta that took over Pakistan recently.  Does 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs really think Saddam Hussein or 
Slobadan Milosevic will really mend their ways after hearing 
about Canada's great values?  It just will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically even the creator of the soft power concept, Joseph 
Nye, understood that soft power meant nothing without hard power 
or military assets to back up that concept.  Also the Liberal 
government slashed defence spending a whopping 24% to just over 
$9 billion, far below what was recommended in the 1994 special 
joint committee report.  This has literally gutted the Canadian 
armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe many of my Liberal colleagues across the way, in 
particular those who sit on the defence committee, would agree 
with this point.  The Liberal members, the Reform members and the 
Conservative member supported the defence committee's first 
report to the House calling for significant increases in defence 
spending as a percentage of GDP over the next five years.  The 
finance committee has recognized the urgency of the situation and 
has recommended a five year increase for national defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results of these massive cuts to defence spending were very 
predictable. 
Personnel had to be cut to 60,000, far below that which we 
recommended in the special joint committee and a dramatic drop 
from the 87,000 personnel we had in 1987.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Conference of Defence Associations that 
appeared before the defence committee today, this number has 
fallen to about 56,000 or 57,000 because national defence cannot 
afford to replace the people it is losing through attrition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know manpower is essential to our combat capability. 
The army is particularly hard hit with personnel at only 65% of 
what is needed to achieve combat capability.  The Conference of 
Defence Associations told the defence committee today that 
Canada's forces would be hard pressed to fulfil the Liberal 
government's 1994 white paper commitment to field a combat 
capable brigade size force.  It argued that the Canadian army is 
really only combat capable at the company level, which is about 
150 troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, with a population of some 30 million people, we are 
only capable of fielding a company of 150 personnel that are 
combat capable.  We have seen how stretched our two battalions 
are in Kosovo and Bosnia.  We have to bring home our battalion of 
1,300 troops from Kosovo because we cannot effectively sustain 
two battalions in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The army is getting so desperate that two weeks ago, members 
might have read in the press, Colonel Howard Marsh advised the 
government contrary to the government's own white paper on 
defence that it should cut the army to 10,000 personnel from the 
current 20,000 and make up the difference by using high tech 
gadgets.  This idea is absolutely ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conference of Defence Associations stated today that even 
with the army at its current size of 20,000 it is far too small. 
High tech gadgets will not make up the difference for the crucial 
role played by highly trained individuals in the army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last month the Conference of Defence Associations stated 
during hearings before the finance committee that the Canadian 
forces were on the verge of a major breakdown in combat 
capability, unless the defence budget was increased by at least 
$500 million, climbing to $1.5 billion over the next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for me to mention again the mismanagement of the 
Sea King helicopters by the Liberal government.  We have been 
waiting for six years for a replacement for the Sea King 
helicopter.  Canadians still wait and this is unacceptable.  We 
probably will not have replacement helicopters until the year 
2008.  They are literally falling apart.  Pieces are flying 
through the air from Sea King helicopters.  They need to be 
replaced and they need to be replaced now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has broken its stated defence policy 
which claims Canada must have combat capable forces.  Instead the 
Liberal government has consciously pursued a defence policy that 
has stripped our Canadian forces of much of its combat 
capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we get to the point of no return the official opposition 
calls on the Liberal government to increase defence spending by 
at least $2 billion over the next two years to reverse this 
decline in the combat capability of the Canadian armed forces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK325"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Okanagan—Coquihalla gave a very thoughtful speech. My 
question has to do with some of the responses the member received 
from the defence minister when it comes to questions of how 
stretched Canada's military is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both in response to questions about our ability to do 
peacekeeping and about our ability to keep the Sea King 
helicopters in the air, the minister has always assured the 
public that everything is okay and that they are not stretched 
beyond their capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my friend would care to react to that.  It sounds to 
me like there is a contradiction.  My friend is saying there is a 
huge problem and the Minister of National Defence is saying there 
is no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is absolutely 
correct.  The Minister of National Defence continually leads the 
Canadian public to believe that we do not have a serious problem 
with our defence forces and that every time a mission comes up it 
seems Canada is able to respond very quickly. 
The problem is that places tremendous stress on our troops.  At 
this time, some 4,500 army troops are serving outside the 
country.  That means three times that amount are needed to 
maintain that 4,500 figure.  The reason is that 4,500 people are 
training to go on that mission, there are the 4,500 who are 
deployed on that mission already, and then recuperation time is 
needed, so there are another 4,500 people who have just returned 
from the mission and are taking time with their families and 
undergoing debriefing and training opportunities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of Canada's always being there and deploying 
more people with the budget constantly declining and the 
government foisting more missions on the armed forces is a very 
desperate situation that has come to a crossroads. We like to 
point these things out constantly to the Canadian public, but we 
always hear quite the opposite from the defence minister and the 
foreign affairs minister that everything seems to be fine. The 
Canadian public should realize this is a desperate situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian public has given its support to the Canadian armed 
forces in the missions we operate in around the world.  It is 
time for the government to give the people in the Canadian armed 
forces the tools they need to do their job, whether it be 
peacekeeping or whether it be a combat role in hot spots around 
the world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK326"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the input from all 
members as we continue this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am puzzled with the position of the Reform Party.  In their 
platform Reformers talked about tax reductions but not starting 
until the year 2000.  We would not have had any tax cuts at all. 
The Liberal government has already implemented tax cuts of 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their platform they talk about a tax cut package that in the 
third year of their proposal would cost the federal treasury $26 
billion.  They also talk about an equal amount against paying 
down the debt.  That is $26 billion in year three for tax cuts 
and $26 billion for paying down the debt.  If my arithmetic is 
correct, that is $52 billion.  When I look at the document 
released by the finance minister a month ago and the surpluses 
projected forward by 11 of Canada's leading economists, it shows 
that in year three the surplus would be at a level of $12.5 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the other Reform member was talking about increased 
expenditure on defence.  Other members of the Reform Party have 
talked about increased expenditures on farm income relief. How 
does the arithmetic add up?  How does this package fit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has his facts and 
figures wrong.  As has been pointed out, we would have offered 
tax relief in 1997 with the return of the $7 billion UI fund.  To 
get to the heart of the matter and how we can say that we want to 
increase defence spending, we would not waste as much money as 
the Liberal government wastes on unnecessary items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to go very far back to remember a $25 million 
program where we were giving out free flags to the Canadian 
public when the people in Bosnia and Croatia did not have the 
proper clothing to wear.  The government wasted $25 million there 
and sent our military personnel literally having to exchange 
helmets and flak jackets as one unit was getting on the plane to 
come home and the other unit was getting off the plane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would tell the government that its priority in spending is out 
of whack 100%, it has been for years, the Canadian public has 
financed the deficit reduction the government takes claim for, 
and it is time to return that money to the Canadian public and 
use the priorities we as the official opposition have suggested 
to re-fund, for example in defence.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

<A NAME="LINK336">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK337"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with pleasure that I rise today to talk about the first report 
of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to talk about the process because the content 
of the report is only as good as the process that preceded it. 
Coming from Women's College Hospital in Toronto where the motto 
was non quo sed quomodo, it is not what we do but how, I would 
like to celebrate the fact that this is a process by which our 
Liberal government can be extraordinarily proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No longer, as with previous governments, does the budget get 
written in secret after a series of one on one meetings with the 
finance minister, clearly influenced only by those who were able 
to secure such a meeting, largely because of their elevated 
positions in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the committee hearings and submissions and the town 
hall meetings held by 62 of our members of parliament, we feel 
that Canadians have been properly consulted. It is not surprising 
therefore that the Minister of Finance's budgets are so well 
received when people can see their own advice in the budgets as 
they are tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of parliament for St. Paul's I believe that the 
best antidote to the cynicism and apathy that really threatens 
our democracy is a commitment to real consultation and the 
participation of citizens in the policy process.  Citizen 
engagement must be genuine and it is not good enough that 
governments and parliamentarians consult. Citizens must feel that 
they are being given the opportunity to actually shape public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Oak 
Ridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peter Newman said that politics in Canada has always been the 
art of making the necessary possible.  Therefore deciding what is 
necessary must be a political decision.  Deciding what is 
necessary must be done by politicians in true partnership with 
the citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prebudget consultation is an excellent example of a process 
whereby all Canadians have the opportunity to provide input into 
the priorities that define our country.  The budget making 
process is where we receive input into the tools we have at our 
disposal to help ensure that the necessary becomes possible: debt 
retirement, taxation as well as tax relief, and strategic 
investments in program spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year I had the opportunity to chair four consultations on 
the budget; a town hall in St. Paul's, an invitational round table 
in St. Paul's, a special meeting of the Liberal women's caucus 
with the finance minister, as well as yesterday's round table of 
the subcommittee on persons with disabilities on the tax 
treatment of persons with disabilities and families with children 
with disabilities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first such consultation which was submitted to the finance 
committee was held in St. Paul's on November 8.  The clear 
consensus in the room was that affordable housing was 
extraordinarily important to all issues around the true 
disposable income of Canadians, and that all levels of government 
must do whatever they can to make shelter possible for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also a clear consensus on the need for proper tax 
relief, that the amount of disposable income families have is for 
snowsuits and snow boots for kids.  Families, in particular low 
and middle income families, need to have money to spend, and this 
year as we focus on children it should be for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that in terms of our economy the need for a 
vibrant and accountable health care system was agreed upon by 
everyone in the room, as well as employment strategies and a 
focus on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While affordable housing and tax relief topped the list of 
budgetary suggestions at the meeting, it was clear there were 
underlying issues to be addressed.  The constituents of St. 
Paul's wanted to know that they were receiving good quality 
social services for their tax investments.  They were asking the 
federal government to take the initiative in protecting the 
things they value most as Canadians:  access to shelter, a 
quality health care system, employment, and protection of the 
environment for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this new age of surplus, constituents would like to see 
measurable outcomes that demonstrate that their taxes are being 
well spent. They would like to have confidence that we will 
ensure that basic needs of all Canadians are met.  They 
understand that good social spending is also good economic 
spending and economic policy and will result in a secure future 
for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At our prebudget round table, it was interesting that a 
consensus emerged on the need for the federal government to 
articulate a clear, long term economic and social vision based on 
Canadian values.  Like the finance committee, they felt that we 
should be rolling out a vision over more than one year.  Their 
issues of greatest concern were tax relief, debt reduction, 
poverty, homelessness and the children's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in attendance felt that the government must lead the way in 
long term planning, setting outcomes and filling the gaps within 
a framework that reflects Canadian values.  They wanted to ensure 
that good social policy was viewed as good economic policy. The 
consensus was that in order for us to maintain a decent social 
infrastructure, growing the pie and the economic strength of our 
country are extraordinarily important in reaching that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the round table, they felt we must ensure that productivity 
in the growth of the country occurs.  It must be addressed in a 
long term, systemic way.  If the government were to articulate 
long term plans, people would see their needs as being met. The 
feeling was that the government must not expect to run every 
aspect of life, but it must recognize clearly where it has a long 
term impact and harmonize its actions with other levels and 
partners to ensure its long term success. They wanted frequent 
reviews of government programs to see how effective they have 
been upon implementation to ensure that outcomes are being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We felt extremely heartened by the new efforts and initiatives 
of the treasury board to look at outcomes and the performance 
indicators of those outcomes in terms of the future of smart 
spending in the country and in knowing that we will fund programs 
only if they are shown to be, as we used to call in medicine, 
evidence based practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At their meeting the Liberal women's caucus reflected what they 
had been hearing in their constituencies.  It was a very similar 
shopping list in terms of the budget.  A lot of those things have 
been reflected in the finance committee report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was not in the finance committee report but the women's 
caucus feels strongly about, is that all aspects of public 
policy, in particular budget items, require a gender based 
analysis.  We must make sure that there is no discrimination of 
gender by all policies and it must be done before things come to 
the point of being a budget allocation.  We were heartened by the 
commitment of the Minister of Finance to meet with the Secretary 
of State for the Status of Women and the President of the 
Treasury Board to actually look at how that could be articulated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday it was extremely interesting to receive the experts on 
the issue of tax and families with disabilities.  I would like to 
draw members' attention to some of the things that were 
articulated at yesterday's meeting.  I am thrilled that a lot of 
these things were in the finance committee report, but I would 
like to underline the things that we feel most strongly about or 
that there would seem to be consensus at the round table about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Defending the child tax deduction for parents of children with 
disabilities would clearly benefit both low and middle income 
earners.  The experts wanted to see an index or an adjustment to 
the various credits and deductions claimed by persons with 
disabilities and their families to deal with the increasing cost 
to them due to the lack of indexation.  They wanted more 
technical aids and services added to the list of expenses for the 
medical expense tax credit.  Clearly there was a consensus to 
broaden the definition of eligibility in the disability tax 
credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are particularly concerned about people with cystic fibrosis. 
For some reason in the current definition of disability, in 
activities related to daily living, breathing has been left out. 
People who have a great deal of difficulty breathing are not 
included in the disability tax credit.  We feel that is a modest 
expansion that would seriously help the 600 to 900 adults with 
cystic fibrosis to participate as full citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are requesting that the Canada study grants received by 
persons with disabilities be not treated as taxable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was interest in a new savings vehicle modelled on the 
registered retirement savings plan that would encourage private 
savings to support individuals with mental and physical 
disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think there should be more generous and consistent tax 
treatment of the costs of attendant care and that the income tax 
guide should be clarified so that taxpayers with disabilities and 
their families can more clearly understand the applicable tax 
measures and act accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were thrilled to see in the finance committee report strong 
support for the renewal of the opportunities fund, and we are 
hoping for accessibility standards that would become benchmarks 
in the national children's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely heartening to see so many of the social 
infrastructure programs clearly identified in the finance 
committee report. 
<P><A NAME="LINK338"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for her intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the committee report with interest and I certainly want 
to commend the members of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an aspect of the report that dealt with increased 
savings for Canadians.  Certainly we are all attempting to 
encourage Canadians to increase their savings for retirement. 
There was a recommendation in the report that called for an 
additional $2,000 increase in the RRSP limits.  The RRSP limits 
are currently scheduled to increase by $1,000 increments, which 
would give a $2,000 increase to the limits as they stand today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member confirm for me whether the recommendation 
of the committee would actually push these limits up to $17,500 
over the five year period? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member often talks about smart spending.  I want her to 
focus on the health file for a second.  The Canadian Healthcare 
Association talks about investing money more strategically in 
service delivery.  I would like the hon. member to take a moment 
to focus on smart spending and service delivery in the health 
care file and describe for the House in some detail what she sees 
as smart spending in the health care file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to affirm 
to the hon. member that the increase of $2,000, I believe, having 
attended a great number of the finance committee meetings, was in 
addition to the already scheduled increases.  I think he will be 
relieved to hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of smart spending in health care, I was extremely 
interested in the brief of the Canadian Healthcare Association, 
which said that putting more money into the health care system, 
even if were available, would not be the answer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are extremely worried that accountability in the health care 
system is not there.  As we know from some of the briefs, 60% of 
the things that are being done in health care, as we speak, have 
never been subjected to any sort of evidence based practice.  As 
was recommended in the finance committee report, we have to make 
sure that there is money for information technology and the 
ability to practise evidence based medicine as well as research 
into health care delivery.  We need proper data in terms of how 
we deliver health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of us were very impressed by the University of Ottawa and 
Queen's University study of the sustainability of the health care 
system.  It showed that if we actually moved to best practices, 
or moved people to the right level of care, there would be $7 
billion in savings annually in Canada.  Many briefs said that 
this was not about dollars, it was about mismanagement.  We need 
a real system instead of this patchwork quilt of non-systems.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to participate in the debate on the upcoming year 2000 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through successive budgets the government has continued to build 
on a strong fiscal foundation that began in 1993.  At that time 
our economic condition was in a serious state of disrepair.  We 
had a $42 billion deficit, high unemployment and sluggish 
investor confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the government has rolled up its sleeves and 
presented to Canadians a clear vision of how to get things 
straight.  Canadians understood that large deficits and an 
astronomical debt would cripple Canada for generations to come if 
we did not act, and act we did.  Canadians embraced the deficit 
reduction strategies of the government.  Together we have been 
able to eliminate the deficit, bring in balanced budgets and 
forecast further balanced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99 Canada balanced the books for the first time since 
1951-52.  The government has continued to operate deficit free. 
For the coming millennium we will continue our prudent spending, 
continue to balance the books and offer Canadians further tax 
cuts.  I can think of no greater gift to offer young people, our 
future generations, than a deficit free government, lower taxes 
and a strong economic and fiscal atmosphere that supports growth 
and development by continued investment in the talents of our 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 2000 the Minister of Finance will continue on this 
path by announcing further tax cuts for Canada.  I have always 
been a strong advocate of calling for tax cuts.  Many of my 
constituents want tax cuts as well.  I recently conducted a 
survey in my riding asking constituents what they would like to 
see in the upcoming budget.  Close to 75% of those who responded 
chose tax cuts and debt reduction as the top two issues that 
needed to be addressed in the upcoming federal budget.  Continued 
funding for health care in Canada ranked a close third, at 70%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share some of the direct comments of my 
constituents with the House today:  “Lower taxes, both personal 
and corporate, can help to create and retain jobs in Canada.  Tax 
cuts should focus more on lower and middle income people and 
families”.  “I believe lower national debts are a key 
foundation to a stronger economy and the benefits of long term 
growth.  Get the debt behind us and Canada can become a stronger 
nation”.  “Continued fiscal responsibility, as already 
demonstrated by Mr. Martin, is required”.  “Seeing as children 
and youth are our priority, the only responsible action in the 
federal budget is to make debt payment the top and only priority 
for surplus funds.  It is not fair to the next generation to 
burden them with debt created by this generation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canadians know what they want.  They want a 
fiscally responsible government which is willing to take action 
to end the overspending of the past and to make sure that we have 
cleared the slate for future generations.  By getting our fiscal 
house in order we can concentrate on other issues.  We can create 
an atmosphere where job creation strives and where Canadian 
entrepreneurs can make their mark in the global economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This past November the finance minister brought down his 
economic and fiscal update.  He noted that Canada's economy has 
made tremendous strides.  The economy is now forecast to grow by 
3.6% this year, based on the average of private sector forecasts. 
That is a significant jump from the 2% growth rate that 
economists were forecasting just before last February's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the year 2000 the average growth forecast is 2.9%, again an 
increase over the 2.5% predicted at the time of the budget.  This 
has brought our November 1999 unemployment rate down by 0.3 
percentage points to 6.9%.  That is the lowest level since August 
1981. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our future as a country is indeed bright.  The government will 
continue its commitment to Canadians through strong, continued 
funding for our world renowned universal health care system.  We 
will provide tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize that Canada is a place for business.  We have 
taken great strides to make this so.  We recognize the value of 
innovation, but we know that innovation does not just happen.  It 
requires an investment on our part.  It requires infrastructure. 
We are committed to building a society of security and 
opportunity by helping Canadians to acquire education, knowledge 
and skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will provide continued funding to help our youth reach their 
goals and dreams through the youth employment strategy, the 
Canadian opportunities strategy and the Canada education savings 
grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to speak briefly about another program.  I fully 
support the joint federal-provincial-municipal infrastructure 
program.  The Speech from the Throne committed the government to 
developing a five year physical infrastructure plan with the 
provinces and territories.  It is a prime example of how 
governments can work together for the good of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward with great anticipation to the next federal 
budget.  As the first budget of our new millennium it will set a 
benchmark for all future budgets.  It will clearly demonstrate 
our commitment to providing Canadians with an efficiently run, 
fiscally responsible government, and continued investment in the 
programs and services Canadians have come to expect and deserve.

I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there not a standing order that would allow us to suspend the 
sitting temporarily? I think it would be a shame for my 
colleague from Lotbinière to begin his speech—unless he wants to 
do so—only to be interrupted after one or two minutes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that if 
there is time for questions and comments, I could pose a question 
to the member for Oak Ridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  What we will do is take a few minutes for 
questions and comments, and after that I will go to the hon.

<P><A NAME="LINK341"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
for Oak Ridges for his participation in this debate and for his 
contribution to the thought process for the budget 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member has been very much involved in municipal 
affairs.  I also know that he has taken an active interest in an 
infrastructure program.  In the throne speech, there was mention 
that the government intends to move on an infrastructure program. 
There have been representations by the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities to proceed with an infrastructure program. It 
talks about social infrastructure as well as physical 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could comment on what he would 
like to see if the government proceeds with an infrastructure 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question that 
a national infrastructure program is critical for the economy, 
for the environment and for the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1983, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities proposed an 
infrastructure program involving all orders of government in 
the country. In 1993, the government adopted the national 
infrastructure program of the FCM. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditional infrastructure is roads, sewers, bridges and water. 
The announcement in the Speech from the Throne clearly indicates 
all three orders of government participating.  Municipally 
driven is what I would like to see.  I would like to see that we 
are involving all orders of government in a process by which we 
have at the moment basically a $40 billion deficit in 
infrastructure in the areas that I have just outlined. There is 
no question that over 125,000 direct and indirect jobs were 
created by the last national infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that varies in the proposals in the Speech 
from the Throne is that we actually have a blueprint for five 
years.  We think this is critical when we look at our 
competition, the United States, Europe and elsewhere. I know that 
every member in the House benefited from the national 
infrastructure program.  The mayors of the communities in these 
members' ridings, including my good friends across the way in the 
Reform Party, have benefited very much.  There are some former 
mayors over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program delivered both in terms of job creation and in 
speeding up needed infrastructure programs.  I say to my hon. 
friend that there is no question that by involving all orders of 
government, we will be able to improve our economy by being able 
to move people, certainly through roads being reconstructed—

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK349"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in this most important debate. First of 
all, I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time 
with my colleague from Jonquière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reading the report stemming from the prebudget hearings, 
which was tabled in the House, one can tell that a great deal of 
ambiguity remains concerning the direction the Minister of 
Finance intends to take with the budget to be tabled on or about 
February 22 or February 29, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, the Bloc Quebecois brings out statistics to support 
its criticism of what I always refer to as cooking the books, 
something the Minister of Finance is indulging in with 
increasing frequency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years now, the Bloc Quebecois has been calling for a 
number of things, and I think that the Bloc Quebecois is the 
party that best defends Quebec's interests.  We have called for 
tax cuts, a return to a real EI system, and the return of social 
transfer payments to Quebec and the provinces; we have called 
for support for productive projects, moderate debt reduction, 
and significant efforts to combat poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the gist of what the Bloc Quebecois puts forward 
annually at this time of the year, when the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Finance presents the committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Lotbinière, as everywhere else, we took part in this 
democratic process, in order to find out what the people of 
Lotbinière wanted.  Like all taxpayers in Quebec and in Canada, 
the people in my riding want lower taxes, but not along the 
lines the Minister of Finance is suggesting.  We want tax cuts 
for those who contributed most to helping the federal government 
eliminate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means a tax cut targeted at the middle class.  As for 
middle class, let me explain what I mean.  Statistically, middle 
class in Canada means those earning between $30,000 and $70,000 
a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a riding like my own of Lotbinière, or like Jonquière or any 
others with the same characteristics, semi-urban, semi-rural, the 
middle class is not earning between $30,000 and $70,000 a year; 
often it is earning $15,000, $20,000 or $25,000. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT87"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT87"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1725
<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people often work 40 hours a week, at an hourly rate of 
$8, $9 or $10, and have a lot of trouble making ends meet. They 
are also greatly affected these days by the price of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When travelling throughout Quebec, people probably notice that 
the price of gasoline is quite high in urban centres like Quebec 
City and Montreal. However, if they travel 100 or 150 kilometres 
to regions like Jonquière, Rimouski and Abitibi, they will see 
that the price of gasoline in these areas is very high. What 
does that mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since inflation started to skyrocket in the mid-seventies, 
the price gasoline has had a major impact on the price of 
consumer products. 
When the price of gasoline goes up, the trucker who delivers the 
goods has to increase his rate. Once on the shelves, the goods 
have to be sold at a higher price, and the consumer who buys 
them also has to pay more for gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a real problem for the regions. In the budget being 
prepared for the year 2000, it is anticipated that the 
government will include no measure to help these people, even 
though we are now facing this indirect inflation created with 
the complicity of the oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to this issue, because in the year 2000, as the 
regional development critic for the Bloc Quebecois, along with 
my hon. colleagues, we will be taking major action, including in 
the energy sector, which will be discussed at some length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not want to relive the situation we experienced in the 
mid-1970s when inflation soared. We know what it did to the 
economy of Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to talk about an issue near and dear to my 
heart which, once again, goes unmentioned the report tabled by 
the Standing Committee on Finance, namely employment insurance 
reform. Over the last few weeks, I have been leading an 
awareness campaign in the riding of Lotbinière, inviting people 
to sign a petition condemning this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, within the riding of Lotbinière, there are two 
different rates. The first one is 6.2%, which means that people 
have to work 660 hours to be eligible for benefits. 
At the other end of the riding, the rate is 11.2%. This means 
that people need only work 490 hours. In the same riding, there 
is a difference of 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people come to see us in our riding offices, it is 
difficult to explain to them the injustice that comes from the 
fact that the rate is based on the place of residence. This 
means that, if two persons work for the same company and that 
company closes down or experiences a slowdown, one person may be 
eligible for benefits and the other may be penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the same rates, with the same rights, because of the 
complexity of the map drawn by the Department of Human Resources 
Development, some people in my riding are severely penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as this week, someone who thought he would be 
eligible for benefits with his 635 hours learned that the rate 
had changed. 
It came down to 6.2%, and that person left with the sad news 
that he needed 660 hours to be eligible for benefits. So he did 
not have a choice, he had to turn to income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes the government is proud of the fact that the number of 
people receiving employment insurance benefits is going down. 
This is to be expected, because when unemployed workers no 
longer have access to employment insurance, that have to turn to 
income security. In the statistics, these people are no longer 
considered to be part of the labour force. They have been 
dropped from the statistics.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics are to be used with caution. Yes, the economy is 
getting stronger. However, we must not forget the terrible 
consequences of the employment insurance program. A lot of 
people have to rely on income security now. It is a problem we 
have in the riding of Lotbinière and in most Quebec ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank all those who helped me with this initiative in 
my riding, including the Caisses populaires that circulated the 
petition and the municipalities that sent resolutions supporting 
my initiative. Hundreds of people are still signing the petition 
condemning this social injustice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the holidays, we will take a break, but in the year 2000, 
we will be back at it and we intend to hand over to the Minister 
of Human Resources Development a comprehensive report to make 
her aware of the social injustice affecting the people of 
Lotbinière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regions are also faced with problems at the municipal level. 
When the new governor general delivered the throne speech, we 
all expected the federal government to announce immediate 
measures to help the municipalities. The President of the 
Treasury Board herself told us that they had a project in mind 
and she believed negotiations were under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, to sum it up, a project might be announced in November 
or December 2000. There is a desperate need for action now. This 
measure should already have been announced. Memorandums of 
understanding should already be under negotiation. 
Also, financial support for the municipalities should be 
included in the February 2000 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the municipalities have to upgrade their 
infrastructures and that we previously had three party 
agreements between Quebec, Ottawa and the municipalities that 
worked just fine. The federal government now has a surplus. I 
think it is important that the surplus go to areas where the 
people feel it is most needed: to help the unemployed, to 
support municipalities and to restore transfers for health care 
and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleagues in the National Assembly, the health and social 
services minister, Mrs. Marois, and the education minister, 
François Legault, are having a lot of trouble running their 
departments because of all the cuts the federal government has 
made since 1993. 
Representatives of the federal government say that it has 
increased transfers. This is a joke, it is utter nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cut less than it was supposed to be. We know that 
this government is quite good at marketing. These people are 
trying to show us how good their government is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that the government should reduce taxes to help the 
middle class, come back to a real employment insurance program, 
fully restore the social transfers to Quebec and the other 
provinces, support the positive projects of the municipalities 
and especially put significant effect into the fight against 
poverty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK350"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with a certain sadness that I am rising today to take part in 
the debate on the report of the Standing Committee on Finance 
because there is not much good news in this report tabled just 
before Christmas. It does not contain many measures to alleviate 
human suffering and to bring some hope that next year will be 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this report shows the contempt of the Liberal 
government for the views expressed by the people and by the 
witnesses who appeared before the finance committee or took part 
in the prebudget consultations held by my colleagues, the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of reporting accurately the views expressed by the 
people who said they wanted surpluses to be reinvested in social 
programs, the Liberal majority on the committee preferred to be 
servile and to tell the minister only what he wanted to hear, 
namely that he can keep his surpluses and use them as he sees 
fit for measures that are not essential.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Finance and the finance minister 
deliberately ignore the reality that exists in many regions. 
They prefer to hide their heads in the sand. The reality is that 
the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider every 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a few words about my region. Today, in my region, we 
have to serve meals to children under 12 who, otherwise, would 
not be able to take their classes or would get sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some parents are no longer able to serve three meals a day to 
their children, even if they themselves do not eat their fill. 
That is the reality the Liberals are ignoring because they 
prefer to talk about growth, about the economy and so on. 
During that time, in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, six soup kitchens are 
helping people to survive all year long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, La soupière de l'amitié of Arvida, in my riding, is 
holding its eight fundraising campaign with the help of more 
than 200 volunteers, who collect money to help the 
underprivileged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank those volunteers 
working on the campaign, under the auspices of honorary 
president Monseigneur Jean-Guy Couture, and thank also the people 
of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean for their generous support of the less 
fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has abandoned the population. There is a growing 
number of relief agencies and food banks. This situation should 
not be tolerated. We should never get used to hardship. 
However, it seems to be a sad reality: this government has 
created more hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the prebudget hearings, I consulted with the people from 
my constituency and from Chicoutimi. Incidentally, I would like 
to thank the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for his document 
containing realistic suggestions that take into account the real 
concerns of ordinary people. The people told me that their 
priorities, with respect to how the budget surpluses the finance 
minister thinks are his own should be used, are different from 
the federal government's priorities. They do not want the 
Minister of Finance to loose sight of the fact that these 
surpluses are the result of the considerable sacrifices he has 
imposed through drastic cuts to social programs as well as of 
not indexing the tax tables and taking money out of the pockets 
of the middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, I thank the hon. member for Lotbinière for his 
help in the consultations I have held in my riding. I 
appreciated his co-operation. Many of my constituents have 
suggested priorities, some of which I would like to mention 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my constituents do not necessarily want tax reductions; 
they would rather have the money used to ensure that quality 
services continue to be provided to seniors, the sick and the 
young. Many senior citizens who participated in my consultations 
complained that the money they get from the government and the 
level of taxation do not take into account the expenses people 
who live alone are faced with, be it for maintenance or home 
help, which increase substantially every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many told me that the surplus in the EI fund should be used to 
help communities through assistance and support programs for the 
elderly, to help existing small businesses or new ones getting 
started and to set up an EI fund for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people told me that the surplus the minister is 
bragging about, which came straight out of the pockets of 
ordinary citizens, should be used in part to set up assistance, 
integration and adjustment programs for people between 50 and 60 
who are out of work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of several 50 or 60 year old workers in my riding of 
Jonquière who, unfortunately, have lost their jobs following 
plant closures and who are left with nothing. They cannot get 
training, because, as you know, after spending 30 years in a 
plant, these older workers can hardly go back to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government should be sensitive to the needs of these 
people who are hurting badly. It should restore the POWA 
program, or a new and improved program that better suited to 
their situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government is once again turning a deaf ear. 
It contends that there is nothing wrong, that nobody has to deal 
with this problem on a daily basis. There are things we have to 
do for the future. But right now, people are really stuck with 
this problem, and families are facing considerable hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the people want the government to maintain its social 
transfers. As you know, the federal government has been cutting 
transfers to the provinces for social programs since 1993. Many 
people were furious and spoke against EI, which brings nothing 
but misery. Ten years ago, EI covered 80% of the workers who 
lost their jobs. Nowadays, a mere 40% of the workers are 
eligible, although all of them pay premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that, since 1993, the Liberal 
government's record with regard to the environment has been 
dismal. Apart from engaging in jurisdictional wars with the 
provinces and trying to impose national standards, the federal 
government has not proposed any concrete measures to reduce 
pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the reduction of greenhouse gases, which affect the 
climate, pollution and health, and involve considerable economic 
costs, the federal government still has no clear plan and no 
clear timetable to meet the objectives that it set for itself 
under the Kyoto agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several environmental groups have adopted a more practical 
approach and have proposed concrete measures to the Minister of 
Finance to reduce pollution, such as investing in public transit 
systems or encouraging the transportation of goods by train, 
particularly by special railway cars that can carry trucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is urgent that this government keep its promise to 
invest in new depollution technologies. There is an approach 
that we fully support, because it is a concrete measure that 
would allow industries, farmers and municipalities to reduce 
their levels of pollution when renewing their equipment or 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that in the Jonquière area, as shown in 
a recent federal study, air pollution reaches very high levels. 
We are all waiting anxiously for the federal government to 
co-operate with industries, municipalities and the provincial 
government to make the air cleaner, which would better reflect 
the nature of our region.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario, we have to deal with a premier, Mr. Mike Harris, who 
is using money that should be going to social programs for other 
purposes. Faced with a province that will not support social 
programs, I wonder if the solution would not be for the federal 
government to give more money to charitable and non-profit 
organizations, which in turn could deliver social programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the hon. member that community 
organizations and transfers both come under provincial 
jurisdiction. What have the Liberals done since 1993? They have 
infringed upon jurisdictions when they had no reason to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything that has to do with health care and the 
municipalities also come under provincial jurisdiction. I 
encourage my hon. colleague to tell his government, which has 
way too much money, to give some back to the provinces. I am 
sure they will ensure that the money goes to the people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in the prebudget debate.  As a member 
of the finance committee since 1997 I have had the honour to 
travel across Canada to listen to what Canadians from all walks 
of life have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can carefully say that the mood of the Canadian people is that 
they are quite relieved that the fiscal house of Canada is in 
order.  They are looking forward to more good news.  To put it in 
context, when I became a member of parliament in 1993 and the 
government took office unemployment in Canada was 11.2%.  In 
addition, we were faced with a $42 billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that each and every Canadian was called on to 
bear a share of the burden of getting our fiscal house in order. 
It was an imperative.  Not only was unemployment high, not only 
did we have this deficit, but the debt to GDP was rising.  It 
meant that there was pressure on interest rates.  It was a 
scenario that was not sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the sacrifices that Canadians have made, as a 
result of the prudence that the government has exercised and as a 
result of the good fiscal management and fiscal responsibility 
demonstrated by the government, there is good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a few key points.  The real gross domestic product 
advanced 4.7% in the third quarter of this year, its fourth 
consecutive quarter.  The real consumer spending posted its third 
consecutive quarter of strong growth with an increase of 4.8%. 
Real business investment has grown at an average rate of 11.3%. 
Real goods and services exports surged 15% in the third quarter. 
The current account balance improved dramatically from a $7 
billion deficit to a second quarter surplus of $2.6 billion in 
the third quarter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The healthy economic growth has translated as well into robust 
job creation.  Since December 1997 over 760,000 jobs were created 
and 199,000 of those new jobs were for young Canadians.  The 
unemployment rate has declined.  It is now at a rate of 6.9%. 
That is its lowest level in Canada since August 1981, virtually a 
generation ago.  Both the International Monetary Fund and the 
OECD expect Canada to lead G-7 countries in employment growth in 
1999 and 2000.  Inflationary pressures remain subdued.  The 
consumer price inflation was 2.3% and excluding food and energy 
the inflation was only 1.6%. 
Those are technical points but they paint a picture which 
indicates to Canadians that we have our fiscal house in order.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 2 the Minister of Finance took the opportunity to 
address Canadians in his annual fiscal update.  During that 
update he laid out the scenario as he saw it, using prudent 
assumptions and responsible fiscal management, looking at the 
fundamentals, and accepting the advice of the experts in business 
and industry and the economists of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from the closing of his speech which should give 
Canadians the confidence that the next budget will reflect a step 
in the right direction of addressing the fact that Canadians have 
taken a great deal of the burden over all the years we have taken 
to balance the budget and finally get into a surplus position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will strengthen our economy. We will bring down taxes.  We 
will recast the foundations of individual security.  We will 
forge a culture of innovation.  We will build upon our 
traditional industries and we will build a society that nurtures 
its children like no other. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be very encouraged by the state of the fiscal 
house of Canada.  It is time for Canadians to start discussing 
the strategies they would like to see in terms of how we put 
these things in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the finance committee travelled across Canada and consulted 
with Canadians, it will come as no surprise to members and to 
Canadians at large that depending on whom we were talking to at 
the time the interest areas were certainly different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people in university talked to us about the cost of 
education. They asked us if they could get lower tuitions, if 
they could get better assistance for post-secondary education, a 
very important and noble request that has to be looked at. At the 
other end of the spectrum, a growing segment of the Canadian 
population, our seniors, told us their concerns were the health 
care system and the social security benefits that allow them to 
live in the dignity they have earned and to which they are 
entitled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businessmen told us that they wanted to see changes in the 
corporate tax structure for small businesses, the business sector 
that generates the most jobs in Canada.  They wanted to know if 
they could get an increase in the small business limit from 
$200,000 to $400,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People spoke on behalf of families and children before the 
finance committee.  They talked about the fairness and equity of 
our tax system, the taxation of families with children and the 
issue of one income versus two.  They talked about the EI system. 
They talked about debt reduction.  Large business groups and 
organizations talked about the need to improve benefits under our 
registered retirement savings plans because they want to be able 
to provide for their retirement down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually every segment of society had representation.  The 
disabled had an excellent representation by Community Living 
which came before us and talked about how important it was to 
address the needs of the disabled of our country.  Disabled 
persons often do not get an opportunity to enjoy the dignity and 
quality of life of other Canadians because so much of their time, 
energies and resources are dedicated to meeting their basic needs 
of health and dignity of life.  It is a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members would agree, no matter what party they may come from, 
that the needs of Canadians are diverse.  It is incumbent upon 
the government to balance those needs on a priority basis and to 
ensure that when the budget comes forward we maintain fiscal 
prudence.  The finance minister reminded us that we will not go 
back to a deficit ever again.  Canadians can bank on that. The 
application of fiscal prudence and fiscal responsibility will 
ensure the sustained growth of our economy, which means more 
people will have jobs, have the dignity of those jobs, and enjoy 
Canadian life as every other Canadian.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It really gets down to productivity.  We had a study last year 
in the finance committee on productivity.  In that study there 
was some disagreement among the experts about what it really 
meant, but I think they all concurred that at the end of the day 
it was really an issue of how we improve the quality of life for 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some ways we can do that by delivering benefits directly to 
Canadians.  In other ways it can be done through stimulating the 
economy or through the economic sector so that we increase the 
size of the pie and there is more to share with all Canadians. 
There are many decisions to be made and they should not be taken 
lightly.  We have to acknowledge the important needs of all 
Canadians regardless of their state in life.  I will be splitting 
my time with the member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final comments will be with regard to the report of the 
subcommittee of the finance committee that dealt with the 
taxation of families.  In that report there were four 
recommendations.  The first was to extend parental leave under 
the employment insurance system to a full year for maternity 
benefits.  It is a very important initiative.  I am very pleased 
that the government has embraced it and will be pursuing it in 
the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommended that the government look at how to amend the 
Canada pension plan system to assist Canadians who withdrew from 
the paid labour force to raise a family so that they do not get 
penalized in the CPP structure.  We also recommended that a new 
benefit be introduced under the Canada child tax benefit to 
assist families with children.  Finally, we asked the government 
to look at the child care expense deduction under the Income Tax 
Act to ensure that it continues to meet with policy objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report was commented on by many witnesses before the finance 
committee.  I can tell Canadians and all members that its 
recommendations were well received.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened to this prebudget debate all day, and 
frankly I cannot believe how shortsighted and irresponsible the 
Liberals are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is prepared, if we listen to its comments, to sit 
idly by and oversee the death of medicare.  I thought we were 
here today to talk about the future, and for sure one of the 
important issues of the future is to take medicare into the new 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the government that cut $6.2 billion out of transfer 
payments in 1995.  In the last budget it put back in half of what 
it took out and stretched it out over five years.  It has taken 
50:50 cost shared arrangements down to, if we really stretch it, 
a 15% federal share of health care spending in the country.  No 
wonder we have Ralph Klein in Alberta threatening to privatize 
the system and destroy our universal health care system because 
the government has nothing with which to stand up in the face of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member very specifically whether the government will 
have the responsibility to put back at least $1.5 billion into 
transfer payments for health care.  Will it have the integrity to 
keep to its promises of the last election and the election before 
that for national home care and pharmacare?  Will it have some 
vision to ensure that we can carry medicare into the new 
millennium? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will not be able to 
address all those points in the time allotted, but I will point 
out to the member that the cuts to the province of Ontario and 
the CHST, which includes health, post-secondary and social 
services, were about $800 million.  The Government of Ontario at 
the same time decided to reduce income taxes by $4.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are joint responsibilities with regard to health care. The 
member will well know that the provinces have to deal with that. 
Indeed the National Forum on Health identified that there was at 
least $11 billion of waste in the system.  It is very important 
that the system be managed properly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
very interested to hear the member from across the way talk about 
having the fiscal house in order.  Let us see how much order it 
is in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I noticed we were $560 billion in debt. 
We have a 67 cent Canadian dollar.  We pay about $40 billion to 
$50 billion in interest depending on what rate we are paying at 
the time.  The member calls that getting his fiscal house in 
order.  All of this is despite the fact that revenues have 
increased since 1993 by about some $40 billion or $45 billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall in 1993 when the Liberal candidate in my riding said 
that a perfectly acceptable level of deficit financing would be 
about 3% of the GDP.  I would like the member to comment on 
whether he has changed his mind about that level of deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when the government was 
formed in 1993 the annual deficit was $42 billion.  Obviously we 
cannot just make that disappear by flipping a switch.  It 
obviously added to the accumulated national debt.  The record 
shows very clearly that the government not only eliminated that 
deficit but it has also balanced the budget and delivered 
surpluses to Canadians as a result of its fiscal responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member cannot deny the fact that we are on the right track. 
The debt to GDP is going down, down, down and in fact it should 
be below 50% before the next fiscal year is finished. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK355"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my colleague from Mississauga South for his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised to hear him speak so enthusiastically, praising 
the government for its fiscal management. As I listened to him, 
I wondered whether he was fully aware of what is really going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the government has eliminated the deficit. Yes, it has 
accumulated surpluses, but we must look at how it was done. This 
government acted in the most cowardly fashion to eliminate its 
deficit. Only 11% of savings, if I can use that word, came from 
its own programs. 
All the rest was achieved at the expense of the provinces, 
through cuts in their transfer payments for health, 
post-secondary education and social programs, and at the expense 
of workers and employers who contribute to the employment 
insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach did allow the government to accumulate surpluses, 
with the result that, for example, the provinces had to make 
drastic cuts in health and education to the point where 80% of 
cuts affecting the Quebec health care system today are the 
direct result of this government's cuts in transfers to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the federal government's fault if it has become so 
difficult for people to get medical care today. And we hear the 
members opposite blow their own horn and say how good they were 
at managing public finances. It is outreageous. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member had some pretty 
strong words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me review it for the member. The year ended March 31, 1998 
was the first year we had a balanced budget of some $1 billion. 
In the last fiscal year reported on it was $2.9 billion. In the 
current fiscal year ending March 31, 2000 we are looking at a 
budget surplus of some $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider the modest surpluses the government has, I 
wonder what the member has in mind when he suggests that billions 
and billions of dollars should not have been cut from the 
spending of governments.  We would have still been in deficit. 
Unemployment would have remained high.  Inflation would have 
increased.  Long term debt interest rates would have increased. 
Canadians' mortgages would have increased.  Car loans would have 
increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a balance and I will not deny that all Canadians have 
to share part of that burden. 
But let us be clear.  When in government it is very important 
that prudence and fiscal responsibility are exercised to make 
sure that the changes we have made are sustainable, to ensure we 
are on a positive track to have continued surpluses, so Canadians 
can get the tax breaks they have earned, so Canadians can have 
the health care system they deserve, so that students can be 
taken care of, so that seniors can be taken care of and so that 
families with children can be taken care of.

politicians and our political system that they have chosen not to 
exercise the basic rights for which our forefathers fought and 
died.  But the sad reality is, and it came across loudly and 
clearly to me during the election campaign, that many citizens 
have lost faith in their politicians.  Politicians were described 
to me as not really caring, being in it only for themselves or 
for the money, being dishonest or full of empty promises.... As I 
stand here today I pledge that I will do my best to put a new 
face on politics. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were my words in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This code of conduct sets out to address this very real problem. 
This bill is being brought forward out of my personal desire to 
see parliamentarians carry out their responsibilities with 
honesty, integrity, transparency and in a manner that dignifies 
the trust placed in them by the electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately over the years there has been too much opportunity 
for people to become cynical, skeptical and pessimistic 
concerning elected officials. 
I firmly believe that those entrusted with public office must not 
only conduct themselves in a manner befitting of that trust, but 
must also be seen to be carrying out their responsibilities 
beyond reproach and free from conflict of interest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This parliament should have and needs a clear and objective 
complaint and resolution mechanism available to the public.  This 
private member's bill addresses these issues.  My bill is based 
upon the following principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians should have the highest ethical standards so as 
to maintain and enhance public confidence and trust in the 
integrity of parliamentarians and parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians should perform their official duties and 
arrange their private affairs in a manner that will bear the 
closest public scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians should avoid placing themselves under any 
financial or other obligation that might influence them in the 
performance of their official duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians upon entering office should arrange their 
private affairs to prevent real or apparent conflict of interest. 
If such does arise, it should be resolved in a way that protects 
the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians should not accept any gifts or personal benefit 
in connection with their office that may reasonably be seen to 
compromise their personal judgment or integrity. Parliamentarians 
would not accept any gift other than those received as a normal 
expression of courtesy or protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, all parliamentarians under this bill would have to 
disclose all official travel when the cost exceeds $250 in cases 
where the trip is not completely paid for by parliament or one of 
the few officially recognized sponsors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No parliamentarian would be permitted to be a party to a 
contract with the Government of Canada under which the 
parliamentarian receives a benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians would be required to make a disclosure of all 
assets once every calendar year and would be required to make 
public disclosure of the nature, although not the value, of all 
assets each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, to ensure that public interest and the highest 
standards are upheld, there would be an ethics counsellor to 
advise parliamentarians on any question relating to conduct. The 
ethics counsellor would enforce the application of the code of 
conduct.  There would also be the creation of a new standing 
joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on 
official conduct to review the code and to monitor the ethics 
counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that there are codes of conduct in various 
forms in other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom and 
Australia as well as in some provinces in Canada.  For example, 
in B.C. there is the conflict of interest commissioner.  In 
Alberta there is the ethics commissioner.  In Saskatchewan there 
is the conflict of interest commissioner.  In Ontario there is 
the integrity commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many obvious reasons why having a code of official 
conduct would benefit all parliamentarians and all Canadians.  In 
terms of the public, I am sure that everyone here would agree 
that the majority of Canadians has lost confidence in politicians 
and many hold a negative opinion of the political system.  This 
code would address public cynicism.  It would satisfy the 
expectations of the public and encourage a sense of security in 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The values that this bill promotes are central to rebuilding 
respect in this institution by Canadians.  That is why this code 
would include a statement of principles that parliamentarians are 
expected to uphold.  The values inherent in this code of conduct 
are that service in parliament is a public trust.  Public 
interest must be placed ahead of private interest and conflicts 
of interest must be avoided or resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This code is not only a disciplinary measure but it also 
provides an important educational function. The public would like 
to see such a function instilled in this House and the code sets 
forth a framework for that kind of education. This code would 
make it clear what parliamentarians are expected to do in certain 
situations and would provide an educational function for the 
guidance of parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said at the outset that I was disappointed this bill was not 
deemed votable. There are several criteria to determine whether a 
bill is votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills and motions if they are to be votable should be drafted in 
a clear, complete and effective way. This 18 page bill has gone 
through many drafts and redrafts with the assistance of 
legislative staff. The bill not only stands the scrutiny of being 
potentially effective and an operable piece of legislation, but 
it is one that clearly outlines its goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, bills and motions must be constitutional and concern areas 
of federal jurisdiction.  The bill fully meets that criteria.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills and motions must deal with matters of significant public 
interest. The conduct of parliamentarians is obviously of 
considerable public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bills and motions must also deal with matters that are not part 
of the government's legislative agenda and on which the House of 
Commons has not had the opportunity to vote during the session 
under way. As far as I know, Bill C-226 meets these criteria. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of bills being votable, all other things being equal, 
higher priorities should be given to items which transcend purely 
local interests, are not couched in partisan terms or cannot be 
address by the House in other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly Bill C-226 has no given local interest and is fully in 
the national interest.  It would also apply to all 
parliamentarians, including myself.  There is nothing partisan 
about this particular effort.  Members from all parties signed my 
petition accompanying the bill.  I believe strongly that anything 
we can do to raise the dignity of parliament and parliamentarians 
in the eyes of the public benefits all of us, both collectively 
and individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar legislation exists in provincial legislatures and other 
national legislatures.  It is neither fanciful nor onerous in its 
construction and in its potential application.  I sincerely 
believe that the bill meets all the tests of being something that 
is worthy of being voted on by this honourable body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask for the unanimous consent of members in 
the House to deem this bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Halifax West has presented a motion to the House to have his bill 
made votable.  Does the member have the unanimous consent of the 
House to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak on Bill C-226, the parliamentarians' code 
of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not question the significance of a bill like the one being 
put forward by my hon. colleague from Halifax West. In fact, I 
can well imagine that on such a bill depends all the confidence 
the public may have in their institutions and in the elected 
representatives and politicians who are part of these 
parliamentarian institutions, which are the foundation of our 
democratic system and of our system of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I have questions about the surrealistic nature 
of the debates we are having in the House these days since, at 
the same time we are discussing a parliamentarians' code of 
conduct, which, I admit, is a very important issue, the federal 
government has introduced a bill that challenges the fundamental 
balance of the federation in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This federation was created with the voluntary consent of the 
provinces of which it is made up. These provinces who freely 
entered the federation are now being put into a straitjacket so 
they cannot leave the federation, or at least so the conditions 
allowing them to leave as freely as they entered are more 
difficult than ever, making it practically impossible for them 
to leave.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to stray from the subject for a moment to make a 
few remarks that seem very important to me since, although I do 
not deny the importance of the bill introduced by our colleague, 
I believe there is a much more important debate that must take 
place, a debate on the very nature of the country in which we 
live, which leads us to have these kinds of debates on the 
parliamentarians' code of conduct, on the budget and on all the 
other issues that must normally be brought to the attention of 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us keep in mind that at the time Quebec joined the Canadian 
federation in 1867, it did not do so based on a simple vote by 
the legislative assembly of the day.  Incidentally, that vote 
passed by a very slender majority of two seats, if I am not 
mistaken, among the francophone members.  The least one can say, 
therefore, is that this entry was not the most unanimous 
possible, far from it in fact. But that is how Quebec entered 
the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later, when other provinces came into the federation, the 
founding members never had to give formal assent to their entry, 
even though the arrival of new provinces did have a fundamental 
impact on each of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they are trying to tell us that consulting the population in 
a democratic manner, through a referendum, would not be 
legitimate, would not be the right way to leave this country, 
whereas in 1867 the population of Quebec was never consulted 
about entering this federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respectfully submit that it is legitimate and democratic 
for Quebec to leave the Canadian federation as freely as it 
entered it, if that is the wish of its population, and if that 
wish is expressed by a majority vote, that is a 50% plus one 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the floor of this House, they are saying “But there have 
already been two referendums.  How many of them are you going to 
hold before you get a yes?”  That is not the point. 
In 1980, federalists told Quebecers “If you stay in Canada we 
will reform this country in such a way that you will feel 
comfortable in it”. A constitutional reform was indeed 
undertaken, but Quebec was left out. Quebec never signed the 
constitutional reform adopted in 1982 and no Quebec premier, 
whether federalist or sovereignist, was ever prepared to sign 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federalists got a no on the basis of misrepresentation, 
and the same thing happened again in 1995. On the eve of that 
referendum, the current Prime Minister, realizing to his great 
dismay that the sovereignists might win, once again made 
promises to Quebecers and told them “we will entrench a veto and 
the concept of distinct society in the constitution”. 
We saw what happened once again. The government passed a 
meaningless motion in this House and a veto was given to all the 
regions of Canada, making it forever all the more difficult to 
reform the Canadian constitution to accommodate the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these circumstances, I respectfully submit that it is 
perfectly legitimate that Quebecers who voted no in 1980 and no 
in 1995, by a very slim majority, be given an opportunity to 
vote a third time. Oddly enough, even if the no side won with 
only 50.4% of the votes in 1995, they seem to think that the 
question was clear enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis, we must conclude that the moral contract, if 
I can put it that way, that had been agreed to between Quebecers 
and the federal governments of 1980 and 1995 was broken. This 
fully justifies the holding of a third referendum, so that we 
can tell Quebecers “Listen, they told you that they would reform 
a number of things to convince you to vote no. Well, there was 
no reform whatsoever. Do you still think we should continue to 
be part of that country?”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if Quebecers were to say no, they would have the 
option and the freedom to leave this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect for my hon. colleague 
from Halifax West who has worked very hard to prepare this bill, 
I want to say that although I understand why he felt the need 
to introduce this legislation, we will unfortunately be unable 
to support his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot support a bill that establishes a code of conduct for 
parliamentarians when it seems that there is already a very 
mysterious code of conduct for the ministers that is, however, 
known only to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister appointed an ethics counsellor who reports 
only to the Prime Minister on a code of conduct known only to 
the Prime Minister, and now we are asked to set stricter rules 
for parliamentarians than the ones being applied to cabinet 
members who have access to inside information and subsidy 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to all my colleagues in the House, and with all due 
respect to our colleague from Halifax West, that the priority 
should have been the adoption of a public code of conduct for 
cabinet members. After that, it would be possible to consider 
adopting a code of conduct for parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is appropriate to consider the adoption of a code of 
conduct for cabinet members and perhaps for parliamentarians, we 
must also examine the source of certain conflicts of interest in 
which parliamentarians but especially cabinet members have found 
themselves or could find themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one looks at the various cases of conflict of interest over 
the years, it is possible to see a direct relation between 
businesses that made contributions to campaign funds and 
services rendered by parliamentarians, ministers and government 
members afterwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I think we must not only look at adopting codes of 
conduct, but we must also carefully examine the way in which 
political parties get their funding. Bill C-2 will give us the 
opportunity to discuss this fundamental issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise and address this item of Private Members' 
Business this afternoon dealing with the creation of a code of 
conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development of a code of conduct for members of parliament 
is a proposal that has been brought before the House many times 
over the past 20 years or so.  In fact, my hon. colleague 
introduced this bill in the last session of parliament, which was 
Bill C-488. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A code of conduct is a matter in which all parliamentarians have 
an interest and which can only be implemented with the agreement 
of all members of parliament and in the other place.  Obviously, 
every parliamentarian has a responsibility to act with honesty 
and integrity and to maintain the confidence that Canadians have 
placed in all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, himself, in this House has said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—trust in the institutions of government is not a partisan 
issue, but something all of us elected to public office have an 
obligation to restore. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly as parliamentarians we have individual responsibility 
for ethical conduct.  In addition, together we have a collective 
responsibility to ensure that conduct. 
In part, this is because the legislature is a separate and 
distinct branch of government from the executive.  Our approach 
to conduct can only properly be developed by us for ourselves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague's initiative for a code of conduct raises 
issues regarding our individual and collective responsibilities 
here in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this in perspective, I will comment on what is already in 
place and the work that has gone on before us as it relates to 
the integrity and honesty of our political institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as parliamentarians we are already governed by the laws 
of the country, as well as the laws of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin with the standing orders of the House of Commons, 
which govern us here, and the rich history of precedents and 
Speakers' rulings, which establish parameters for the carriage of 
our duties as parliamentarians.  The same applies in the other 
place with their own rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Standing Order 21 provides that members cannot vote 
on a question in which they may have a pecuniary interest. 
Standing Order 23 defines as a high crime and misdemeanour the 
act of members of the House accepting money to promote a matter 
which is being considered by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code specifically prohibits members of parliament 
from engaging in bribery and corrupt acts.  However, the courts 
have recognized some ambiguity in the definition of the term 
officer of parliament, and it has been suggested that the term 
should be clarified by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliament of Canada Act addresses conflict of interest for 
senators and establishes fines for contravention.  There are also 
provisions relating to contracting governing members of the 
House, though it has also been proposed that these rules, long 
standing, now be updated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Elections Act also sets out guidelines for conduct during 
elections, for example, with respect to campaign financing.  An 
amendment to the Elections Act currently before the House 
increases the level of transparency and accountability in 
election financing, which is consistent with the government's 
commitment to restore integrity to our political institutions. 
The penalty in some cases under the Elections Act is loss of the 
member's seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from these basic building blocks for ethical behaviour, 
from the beginning the government has recognized the importance 
of restoring the appearances of honesty and integrity to the 
country's political institutions.  We set this out as a top 
priority in our Liberal Party's red book during the 1993 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, the list of initiatives we have implemented is quite 
long, but I am sure my colleagues will recognize the following. 
The government introduced amendments to the Lobbyists 
Registration Act to increase the transparency of lobbying 
activities.  This included stiffer penalties for lobbyists, and 
has increased the transparency of their activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this initiative, the government also appointed an 
ethics counsellor who has responsibilities in two areas:  First, 
he advises ministers and government officials on their conduct in 
the course of carrying out their official duties; and second, the 
ethics counsellor can investigate complaints about lobbyists' 
activities pursuant to their code of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister tabled a new conflict of interest code for 
public office holders in the House in June 1994.  This code is a 
concrete measure that shows that the government recognizes that 
restoring the public trust involves strengthening the system from 
both the public office and lobbying sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code sets out key principles that apply to all public office 
holders:  ministers, secretaries of state, parliamentary 
secretaries, ministerial staff and full time governor in council 
appointees.  The code is enforced by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the government takes very seriously its 
responsibilities to maintain integrity in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address parliament's efforts in developing a code of 
conduct.  We have been studying the issue of parliamentary ethics 
since the early 1970s with various government green papers, 
standing committee reports and a plethora of bills on the 
subject, although all have died on the order paper. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, some of the most in depth study was conducted quite 
recently.  Here I am thinking of the work of the special joint 
committee of the Senate and the House of Commons on a code of 
conduct, which was established by the government in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee, which was chaired by the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands, heard from many witnesses, including 
the federal ethics counsellor, the privacy commissioner, 
academics in the field of political science, respected members of 
the public and several provincial commissioners of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final report of that committee constructed a code that drew 
on many of the common elements raised during testimony.  Some 
examples include:  that a list of principles should be included 
in the code: that it was important to have a commissioner or body 
appointed to provide advice, take disclosures and enforce the 
code, as does the existing ethics commissioner for ministers and 
parliamentary secretaries; that it needed to deal with disclosure 
of assets and interests; the importance of clarifying the area of 
government contracting; and recognizing the distinction between 
the legislature and the executive by recommending that a 
permanent committee be established to administer the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From reading Bill C-226, I can see that my hon. colleague 
opposite has drawn on much of the previous work that has been 
done by parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as with the many initiatives on a code of conduct for 
parliamentarians, the special committee's report was not adopted 
because members of parliament themselves could not agree to adopt 
the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members of parliament have indicated that in their view a 
formal code could create a rigid and onerous system of rules 
which would not be appropriate in a parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the challenge in the House and in the other place has been in 
deciding the best balance to ensure that there exists and appears 
to be ethical behaviour on the part of parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, we already have a range of measures in 
place to deal with this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not personally aware of a great interest among hon. members 
in making the development of a formal code a priority at this 
time.  I am also not aware of a special need to do it at this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's efforts, the member who moved the bill, are most 
creditable and laudable.  He continues a tradition that has been 
around this place for 20 or so years now.  I certainly want to 
recognize his efforts and contribution to this and to our efforts 
collectively in this place to maintain high standards and the 
appearance of high standards of ethical conduct in the conduct of 
our work and responsibilities as parliamentarians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK362"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to talk to the bill about a code of conduct and 
whether an official code of conduct is a good idea here in the 
House of Commons and for parliamentarians generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened with interest to the member from the government 
side as he talked about some of the safeguards that are in the 
system now to ensure that conduct is above reproach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this a very interesting bill.  The idea that 
parliamentary service is a public trust is something that I think 
most parliamentarians hold very close to their heart.  They want 
to do what it takes to ensure public confidence is maintained in 
the precincts of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A code of official conduct is an idea that I think is worth 
debating.  We have had the example of the ethics counsellor, 
which the member on the government side mentioned, who is 
selected by the Prime Minister himself but then must often 
investigate the actions of the Prime Minister.  That brings 
conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the debate is very timely.  It is timely because people, 
by and large, have a reduced standard of respect for this 
institution and for the members.  It has been steadily declining 
for a long time.

workers have a certain standing.  However, as we go down the line 
and we get to elected officials, we see that they are way down on 
the respect list, and we cannot ignore that.  That is why this 
debate is timely, and I congratulate the member for bringing it 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of the bill involve things such as ethical 
standards; the way parliamentarians will act in a fashion that 
will promote and preserve public confidence and open themselves 
up to public scrutiny, the way they will arrange their private 
affairs so they are in the public interest, and that they will 
not accept any gift or personal benefit connected with their 
office that could reasonably be seen to compromise their judgment 
or integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will dwell on the last point for a few minutes.  In the House 
during question period today, I brought up the situation that has 
been evolving over the grants in the Prime Minister's riding. 
This is a good example of why we need an arm's length ethics 
counsellor, an arm's length code of conduct.  I would like to see 
what the ethics counsellor believes in because I have never been 
able to get a copy of what he is trying to enforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we asked in question period today is an example of why we 
need to have public scrutiny and openness about the actions of 
both ministers and parliamentarians.  We asked how many 
coincidences in a row it takes before the alarm bells go off 
regarding the activities of the Prime Minister and these 
government grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can detail, for example, that in the 1997 campaign, 33% of the 
total of the personal and business donations to the Prime 
Minister's personal campaign had some government grant or 
government loan association to it.  In other words, the person or 
the company that received a federal government loan or grant gave 
in return large donations to the Prime Minister ranging from as 
low as $400 to as high as $10,000.  That in and of itself is not 
evidence of any wrongdoing, but it goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister sold property to someone who had, shall 
we say, dubious business credentials and had gone broke in a 
previous hotel business, the Prime Minister sold a hotel to the 
same person.  That person then received more government grants. 
Did the Prime Minister receive a benefit or not?  The ethics 
counsellor said that he did not really think so, but that same 
hotel now owes taxes to the provincial government and the local 
Shawinigan government.  It owes federal excise taxes and $100,000 
to the local contractors.  The inn is now up for sale again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did that hotel ever get any federal money in grants and 
loans given the bad track record of the proprietor and the very 
close connection to the Prime Minister?  Maybe that in and of 
itself is not enough to cause alarm bells, although I would argue 
that they are starting to jingle a little bit.  It goes on from 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>René Fugère was an unpaid aide to the Prime Minister.  He 
represented the Prime Minister at public functions and made 
announcements on behalf of the Prime Minister here and there.  He 
was closely tied to the Prime Minister.  This was someone who 
represented the Prime Minister at constituency functions.  He 
announced a transitional jobs fund grant for the Grand-Mère Inn 
in the Prime Minister's riding.  Ten days later, he received 
$11,500 from that same company for services.  Maybe it is a happy 
coincidence for this fellow.  If the bells were jingling before, 
now they are starting to get a little nervous because there are 
so many coincidences.  On and on it goes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human resources minister has a special fund that is 
available for special grants only at the minister's discretion. 
The only grant that is given out in all of Canada goes into the 
Prime Minister's riding.  Maybe that is another one of those 
coincidences, but what happens is that the grant is not spent so 
they have to set up a special trust fund to keep that grant money 
in the riding until the next fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the government's own admission, by the admission of the 
government's own documents, the trouble is that the trust fund is 
actually illegal.  It is outside the parameters of legality. 
They cannot do it legally but it is set up anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is illegal.  It is one of a kind.  It is in the Prime 
Minister's riding.  It follows all these other things.  Maybe it 
is a happy coincidence.  More than that, the lawyer who set up 
the illegal trust fund was appointed not once but twice by the 
Prime Minister to his role at Canada Post, the last time being in 
September of this year.  The alarm bells have gone off now for 
me.  There are too many happy coincidences all at once, one after 
the other after the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quality Inn in the Prime Minister's riding, for example, 
received a $600,000 grant.  It was announced without any 
departmental paperwork.  No paperwork was done whatsoever.  It 
was advertized in the Prime Minister's householder in April 1997, 
the month the election was called.  The approval came well after 
it was announced in the householder.  Press releases were made. 
There were announcements of grand things that were coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Thibault is involved, a self-confessed embezzler in the 
Prime Minister's riding and now the subject of criminal 
investigation involved in legal disputes in the riding.  One of 
the fundraisers for the Liberal Party of Canada in the last 
election has been convicted of influence peddling by linking the 
transitional jobs funds grants by saying that he will arrange a 
grant or arrange for someone to see the minister but the person 
will have to give a donation to the Liberal Party.  The Liberal 
Party does not condone this but it happened.  He has been 
convicted of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at a bill like this one I am not sure it would 
prevent that.  It would certainly point to how wrong it is.  It 
would say that we have to conduct our affairs so that we can be 
seen to be at arm's length from any benefit to ourselves 
politically or from any benefit from any sale of property.  We 
have to conduct ourselves in a way that brings honour to this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked the Prime Minister repeatedly to table in the House 
all documents associated with this matter.  We keep digging them 
up in access to information requests.  We had some more today. We 
will have some more tomorrow.  The Liberals can know that now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that it is time everyone understands that an 
ethics councillor in this place needs to be arm's length from 
everyone, including the Prime Minister, to give reports to all of 
us in order to uphold the highest standard of public conduct and 
to establish faith in a very honoured institution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to speak this evening to the bill of the 
hon. member for Halifax West which seeks to establish a code of 
conduct for parliamentarians, a code of ethics for 
parliamentarians.  I think that is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the member makes a valid point with this piece of 
legislation.  There are countless examples of elected politicians 
who dangerously straddle the fence between what is right and 
wrong in terms of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Prime Minister and his suspect use of the 
transitional jobs fund has led to repeated stories in the press 
about large federal grants going to shady businessmen in the 
Prime Minister's riding.  In an instance like this one where 
there is even a political staffer being quoted in the newspaper 
as saying the process for doling out cash in Shawinigan was 
outside the standard practices of the Department of Human 
Resources Development, one has to wonder if an appropriate 
watchdog body's time is not due.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a big difference between sending everything through the 
criminal route and being investigated by the RCMP versus it being 
investigated by an independent body that would go after the 
conduct or the ethics of how a person behaves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade, who has taken some serious 
criticism for his election fundraising and his use of the 
transitional jobs fund, is another example where a committee or 
body overseeing ethics might be a good idea.  I do not think we 
need to set up witch-hunt committees.  I do not think this is the 
point of the hon. member's bill.  However, in a case like this 
one where the minister's practices are in question an ethics 
committee would be a logical tool in establishing the realities 
of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development, who has also made 
fine use of the TJF for propping up projects in her riding, might 
be in a situation where a committee would be a wise body in 
straightening out the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through all the endless stories of the government's questionable 
approach to using public funds, the government repeatedly tells 
us and Canadians that all is okay with this behaviour because the 
ethics counsellor, Mr. Wilson, acts as a watchdog for the Prime 
Minister and cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson is not really an ethics counsellor.  He is a staffer 
who reports to the Prime Minister.  If he hears of any 
unfavourable conduct, his job is to straighten it out with the 
ministers and the Prime Minister and cover it up.  A true ethics 
counsellor would look at it and if there were any 
inappropriateness his role would be to tell parliament or a 
committee of parliament.  His role would also be to make it 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this position provides lovely optics for the government, 
the fact remains that he reports to the Prime Minister.  He does 
not report to the House but to the individual whom he is supposed 
to monitor.  This is absurd and completely counterproductive to 
the whole notion of having an ethics watchdog.  What is the 
purpose of having somebody policing his boss?  The position 
despite the charming title is a political one where an individual 
is tasked with keeping the Prime Minister and ministers out of 
trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for an individual who reports to the House on 
the ethics of government.  However I am not sure it is necessary 
to monitor every member of the House of Commons and the Senate. 
By the simple virtue of being elected by the citizens of Canada 
we are automatically asked and expected to hold a high standard 
of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we were to look into it further, the U.S. House of 
Representatives model may be worth examining.  Its committee on 
house administration is charged with overseeing and, if 
warranted, examining the ethical behaviour of congressmen.  This 
might be a good approach to look at rather than the existing 
ethics counsellor who is really nothing more than a political 
fixer for the Prime Minister and his ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Seeing no one 
rising, the hon. member for Halifax West will have five minutes 
to end the debate.  At the termination of that five minutes 
debate will conclude.

<P><A NAME="LINK364"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want 
to express my deep appreciation to all members who took part in 
the debate. This is a very important topic, and members' 
opinions are very useful. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a moment to try to summarize a few points that 
were raised with respect to the bill.  My hon. colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois had some reservations about the bill because he 
felt it created stricter rules for members than it did for 
ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all due respect to the hon. member I would say the bill does 
just the opposite.  The bill would apply to all members including 
ministers and the Prime Minister.  There would be baseline rules 
for everybody.  If the Prime Minister wants to create stricter 
rules under the bill for his cabinet members for whatever reason 
he could do so, but the bill would apply to all members of 
parliament including members of the Senate.  It would accomplish 
the purpose about which my hon. colleague has some concerns.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the comments made by the hon. government member 
regarding all measures that are currently in place, I guess the 
very fact that this issue keeps coming forth, as he indicated 
over and over again, indicates that perhaps all measures in place 
are not working the way they should, or else the issue would not 
constantly keep coming up.  As he indicated I certainly did 
research the previous studies and the previous efforts that were 
made.  The bill builds upon them and tries to codify and bring 
together all the loose pieces under a workable piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the hon. member's comments he mentioned that the 
Right Hon. Prime Minister said that ethics should not be a 
partisan issue.  This is exactly why the bill has come forward. 
It is not a partisan issue.  It is an issue that would apply to 
all members regardless of political stripe, regardless of whether 
or not they hold office.  The system in place is open to suspect 
in terms of the ethics counsellor who currently reports to the 
Prime Minister and does not have in the real sense any 
objectivity in terms of reporting to parliament as a whole. 
Therefore there is even within the current structure a system 
that allows for a perceived conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all hon. members would believe and understand that 
even if something is being done correctly there is no harm in 
having it looked at because that removes any air of suspicion the 
public may have with respect to actions by elected members.  The 
bill would certainly enhance the role of parliamentarians and 
would provide for transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already expressed my disappointment that the bill was not 
made votable.  I recall someone saying that I should not expect 
it to be made votable because nobody would really want to vote 
against it; it would be like voting against motherhood.  I 
understand that, but it is time we voted for motherhood and stood 
up for something that would perhaps help us improve the way this 
institution operates on behalf of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not get a degree of confidence from the people to whom I 
spoke as I was campaigning and still speak to.  They do not have 
any great degree of confidence in the House and in the personal 
ethics of everyone in the House and the way we operate.  As a 
matter of fact I think we are rated close to the bottom of the 
pile on the list of professions.  We are down with used car 
salesmen, I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anything we can do to improve the image of parliamentarians 
would be helpful.  I understand why the hon. member on the 
government side would not want to see the bill come into play 
because it certainly places an additional onus upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with one opinion expressed by the hon. member on the 
government side.  We cannot legislate behaviour and ethics. 
Ultimately the law that has to apply to all of us is the law of 
love that comes from within and comes from the heart.  I honestly 
urge all of us, regardless of what legislation is on the books, 
to examine our actions from within and continue to strive on 
behalf of those whom we represent from a point of view of love, 
integrity and respect for other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking with a grade five class in Basinview school in my 
riding the other day.  It struck me that these young people were 
very much interested in the parliamentary system.  I stressed to 
them the most important thing of all, that no matter what 
occupation they pursue they should do it with honesty, integrity 
and a sense of transparency and respect for other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we draw close to the Christmas season I wish all my 
colleagues a very, very merry Christmas, happy new year, happy 
holiday season, and all the best in the upcoming millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hone in on the Sea King question today. We all 
know the Sea Kings are very tired and old.  They have been 
refurbished.  They have new skins and now they have new lives but 
even with that, the minister of defence says that their useful 
life is only until 2005 before we get new helicopters to replace 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that new helicopters are necessary now, especially 
because we have spent all this money on frigates that were 
designed to have these new helicopters.  Without the helicopters 
they are really only about 50% effective.  We are most anxious to 
see those helicopters supplied, but the problem is the new 
helicopter delivery time is eight years.  The Sea Kings only have 
a useful life until 2005 and if we ordered the helicopters today, 
which we have not done yet, they would not be here until 2008. 
There is a hole between 2005 and 2008. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the parliamentary secretary is, what will the 
department of defence do in the time period between the earliest 
delivery date of 2008 and the expiry of useful life of the Sea 
Kings in 2005?  What happens in the three year hole? 
<P><A NAME="LINK368"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe that all 
Canadians should take great pride in the work performed by the 
men and women of Canada's air force at home and abroad. Every day 
Canadian forces aircraft operate throughout the country and 
around the world performing a variety of demanding missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During their mission in East Timor, our Hercules aircraft 
completed some 130 operational missions carrying more than two 
million pounds of equipment and some 2,200 personnel. They have 
also airlifted humanitarian aid to various regions of the world. 
Canadians also appreciated the valuable contributions of the 
Hercules during the Manitoba flood and the great ice storm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Labrador helicopters continue to conduct dangerous search 
and rescue operations and save thousands of lives every year. 
They will soon be replaced with state of the art Cormorant 
helicopters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recent NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia, the CF-18s 
flew more than 670 sorties striking at a variety of military 
targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few years the government has also taken significant 
steps to ensure the air force has the tools it needs to do its 
job.  In addition to the Cormorant, the minister has announced 
the beginning of modernization of programs for both the Aurora 
maritime patrol aircraft and the CF-18 aircraft. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very pleased to report that the Auroras, which until 
mid-November were restricted to unpressurized flights, are now 
almost all authorized to fly at a new altitude of over 10,000 
feet.  This comes after detailed inspections confirming that 
these planes can carry out pressurized flights in complete 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Sea Kings, the minister has made it very clear, on 
more than one occasion, that they need to be replaced.  In fact, 
the minister confirmed several times in the House that new 
maritime helicopters were the number one equipment priority. 
We are therefore in the process of developing an acquisition 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives will help ensure that Canada's airforce can 
continue to serve all Canadians from one end of the country to 
the other and will make it possible to continue to interoperate 
effectively with our allies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just in case any of 
the departments happen to be watching and tuned in, the 
parliamentary secretaries have exactly two minutes to respond.  I 
know it is sometimes difficult because the responses that come

well done that it seems a shame to interrupt.

appalled at the President of the Treasury Board's response to my 
question concerning racism in society at large, and in the 
federal government in particular. She had a choice.  On behalf of 
the government, she could have addressed issues of racial 
discrimination.  Instead she chose to play partisan political 
games, but it gets worse.  She then proceeded to say that the 
government is addressing the problem by setting up an advisory 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Black Canadians and other visible minorities have been studied 
to death.  What we need are solutions.  The Canadian Human Rights 
Commission's analysis of the government's performance in 1998 
shows an abysmal record.  Out of 12,420 term staff positions 
filled last year, only 418 were visible minorities.  That is only 3%. 
Out of 2,800 permanent jobs filled, only 184 were visible 
minorities, but with 685 visible minority positions lost, the 
Liberals had a net loss of 501 employees, or a decrease of 18%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the government is well aware that it has been over two 
years since the commission released the study carried out by Dr. 
John Samuel entitled “Visible Minorities and the Public 
Service”.  In February 1998 a forum on racial discrimination in 
the federal public service and federal agencies in Canada looked 
at the issues of systemic racism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Human Rights Commission states in its 1998 annual 
report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public service's record regarding the employment of visible 
minorities is worse than its record for the other designated 
groups. For 1997-98, the representation of visible minorities was 
5.1 per cent, about half of what could be expected based on the 
number of people qualified and available for work. There were 
ample opportunities to remedy this situation, since more than 
15,000 people were hired, but the number of visible minority 
candidates recruited was less than half of those qualified and 
available.  Given the continuing difficulties that federal 
government departments seem to be experiencing in hiring and 
promoting visible minorities, it is hard to conclude that they 
have taken to heart the recommendations made by Dr. Samuel. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also raised in my question to the President of the Treasury 
Board the government's inexcusable act of failing to appoint 
Judge Corrine Sparks who was passed over and ignored in a 
conscious decision by the government to appoint judges who have 
sat on the bench in Nova Scotia for less time.  Judge Sparks was 
appointed in 1987. The government overlooked her in favour of 
judges appointed in 1995, 1993 and 1991, among others.  As 
Lincoln Alexander, chairperson of the Canada Race Relations 
Foundation stated, this is a “major slap in the face to the 
black community” and he suggested the government's actions 
“smack of racism”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first raised the issue in the House of Commons on April 14. 
The government buried its head in the sand and hoped the problem 
would go away, as governments in the country have so often hoped 
when it comes to issues of fairness for blacks and other 
Canadians of colour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures speak for themselves.  Representation of Canada's 
visible minority population in the government's public service is 
abysmal and offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope the government representative will not respond 
with platitudes, with comments of look how well they have done, 
and with vague references to future reports of advisory boards or 
task forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Liberal government will now respond with an action 
plan including targets, funding and dates.

Recognizing diversity, career aspirations and the learning and 
developmental needs of employees will lead to better service for 
Canadians. Further proof of the government's commitment is our 
continuing investment in this area.

culture in the public service.  This is proof of the government's 
resolve to make the public service of Canada better reflect and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
why does the government put gun registration ahead of putting 
more police on the streets? This policy of the government has 
negatively affected my riding of Dauphin—Swan River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If safe streets are a priority of the Prime Minister, then the 
government is spending in the wrong places. 
Let us look at some facts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds and hundreds of RCMP positions remain unfilled 
throughout the country.  There are 39 RCMP positions vacant right 
now in Manitoba.  The RCMP training depot in Regina is currently 
closed. The new government estimates show the spending of $35 
million for gun control and only $13.8 million for the RCMP. 
Where are the priorities of the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has had gun control for over 60 years.  No one disputes 
that need.  Wasting hundreds of millions of dollars on a wasteful 
long gun registry is irresponsible.  This money would be better 
used to put more police officers on the street, or used in health 
and education or in defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read for the record some information obtained through 
access to information by my colleague the member for 
Yorkton—Melville on the current registry of long firearms in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The registration system has cost more than $300 million so far. 
Only $2.9 million in user fees were collected in the last six 
months of operation.  Justice department has still not released 
the registry's budget for this fiscal year. Cabinet secrecy was 
used to hide 172 pages of documents on true costs of gun 
registry.  On bureaucrats, as many as 800 paper pushers are now 
working on the firearms registration scheme.  The RCMP have 
diverted resources from law enforcement to employ 391 on the 
firearms registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada reports that 98% of violent crime victims 
never encounter firearms.  Forty-six percent of all murders are 
committed with handguns despite a 65 year old handgun registry. 
Criminal incidents have doubled since 1970 but the number of 
police officers per capita is dropping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP report less than 10% compliance. What use will this be 
to police?  Backlogs are increasing despite a 70% lower than 
expected number of applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A consultants' report states that workflow is inflexible and 
inefficient at the registry.  Only 87,825 photo IDs were issued 
in the first year of operation; only 2.5 million to 6.5 million 
to go. Only 260,464 registration certificate numbers have been 
issued; only six million to 20 million to go.  The minister's 
firearms experts say production must increase from 1,500 per day 
to 13,500 per day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the economic impact, cabinet secrecy was used to hide a 115 
page report on the economic impact of the registry.  There are 
still legal challenges ahead. Six provinces and two territories 
are challenging the registry in the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the government is making the streets of Canada less 
safe through the headstrong drive to register all long guns in 
this country. When will the government wake up, quit playing 
politics and fund the RCMP properly instead of wasting hundreds 
of millions of dollars on useless long gun registration?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
December 1 marked the first anniversary of the beginning of the 
implementation of the new firearms legislation.  I would like to 
assure my colleague that contrary to the opinion of some here, 
this new program is making a real difference, a difference we can 
measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is making a real difference in terms of public safety. 
The objective of the firearms legislation is to create a culture 
of safety regarding firearms in Canada and to keep guns out of 
the hands of those who should not have them.  Looking over the 
record of the past year, we can plainly see that the program is 
doing just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stricter eligibility checks on licence holders and applicants is 
one piece of evidence.  Officials have refused 587 new 
applications for public safety reasons and have revoked 504 
licences to individuals who no longer meet the eligibility 
requirements.  This number is significant.  It is seven times 
higher than the total for the past five years.  It is a 
measurement of the success of a new system that provides more 
information in a timely manner to public safety authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The checking system is also successful in uncovering cases of 
licence falsification, unauthorized sale of firearms and spousal 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the program is making a difference in terms of what it 
offers police.  The program has provided police services with 
concrete savings.  In fact, there is an annual saving of $30 
million because officers no longer have to do the paperwork of 
accepting applications and issuing licences. 
This allows police more time to do policing.  It certainly does 
not take police off the streets and it does not reduce municipal, 
provincial or RCMP police budgets.  In fact, the federal 
government reimburses provinces and other administrators of the 
system for the work they do in the firearms program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the fact that the registry provides vital 
information to police, information that is invaluable to criminal 
investigations.  It enables police to take preventive measures 
when responding to emergency calls and to identify guns held 
illegally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Canadians should be proud of the country's firearms 
legislation.  This legislation will make our communities safer. 
It is unfortunate that the Reform Party refuses to see this fact. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
