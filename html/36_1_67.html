step up to the Olympic standard and carry on in the great

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as Canadians we have much to be proud of today. We have 
demonstrated that this federal government has a vision for 
tomorrow, a vision that is based on the well-being of its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a budget that addresses our children, our youth and our 
elderly. We have demonstrated a commitment for the protection of 
those most in need.  We have developed a dynamic millennium 
project, an educational plan to ensure Canadians of a leading 
role in the new technological society. Our young people are going 
to be prepared for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of this budget are broad and far reaching.  It 
comes at a most appropriate time, as the Black Community Resource 
Centre in the Mount Royal riding celebrates its first anniversary 
and as we all celebrate black history month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we rejoice in the achievements of the black community 
across Canada, we are at the same time able to apply this budget 
to one of its important local endeavours in the interests of 
black youth and their future.

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
McDonald's recently announced the closure of its restaurant in 
Saint-Hubert, thus throwing sixty or so employees out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company claims the closure is justified by financial 
reasons.  In reality, it is an obvious anti-union measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a year now, McDonald's has been spending tens of thousands 
of dollars on lawyers and on public relations, using the biggest 
public relations firm in Canada, in order to trample the legitimate 
rights of some sixty young people who are working for minimum wage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the young workers who lost his job for having tried to 
gain recognition of his rights summarized the situation very aptly 
“Just because we make hamburgers, that doesn't mean we don't 
deserve respect”. Basically, McDonald's scandalous anti-union 
attitude is sending a clear message to young people, giving them a 
choice between exploitation and unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>McDonald's says “You deserve a break today”, but do its 
workers not also deserve a break?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, many people and organizations have raised some very 
serious questions about Canada's involvement in negotiations on the 
multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the Minister of International 
Trade, who has announced that public consultations will be held on 
the draft agreement. He also stated that he had set ironclad 
conditions for Canada's signature, in areas such as health care, 
social programs, education, culture, aboriginal peoples, labour and 
environmental standards, and supply management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also pointed out that Canada would sign only when 
satisfied with the conditions set and the exemptions obtained, and 
would, if necessary, not sign at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an illustration of the government's sensitivity to the 
representations made to it, and offers an opportunity for the 
people and groups concerned to make their points of view known 
democratically within a public debate.

Mr. Speaker, congratulations to the Minister of Finance on his 
budget which underlines Canada's ongoing commitment to the land 
mine cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs in the interest of international 
social justice and humanity took the lead in having 123 countries 
sign the treaty banning anti-personnel land mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again a Liberal minister has made us proud. In yesterday's 
budget he announced we would provide $100 million over the next 
five years to help meet the goals of the treaty, one of which has 
greatly expanded humanitarian assistance for land mine victims to 
help with their medical care and to help rebuild their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe that to sign and ratify this treaty was 
important but not enough.  In order to make it meaningful and not 
just principles on paper, we had to put our money where our mouth 
was, and we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada continues to play a prominent role in promoting and 
strengthening humanitarian initiatives.  I applaud the minister 
for enabling us to make a difference.

with three square meals a day, complete medical and dental care,

</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is good to see that a convicted murderer can reduce 
his handicap while behind bars, in the real world I have met 
hundreds of families that cannot provide the basic necessities 
for their children. Last week when I was at Drumheller 
Institution I met six inmates marinating a beautiful Alberta rib 
eye steak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like this government to explain to the needy 
children of this country is: why convicts eat steak when they 
cannot afford macaroni; why inmates get free education and the 
poor have to wait to win the millennium scholarship lottery; why 
a low income family cannot afford to take its children to the 
dentist, but the dentist will pay a house call to Millhaven; and 
why our seniors suffer from poor health but convicts can have a 
sex change on demand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the Minister of Finance.  The 1998 budget will 
provide increased funding of more than $400 million over the next 
three years to the granting councils which provide crucial 
support for our Canadian researchers, university professors and 
post-graduate students.  By 2001 these budgets will be at their 
highest level ever in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians will benefit directly from this initiative.  This 
increased investment in basic funded research to the Social 
Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the Natural Sciences 
and Engineering Research Council, and the Medical Research 
Council illustrates our government's serious commitment to 
transforming Canada into a strong knowledge based economy now and 
into the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday Dr. Paul Davenport, the chairman of the Association of 
Universities and Colleges of Canada stated “The increased 
investment in research will help generate growth and jobs, create 
new products and processes and improve our ability to compete 
globally.  This budget provides an excellent start if Canada is 
to close the research gap with its international competitors”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now Canadian researchers, the best and brightest, can realize 
their dreams and fulfil their promise right here at home in 
Canada.

will continue to balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget reflects the priorities of my community of 
Guelph—Wellington.  Ninety per cent of all taxpayers will 
receive a reduction in taxes.  Eighty per cent of the budget is 
made up of education and health care.  This is in keeping with 
what all Canadians have told us their priorities are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The students of Guelph—Wellington will be helped.  Transfer 
payments to the provinces will be increased and more money will 
go to research and development.  I am especially pleased to see 
the contract payment system become mandatory.

Guelph—Wellington and Canada for making this possible. Balancing

Canadians, in particular Albertans, will be forgiven if they are 
sceptical about yesterday's budget promises.  Only those with 
short memories have forgotten the Prime Minister's 1990 
commitment that “the Liberal government in two years will make 
the Senate elected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same Liberal leader can now boast the longest unbroken 
string of Senate patronage appointments in history.  It is time 
to cut that string.  Albertans are tired of waiting and they are 
demanding the right to choose their senators.  After all it is 
their tax dollars he has used to fund this $50 million a year 
patronage haven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Alberta senator has offered to resign his seat if the Prime 
Minister would appoint an elected senator.  This mechanism is in 
place in Alberta and we can hold a vote as soon as there are 
municipal elections this fall. This Calgarian recognizes the need 
for an effective Senate and is willing to put his prized seat on 
the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Prime Minister live up to his promise of an

might ask what a recent graduate in Regina who was forced into

Minister of Finance.  Neither of them believes yesterday's budget 
will really help students in debt.

of the people the Minister of Finance claims to help in his 
budget.

the opportunity to learn, behind the scenes there are cynical 
plans to change bankruptcy legislation to protect the banks 
rather than students.

up for the banks at the expense of students by changing the

yesterday, in his budget speech, the Minister of Finance announced 
an important measure for young Canadians that will help reduce the 
high level of student indebtedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers who are repaying their student loans will receive 
assistance from the federal government.  For instance, a student 
repaying a loan of $25,000, or $3,800 a year, will be entitled to 
a federal and provincial tax credit of $530, representing 17% of 
the $2,125 in interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure shows that the federal government is listening to 
young people struggling to repay student loans. 
Under no circumstances does our government wish to see student 
indebtedness jeopardizing the future of our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure shows the Liberal government's desire to improve 
the quality of life of Canadian citizens, young people in 
particular, as they undertake or pursue job training.

hurting badly.  No place in Canada is hurting more than Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals did not get the message in last June's election. 
Regrettably they have not responded to the real needs of Atlantic 
Canadians.  The numbers speak for themselves.  There are record 
numbers of unemployed.  Record numbers of Atlantic Canadians are 
moving to other parts of Canada and regrettably to other parts of 
the world to seek opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at a record high rate of unemployment in Atlantic 
Canada.  The Liberals have done nothing about it since taking 
office.  With their failure to respond they are crippling the 
economy of Atlantic Canada.  But what else could we expect from a 
government that was elected with no plan for Atlantic Canada?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what a disappointment. For the first time in a 
generation a Prime Minister could have charted a new course for 
our country. He could have set us on the path to debt reduction 
and tax relief but he blew it. Canada's debt:  $583 billion this 
year, $583 billion next year, $583 billion in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does debt reduction always come last with Liberal 
governments? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, for the Liberal government it is very important to note 
that the Leader of the Opposition in the last campaign promised 
to balance the budget by March 31, 1999.  So he would not have 
even been able to talk about debt reduction at this moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Leader of the Opposition has come into this House many 
times and has always said we were not preoccupied by debt 
reduction and tax reduction. But I would like him to go to the 
budget book and on page 17 it says that with the programs— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Leader of the Opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government did not balance the budget; the taxpayers 
did. Over the next three years this government is going to take 
$48 billion more in tax revenues out of the pockets of those 
taxpayers. It gives the taxpayers a pittance in tax relief and 
collects $48 billion more in tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do Canadians still pay the highest personal income taxes in 
the free world? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I know that he knows that that is not true. Anyone who 
reads a little bit about the economy of the world knows that that 
is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to the question of debt and taxes, it is in front of 
the hon. member's eyes on page 17. For the next four years it 
states what will happen, and it will not be as good as we would 
like it to be. Sixty percent of what will happen will go for tax 
reduction and debt reduction and 40% for new spending. Really, we 
have to go to 50:50. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I wanted the truth, I would not read out of that 
book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who got us into this mess? It was the spenders, the big Tory 
spenders, the big Liberal spenders who got us into this mess. Who 
got us out of this deficit? It was the savers.  It was the 
taxpayers, the hardworking taxpayers. Yet in yesterday's budget, 
the surplus was given to the spenders and the taxpayers got 
little or nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister always at the end of the day reward 
the spenders rather than the taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, turn to page 17. I am rewarding those who want tax 
relief and debt reduction. Yes, there is more revenue than 
expected because we had the right policies to make sure that the 
interest rates were low and that our exports were very good. That 
is why Canadians are making more money and they keep more money, 
and of course they help us to balance the budget. It is as clear 
as that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberals have taken out the taxpayers' chequebook again. Just 
when we thought that taxpayers had some rights, just when we 
thought that the Prime Minister would do the responsible thing 
and start paying down the debt, he popped the cork on the 
spending champagne, and that is wrong. The tiny token tax cut was 
more than swallowed up by the CPP increases that they instituted 
at the beginning of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a surplus yesterday.  Just how is it that that surplus 
got sucked up so soon?

that the government will have paid back $12 billion of market 
debt in 1997-98.  This is the debt whiche we have to collect 
money to pay interest on.  They should know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, yes, we have balanced the books one year earlier than 
they were to do it.  It is going to be balanced next year and the

<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister talks about paying down market debt.  That is

huge CPP tax hikes.  This year we will pay $167 billion.  By the 
turn of the century, in the year 2000, it will be going up to 
$173 billion: $161 billion, $167 billion, $173 billion.  It is 
going up, up and away.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  When he approached Mr.

the field of education was raising hackles in Quebec and that 
everyone involved—students, the academic community and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I had the privilege and the pleasure of speaking with Mr. Landry, 
who understands very well, as we do on this side, the importance of 
investing in the future of young people throughout Canada, 
including Quebec.  Education is the key to young people's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Landry is highly respected and successful.  He will do an

education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, did the Prime Minister—and this is my question—tell 
the new chairman of the Canadian millennium scholarship fund that 
the position he was appointing him to would put him between a 
rock and a hard place, that is, at the heart of a potential 
federal-provincial battle, because no one in Quebec wants Ottawa 
involved in education? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I hope Mr. Landry will realize that Philippe Leclerc, the president

put young people's priorities in the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member will understand the remarks of Mario 
Dumont—who is not necessarily one of my greatest friends.  He 
said: “Lucien Bouchard would really like the next election campaign

of confrontation whatever the cost could well end up penalizing 
students in Quebec”.

in revenues per family.

revenues are going up.  Why are the government's revenues going 
up?  They are going up because there are a million more Canadians 
back at work.  They are going up because Canadian corporations 
are making more profits, therefore they are paying more taxes and 
revenues are going up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain slowly to the Reform Party.  When economic 
activity is good and when Canadians are going back to work and

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance acknowledge that his government's

<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us simply take a look at the record. The fact of the 
matter is this year there was a $1.4 billion cut in employment 
insurance premiums.  In yesterday's budget we cut taxes for 
students, we cut taxes for single mothers and single families, we 
cut taxes for 13 million Canadians. In fact, 14 million Canadians 
saw a tax reduction. We eliminated for all those taxpayers 
earning $50,000 or less the odious surtax imposed by the kissing 
cousins of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is a $7 billion tax cut package was in yesterday's

can smell that odious thing right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once upon a time there was a hope in this country that maybe, 
just maybe, once the budget was balanced there would be some 
prospect of significant tax relief.  It was kind of like the 
faint hope clause for Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in this budget, when we add together the CPP increases, the 
bracket creep, the user fees, the hidden taxes, Canadians are 
paying more taxes now and in the future than ever before in 
history.

put $134 million more into the Medical Research Council for 
medical research.  We put a substantial amount of money into the 
national AIDS strategy.  We put $60 million into the blood

Speaker, after all the hype and the headlines what real change 
has this budget brought about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians still pay the highest personal income taxes in the 
free world.  We still have a $583 billion national debt, a second 
mortgage of $77,000 per Canadian family.  Government spending has 
never been higher in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not have to be this way.  After all, we had a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the finance minister blow this money on more spending 
instead of real tax relief and real debt reduction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would simply say to the hon. member is helping 13 
million Canadians lower their taxes not tax real relief?  Is 
helping single mothers not real tax relief?  Is helping students 
not real tax relief? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What constituency is the hon. member talking about?  Who is he 
worried about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made it very clear.  We are going to cut personal taxes and 
we are going to start with low and middle income Canadians.  We 
will get to his friends later.

<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, many people look to <I>Hansard</I> as being a fairly 
accurate record of the proceedings of this House.  I am not sure 
if this is a point of order or a point of privilege.  I will 
allow you to judge that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would like to point out to you that I have checked 
<I>Hansard</I> last week and this week just to see how the remarks 
that I have been making have come through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week in the debate on C-4, remarks that I did not make were 
attributed to me in the <I>Hansard</I> record and yesterday, in 
looking through this again, I note that I had an intervention. 
Following that intervention a response was made to what I had 
said by a Bloc member.  None of that is recorded in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring that to your attention because I think there are many 
people out there that look to <I>Hansard</I> to be fairly 
accurate.  I do not know what can be done about this, but I think 
it is something that should be looked into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, I thank you for bringing that 
to my attention as you did earlier at the chair.  If some error 
has been made I will see to it that (a) the <I>Hansard</I> blues 
are checked through and (b) we will refer to the audio which is 
on the television portion.  If there is a correction to be made 
it will be made.  It was inadvertent if it did happen.

I would like to ask if you would bring the results of that back 
to this House.  I have heard concerns of this before, not just 
from this member.  We would like a report back to the House, 
please. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Of course we are going to check it and 
we will see where it is.  If it is an error, I guess we make some 
errors, but we will try to cut down on them as much as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have a look at the blues and the television tapes and if 
indeed that was on there, if it is necessary, I will report back 
to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to go to point of order from the hon. member for 
Edmonton North.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during Statements by Members today my colleague from Wild Rose 
said that he had spent the last four years touring around the 
country visiting prisons and then went on to make some comments 
about the prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that moment the member for Brampton West—Mississauga blurted 
out from her place “eating your way around the—” and then 
covered her mouth, realizing what she had said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to these vicious personal attacks, which are 
unnecessary, could she stand up and withdraw the comment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  In the heat of everything that was going 
on I did not hear the remarks.  I do not know that they were 
made, but an hon. member has been named.  The hon. member for 
Brampton West—Mississauga is here now.  Perhaps she could 
clarify whether anything was said. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West—Mississauga, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, instead of getting into a petty argument I would 
like to withdraw that comment.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier today, during Oral Question Period, you 
asked a member to withdraw his statement suggesting that a minister had 
said things that were untrue. That is what you asked the hon. member for 
Medicine Hat to do, and he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, claiming to be quoting from a newspaper, another member, 
in this case the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, said basically 
the same thing about the Minister of Finance, still alleging that the 
words were not his but those of the reporter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 487.(2) of <I>Beauchesne</I> clearly states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>487.(2) Words may not be used hypothetically or conditionally, 
if they are plainly intended to convey a direct imputation— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, whether his words were used hypothetically or 
borrowed from someone else, the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot 
does not have the right to use words the hon. member for Medicine Hat 
was forbidden to use, and rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I suggest that you ask the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot to withdraw the words he used in reference 
to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Members, of course, cannot quote from another person 
who used words they are not allowed to use in this House. I sometimes 
miss a word here and there, and I missed those. It happens. The hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is here. He was named. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did he use a word suggesting that someone in this House lied? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
simply read what Alain Dubuc wrote in the paper, namely that the 
Minister of Finance was so secretive about his budget, almost to the 
point of deception, or something to that effect. But it was a quote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> It is a very simple issue. As I said, we cannot use 
this word, even if it is from someone else, in this case a journalist. 
We cannot use someone else's words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to withdraw these words if he did use 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, while listening to you, I found 
the exact quote. I would not want to distort the statement made 
by Alain Dubuc, who is the editorial wrtier from <I>La Presse</I>. He 
wrote, yesterday, that “the minister is cautious to the point of 
becoming deceitful”.  And if you ask me— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Even if it is from Mr. Dubuc, we cannot say this. I am 
asking the hon. member to withdraw this comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would not want to stir up 
controversy. We have better things to do. I withdraw these words. I 
could have replaced them by “Mr. Dubuc said—”

honour to present a petition pursuant to Standing Order 36.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners indicate that if the government is to proceed 
with any form of tax reform, which we have just seen it is really 
not, it should be phasing out or phasing down the GST.

afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners believe that consumers in Canada are basically 
at the mercy of the pricing policies of oil companies.  They 
therefore petition the Government of Canada to adopt legislation 
which would require gasoline companies to give 30 days written 
notice to the Minister of Natural Resources of an impending 
significant increase in the price of gasoline of over 1% of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the second petition pursuant to Standing Order 36 is 
from a number of Canadians who are very concerned about the 
multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Canadians are concerned that the House of Commons would be 
signing this without public debate. They are calling on the 
government and the House of Commons to debate this issue in the 
House publicly and to place the issue, if the Government of 
Canada decides to sign the MAI, before a national referendum for 
all the people of Canada to make that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are concerned about this because obviously the rights of 
Canadian citizens and the power of the Government of Canada would 
be greatly superseded by those foreign— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. I know the hon. member will not 
want to make a speech on the presentation of petitions but 
comply with the rules and give a brief summary of the petition 
and perhaps the place where the petitioners are from, which I

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that police 
officers and firefighters are required to place their lives at 
risk on a daily basis and that employment benefits for them often 
do not provide sufficient compensation for the families of those 
who are killed in the line of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also state that the public mourns their loss when they are 
killed in the line of duty and wishes to support in a tangible 
way the surviving families in their time of need.

public safety officers killed in the line of duty.

that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to begin the debate on the 1998 federal budget. 
In the interests of civility I would like to find something in 
the budget on which I could compliment the minister at the 
outset.  The best I can do is we note that the colour scheme of 
the 1998 budget is not Liberal red but Reform green.  I would 
like to compliment the minister on this change in colour scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the duty of the official opposition to hold the government 
accountable for its actions and to present constructive 
alternatives where we consider the government's course of action 
weak or misguided.  This duty we now intend to discharge in 
relation to the federal budget presented to the House yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by commenting on what could have been.  This budget 
could have been the best piece of economic news to be received by 
Canadian taxpayers in the last three decades.  It could have been 
a budget and budget day to be celebrated by all Canadians 
regardless of party.  This could have been the case because, for 
the first time in 28 years, the federal budget is balanced.  For 
the first time since fiscal year 1969-1970 the federal government 
will not be spending more than it takes in in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A balanced budget, the elimination of the deficit, has been a 
goal to which the Reform Party has aspired since its inception. 
It is a goal which has been pursued by many other Canadians, by 
the chambers of commerce, by the boards of trade, by the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business, by the Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation, by the C.D. Howe Institute, by the Business Council 
on National Issues, the conference board.  The fact that this 
objective has been reached could have been, for all of us, a day 
of unqualified celebration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I say could have been for a good reason.  I say could have 
been because this budget unfortunately and regrettably also 
contains a great betrayal of those Canadians who are chiefly 
responsible for eliminating the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the oft abused, oft ignored, long suffering Canadian 
taxpayers, the 14 million Canadians who pay personal income 
taxes, the hundreds of thousands of business people who pay 
corporate taxes and payroll taxes year after year, the millions 
upon millions of Canadians who pay consumption taxes including 
the hated GST every day on almost everything they buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us begin this budget debate by clearly recognizing that it 
is the taxpayers of Canada who are chiefly responsible for 
eliminating the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me establish this.  When the Liberals took office the 
deficit, the legacy of fiscal mismanagement left over from the 
Tories, stood at $42 billion.  It now stands at zero or near 
zero, but how was it eliminated?  It was eliminated in part by 
offloading federal spending on the provinces, by slashing 
transfers by $7.4 billion. This offloading accounted for about 
16.5% of the reduction of the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Primarily, however, the bulk of the deficit, 70% of it, was 
eliminated by increased tax revenues collected from the long 
suffering Canadian taxpayer. The federal government will collect 
$35 billion more from taxpayers in 1998 than it did in 1993.  It 
has levied 37 tax increases on top of the 71 tax increases levied 
by the previous tax happy Tory administration. So 70% of the 
deficit was eliminated not by cutting federal spending but by 
increased revenues from the taxpayers.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the most regrettable feature of the 
budget, a feature that will go down in Canadian history as the 
great betrayal.  If it is the Canadian taxpayer who has through 
the payment of increased taxes contributed the most toward 
eliminating the deficit, then by all that is fair and just and 
equitable it is the Canadian taxpayer who ought to be the first 
to be rewarded and ought to receive the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first claim on any surplus ought to be debt reduction and 
tax relief, the two highest priorities of the very people who 
made elimination of the deficit possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians had a right to expect that this might happen.  In the 
1997 federal election the Prime Minister solemnly promised the 
following, from page 29 of the 1997 red book: “We are moving 
towards a time when the budget will finally be balanced and the 
government will have a fiscal surplus. When we reach that time, 
we will allocate every billion dollars of fiscal dividend so that 
one half will go to a combination of reducing taxes and reducing 
the national debt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By this promise millions of ordinary Canadians were led to 
understand that as soon as there was a budget surplus they would 
be rewarded by half of every billion dollars of surplus going to 
tax relief and debt reduction, and they understood this would 
occur over the entire mandate of the government in the first 
year, the second year, the third year and the fourth year. But 
what happened?  Let me tell the House what happened.  Let me 
trace the downward spiral of government credibility on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year the government's <I>Fiscal Monitor</I> showed a 
December 1 public accounts surplus of $1.4 billion and financial 
surplus of $11.3 billion.  In other words, the official figures 
from the finance department showed a significant surplus.  But at 
the same time the finance department's spin doctors began to 
predict a year end deficit of $2 billion; in other words, a sign 
for anyone watching of front end loading by the government 
endeavouring to spend any surplus before it could accumulate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an old story. Finance ministers since the days of Sir 
John A. Macdonald have complained about civil servants, sensing a 
possible year end surplus in departmental budgets, rushing out to 
spend it before the fiscal year ends.  But in this case we have 
the Minister of Finance himself, the finance department itself, 
following exactly the same practice which it has decried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This downward spiral of credibility was further advanced by the 
Prime Minister's prebudget speech on Tuesday, February 17. 
Remember, this is the Prime Minister who a few months before was 
talking about debt reduction and tax relief. In that speech on 
February 17 there was not a word about debt reduction and not a 
word about tax relief.  It was as if the red book had become a 
dead book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the speech focused almost entirely on a new spending 
proposal in a sphere of provincial jurisdiction, namely the Prime 
Minister's $2.5 billion millennium scholarship fund.  By the 
Prime Minister's own election promise, if there was enough of a 
surplus to support a new $2.5 billion spending initiative there 
should automatically have been announced a $2.5 billion 
contribution to debt and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was not a peep from the Prime Minister on February 17 
about debt and tax relief, only the scratching sound of the 
Prime Minister's pen writing a cheque on the account of the 
taxpayers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The breaking of the Prime Minister's election promise, which was 
soon to come, became a fait accompli on February 18 when the 
finance minister told the CBC that he would not be 
“constrained” by the Prime Minister's election promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the great betrayal is confirmed in this budget speech. The 
budget discloses that the entire accumulating surplus for 1997 
was spent and no new tax cuts in 1997 and no real debt reduction. 
That surplus should have amounted to $3 billion and the 
government spent the whole thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget there is no serious effort to tackle the debt. 
Despite the fact that the polls say the majority of Canadians 
want debt retirement to be the number one priority of this 
government, the minister devoted only one and a half pages in his 
budget speech to debt reduction while he spent eleven pages and a 
great deal of time on spending proposals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Net public debt remains constant at $583 billion over the 
mandate of the government. Interest charges on the debt increase 
to $45 billion per year.  The claim that the government has 
reduced market debt by $13 billion fails to mention that much of 
this has been done by the government using its MasterCard to pay 
off its Visa card, using funds from the civil service 
superannuation fund and from CPP to pay off government debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision for only a $3 billion contingency reserve, which 
may go to paying down the debt only if it is not needed by the 
big spenders in the government, is completely inadequate.  In the 
1997 federal budget, and I quote from page 47, it said in big 
bold black letters—the finance department was trying to impress 
us—“the contingency reserve is not a source of funding for new 
policy initiatives”. It said the same thing on page 94 of the 
1996 budget.  It said the same thing on page 68 of the 1995 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in 1998 the contingency reserve disappeared and was 
replaced by an equal amount of new spending.  Program spending 
was budgeted at $103 billion.  The actual spending was $106 
billion. The difference was made up from this contingency fund 
that was not to be touched for that purpose. This says that 
statements by the minister, even if they are in the budget, about 
what the contingency reserve fund may or may not be used for are 
not worth the paper they are written on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed is the ironclad national debt retirement fund 
proposed by the official opposition and established by law, to 
which fund 50% of any budget surplus would be allocated by law 
each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big story of the budget is that while no serious effort is 
made to tackle the debt, spending is nevertheless up by $11 
billion over the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While tax relief measures amounting to $7 billion are offered 
over three years, total taxes paid by all taxpayers increased by 
$46 billion over the period. In other words the government is 
prepared to put $900 in tax relief into the average family's 
right pocket and then take almost $6,000 in additional tax 
revenues out of the left pocket and hope that the hapless 
taxpayer does not know what is happening to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find it unbelievable that the finance minister was able to 
get this shell game through the government caucus.  Picture it. 
He apparently came to the Liberal caucus one day, that great 
sheepfold where Liberal backbenchers are told what to do and 
think.  He must have said to them “I am going to give the 
Canadian taxpayers $7 billion in tax relief over the next three 
years and I am going to take 400,000 people off the tax rolls”. 
He must have said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently nobody stood up.  The chairman of the finance 
committee must have been sitting there; he did not stand up. 
Nobody stood up and said “Mr. Minister, while you are giving $7 
billion in tax relief over three years with one hand, our CPP 
payroll tax hike over the same period takes more than $7 billion 
from the pockets of those taxpayers.  So how can the taxpayers be 
further ahead?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, when the minister said he was going to take 400,000 
people off the tax rolls, surely someone in the Liberal caucus 
must have stood up and said “But Mr. Minister, bracket creep 
alone will add 460,000 people to the tax rolls over the same 
period and again the taxpayers are worse off at the end of the 
day”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is necessary to have an official opposition.  To 
hold the finance minister accountable, because there is 
absolutely no accountability demanded of the minister by the 
Liberal caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore 1998 should have gone down as a landmark victory for 
Canadian taxpayers, the end of overspending, the elimination of 
the deficit, the beginning of a new era of tax relief and debt 
reduction.  Instead it will go down as the year of the great 
betrayal, the year of the broken promise, the beginning not of 
broad based tax relief and debt reduction but the beginning of 
more Liberal spending, the very thing that led to high deficits, 
high debt and high taxes in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget eliminates a fiscal deficit but leaves in its place 
a credibility deficit which will not be eliminated until this 
government is driven from office.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose that Canadians should not be surprised by these 
betrayals and broken promises.  Exactly the same thing happened 
after the 1993 election.  Canadians were led to believe that if 
they voted Liberal, the promise to kill, scrap, abolish the GST 
would be kept.  But in the end the vision and the promise of tax 
relief was shattered by a broken promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that this pattern of betrayal has become an inherent 
characteristic of Liberal governments:  winning votes by 
presenting a vision encased in a promise and then shattering the 
vision by breaking the promise. It is a pattern of which I am 
personally reminded every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps not all members of the House are aware that the office 
on the fourth floor of the Centre Block which I now occupy as 
Leader of the Official Opposition is the old office which was 
occupied by Mackenzie King, the founder of modern liberalism.  He 
occupied it from 1920 to 1948, not just when he was leader of the 
opposition; he liked it so much he kept it when he was prime 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mackenzie King helped to decorate that office.  He helped to 
choose the frescos, the pictures around the top of the walls just 
below the ceiling.  These are pictures of knights in armour in 
various poses intended to depict the various virtues which 
parliamentarians are to display.  There is one displaying 
struggle.  There is one on integrity.  There is one on justice. 
There is one on conciliation. But it is the last fresco which is 
the most interesting.  It is entitled “Vision”.  It is the 
picture of an angel receiving a vision and handing it to the 
knight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to historians, the face on the angel is Mackenzie 
King's mother's face.  He asked the painter to put his mother's 
face on that picture.  We will recall that next to his dog, there 
was no creature on Earth more highly esteemed by Mackenzie King. 
Reformers esteem Mackenzie King's mother as well because she of 
course was the daughter of a Reformer, William Lyon Mackenzie, so 
I would not want to say anything to denigrate Mackenzie King's 
mother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, beneath this lovely portrait of “Vision” is a wall 
panel.  If we push it, we discover that it is on hinges and 
swings open to reveal a dark secret passage out of the office. I 
suggest that this is the perfect picture of Liberal politics. Up 
on high is this glorious vision, like the vision of a balanced 
budget, a vision of fiscal responsibility, but just beneath it is 
a trap door to enable them to escape the burden of the vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a shameful pattern.  It is a shameful legacy.  It is one 
which the finance minister will not be allowed to forget.  When 
the current finance minister replaces the current Prime Minister, 
as he seems determined to do, and when he then loses the next 
election, as he most surely will, he may very well find himself 
planning his retirement in the Turks and Caicos, sitting in that 
same office as leader of the official opposition.  He will then 
be daily reminded of that fatal flaw of a degenerate liberalism, 
a congenital predisposition to betray in government the visions 
it espouses at election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having outlined the greatest fundamental weakness of the budget, 
the betrayal of the interests of the taxpayer in debt reduction 
and tax relief, let me comment further on the spending and taxing 
components of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made it clear that its number one priority 
once the budget is balanced is to increase spending; 50% of any 
surplus should go to spending.  The budget itself contains 17 
spending proposals amounting to $11 billion over four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should note that the spending program proposed by the 
government has two major flaws, flaws which have become 
characteristic of Liberal budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first flaw is that government spending still contains 
billions of wasteful expenditures.  There is almost $1.1 billion 
of wasteful and patronage ridden regional development programs 
that simply do not work, have never worked and will never work. 
There is over $800 million in subsidies to CBC TV which should be 
eliminated through privatization while preserving Newsworld and 
CBC radio. 
There is at least $1 billion to DIAND that does not have a hope 
of ever getting down into the hands of ordinary aboriginal 
people.  The list goes on and on.  I have not mentioned the small 
wasteful expenditures which add up to big waste, such as spending 
$97,000 of federal money on a study of idolatry and religious 
practice in colonial Peru, or $57,000 on a study on wives and 
husbands in 15th century England.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member for St. Albert, chairman of the 
public accounts committee, will be dutifully digging out all 
these wasteful expenditures and reporting them in his regular 
“Waste Report”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second flaw in the government's spending program, and this 
is a big one and a bad one at this point in our history, is that 
the government continues to abuse its constitutional spending 
power by spending without consultation and without co-operation 
in provincial areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its biggest new expenditure item is the $2.5 billion millennium 
scholarship fund. Did the government go to students and ask them 
“We have $2.5 billion to spend on education, how do you think it 
should be spent?”  If the government had done that, it would 
have heard that the preference of students is to pay down 
existing student debt which is now accumulating at the rate of $2 
billion a year and to increase transfers to institutions in order 
to lower tuitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government go to the provinces?  This House is to be 
bound by the Constitution.  It has a list of what the federal 
government does and what the provincial governments do.  If we go 
through the list, education is under the provinces. Presumably 
the government went to the provinces and asked them “We have 
$2.5 billion for education.  How would you like us to spend it?” 
If the government had done that, it would have heard that the 
provinces' priority would have been for the federal government to 
restore the $7 billion in cuts to health and education transfers 
made in previous years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest flaws therefore in the government spending programs 
are its abuse of the Constitution and its failure to eliminate 
waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constructive alternative, and the official opposition is in 
the business of constructive alternatives, offered by the 
official opposition is contained in our booklet entitled 
“Securing Your Future”.  Our alternative is to hold the line on 
spending at $103 billion.  This can largely be done by 
eliminating the wasteful expenditures that I have referred to 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose to hold that line for three years while the focus is 
entirely on debt and tax relief.  Then we say allow spending to 
rise but only by the percentage rate that the economy itself is 
growing.  The difference between the government spending program 
and the Reform spending program is the difference between 
irresponsible, unconstrained spending and responsible limited 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn for a minute to taxation.  To finance its spending 
program, the government will collect $151 billion in taxes next 
year, $35 billion more than the Liberals collected in 1993.  If 
the CPP payroll taxes are included, the total rises to $42 
billion more than the government was taking in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To maintain this level of revenue, Tory and Liberal 
administrations over the past 14 years have established one of 
the most socially and financially repressive tax regimes in the 
western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here today, at the commencement of the 1998 budget debate, 
with the full backing of 58 Reform colleagues to say on behalf of 
millions of Canadian taxpayers, enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the 14 million personal income taxpayers upon whom 
the government has inflicted the highest personal income taxes in 
the western world, we are here to say enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of small and large 
business people who are strangling in Revenue Canada red tape and 
who cannot expand or hire more employees because they are paying 
too much income tax, too much excise tax and too much payroll 
tax, we are here to say on their behalf that enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the 2.7 million taxpayers, single mothers, young 
graduates, retired Canadians, Canadians whom the finance minister 
described today in question period as ones for whom he has such a 
passionate concern, and from whom he collects $1.4 billion a year 
in taxes, we are here to say enough is enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the 7.7 million taxpayers, hard working, often 
underemployed parents and citizens making $30,000 a year from 
whom this finance minister extracts $12 billion a year in 
revenue, we are here to say that enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of Canadian young people 
who see their first paycheque chopped by Revenue Canada, we are 
here to say enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deplore the hypocrisy exhibited by the other side on this 
point.  The youngest members in this House are in this caucus, 
not in that caucus.  If anyone is entitled to speak on how young 
people feel about taxes and debt, it is this caucus, not that 
aging caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hundreds of thousands of seniors who are worried sick 
when they see an ever increasing proportion of their fixed income 
clawed back by the government, we are here to say on their behalf 
because they cannot stand here and say it themselves, that enough 
is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the millions of moms and dads, like the Kim Hicks 
family that visited the House earlier in the year, who cannot 
make ends meet because they are paying more in taxes than they 
pay for food, for shelter, for clothing, we are here to say that 
enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all those Canadian families who have taken a $3,000 
a year pay cut because of the spend and tax policies of the 
government, and who cannot personally stand in this House to 
protest the injustice and the frustration and the unfairness of 
it all, we are here to say enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more and more Canadians, the federal government is no longer 
identified with the services it provides.  This government is not 
considered by the rank and file of people as the government of 
medicare, or the government of old age assistance, or the 
government of the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the minds of millions of Canadians the federal 
government is most identified with the excessive taxes it 
imposes.  It is the government of Revenue Canada.  It is the 
government of T-4s.  It is the government of the GST.  It is the 
government of taxes which, if not reduced, threaten to render the 
very name of the Government of Canada and the finance minister 
and the finance department odious to the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are members opposite who do not know the meaning of the 
word odious, its synonyms are: repulsive, repugnant, disgusting, 
disreputable, despicable, detestable, execrable, infamous, 
invidious, obnoxious, offensive, contemptible, abominable, 
loathsome, repellent and hateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that the Canadian taxpayer did not get into this 
abused relationship with the federal government all at once. This 
confiscation of the taxpayers' income and resources by successive 
governments has happened gradually, one tax at a time, one 
increase at a time, the hope of such governments being that the 
taxpayer will be annoyed and inconvenienced by each tax bite but 
never angered enough to revolt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's approach to taxpayers reminds me of an 
old story.  When it comes to taxes there are no new stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an old story of a travelling salesman whose car broke down 
in the country.  He hiked over to a farmer's house.  The farmer 
offered to help but first invited him in for lunch.  As the 
salesman sat down at the table he noted that seated at the 
farmer's table were the farmer's wife, three children and a pig. 
The pig had three medals around its neck and a wooden leg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This salesman was a Canadian.  That meant he was polite.  He did 
not want to appear nosy.  He did not want to appear inquisitive. 
So he sat through the whole meal without saying anything, just 
making small talk. Finally he could not contain himself.  He said 
to the farmer “What is with the pig?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmer explained “One of our children once fell into the 
dugout. 
That pig ran into the dugout and pulled the child out so we gave 
him a medal”.  He said “Our second child once set fire to the 
barn.  The pig ran in there, pulled that child out from the 
flames and the smoke and we gave him another medal”. He said 
“The third child was once cornered in the field by a bull but 
that pig rushed in, diverted the bull so that the child could run 
to safety.  We gave him another medal”. “That explains the 
medals”, said the salesman, “but what about the wooden leg?” 
“Well”, said the farmer “when you have a pig this good, you 
only eat him a piece at a time”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that that farmer's attitude toward the pig is very 
similar to the Liberal government's attitude toward the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is willing to recognize the heroic achievements 
of the average taxpayer who is raising a family, paying the 
mortgage, paying taxes.  It gives him a medal for that.  The 
Liberals are even willing to give him or her a taste of tax 
relief now and then, like the $7 billion promised over the next 
three years while at the same time collecting $46 billion more 
through general tax revenue increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in the end, this government's primary interest in that 
taxpayer is to confiscate more and more of his or her income. 
Only with a taxpayer that good, you do not eat him all at once. 
You just eat him a bit at a time, a leg today, an arm tomorrow 
and the rest next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the Liberal-Tory record of overtaxation is one of 
the most socially and financially repressive regimes in the 
western world and Canadians are paying the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Canadian who is out of work or working for low pay and 
under poor conditions, and there are millions of them, is paying 
the price of this high tax regime in this country.  Every parent 
or senior who is living in despair below the poverty line and 
still paying taxes, and there are millions of them, is paying the 
price of too high a tax system. Every entrepreneur who defers 
investment in a new project, every business person who decides 
not to hire another employee because their income is strained by 
overtaxation, they are paying the price of too high a tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people want real tax relief, not token tax relief.  They 
want real tax relief moved up, way up on the agenda of this 
Parliament and this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of tax relief, my colleagues, in particular the 
official opposition critic for finance, the member for Medicine 
Hat, and the official opposition critic for revenue, the member 
for Calgary Southeast, will have more to say on the official 
opposition's proposals for tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say that if the tax relief proposals contained in 
the official opposition's “Securing Your Future” program were 
to be fully implemented, they would deliver more than $20 billion 
in tax relief per year to Canadians. They would lift 1.3 million 
lower and middle income Canadians off the federal tax rolls 
altogether which in turn would lift a tremendous weight of worry 
and anguish off the shoulders of those taxpayers. They would 
deliver more than $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of 
four by the year 2000 which in turn would deliver stress relief 
to families such as no government program could deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When fully implemented, our tax relief proposals would deliver 
over $1.4 billion per year in tax relief to Atlantic Canada, over 
$4.5 billion per year in tax relief to Quebec, almost $7.5 
billion per year in tax relief to Ontario, over $1.4 billion per 
year in tax relief to Manitoba and Saskatchewan, over $1.9 
billion per year in tax relief to Alberta, and over $2.5 billion 
per year in tax relief to British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is tax relief that would do more to stimulate local 
economies and accomplish regional development than all the 
regional development programs and policies ever conceived of or 
implemented by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Reform proposals would deliver genuine broad based tax 
relief to people, but I am talking about more than financial 
relief.  I am talking about relief from stress and guilt and 
worry and anxiety and despair.  I am talking about people being 
able to sleep better at night, being able to get out of debt, to 
have more money to put away, to build more security and freedom 
in their own lives and to have more opportunity to get a decent 
job with a good income. Tax relief is not just a fiscal policy. 
It is a social policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken earlier of the great betrayal of the Canadian 
taxpayer contained in the budget. But there are two other groups 
of Canadians for whom this budget will also be a huge 
disappointment. 
I refer first to Canadian youth and second to Canada's 
unemployed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had a marvellous convention last weekend with an active 
group of young people from across the country.  They are acutely 
conscious, much more conscious than perhaps their elders that 
under the Liberal-Tory mismanagement the federal government has 
piled up this federal debt of $583 billion or $20,000 worth of 
debt for every man, woman and child in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debt constitutes an intergenerational transfer of wealth 
since the taxes needed to finance the interest and the principal 
are levied on future taxpayers while the borrowing that the debt 
represents enriches the lives of current citizens. The debt in 
fact constitutes a $77,000 second mortgage on every family of 
four in the country, both the principal and the interest on which 
must be paid off by future generations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, as if that was not enough, the young people of this 
country are conscious that under Liberal-Tory mismanagement of 
the Canada pension plan the unfunded liability of that plan now 
amounts to another $485 billion.  So the unfunded liability on 
the Canada pension plan constitutes a third mortgage on every 
family of four in the amount of $65,000, the repayment of which 
falls squarely and disproportionately on the young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Against these huge obligations, the $77,000 second mortgage, the 
$65,000 third mortgage, which successive governments have loaded 
on to young people, what does the government have to offer?  A 
$2.5 billion millennium fund.  An amount insufficient to pay the 
interest for one month on the debt imposed on young Canadians; an 
amount which pales into insignificance when compared with the 
hundreds of millions of dollars in tuition fees paid by students 
each year or the billions of dollars in student debt already 
accumulated; an amount which pales into insignificance when 
compared with the CPP premiums young Canadians will have to pay 
after the minister's 73% hike in CPP payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the betrayal of youth by a generation of shortsighted 
and self-serving Liberal and Tory politicians, the official 
opposition offers not tokenism but constructive alternatives. 
Some of these details will be elaborated on by my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say at this point that we support the reform of 
the student loan program to make interest on student loans 
deductible and to make repayment less onerous and more secure by 
directing it through the income tax system. But we want to do 
much more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the weeks ahead we intend to enter into a public discussion 
on a reform of CPP which will give young people a choice between 
the current CPP managed by the government and a personal pension 
plan designed for younger and middle aged workers owned and 
controlled by them, not by the government. But our greatest 
commitment to youth in the future is reflected in a concrete plan 
to tackle and reduce the crushing federal debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan has three features.  The first is a commitment to 
devote 50% of future budget surpluses to debt retirement, to 
reduce the mortgage on our young people's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is a commitment to set debt reduction targets and to 
stick to them and not the pale targets contained in this budget 
which no financier in the world would even recognize as a target. 
We propose concrete targets of reducing federal debt from 70% of 
GDP to 50% by the year 2003 and 20% by the year 2016; in other 
words to cut that second mortgage on every family in this country 
from $77,000 to $36,900 over the next 20 years. This achieves 
savings of some $20 billion in interest per year which are then 
available either for tax relief or for social investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we back up these commitments with balanced budget 
legislation:  a legal definition of surplus so that the games 
playing that has gone on around here over the last three months 
cannot go on, a commitment to accounting principles for 
calculating the surplus that will prevent finance ministers from 
playing with the books; a legal requirement to keep the budget 
balanced over a four year cycle; a legal requirement to put 50% 
of defined surplus into a national debt retirement fund; and 
penalties on ministers and MPs for violation of those guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six provinces of this country have balanced budget laws.  If the 
federal government were really serious about debt retirement or 
removing this enormous burden from future generations, this 
budget should have been accompanied by a federal law making a 
repeat of the Liberal-Tory deficit and debt accumulation illegal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to direct a word to that other vast group of Canadians 
whose needs will never be met by the budget.  This is a group 
whose hopes have been mocked by budget after budget and throne 
speech after throne speech produced by the Liberal government. 
This is a group to which the federal government addresses more 
words than any other and does less than it does for any other 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the 1.4 million Canadians who are without work today, 
the 2 million to 3 million Canadians who are underemployed, and 
the hundreds of thousands of unemployed or underemployed young 
people which give us the highest youth unemployment record in the 
western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From jobs, jobs, jobs and employment is the number one priority 
in its first budget in 1994, the government has fallen into the 
pallid and token provisions for job creation and youth employment 
contained in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we believed that government spending and government 
policy could somehow lead to jobs in the numbers that are 
required by the unemployed, who would ever believe that the 
government, after five years in office and a record of failure in 
this area, has any new answers?  In contrast, the official 
opposition has a job creation strategy for the 21st century 
worthy of the name, large enough to match the problem and 
particularly capable of offering help to youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has relied on a one cylinder engine of government 
spending to drive its job creation engine.  The official 
opposition wants to harness a bigger, stronger four cylinder 
engine to that task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other three cylinders are business investment, consumer 
spending and international trade.  To stimulate business 
investment and consumer spending we advocate the broad based tax 
relief discussed a moment ago.  That includes a $3.3 billion 
reduction in payroll taxes paid by job creating employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there needs to be more investment in job creation and 
human resources, in training and technology, but does anyone in 
their right mind believe that the federal government is the best 
one to lead or to make that investment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cannot even train its senators to come to 
work, let alone do something useful when they get there.  The 
federal government cannot even apply technology like electronic 
voting to the House.  I hope someone writes that little story up 
one of these days, if they think the federal government has a 
grasp on how to attach modern technology to a current operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let those investments be primarily made by individuals and 
families in their own education and by institutions and companies 
in training and technology, by leaving more of their own dollars 
in their own pockets through tax relief.  Until that stimulus is 
provided we are absolutely convinced there will be no significant 
improvement in job creation numbers over the present levels. 
While the present employment levels may be good enough for 
Liberals, they are not good enough for the official opposition 
and they are not good enough for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have something to say to every unemployed person, particularly 
those who have become weary and discouraged because they feel 
there is no hope.  I have something to say to every underemployed 
person.  I meet lots of them:  the university graduate who is 
working in the fast food joint, the engineering graduate who is 
driving a cab.  Whoever they are and wherever they are, I want to 
say to the hundreds of thousands of young people who are worried 
about finding a summer job, let alone finding a good paying 
permanent job, that the key to more jobs is tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key to more jobs is not more government programs.  It is not 
more rhetoric like we saw in the budget speech.  That has not 
worked.  For the past 10 years it has not worked.  The key is 
more dollars in the pockets of consumers to spend and in the 
pockets of investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the great army of the unemployed and underemployed 
made common cause with the oppressed and angry taxpayers to 
demand the tax relief which is the key to firing up the job 
creation engine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country needs to further stimulate the fourth great cylinder 
of the job creation engine.  We need to stimulate greater 
international trade, a stronger export sector and a bigger and 
better strategy than trade junkets to prospective trading 
countries led by the Prime Minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country needs tax relief to make our exporters more 
competitive.  We need an MAI that works for Canada, that will 
allow responsible Canadian based multinationals to function 
freely and securely anywhere in the world.  We need an 
enlargement of our trading sphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this latter point I am proposing today that Canada and the 
United States invite the United Kingdom to join the North 
American free trade area.  Expansion of the North American free 
trade area means more jobs and higher incomes for Canadians.  The 
country's trade alliances should reinforce and complement our 
historic foreign policy and defence alliances.  The United 
Kingdom has more in common with Canada and the United States with 
respect to foreign policy and defence issues than it has with 
France or Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting the United Kingdom into NAFTA would be particularly 
beneficial to Atlantic Canada, which could then promote itself as 
Europe's great trade gateway to North America, just as the U.K. 
could promote itself as America's gateway to European trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition calls upon Canada's Prime Minister to do 
something strategic and far sighted for once to increase and 
enlarge our trading sphere, to actively pursue with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair the 
idea of Britain joining the North American free trade area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if in the end this idea is resisted, Canada and the Prime 
Minister should at least be more vigorously pursuing freer trade 
with Europe and doing so in association and co-operation with our 
oldest Atlantic partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came to the budget debate today, half hoping that this could 
be a day of unbridled celebration of our 10 year advocacy of a 
balanced budget.  Instead, we find ourselves forced to hold the 
government accountable for a broken promise.  It is a great 
betrayal of the Canadian taxpayers and a great betrayal of 
Canada's youth and unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To counter these dark blotches on the government's budget, we 
offer the alternative of, first, a commitment of 50% of any 
future surplus to debt reduction; second, a commitment of 50% of 
any future surplus to tax relief; and, third, a job creation 
strategy based on a broader foundation and a broader vision than 
anything contained in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, while Canada awaits new and better leadership 
than that offered by the authors of the budget, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK159">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by replacing all the words after the 
word “that” with the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons reject the budget statement by the Minister 
of Finance because it denies Canadians debt and tax relief by 
spending away the federal budget surplus, thus killing 
opportunities for job creation and economic growth; it leaves 
Canadians saddled with the highest personal income tax rates in 
the G-7 countries resulting in a systematic brain drain to 
jurisdictions with lower taxation levels; it allows interest 
charges on the national debt to consume one-third of every tax 
dollar collected by the federal government and to exceed spending 
on health care, education and old age security combined; it 
continues the steady decrease in real disposable income for the 
average Canadian through tax hikes; and it does not keep the 
government's promise of committing 50% of the surplus to new 
spending and the remaining 50% to some combination of debt 
reduction and tax relief.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on the finance minister's fifth budget, but I am not 
too pleased with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to congratulate the real architects of 
the battle against the deficit reduction, of the initiative to put 
public finances in order. I would like to congratulate Lucien Bouchard 
and his finance minister, Bernard Landry; Ontario finance minister Ernie 
Eves; New Brunswick finance minister Edmond Blanchard and the other 
finance ministers in the maritimes. I would like to congratulate Alberta 
finance minister Day Strockwell; Manitoba finance minister Eric 
Stefanson; 
British Columbia finance minister MacPhail and the finance minister of 
Saskatchewan too. Together, they had to withstand 52% of the spending 
cuts made by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My congratulations to the unemployed, and to employers and 
employees. In the past three years, the Minister of Finance has taken 
between $6 billion and $7 billion from annual surpluses that belonged to 
them to put his fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the taxpayers in Quebec and Canada 
because they too were instrumental in restoring the health of public 
finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the four years he has been Minister of Finance and the 
Liberal government has run the country, the taxpayers of Quebec and 
Canada have been hit with $30 billion in new taxes by the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the benefits to be found in this budget are few and far 
between. This is why the congratulations stop here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance definitely does not deserve to be 
congratulated for putting our fiscal house in order. Let us just make a 
quick calculation; it is easy to do with the successive budgets of the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's own efforts only account for 12% of the money, which 
really comes from the provinces, the employment insurance fund and the 
taxpayers' pockets. We have no congratulations for the minister, who 
said this morning that our fiscal house has been put in order, a zero 
deficit has been achieved, and a surplus now exists. The minister was 
right in using the impersonal form instead of “we”, because he is not 
the one who did all this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very disappointed by the way the minister is going about 
putting our fiscal house in order; he is keeping practically all the 
resulting dividends, even though he deserves no credit at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is keeping over 50% of these dividends. What is he 
doing with that money? He is taking all sorts of initiatives, even in 
areas where he asked the provinces, the unemployed, the welfare 
recipients and the sick to make sacrifices. He is taking all sorts of 
initiatives for students, in the area of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After cutting $12 billion in social assistance, post-secondary 
education and health care, after having already cut billions in 
the past three years, not to mention that he is about to cut 
another $30 billion—as part of the budget cuts included in his 
1995 budget—the Minister of Finance is taking all sorts of 
initiatives, such as the $2.5 billion millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting to the issue of provincial jurisdiction, let me say 
something about the somewhat secretive nature of the minister's 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the millennium scholarship fund will start giving out 
scholarships only in two years. However, in his budget, the Minister of 
Finance eliminated any sign of a real surplus for this year, by 
including the whole amount of $2.5 billion, even though he will start 
giving out that money to students only in five years.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resulted in almost unanimous agreement—all analysts 
zeroed in on this ploy—that the Minister of Finance was 
overstepping the bounds, that he was not behaving in the most 
transparent manner in showing where public finances were headed, 
and that he was sometimes using somewhat dubious methods, such as 
concealing the real surplus for this year and for the next two 
years, by including in the 1998-99 budget an amount of $2.5 billion 
that will actually be spent two years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time the Minister of Finance has done 
this sort of thing. 
I cannot recall a single time in the first four budgets where the 
Minister of Finance gave us figures that made sense, that 
corresponded to the reality of public finances. 
It is very important in democracy to show things as they 
really are, and it is even more important to do so when it comes to 
putting one's fiscal house in order, even if we were not talking 
about the Minister of Finance, who is asking the most disadvantaged 
Quebeckers and Canadians in particular to make tremendous 
sacrifices.  These people are entitled to transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please.  The hon. member for 
Mississauga South on a point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect, the statements 
of the member attributing something to the finance minister which 
he says is not the truth I believe are unparliamentary.  I would 
ask the member if— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I have been listening quite 
attentively to the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that everything the hon. member said was 
parliamentary.  He did not suggest that the minister had been 
dishonest.  His remarks are in order.  This is a point of debate 
and not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your kindness 
and understanding.  As I was saying, this is not the first time a 
budget contains figures that are cautious and fail to reflect the 
reality of changes in public finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barely a few months ago, I was in Vancouver with the Minister 
of Finance, who was giving us information on the economy and the 
financial situation.  It was then he announced the good news that 
the 1996-97 deficit for fiscal year ending March 31, 1997 would be 
somewhere around $8.9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six months earlier, we were telling him in this House that the 
deficit would be below $10 billion.  He said the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois, the opposition, was bandying figures about.  Six 
months later, he said the forecast was out by 63%. 
If he were working for a firm of economic consultants, he would be 
out on the street now for having made an error of 63% in six 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was rather disappointed to see the Minister of Finance 
hiding things.  Over the next three years, he says, the budget 
surplus will be zero, zero, zero.  Do you know what the real 
figures are?  I will give them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have become forecasting specialists.  We decided that, if, 
in the past four years, the Minister of Finance has been incapable 
of putting the right figures in the budget, we would tell him the 
right ones.  He says there will be no surplus in 1998-99 and marked 
a zero on page 12 of his budget plan.  The real surplus amounts to 
at least $7 billion and starts this budget year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 1999-2000 the figure given is 0.0.  That is tantamount to 
laughing in people's faces.  It is an affront to the public, which 
expects the right information from their elected representatives. 
A surplus of $14 billion is what we expect, and he writes zero in 
the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went further, up to 2000-01.  I say there will be a surplus 
of at least $19 billion.  He does not want to go that far in his 
forecasts.  I can understand that.  If I were out by 63% over six 
months, I would not even make a two week prediction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the millennium fund, I said earlier that, in his budget 
plan of 1995, the Minister of Finance was sly, rather sneaky. 
Sometimes that can be a good thing, but as far as I am concerned, 
it can also be a fault.  In this case, it is a major failing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, he said there would be a plan for budget cuts in 
order to fund social assistance given out by the provinces to the 
most disadvantaged, university education—under provincial 
jurisdiction—and health.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said “I am going to cut and cut, until 2003, in order to 
attain my objective of a balanced budget” and so on.  Cut so much 
that, if all of the cuts until 2003 are added together, the 
Minister of Finance will have cut $42 billion, a good part of that 
$42 billion in university education.  Another $30 billion is to be 
cut before 2003, and the minister announced nothing about this 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oh, he did announce one thing: the cuts initially forecast at 
$48 billion will be reduced to $42 billion, and he would have to 
be applauded for continuing to cut at the $30 billion level until 
2003.  Now he is telling us “I have put our fiscal house in 
order”, and he gloats over it. He toots his own horn. We will be 
coming back to that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He toots his own horn, and then he says “Now that I have this 
surplus, I am announcing that I am going to put $2.5 billion into 
education”. He cuts education, health and social assistance to the 
tune of $42 billion and now he is telling us: “We are going to put 
$2.5 billion into education.  Look, we have some extraordinary 
initiatives in the area of education”.  The provinces meanwhile 
continue to cut.  But it is he who is cutting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public must know this.  And as for getting into an area of 
jurisdiction as exclusive as education, so what if this has been a 
prerogative jealously guarded for the past 50 years by any and all 
Quebec premiers, whether federalist or sovereignist.  Quebec will 
never accept the federal government's encroachment on this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said: “We are not getting into education, 
we are simply helping students with debts”. First of all, it is 
they who caused those debts by making savage cuts in recent years 
and, second, the Minister of Finance pronounced the word 
“education” in connection with the millennium fund no less than 12 
times during his budget speech. That is a rather serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, they claim that they have an interest in 
student debt loads. 
Give me a break.  What the government is really interested in is 
its visibility.  In the scrum yesterday, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development made no bones about it.  He said in 
English—he did not dare repeat it in French, because I think he 
realized he had made a blunder—that this was the best way of 
increasing the federal government's visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for the federal government's wonderful philosophy of 
student assistance:  relieve them of their money by annually 
reducing the amounts available for university education, a job 
foisted off on the provincial governments, and then turn up to put 
a partial band-aid on the wound they themselves inflicted by 
interfering in an area reserved for the provinces.  This move may 
well provoke an unprecedented confrontation between the federal 
government and the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, through its finance minister, also 
kept us from seeing the real extent of its leeway.  Why?  Because, 
in his wisdom, in his concern for his image, in his desire to make 
a dramatic gesture as well and to break records never before broken 
in the history of Canadian taxation, the Minister of Finance 
decided that what he valued most was not a balanced budget, not 
visionary policies, not improved conditions for the most 
disadvantaged in society, not the elimination of child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in this regard, the forecast increases in the 
child tax benefit have been put off for two years.  That is the 
priority they give to the fight against poverty.  That is not what 
motivates this government.  That is not what motivates the Minister 
of Finance.  Nor is he motivated by the fate of the unemployed. 
Once again, by not using the government's overall gains to create 
an independent EI fund, he has just given us the message that, in 
the years ahead, all surpluses from employers' and employees' 
premiums will go into his pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So he is not interested in helping unemployed workers either. 
Since January 1997, the benefits available for those unfortunate 
enough to lose their jobs have steadily decreased.  They now 
receive almost half of their most recent wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are thus denied EI by restrictive measures.  The 
unemployed and what becomes of them are not what motivates the 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this was the unanimous view of analysts, people 
from the private sector, and representatives of the business 
community.  Yesterday, I listened to the executive director of the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business, who had this to say: 
“This budget did not contain any significant measure and no 
strategic plan for creating employment in any consistent and 
lasting way”.  That was what Mr. Cléroux had to say outside the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, jobs and unemployment are not what concern the Minister of 
Finance.  What concerns him is going down in history as the one who 
not only put the country's fiscal house in order but who broke the 
record for surpluses.  His concern is making it into the Guinness 
Book of Records. 
That is what is on his mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof lies in the fact that he is not letting us in on the 
real surpluses.  The proof is that, if the present trend continues, 
if the federal government continues with its initiatives and 
continues to aim at very conservative economic growth—we have done 
the math—the surplus will perhaps top $30 billion by 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a sign of good public management.  It is a sign 
that somewhere people are paying too much in taxes and the Minister 
of Finance could care less.  People are paying too much in taxes, 
while the Minister of Finance is breaking surplus records and 
calling himself a good manager.  He calls himself a great manager. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surpluses that go up year after year—the Minister of Finance 
is so ashamed that he does not even give the figures in his budget; 
he puts zeros everywhere—point to bad management. 
This is someone who is more interested in popularity, because of 
some agenda, perhaps that of becoming the next prime minister, you 
never know, but it is not necessarily someone interested in 
efficiency and the general well-being of the public.  If he were, 
he would have tried to achieve a balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A reserve of $2 to $3 billion is fine, but we would not 
accumulate large surpluses, which are a sign that the tax burden of 
average taxpayers, which is not significantly reduced in this 
budget, is too high, that people are paying too much in taxes, and 
that other people are also contributing too much as well.  I am 
thinking of the unemployed, those on welfare, the ill, and 
students, who are still suffering from the cuts in the 1995 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I found yesterday in the budget is that the Minister of 
Finance was in far less of a hurry to remedy misery and to lighten 
the burden of taxpayers who have been crushed by $30 billion in 
additional taxes of all kinds he himself has imposed over the past 
four years, and also by the non-indexation of tax tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was in far less of a hurry to help the sick, to help 
students, except with one program aimed solely at raising the 
federal profile, at getting that maple leaf out in a prominent 
place.  The Minister of Finance was much more interested in 
drafting custom-made bills serving the interests of his foreign 
shipping holdings than in looking after the general well-being of 
the people of Quebec and Canada and in being a good manager. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People will understand that, while this Minister of Finance 
has not made significant reductions in their tax burden, he is 
continuing to take money from the most disadvantaged and to make it 
more difficult for the provinces, particularly Quebec, to balance 
their budgets.  The people sitting down to do their federal tax 
returns are well aware that while the minister is taking money from 
their pockets, he is also getting bills passed that are tailor-made 
to save him tax money in the coming years.  They know he is in 
apparent conflict of interest, that this government is refusing to 
cast any light on that apparent conflict of interest, and that the 
integrity of the Minister of Finance is open to question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is hard to take.  We have sounded people out.  All of my 
Bloc Quebecois colleagues have asked the people in their ridings 
what they think of this budget, and of this nebulous business.

accounting because they see that the Minister of Finance is not 
only unconcerned about their welfare, but appears concerned only 
about his own and that of his buddies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to table an amendment to the amendment to the 
budget proposed by the Reform Party.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK161">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be amended by striking 
all words following the words “Minister of Finance” and 
replacing them with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“because he has, by creating the Canada Millennium 
Scholarship Foundation, broken his promise to respect 
provincial jurisdiction over education, he has provided 
nothing to stimulate job creation, he has not provided for 
adequate income-tax reductions for middle-class families, he 
has continued to appropriate the huge employment insurance 
fund surplus, he has obstinately refused to table 
anti-deficit legislation and he has not returned to the 
provinces the money he cut from their transfer payments, 
while pursuing his planned cuts up to the year 2003.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I table this subamendment in this House and thank you for your 
attention in the hope that taxpayers will now know they have to 
keep an eye on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> For the time being we will 
take the text submitted by the hon. member under advisement.  We 
will get back to you in a few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for Calgary Southeast, 
Taxation; the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, 
Banking; the hon. member for Lévis, Spirit of Columbus Platform; 
and the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington, Construction 
Industry. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I want to start by saying how disappointed and upset I am at the 
comments made by the hon. member who just spoke in his reference 
to an hon. colleague, the finance minister, using this 
opportunity for his own personal image, to try to gain a spot in 
the history books and to increase his own popularity.  He is not 
working for the welfare of Canadians.  He is in a conflict of 
interest and his integrity is in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became a member of Parliament comments like this used to 
bother me.  Some would say they were politically motivated. 
However, having been here before and seen this member and the way 
sometimes things play in this House, I believe those statements 
tell me more about this hon. member than they do about the 
finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment and ask a question of this member with 
regard to the elements of his speech.  He indicated that he was 
not interested whatsoever in the fishiness and fuzziness of 
numbers.  However, there is no question that in 1993 when this 
government took office there was a deficit of some $42 billion. 
That deficit is now gone as a result of another balanced budget 
with a balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may be right that the government has broken some 
promises, but the promises we have broken are things like the 
promise we made to balance the budget in five years and it has 
now been balanced in four.  We promised to reduce the deficit to 
3% of GDP and it is now down to zero. That is a broken promise. 
The member does not give credit where credit is due in terms of 
setting the priorities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member somehow thinks this is the only budget that will be 
brought down in this mandate.  The undertaking of the government 
was to balance the budget, and the finance minister has 
delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member did not want to talk about the tax break for low 
income Canadians.  He did not want to talk about the surtax cut 
for middle income Canadians.  He did not want to talk about the 
child tax benefit increase for families or the child care expense 
deduction or the other tax measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member did not give credit for those but rather decided to 
launch a personal attack against the Prime Minister.  I think at 
this point I would pose a question to the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I ask him to rise in his place and apologize to 
the House and to the finance minister for his personal attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with regard to the upcoming fiscal period, with regard 
to the numbers presented, exactly which numbers, which he 
generally referred to as fishy, is he saying he does not 
understand so that we can explain it to him in plain English? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I was beginning to despair at the length of the question, its 
preamble in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never apologize, because what I said was the truth, 
accurate and verifiable.  Over the past four years, the Minister of 
Finance has cut everywhere except there.  Fifty-two per cent of the 
cuts he imposed have been made by the provinces in such areas as 
social assistance, post-secondary education, and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is capable of doing the math—and I have my doubts—let 
him look at the budgets since 1995 and he will realize these are 
the right figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other source for getting public finances back onto an even 
keel: tax increases, and the employment insurance surplus made up 
of employer and employee contributions, 37% of the sacrifices and 
efforts to get our fiscal house in order.  Now we are up to nearly 
90%; 90% of the recovery has been from the most disadvantaged 
provinces, the poorest provinces, the average taxpayer.  The 
percentage that is really connected to the Minister of Finance's 
cleaning up his own act is 10%.  Ten per cent! And I should 
apologize for saying that he is not the one responsible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point: I will never apologize to the Minister of 
Finance, because I am not the one who introduced Bill C-28. 
He is the one who did.  Out of 464 pages, two paragraphs dealt 
with, deal with, a change to the Income Tax Act affecting 
international shipping companies and international shipping holding 
companies, like his.  I should apologize? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should apologize for having discovered that loophole in Bill 
C-28, an omnibus bill?  Two paragraphs out of 464 pages, and I 
should apologize for the fact that the Prime Minister and the 
Deputy Prime Minister have been rising in this House for the past 
month to tell us that there is perhaps a doubt, an apparent 
conflict of interest.  Mr. Wilson, the ethics counsellor, has said 
so.  But there will be no light cast on this matter.  They will 
even refuse requests from the four opposition parties calling for 
a special subcommittee of the Finance Committee to get to the 
bottom of this.  And I should apologize for the lack of 
transparency?  No way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the backbench Liberals who wish to 
applaud this northern Ontario style budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned there is something fishy about this budget. 
We have a major crisis in this country on all three coasts, the 
west, the north and the east coasts.  There was not one single 
word, not even one attention for the people who are facing a 
major crisis in their lives.  We are talking about hundreds of 
thousands of people in hundreds of communities on all coasts in 
the fisheries.  There was not one single word in there about the 
crisis in the fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the government of the day is why was that 
omitted from this budget.

colleague's comments correctly, he was talking to the Liberal 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> He will never get an answer from the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> No, he will not, but I would love to give 
him my own answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that many people have been overlooked in this 
budget.  Particularly overlooked were those whose sacrifices were 
responsible for this result, which is a good result, but this was 
not the way to go about it.  What I really cannot sit still for is 
the Minister of Finance parading around telling anyone who will 
listen that it was his doing. 
And none of my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois will sit still for 
it either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He overlooked the most disadvantaged members of society, who 
are already affected by the scourge of poverty and unemployment. 
These are the people whose doing it was. There are the provinces 
too.  They have also been overlooked.  There was unanimity on that 
yesterday.  All Canadian provinces, particularly the finance 
minister, and Mr. Galganov— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Mr. Romanow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Romanow, not Galganov.  Let us forget 
him; he is history.  Nobody mentions him any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Romanow, who even claimed to be speaking for the premiers 
of all Canadian provinces, said they felt they had been taken for 
a ride, because they were the ones who did the work, who made the 
cuts, by order of the federal finance minister, and who are seeing 
the finance minister pocket the dividends rather than distribute 
them to the provinces.  It is hard to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone asks others to do his dirty work, when manages to 
make a profit somewhere and the dividends do not even show up in 
the budget out of a concern for non-transparency, when there are 
the surpluses, and not a moment's thought is even given to 
redistributing them to those who actually made them possible, that 
is hard to take, even for one's friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty to inform 
the House that the amendment to the amendment moved by the member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is in order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise 
on behalf of many disappointed Canadians across this country to 
register disbelief in the priorities of this government as 
reflected in its budget and the priorities in particular of the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In yesterday's budget the Minister of Finance talked about 
building a Canada for the 21st century.  That is what he chose to 
title his budget.  But he shows no sign of recognizing that 
cutting and slashing over the past four years in health, in 
education, in vital social services, in environmental protections 
have weakened Canada's foundation and the very fabric of the 
nation. The finance minister may make a great interior decorator 
but Canada needs a first rate general contractor.  We need 
someone who knows the difference between rebuilding and 
redecorating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable that this budget is silent on jobs.  This 
budget is silent on health care transfers and it barely mumbles 
about poverty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government thinks that a scrap of wallpaper here and a 
splash of paint there will be sufficient to disguise the truth 
that Canada's foundation is not as solid as it needs to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians balanced the budget through health care cuts, 
through increased poverty and through lower incomes the finance 
minister and the Liberal government lost their last excuse to 
ignore the pressing needs of Canadians, the excuse of the 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the week we were heartened, we were actually 
encouraged, when the finance minister emerged from the G-7 
meetings and proclaimed that this budget would address growing 
inequality in this country and that it would address 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we get in this budget?  No targets for reducing 
unemployment; not for reducing unemployment by 1% a year or by 
any other target.  There is no target for reducing poverty; not 
by one half, not by one third and not by any other target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What targets do we have in the budget?  We have the target to 
keep inflation in the same 1% to 3% band where it has been since 
1991. The last time I checked inflation it was below 1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the level of employment?  It is still hovering around 
9%. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about our children?  In this great country with its 
wealth of natural resources that claims to be progressive, 21% of 
our children live in poverty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give the Minister of Finance credit on one count and 
that is for targeting tax breaks to low and middle income 
Canadians.  But he could have made better choices.  He could have 
made more cost effective choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across this country the GST is a burden on every single 
Canadian.  The Minister of Finance could have introduced 
increases in the GST tax credit to provide some important and 
immediate relief.  He could have exempted some basic necessities 
like home heating oil, children's clothing and school supplies. 
Not only would that have provided important tax relief, but 
accepted economic analyses make it clear that GST cuts would 
create more jobs than any other form of tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely unbelievable, and I believe to the vast 
majority of Canadians unacceptable, that there is not one single 
new dollar in this budget for health care transfers.  Let me say 
to colleagues opposite, no matter what this government may try to 
tell them, cancelling a cut in spending is not a spending 
increase. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have said on many occasions that the greatest 
priorities for allocating the budget surplus were health care, 
education and jobs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind this government of its own solemn red book 
promise that 50% of any budget surplus would be spent on vital 
programs and services and the other 50% would be spent on debt 
reduction and tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fiscal dividend in this budget is $6.5 billion, and 70% of 
that amount has gone to debt reduction and tax reduction.  If 
this government had simply kept its promise, if this government 
had simply done what the Prime Minister said during the election 
campaign it would do and what the finance minister said again and 
again the government would do, then it would have invested 
another $1.5 billion in health and other social transfers. 
That is the real priority for Canadians.

this government had kept its commitment to allocate 50% of the 
surplus for health and social spending, in the process it would 
have generated a great many jobs.  We know how many jobs have 
been wiped out in this country over the last three years by the 
excessive slashing and cutting in health, education and other 
vital public programs. The government did not choose to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Tories and the Reformers are rejoicing at the Liberal 
acceptance of their priorities.  But there are a great many 
Canadians who feel very badly betrayed by the decision of this 
government not to reinvest 50% of the surplus in health care and 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell members of the House briefly about a letter I 
received recently from a young woman in New Brunswick.  It is a 
woman I do not know.  It is a woman with whom I spoke on the 
phone the evening before the budget.  I wanted to call and talk 
with her about what would be in that budget, if it was to provide 
some kind of relief to her circumstances, to the situation in 
which she finds herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a woman with six years of university education. This is 
a woman with two post-secondary degrees.  Like a lot of students, 
she has $40,000 in student debt.  In fact, like 600,000 young 
people under the age of 30 in this country today, she still does 
not have a job despite how hard she has worked, despite how much 
she has sacrificed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this woman reminded me in her letter, she did exactly what 
she was encouraged to do which was to work hard, to go into debt 
and then she would be sure to get a good job.  Today that young 
woman is living with her parents, like a lot of others in her age 
category. Because she is living with her parents she is not 
eligible for social assistance.  She is not eligible either for 
employment insurance.  She is in default on her student loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote directly from that woman's letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent my life much like most people, searching for 
happiness.  How is it possible if I cannot be proud?  How is it 
possible if I cry myself to sleep every night and through most 
days?  I am ashamed.  I cry tears of shame.  All I want is to be 
a person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what direction I look in, I do not see a light.  I am 
no longer in the tunnel, I am at the bottom of a pit and there is 
someone piling on the dirt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know, if I was given that Senator's job—the one who never 
shows up for work—if I had his job, I would show up every day. 
I know what it is like to need work.  I know how important a job 
can be in the role of feeding one's soul. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget ignores this young woman and this budget ignores a 
great many other young men and young women like her.  Is there a 
job for these young people?  Is there any commitment to relieve 
the poverty she is experiencing?  Because she is earning no money 
none of the tax benefits introduced in this budget is of any 
benefit to her whatsoever.  No millennium fund will help her in 
her current situation.  The premium reduction for employees will 
not help her either because she is over 25 years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government refused to set any targets and timetables to 
help ensure that people like her would get back to work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Disgracefully, the only real job initiative, the reduction of 
the employer EI premium on young people hired over the next two 
years, will only help to employ one half of one per cent of the 
400,000 young people unemployed in this country today. The 
government's commitment to youth employment is window dressing at 
best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week this government announced no new money for summer 
youth employment programs.  There are 48,000 fewer young people 
working today than there were two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To recap, what do we have in this budget?  No meaningful job 
creation; nothing new for children living in poverty; a 
millennium fund that will not start for two years and at its best 
will help only 7% of Canadian students, leaving 93% of those 
students without any help from that millennium fund; not a single 
new dollar for our health care system or for our education 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget sets out the battle lines for the fight for a better 
world.  Unlike this government, the Reformers and the Tories, our 
party believes that better world begins by investing in the 
institutions that give us a civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This finance minister had the chance to make investments to 
fight social inequality and promote job creation as he promised. 
This government chose another way.  It chose not to offer hope 
but to dash expectations.  It chose to ignore the crisis of 
poverty and the growing gap between the super rich and everyone 
else in this country.  It chose to paper over the problems in our 
society, the cracks in the very foundation of our nation.  It 
made a mistake for which Canadians like my young friend in New 
Brunswick will pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on this government.  Shame on a government that can 
gleefully pat itself on the back for ignoring the problems at the 
very foundation of our civil society.

you had not recognized me, but I am glad you did.  Better late than 
never, as they say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very moved by the words of the hon. leader of the NDP, 
especially when mentioned the young woman in New Brunswick.  What 
her story tells us is that hope has to take root somewhere.  People 
must be given hope that jobs will be created and poverty will be 
fought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the NDP on its decades old tradition of 
fighting for social justice, as was mentioned by my colleague from 
Kamloops regarding David Lewis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to elaborate on two of the 
interesting ideas she put forward, although there were many.  She 
mentioned targets and setting targets in the fight against poverty 
and unemployment. I wonder if she would expand a bit on these 
ideas, which are extremely valuable in my opinion, and could become 
a real policy on job creation and the fight against poverty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, nobody kids 
themselves into thinking that by just setting targets and 
timetables for unemployment the problem is solved, that the work 
is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely this is a government that understands the concept of 
targets and timetables.  The very manner in which this government 
went about tackling the problem of the deficit was to set clear 
targets, to set timetables, then develop a plan on how it would 
reduce the deficit and then measure progress toward those targets 
and timetables. 
Heaven knows we heard lots of self-congratulation when the 
finance minister was able to stand yesterday and announce that 
this year they were bringing in a balanced budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we asked was that the government approach the problem of 
joblessness, the continuing problem of chronically high 
unemployment, with the same kind of determination that it has 
tackled the problem of the deficit.  That requires that it set 
realistic targets, that it set a realistic timetable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not trying to suggest that we have the formula that is 
guaranteed to succeed.  What would be wrong with the government 
saying that it commits every bit of its might and muscle, all the 
resources at its disposal, to bringing down unemployment by 1% a 
year over the duration of its mandate?  In other words it would 
commit to reducing unemployment to 5% by the end of its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some who will say that is overly ambitious.  Do we 
have any way to achieve that?  If we look south of the border 
unemployment in the United States is below 5%.  If we look across 
the ocean at the U.K. it has an unemployment rate below 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly will not see progress in reducing unemployment if 
the government persists in bringing in budgets without any 
acknowledgement of the severity and the magnitude of the problem 
of unemployment and without setting any targets whatsoever for 
reduction of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians will be shocked when they learn, as they will, 
that the government is quite content with the projections for 
unemployment to remain above 8% until the new millennium.  That 
is not what Canadians have in mind when they want a government 
that will participate in the rebuilding of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member's criticism 
of the government's budget.  She criticized us for not spending 
money here, there and everywhere.  However she must admit that 
even Tommy Douglas and Bob Rae understood that in order to get 
the bankers off our back we needed to deal dramatically with the 
deficit and the debt, as has been pointed out in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also must admit that through the last couple of 
budgets the government specifically centred money and tax breaks 
on families and students wanting to get an education.  It is 
recognized that those who have post-secondary education have a 
better chance of getting a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government simply cannot throw money out there and hope that 
it will create jobs.  It just does not work that way.  We need 
Canadians with an education in jobs in the high tech area.  The 
best way for us to help with this terrible situation is to help 
families and to help students get an education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member aware of that?  What is her answer to getting 
rid of the close to $600 billion debt we now have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, one of the 
frustrations about the procedures of this assembly is that we do 
not get to ask questions back.  One thing I would love to be able 
to ask this hon. member is what happened between June 2, the day 
of the federal election, and the introduction of yesterday's 
budget that totally changed the commitment his government made to 
the people of Canada during the election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is so irresponsible for me as leader of the New Democratic 
Party to stand in my place and say that 50% of the budget surplus 
should have been reinvested in health, education and other vital 
services, why is it not irresponsible for the Minister of Finance 
and the Prime Minister and every Liberal member to prance around 
the country during the recent federal election campaign making 
exactly the same promise? 
They cannot have it both ways.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Certainly the hon. member knows that when that commitment 
was made it said over the course of a mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  That just reflects how little he, 
his colleagues, the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister 
understand the real priority and pressing needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one heck of a lot of people who want to understand how 
the government could have turned its back on this commitment in 
this year when we have people lined up and trying to get into 
surgery when they need it.  We have people on stretchers in 
hospital corridors.  We have people who desperately need home 
care and cannot get it.  We have people who desperately need 
prescription drugs and cannot get them.  Why?  Because the 
government rips away $7 billion every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When some people hear those figures they think that $7 billion 
is a lot of money but they guess the government had to do it. 
This is a government that is doing it year after year after year. 
It is literally killing people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the government say it will do that later, that later 
it will reinvest some of the surplus dollars, but in the meantime 
decide to take up the cause of the Reform Party that says we 
should not worry if we end up with a deteriorating health care 
system and in fact we should not worry if we have to introduce a 
two tier health care system because somehow or other people will 
just get by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that has a lot to answer for.  One of the 
questions that it has to be prepared to answer is why it is 
prepared to turn its back on the priorities of Canadians.  Why is 
it prepared to betray a promise it made during the campaign that 
50% of the budget surplus would go to health care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
join in the debate knowing that we are marking a very important 
moment financially for the country and for the economy.  I want 
to speak to that right off the bat.  I want to speak to the 
balanced budget and what it means.  I want to use the opportunity 
to speak very clearly on what it is exactly that we are dealing 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with all of those who look at the balanced budget and say 
bravo.  Bravo, it is a good thing for the country to have a 
balanced budget.  There is not a member in the House who would 
not agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I also want to make very clear why we have a balanced 
budget and recognize the soldiers on the front lines, Canadian 
citizens:  low income citizens, those on a fixed incomes who have 
no choice but to pay heavily in income taxes.  I also recognize 
the contribution of other levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal Minister of Finance was in a room with the 
ministers of finance from the provincial governments, I doubt he 
would be patting himself on the back in the same way without 
having a very red face when saying to the provincial ministers of 
finance “I have balanced the budget”.  I think the answer that 
would come across the table would be “You what?  No, no, no.  I 
do not think you balanced the budget.  Canadians did but you did 
it on our backs by cutting in health care and education”.  That 
is what happened here.  As they do that they would also recognize 
that we have done our share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been an almost 15 year effort.  The government I was 
part of started that effort. 
This government has benefited a great deal from a lot of these 
policies.  History may record that the current Prime Minister 
leads the Liberal Party of Canada, but he certainly embraced the 
policies of the Progressive Conservative Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at this result and say bravo.  How we got there is 
another issue, and I want to talk about that.  I also want to say 
that there is some disappointment.  One thing the Minister of 
Finance could have done yesterday is send a message of growth for 
the economy and hope for Canadians.  I thought he would have done 
that by delivering broad based tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the answer.  The path is set.  Broad based tax 
relief is off the table and spending is back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a budget of death bed repentances.  Government members 
were forced to reverse a number of its key policy initiatives of 
the first mandate.  This is a budget with no economic plan. There 
is no plan for growth, no targets for employment, no targets for 
job creation, no targets for tax reduction, no targets for debt 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a target, though.  I thought it was actually an ironic 
target.  The only one they put out was a news release for the 
Bank of Canada yesterday.  Guess what target they were able to 
agree on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it one of their targets?  No.  I will read the press 
release.  The second paragraph says that targets for reducing 
inflation were adopted in February 1991 by the previous 
government and in December 1993 the government and the Bank of 
Canada agreed to extend the targets.  Of course history will 
record that the Liberal Party of the day criticized loudly the 
government of the day for having set that target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they go on to say how low inflation is such a great thing. 
What else is new? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That target has been set, but there is no target in terms of 
debt.  There are no targets in terms of employment.  In fact, the 
government abandoned the practice of actually projecting what 
unemployment rates would be.  I do not think it has the courage 
to tell the truth and to live up to that test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to be the first government on record, by the way, 
record that I know of that is in a mad rush in the first year of 
its mandate to spend money.  Most governments in the first year 
make the tough decisions on reducing spending and then try to 
ease them toward an election campaign with a little less pressure 
on the purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that caucus, to give an indication of the mindset, they are 
in a mad rush to spend money right away.  Quite appropriately 
today is Ash Wednesday and yesterday we were treated to a Mardi 
Gras of spending in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget has lost sight of a number of the fundamental needs 
of Canadians.  The government likes to talk about the 
fundamentals in the economy and to say that the fundamentals are 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share some of the fundamentals on Main Street Canada; 
some of the fundamentals of Amherst, Nova Scotia; some of the 
fundamentals that my colleague from St. John's hears about in 
Saint John, New Brunswick, or in Brandon, Manitoba; and some of 
the fundamentals in Markham, Ontario, or in Granby, Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the fundamentals that we hear about.  Canada 
has the highest personal income taxes among the G-7 nations. The 
disposable income of Canadians has dropped 1.3% since 1993 but 
the federal government's revenues for personal income taxes have 
increased 23% in the same period. The real personal per capita 
income is more than $4,400 higher in the United States than in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hesitate to say that in the presence of the young page who is 
here.  He is probably planning to move to the United States as he 
hears that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal and business bankruptcies have reached record levels 
under the Liberals.  Unemployment in Canada is double that of the 
United States.  That is one of the fundamentals of the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the continuing tragedy of high unemployment for young 
Canadians with 400,000 young Canadians out of work.  These are 
the fundamentals that we do not hear about, not in this place, 
not by this government.  We only hear about them every day in 
Asbestos, Quebec.  We hear about them in Pictou County but we do 
not hear about them here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a government that also continued to waste a billion 
dollars to buy out a GST deal with Liberal governments in 
Atlantic Canada, a billion dollars to save face.  It spent almost 
a billion dollars on Pearson airport, and $500 million on a 
helicopter deal was wasted, down the drain.  All this was to save 
face politically. 
It is a government of deathbed repentances that is now trying to 
fill in the holes it has dug for itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last Parliament it cut transfers to the provinces by 40%. 
Colleagues from the other parties will remember that as the 
Prime Minister looked the electorate in the whites of their eyes, 
his government suddenly discovered that it should back up a bit 
and cut the transfers to 35% instead.  The cost of that was 
dramatic.  By the way did it cut Ottawa? No.  Spending in Ottawa 
has been cut by less than 2%. As the government reacquainted 
itself with the electorate, the cuts nonetheless go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House of Commons we talked about health care.  The 
bottom line and the truth about health care are reflected in the 
numbers from the Department of Finance on cash transfers for 
health, education and social assistance.  Let me quote the 
numbers from the Department of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this budget mean for the province of Nova Scotia in 
particular?  In fiscal year 1997-98 Nova Scotia will receive $427 
million in cash transfers; the next year in 1998-99, $425 
million; in 1999-2000, $422 million; in 2000-01, $418 million, in 
2001-02, $415 million; 2002-03, $411 million in cash transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only imagine that people in Nova Scotia must have been 
bewildered yesterday when they heard the Liberal premier, Russell 
MacLellan say that this was the best budget in 20 years. Surely 
he must have sounded a little funny because the Liberal minister 
of finance in New Brunswick actually denounced the budget.  The 
Liberal minister of finance in Newfoundland and Labrador 
denounced the budget.  The minister of finance in P.E.I. 
denounced the budget.  The minister of finance in Ontario did the 
same, as did the minister of finance in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does Russell MacLellan who is running in an election 
campaign as the Liberal candidate, the ambassador of the Liberal 
government in Nova Scotia, say that it is the best budget in 20 
years?  I say to Mr. MacLellan, please get off your knees.  Start 
representing and defending the interests of the people of Nova 
Scotia.  Since he cannot do that, John Hamm will do it instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of the Liberal cynicism of this budget. 
Page 13 states:  “Today we are announcing the largest single 
investment ever made by the federal government to support access 
to post-secondary education for all Canadians”.  The Liberals 
forgot to say that this was preceded by the biggest ever cut in 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what is the consequence? Do not believe me.  I will quote 
from a well-known document by this government:  “In 1990, only 
eight years ago, the average debt load after a four year program 
was $13,000.  By next year it will have almost doubled to 
$25,000.  At the beginning of this decade, fewer than 8% of 
borrowers had debts larger than $15,000”—and if I remember 
correctly, at the beginning of the decade a Progressive 
Conservative government was in power—“now almost 40% do”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who said that? The Minister of Finance said that. There it is, 
the Liberal record.  Even the Liberals cannot hide from the 
facts.  This is the sad record of a government that has lost 
sight of priorities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how we got there.  The government is also 
announcing a millennium scholarship program that will not be 
implemented until the new millennium—in two years' time—while 
students are facing an unprecedented debt load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, as the Prime Minister acknowledged in the House 
today, main purpose of this program is not to help students but to 
increase government visibility.  To be quite honest, I have nothing 
against the federal government's visibility.   I am a federalist. 
I am proud to be a federalist.  I am a Quebecker and proud to be 
one. 
That does not bother me, I am happy the federal government gets the 
credit it deserves when it makes its contribution, on behalf of 
taxpayers, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when visibility becomes the prime objective, we have 
to say that they are turning an issue all too important to our 
society into a political football.  I find that a disappointment. 
I would really like to know where the Minister of Finance was when 
he made these cuts to education and health care.  Suddenly he wakes 
up, and the issue becomes important.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The best consequence, the most important one was noted by a 
woman named Sherry Cooper from the investment firm Nesbitt Burns. 
She made a very common sense remark, which will surprise you with 
its simplicity and truth.  She said “What is the point of investing 
all that money in education and information if students earning 
their diploma head off to the United States to work because of high 
taxes here”? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point?  We have to ask that hard question.  What is 
the point of investing in education and training if the students 
who graduate, because of high taxes and because of lower pay, 
leave Canada to work in the United States? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently the Prime Minister will be in New York next week, 
hosted by a prestigious New York club.  I can only assume it is 
to thank him.  I can see it now.  They will say “Thank you very 
much, Prime Minister, for everything you are doing for the United 
States.  We cannot tell you how much we appreciate your paying 
for the education of these young people and keeping your taxes 
high and your productivity low so that these young people will 
come to the United States to work for us.  We think it is the 
best thing you could have done for us.  Thank you very much”. 
That will be the message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That tells us what is wrong with the government.  I do not think 
its members realize the consequences which their lack of 
understanding has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also been cynical in the way it has turned 
the budget into a game. Now we are in the game of underestimating 
the revenues and overestimating expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is digging its hands deeper into the pockets of 
Canadians.  How is it doing that?  By deindexing the tax rolls it 
is able to get billions more in revenue from Canadians. The 
government does it insidiously.  It says “We do not increase 
taxes, we just take more money from you”.  It is all a 
technicality.  It is called bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden we are supposed to have a surplus, but it is 
well hidden.  The government even in the millennium fund cannot 
come clean.  It has booked the money this year.  In other words, 
it says to the indebted students “Pay this year.  You will not 
benefit from it, but in two years from now the fund will kick 
in”.  That is something the government did with the innovation 
fund, which has been largely denounced by the auditor general. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government lacks transparency in the area of employment 
insurance.  The auditor general criticized them for using 
employment insurance to reduce the deficit, when the system was not 
set up for this purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that in the budget the government boasts of 
reducing all taxes by $7 billion over three years.  Yet this same 
government is taking $6 billion annually out of taxpayers' pockets. 
To my knowledge, this is the only government to establish an 
unemployment plan for Canadians.  They create more unemployment, 
raise taxes, tax employment insurance and create unemployment. 
That is what their policies do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they are asked to reduce contributions, they say “No, 
that does not work.  It will not create real employment”.  And yet, 
in the budget, they are doing just that for people between the ages 
of 18 and 24, for two years only.  When they are asked why, it is 
“to create employment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it works for young people aged 18 to 24, would it not work 
for people aged 45 or 55?  Why not do it for everyone who wants a 
job, since unemployment is too high in Canada?  No.  They believe 
only in minor measures, always in order to save face. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party believes that it is time for Canada to get a strong 
plan for growth in our economy. We need to get our foot off the 
brake.  What this means for us is lowering taxes.  Lowering taxes 
by reducing EI premiums by about a third so we can create more 
jobs.  Lowering taxes by increasing the basic exemption for 
Canadians to $10,000 so we can allow lower income Canadians to 
earn more and buy more of the essential goods they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 3% surtax should be eliminated completely. The government 
said “We have taken it off for the poor”, but the middle class 
is still being hit. If there is one victim of this government and 
this budget it is Canada's middle class.  They are getting 
whacked to the tune of billions of dollars.  They are not going 
to get a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government which had a great opportunity to launch us 
onto a new path, to close the chapter on deficits, but also to 
start us on a new path. 
It should have set a target for debt reduction so that we are 
able to measure our performance, so that we are able to live in a 
political environment where we can go to our neighbours and say 
“Together we need to limit spending, to keep it under control. 
If we do we will meet a specific target.  When we get there we 
will be able to reduce taxes further”.  If we create that kind 
of a political environment we will all increase our chances of 
succeeding.  Those should have been hard lessons learned in this 
budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party firmly believes that we need this plan for economic 
growth and that this budget is more than just about numbers.  It 
is about values, it is about the choices we make.  It is not good 
enough to shift the numbers around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some parties would say they would put more money into education, 
but then they would cut equalization.  The position we have taken 
is that there should be more money put into education by building 
a new deal with provincial governments so that there is a health 
care guarantee for all Canadians, so that we can leave provincial 
governments alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel for the people of Nova Scotia today.  I feel for the 
people of New Brunswick.  I feel for the people in Yarmouth. I 
was with my colleague from Kings—Hants during the election 
campaign.  Together we visited a hospital wing that was 
completely closed.  Now the government is saying to the people in 
Nova Scotia there will be more cuts in the next few years.  This 
is wrong.  We need to change our priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in a plan for strong economic growth in this country. 
As we do that we can reallocate priorities.  We can put the 
emphasis on education, health and guaranteed services to 
Canadians.  It requires the political will, the vision and the 
foresight to make it happen, something that was not part of this 
budget, I am sorry to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close by putting to the House, through unanimous 
consent, a subamendment to the amendment proposed by our Reform 
colleagues.  This was put to our colleagues before.  I hope today 
that they will see clear to offer some consent to a very useful 
amendment that would allow all members of this House to rise and 
vote democratically and take a position on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subamendment we would put to the House for a vote, which we 
hope all parties would agree with and would give consent to would 
be: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be modified by deleting the word “and” 
after the words “tax hikes” and adding after the words “tax 
relief” the following words “it continues to tax low income 
Canadians earning less then $10,000, it does not set specific 
targets for reducing the national debt, and it continues to tax 
Canadians by stealth, by refusing to index income tax brackets”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you have heard the amendment to the motion.  We 
feel that all members in this House would probably be glad to 
have an opportunity to rise in their place and speak on this and 
to vote on it.  We actually anticipate enthusiastic consent so 
that we can all speak on this.

rise on a point of order and ask you to inform me if I am 
incorrect.  It seemed like yesterday we went through this process 
and that before you put forward a motion, you have to get the 
consent of the House.  Is that wrong?  That seems to me what 
happened yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I find 
this post-budget debate rather amusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find that the party of the right, the Reform Party, is 
emphasizing the reduction of debt and lower taxes, which one 
expects. We find the party of the left, the NDP, wants us to 
spend more on programs. 
That is understandable also. But at least these two parties are 
clear where they stand.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find the leader of the PC party still on the horns of the 
same dilemma he faced in the election campaign, finding most of 
his support in the maritimes, which usually want more spending, 
and yet still trying to pretend to be a party of fiscal 
responsibility.  He suggested that the minister should have a red 
face.  It is my contention that the Tory leader should have a red 
face for even pretending to comment on this budget after the mess 
the last PC government left this country in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He suggested that we embrace the policies of the PC government. 
While it is true that the PC government articulated some of the 
policies which we have embraced and we have implemented, the 
problem for it was that it did not have the courage to implement 
any of those policies. That is why we were left 10 years later 
with a Canada pension plan that had not been revised. We are the 
party that had the courage to set the fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals, they say, abandoned the policy of projecting UI 
figures.  Of course we abandoned the policy of long term 
projections because Canadians had totally lost faith in long term 
projections after years of the Tories missing every projection 
they ever made.  Our two year rolling targets are far more 
realistic because we have hit our targets and indeed have 
exceeded our targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He comments on the cost of Pearson airport.  The Canadian people 
are happy to have Pearson airport now in the hands of a 
non-profit local airport authority where the profits are poured 
back into the public facility as opposed to lining the pockets of 
friends of the former government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He suggested certain provincial finance ministers are condemning 
the budget.  But we expect that because provincial finance 
ministers always want more money and more power. What we have to 
point out to the Canadian people is this.  Yes, we did reduce the 
transfers to the provincial governments but by a percentage that 
was less than what we cut our own program spending by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the people, for example, in the province of Ontario are 
noticing a difference in health and education programming they 
might look to their own premier who cut that spending by five 
times the amount that we cut our transfers by.  So they will be 
smart enough to lay the blame where it belongs, at the desk of 
the provincial premier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my question for the leader of the Progressive 
Conservatives is this.  When are we and his supporters, who are 
few but there in the west of Canada, in Ontario, indeed in my 
riding, going to find out whether he really stands for keeping 
the fiscal house in order and cutting spending or whether he 
stands for all the money to reducing the debt, or whether he 
stands for, as the people in Nova Scotia want, lots and lots of 
spending? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is he going to be clear and honest with the Canadian people 
as to where his party sits on the political spectrum so that they 
can decide whether they support him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would be happy to 
table in the House immediately a document entitled “A Plan for 
Growth”.  It spells out in great detail exactly where we stand 
on all these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the House of Commons can read it.  So I ask for 
consent to table this document immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the member have 
the unanimous consent of the House to table the document? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Madam Speaker, I ask you to rule on 
what I have just asked, the consent of the House to table the 
document.  I cannot believe Liberal members would refuse after 
the question by the hon. member for Oakville.  Surely they would 
not have the gall.  I want to table what our position is.  I want 
to do it for the record in the House and I think it should be 
published in <I>Hansard</I> so that all Canadians will have a look 
at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I am asking you to put the question to the House. 
I would be curious to find out which Liberal member would want to 
get himself on the record at this point saying no.  Let us hear 
them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I again ask the House 
if it gives the hon. member its unanimous consent to table a 
document at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There is no consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Madam Speaker, the parliamentary 
secretary to the House leader of the Liberal Party said no and I 
want the record to show that.  It demonstrates the hypocrisy of 
the Liberals who have now embarrassed the member for Oakville. 
The Reform Party members did not say no.  Why would they object? 
If they asked the same thing I would not object. Nor did the NDP 
or the Bloc.  That demonstrates the hypocrisy of the Liberal 
Party.  I am sorry that she has been embarrassed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that the member would actually want to rise and 
say that our positions are not known or that they just continued 
to have the courage to pursue the policies that we had brought 
forward but did not have the courage to implement.  Does the 
member mean like the GST, the Pearson airport, the free trade 
agreement or the targets for inflation?  What about when the 
leader of the Liberal Party of Canada guaranteed funding for 
health care and education in 1993? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member for Oakville said they reduced their program 
spending more than they cut the provinces, I am very sorry, but 
whether it is in percentages or in raw numbers, she had better 
check her facts.  Maybe the parliamentary secretary would have 
the courage to get up and correct her, since he is now bent on 
correcting her today, and tell the truth to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the truth?  The government gutted health care and 
education after cynically promising that it would not touch it, 
that it would be guaranteed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last comment I want to make is that it is very imprudent for 
someone from Oakville to actually criticize the people of Nova 
Scotia, which she has done today.  I would say to the member for 
Oakville that she would be wiser to let the people in Nova Scotia 
make up their own minds on their future and not sermonize them 
from the House of Commons.  Their health care and education have 
been cut and they have a right to services also.  They have a 
right to receive services from this government and from 
governments in the province of Nova Scotia.  We will see how they 
speak in the next provincial election. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, to 
make more time for my colleagues I would just like to ask a quick 
question.  I know the hon. member who talked about the debt 
realizes that this big debt is a dark cloud hanging over this 
country, holding down unemployment and keeping taxes up high. 
This huge debt has put us in a desperate situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember back in early 1990 when the member's government was 
in control it brought in the famous GST.  There was a big debate 
nationwide on that and I think about 90% of the people did not 
want it, I suggest, based on petitions and all that.  One of the 
members who used to be in this party now sits across the House 
because of that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember distinctly, loudly and clearly, a person by the name 
of Michael Wilson saying—being an old Conservative I was very 
interested in what he had to say—every penny from the GST will 
go to tear down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I have to ask this member is what in the world happened?  It 
went up faster and greater than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Madam Speaker, actually I 
appreciate the opportunity to engage my colleague from Wild Rose 
on this issue because there is a lot of rhetoric around.  Let me 
try to present the facts in as straightforward a manner as I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government was elected in 1984 it faced a very serious 
problem of high deficits and debt.  In fact, the deficit relative 
to GDP, the size of the economy, was about 8%.  We then engaged 
in the process of reducing spending because average Liberal 
government program spending, which the member from Edmonton will 
know, in the last 10 years before the election of the Progressive 
Conservative government in 1984 increased 14% a year.  Guess who 
was minister of finance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We engaged in the process of turning the ship around.  I am sure 
the member for Wild Rose will appreciate that does not happen 
overnight.  Let me set down for him some markers that indicated 
real progress.  The federal government started to balance its 
operating budget as of 1987. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the operating budget? I will take a second. It is the 
amount that comes in in revenue and what we spend on programs and 
excludes interest on the debt.  From there on what we dealt with 
was the leftover debt, mostly of Liberal governments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am certainly very proud to 
rise on behalf of the government in this debate to highlight our 
dramatic, in fact historic, balanced budget and our budget of 
balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until yesterday one in every three Canadians, everyone under 
27, had never seen their federal government deficit free. As this 
House will see, the era of credit card governance is over. One 
would have to be almost 50 to remember when Canada was deficit 
free for three consecutive years. We are changing that too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting now and with the 1998 budget, we announced our 
commitment to balance the books this year and continue to balance 
the books for each of the next two years. In other words, Canada 
will enter a new millennium with the type of positive financial 
performance we have not seen in a half century. That is a 
milestone, a new beginning and it is worth celebrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no surprise that the official opposition and other 
opposition parties are standing in their place today ranting and 
raving that we have not gone far enough or fast enough, whether 
it is cutting debt or cutting taxes. Let me refer to a word that 
the leader of the official opposition has never heard of, let 
alone understands its meaning, balance.  That is a word they do 
not like, it appears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember how members opposite consistently attacked our 
approach in each of our past budgets, an approach that combined 
real fiscal discipline with reasonable, responsible investments 
in areas of strategic economic benefit and for Canadians in 
jeopardy and in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that today's budget leaves a very bitter taste 
in their mouths, because the results of our approach are clear, 
concrete and convincing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government not only balanced the budget but took a balanced 
approach.  Unlike the Reform Party which continues to put forward 
programs of extremes, this government has chosen to take a 
balanced plan for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we heard the leader of the official opposition say that 
his party has a national job strategy. That is what he said. But 
we know what the name of this job strategy is, Reaganomics. It is 
called voodoo economics of the 1980s. It did not work then and it 
is not going to work now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we need to do is look at the facts of our balanced 
approach. These are the facts.  Canada's pace of economic growth 
and job growth is positioning us as a world leader among the 
major industrial nations. Our deficit performance is absolutely 
the best of any G-7 nation. That is the benefit we get from a 
balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an approach that the 1998 budget sustains. It combines 
continued fiscal progress through our debt repayment plan with a 
program of general tax relief and investments in learning and 
skills, in helping to manage student debt, in aiding children in 
need, in boosting research and in funding to provinces for health 
care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to focus on is our fiscal track record, because it 
is our success as financial managers that has made possible these 
tax cuts and strategic investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Achieving a balanced budget this year means that the deficit has 
in fact declined by $42 billion in just five years. This dramatic 
turnaround is the combined result of two factors. The first is 
the sharp drop in federal program spending due to our review of 
all federal programs.  Program spending this year is estimated at 
$106 billion, down from $120 billion in 1993-94. That is real 
cuts in real dollars.  Second, the deficit has been cut thanks to 
higher budgetary revenues, primarily from a growing economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken together, these factors highlight a dramatic 
transformation in Canada's economic and fiscal policy. In 
1993-94, high deficits were pushing interest rates up and 
depressing economic activity.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This meant higher interest charges on the debt, fewer jobs for 
Canadians and, in turn, lower revenues for government, creating 
further deficit pressure.  It was a vicious circle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Canada enjoys the benefits of a virtuous circle with 
fiscal progress contributing to lower interest rates which in 
fact fuel economic growth and job creation, leading again to an 
ever improving fiscal situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister told this House, while we have won a major 
battle, we understand full well that we have not yet won the war. 
Interest charges on our debt, the result of decades of deficits, 
will cost us $41.5 billion this year.  That is money that cannot 
go to health care or further tax reduction or addition debt 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a strong economy and a secure society, this debt must be 
brought down.  Our commitment is to make that happen, steadily 
and permanently.  That is why we are instituting a two track 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we will continue to follow policies that will pay off in 
better economic growth.  Second, we will bring down the absolute 
level of debt itself through the debt repayment plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this plan we will continue to present two year fiscal 
plans based on prudent economic assumptions.  Next, we will 
continue to build a buffer into our budgets. The $3 billion 
contingency reserve is there to make sure we meet our balanced 
budget targets despite any unforeseen pressures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if the contingency reserve is not needed, just as it 
has not been needed in each of the last four budgets, thanks 
again to our prudent economic assumptions, it will go directly to 
pay down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, as the minister said, this is how since coming into 
office we have brought the deficit down year after year after 
year.  This is how in the future we will bring the debt down year 
after year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We heard that before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  The hon. member opposite says he heard 
it before.  He is quite correct.  He has heard it before because 
it is a program that was put in place to eliminate the deficit. 
That is in fact what has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day over the last number of years the opposition party 
would stand up and say that we would never accomplish the 
elimination of the deficit. Yesterday those members sat in their 
seats and listened to the Minister of Finance state unequivocally 
that the budget will be balanced this year, next year and the 
year after precisely because we put in place a strategy to 
eliminate the deficit in a very balanced fashion, not by the 
extreme programs that the opposition party is putting forward, 
tax cuts at any cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we do have to listen to the rhetoric, and I am 
attempting to lay down some facts, I hope the hon. members will 
stand in their places and say that the deficit strategy the 
government put in place was a successful one which has 
accomplished that objective one year ahead of schedule of what 
the Reform Party had actually indicated in its election platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a very important way, the reduction of the debt has actually 
begun.  In 1996-97 the combination of economic growth and fiscal 
restraint meant that the debt to GDP ratio, what we owe in 
relation to what we produce, fell significantly for the first 
time in more than 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree in this House that level is still too high but 
everyone must admit in this House that the trend is going in the 
right direction.  We will continue to bring down the debt to GDP 
ratio.  This year it will drop even further.  Over the next two 
years the improvement will continue, falling to about 63%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to the topic of debt but for the moment I want to 
step back to our current deficit success.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is worth comparing our federal financial performance 
with how other major industrial countries are handling their 
fiscal challenges.  In Canada we use the public accounts method 
of measuring public finances.  It is one of the most rigorous in 
the world.  It is rigorous because it includes all the 
liabilities which government incurs over the course of a year. 
Many other countries such as the U.S. and Japan use the financial 
requirements measure.  This includes only the borrowings that the 
government makes in financial markets. According to this measure 
Canada is in the best fiscal health of the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth repeating that when we use the financial 
requirements measure Canada is in the best fiscal health of the 
G-7.  This means that by the time the federal government of the 
United States sees its first balanced budget we will be on our 
third.  Meanwhile, all the other major industrial economies will 
still be running deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a reflection of the sacrifices Canadians have made to 
support and ensure that we were able to get the deficit under 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an even more important way in which our fiscal progress 
has real meaning and real benefit for Canadians.  The improved 
position of governments, combined with the federal government's 
commitment to low inflation, has played a key role in allowing 
interest rates to drop to a near 30 year low.  While 
international pressures have squeezed rates up somewhat, today 
they are still more than 3 percentage points below the level of 
early 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bottom line win for Canadians.  It means that someone 
who is renewing a five year $100,000 mortgage today will save 
$3,000 a year compared to just three years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one final area of strong performance I want to touch 
on. As I said earlier, an important element of our fiscal renewal 
has been our government's action to control program spending. 
Over the last three years it has dropped in absolute dollar 
terms, a discipline unprecedented in at least 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the growth of Canada's economy, combined with the fiscal 
turnaround we have put in place, means that we can now afford to 
begin to make strategic investments such as the Canada millennium 
scholarship and to increase provincial transfers to the Canada 
health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our commitment to restraint is strong and secure.  The fact is 
program spending will continue to fall in relation to the size of 
the economy.  It will continue to reflect the priorities of 
Canadians, continuing the process we started some five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time total program spending stood at almost 17% of 
Canada's GDP.  This year we estimate that it will be down to 
12.4% of economic activity.  By the year 1999-2000 it should drop 
to 11.5% of the economic activity, the lowest level in 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that is the year when, based on our fiscal 
targets and prudent planning, Canadians will see their third 
balanced budget in a row.  That has not happened in almost 50 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years ago we established a plan which is working.  For the 
first time in 30 years the budget is balanced.  For the first 
time in 50 years we will balance the budget for three consecutive 
years.  This budget is simply the next stage in that plan and it 
continues the same balanced approach for the future which has 
worked over the past four budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will pay down the debt as we have paid down the deficit.  We 
will invest in critical priority areas like education and health 
care.  We will cut taxes, beginning with middle and low income 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt about it, with this budget we have made 
choices. 
They are choices that reflect Canadian priorities and that 
reflect the same balanced approach that we have taken all along. 
This is a budget for the Canadian people.  The days of 
overspending and overreaching are gone.  We have brought the 
deficit down from $42 billion to zero and we will continue to 
live within our means.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason we can realistically talk about tax cuts is we 
have managed to get the books balanced.  The measures announced 
in the budget will affect 90% of Canadian taxpayers. Four hundred 
thousand low income Canadians will be removed from the tax rolls 
altogether and an additional thirteen million Canadians will see 
their federal taxes drop.  All along, this government has not 
once raised personal income tax rates.  Where we have raised 
taxes, we have been sure to do so in the interests of fairness as 
with the special surtax on the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunity strategy is a comprehensive strategy 
that focuses on expanding access to opportunities, to knowledge 
and skills that Canadians require to meet the challenges of the 
21st century.  For a student today hoping to enter post-secondary 
education, it is about the 100,000 millennium scholarships that 
will be awarded each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than one million Canadians paying off a student debt, 
it is about tax relief for the first time ever on the interest 
portion of their student loans.  For adults who are hoping to 
return to school or acquire new skills, it is about tax free 
access to their RRSPs.  For parents or grandparents, it is about 
the Canada education savings grant to help them save for the 
education of their children and their grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship fund will provide 100,000 
scholarships a year to students in every province and every 
community, with up to $3,000 per year for full time and part time 
students, young Canadians and adults at universities, at 
community colleges, at technical schools and vocational 
institutes.  It is all about increasing access to knowledge and 
skills.  It is about preparing for the next millennium.  It is 
about reflecting Canadian priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way we set up the millennium scholarship fund is a 
reflection of what we believe.  It is something we felt was so 
important that it should be taken out of the hands of politics 
and put into the hands of experts.  That is why we are setting up 
a private foundation to administer the scholarships.  Over time 
we may attract private sector endowments so it can grow and help 
even more young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments have an obligation to provide better access to 
skills and knowledge.  We are not about to stand aside and ignore 
that obligation.  It is not about jurisdiction or turf.  It is 
about our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have been able to achieve over the last four budgets is 
a result of the hard work of Canadians.  Members in this House 
often make reference to the fact that this government boasts 
about its success.  Government members on this side of House 
state unequivocally that our success in our war with the deficit 
is a result of the sacrifices Canadians have made, of the 
partnership Canadians have struck with this government, of the 
support Canadians have given this government over the last two 
elections to deal with the fiscal questions and challenges we 
have had to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget marks an historic moment.  It makes possible what 
many thought was not possible.  Most important, it is a budget 
that shows Canadians that their support for our deficit fight and 
their willingness to endorse and accept the tough decisions we 
had to make was not misplaced.  This is their success and the 
rewards it produces will be theirs and their children's.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the speech by my colleague, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some things I found surprising.  First he said: “My 
government accomplished this; my government accomplished that. We 
took priorities into account; we did a good job, and so forth”. 
He should perhaps quit reading the notes the Department of 
Finance gives him, just as he should perhaps quit taking his 
orders from the finance minister in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should perhaps actually take a look at the budget documents 
and do a little evaluation of what has gone on for the last four 
years and will continue to go on until 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, his Minister of Finance introduced a plan of major 
cuts.  Only once did he speak about it.  Every year, another $6 
billion is cut from social programs, university education and 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the information of my colleague, who does not seem to be 
informed at all, or who tells us only half of what he knows, there 
are still $30 billion in cuts to be made by 2003, and they will be 
in those very sectors of university education, health and welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are really concerned about education, as one of the 
keys to the future, the first thing the finance minister should 
have done, and did not do, was to give back what he cut in the 
university education sector. 
But no.  They take this year's surplus, around $3 billion, put down 
$2.5 billion this year for the millennium fund scholarships, when 
these scholarships will not actually be given out for another two 
years, and the public is given to understand that they are 
concerned about student indebtedness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All they are concerned about is their visibility as a federal 
government.  During Oral Question Period, the Prime Minister made 
it clear.  So did the Minister of Human Resources Development in 
the scrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund, he said, was not about arguing, but about 
the future. 
How is it that the constitutional issue of Quebeckers' freedom of 
choice, a constitutional fact of Canadian life, has been referred 
to the supreme court, and our right to exercise this freedom under 
the Constitution is being questioned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he think the Constitution need not be applied in the 
educational sector?  They claim to be defending this Constitution 
and to be betrayed by our democratic right to choose our own future 
as Quebeckers.  It is no big deal, but they refer it to the supreme 
court.  That is my first question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second is as follows.  Does he realize, on quick 
calculation, that, in the past four years, 52% of the cuts imposed 
by the Minister of Finance were absorbed by the provinces?  They 
are the champions and the artisans of improved public finances. 
The taxpayers' contribution was 47%, through taxes, through the non 
indexing of tax tables, through the Minister of Finance's 
systematic robbery of the surplus in the unemployment insurance 
fund of between $6 billion and $7 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, his Minister of Finance, the good manager, cut 11% 
from federal government operations.  Some manager.  He should stop 
parroting the words and political lines of his minister and take 
his duty as a member of Parliament to heart. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, we have started to hear 
the rhetoric heat up a bit.  To address a couple of the points 
that were made, the budget yesterday reflected the balanced 
approach, the approach that worked for the government and worked 
for Canadians since 1993 in achieving our successes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the issue of the millennium scholarship fund 
and the issue of jurisdiction, the federal government has always 
had a role in access to education.  It is a role that the 
government has continually stated, in fact with the announcement 
of the millennium scholarship fund, is not about jurisdiction or 
turf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member were to go to Quebec and speak to young 
students who are looking to gain access to university, he would 
know they are not concerned about jurisdiction or turf.  They 
want solutions. They want to have some hope.  They want to have 
some access to skills training because they know these are types 
of skills they will need to compete in the next millennium.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has responded to the priorities of Canadians.  I 
think we would find across the country that the whole learning 
strategy, the opportunity strategy, is one that is well received 
by students, by Canadians interested in lifelong learning, by 
parents and grandparents who want to put money aside for their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone realizes, regardless of what level of government, that 
we have to do our very best to ensure that each and every 
Canadian has equal opportunity to learning and skills training. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member on the opposite side said that members on this side 
of the House should stand in our place and say that the deficit 
plan has been successful.  I would say that whether or not we 
determine the deficit plan has been successful depends on how one 
measures success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we measure success by the high number of people who are 
unemployed, perhaps the plan has been successful.  If we measure 
success by the large number of young people who need help and who 
will not be able to receive help under the budget, perhaps we can 
say it has been successful.  If we measure success by the large 
number of people lining the corridors of hospitals trying to get 
proper health care, by the large number of people who are unable 
to afford pharmacare and proper medicines, or by the large number 
of seniors who are concerned about their future, perhaps we can 
say the budget has been successful.  If we are looking at the 
large number of federal government employees who are still 
seeking pay equity, not being paid their rightful due, perhaps 
again the government has been successful.  If we look at the 
large number of people working in shipyards who are not able to 
have a national shipbuilding policy that will address their 
concerns, perhaps the government has been successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look Atlantic Canada and Nova Scotia in particular the 
budget does very little to address the concerns of the people in 
that area.  There is nothing concrete offered to ease the 
employment concerns of the fishers on the east coast. No 
substantial relief is offered to young people currently 
experiencing high student debt load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the millennium fund which will not kick in until 
the year 2000 and then will only help about 7% of the students in 
the area.  The budget has no new job creation strategies.  It has 
no targets, as has been mentioned.  There is no new investment in 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government mentioned choices and talked about them being the 
choices of Canadians.  We could look at the large number of 
Canadians who have not been consulted or dealt with in a real 
partnership.  I am speaking about our aboriginal communities that 
year after year are refused admittance at the first ministers 
tables and constitutional talks.  Yet we talk about working in 
partnership.  Have those people been considered and have they 
been consulted in terms of priorities for people when we say that 
this is a budget for Canadian people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about priorities.  Yet, when we talk about priorities, 
we are not really talking about priorities for people but we are 
talking about the priorities the government determined were its 
priorities in meeting the budget deficit.  It has been done on 
the backs of the people.  When we talk about how successful we 
are, let us think about those people who have to worry about 
where their next meal is coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is just about up.  I throw those remarks out 
to have them on record for a response by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Madam Speaker, we do not have very much 
time to address the number of issues that were brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reiterate the fact that the government, despite 
what some members in the opposition continue to state, does and 
will continue to invest in Canadian priorities.  Health care and 
education consistently rank among the priorities of Canadians. 
Certainly the debt and tax relief with respect to low income and 
middle income Canadians are issues.  We have taken steps.  The 
child tax credit is a commitment that we fulfilled in the past 
budget and one that we will continue to work on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the hon. member that back in 1993 the finance minister 
put in place a consultation process that was unprecedented in 
this place.

be included in the budget.  I would only offer an opportunity for 
the hon. member to perhaps travel with that committee to hear 
from Canadians themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure today to rise to debate the government's budget. It 
is an important day.  I think we would be negligent if we did not 
point out that this is an important day for taxpayers who have 
done a tremendous amount to bring the budget into balance for the 
first time in 28 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to note, as we began the budget debate on this day, 
that the finance minister acknowledged the tremendous role that 
taxpayers have played in bringing the budget into balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to my colleagues opposite and I have 
noticed that they have used a few words over and over again. They 
argue that they have taken the balanced approach to this balanced 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to scrutinize whether or not that is exactly the case by 
running through the three major aspects contained in the budget. 
The government talks about how it will deal with the issue of 
spending.  It talks about how it will deal with the issue of 
taxes and the issue of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with the spending side.  That is where the 
government started.  It is where its proclivities lie and it is 
probably one of the most interesting parts of the budget. The 
government is arguing that it is the balanced approach to 
increase spending overall in the budget by $11 billion.  We have 
not seen an increase in spending like that in years and years and 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to make the point right now that we think at a 
time when the government has balanced the budget for the first 
time it is missing a glorious opportunity to deal with the 
fundamental economic problems of the country in a way that will 
fix them once and forever.  By increasing spending it has 
essentially blown that chance, an $11 billion spending increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a couple of words about how the government has 
spent that money.  For weeks on end the government has been 
talking about the need to invest in education.  It has been no 
secret that there would be increases in spending for education. 
Who can be against education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that education is extraordinarily important, but I 
think a little history is in order here.  I think we need to talk 
about just how much the federal government values education.  We 
need to point out to taxpayers of Canada and to students that it 
was the federal government which took the broad axe to education 
funding in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well in the 1995 budget that the finance 
minister said they were to cut the size of government 
percentage-wise far more than they were to cut transfers to the 
provinces.  He made a speech to the Kansas City Reserve Board 
saying that they were to make far deeper cuts to the size of 
government, trim fat, eliminate waste, before they would ever cut 
important things like health care and higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just wasn't so.  Those were their words but their actions 
were completely different.  The result was that health care and 
higher education suffered massive cuts, 35% cuts to the provinces 
to provide health care and higher education.  This was completely 
unnecessary when there were all kinds of wasteful areas in 
government spending that they could have cut, things that are 
completely unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was bad enough that they did that two or three years ago. Now 
they want to be rewarded for riding to the rescue with a new 
education program.  They want to be rewarded after the provinces 
have taken the hits.  It has been the provinces that have had 
protesters on the lawns of their legislatures saying that they 
want to see more funding for health care, more funding for higher 
education.  There were never any protests here.  The federal 
government got away with it basically scot-free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today those members want to come waltzing in to provincial 
jurisdiction and say that they will restore a fraction of the 
funding and they expect to be rewarded for it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out in talking about the particulars of the 
millennium scholarship fund, just where we think this fund goes 
absolutely wrong. The first point is that the millennium 
scholarship fund will focus spending on about 6% of the students, 
leaving 94% of the students out there still looking for a way to 
get to university. We argue that if the government had taken that 
money and given it to the provinces, they could have used it to 
reduce the tuition costs and that would have helped all the 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the millennium scholarship fund misses the point also 
in a very fundamental way.  The issue is not so much that 
students in Canada are not well trained. We know they are. In 
fact we have got one of the highest participation rates in 
university in the industrialized world. The problem is not on the 
supply side. The problem is on the demand side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking a few minutes ago on a cable TV show with the hon. 
member for Red Deer.  He pointed out that his children all 
attended university in Canada but they are all working in other 
countries in the world right now.  Three children, one in Norway, 
one in Holland and one at Princeton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about his son who is at Princeton. Here is a young 
man who is a Rhodes scholar but could not find work as a 
professor in Canada. Why?  Of course because we saw the federal 
government cut transfers to the provinces for things like higher 
education, making it almost impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did talk about other areas as well, or other ways 
to aid higher education. Let us talk a little bit more about 
access to higher education, an important subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have talked about ways that they would use 
the registered retirement savings plans to benefit people who 
want to go back to school. That is entirely laudable. We agree 
with expanding the use of RRSPs. RRSPs are a good idea. But the 
problem is people do not have the disposable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem again is not that the programs are not adequate. The 
fact is people do not have the income to participate in them. 
Which is why we are making the argument that we need to have 
lower taxes in this country, far lower taxes than we have today 
and far more than the government was offering in its recent 
budget. 
The registered education savings plan is another savings plan for 
education. But again Canadians just do not have the income to 
participate. We make the argument that if this government really 
wants to help education in this country, it has to address both 
sides of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one side we need to ensure that Canadians have adequate 
incomes so that they can put money aside to get their children 
into university. We need to ensure that transfers to the 
provinces continue. But on the other side we also need to know 
that there are jobs for those people. We need to know that when 
they graduate from university they can find a job so they can 
start to pay back those student loans. Unfortunately in Canada 
today where we have a youth unemployment rate of 16.2%, it is 
very difficult for many students to find jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study by Nesbitt Burns points out the huge difference in the 
tax rates between Canada and the United States.  As a result so 
many of our students whom we have just trained at great expense 
are disappearing from this country and are going to the United 
States. And it does not end with the United States. It points out 
that people who are involved in computer sciences and it talks 
about all kinds of professionals, doctors, nurses, teachers and 
engineers, are disappearing across the border. It would be bad 
enough if it was only an economic problem, but I argue it is also 
a social problem. We are seeing families split up and that is 
extraordinarily unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not very long ago that Liberals in this place would stand 
up and rip the Conservative government because our sovereignty 
was being taken over by the Americans. Today the Liberals are 
allowing our brightest and our best to go to the United States 
because they will not deal with the taxation problem in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a moment about the debt side of the budget. 
First let me explain the situation for people. In Canada today we 
have a debt of $583 billion. 
When my friends across the way came to power a few years ago they 
began the process of adding debt upon debt upon debt.  They built 
the debt up by about $90 billion while they were in government.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have this debt of $583 billion.  We pay $45 billion a 
year in interest on it, one-third of every tax dollar. The 
average family pays $6,000 a year in federal taxes just to pay 
the interest on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been coast to coast over the past several months talking 
to Canadians about how to deal with the problem of the country's 
finances. Without exception no matter what part of the country we 
go to people say with one voice “Please begin the process of 
paying down the debt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly in Canada today the government is taking the approach that 
the debt is not an issue.  The government said in its budget that 
in fact it will only deal with the problem of the debt in terms 
of paying it down if it has some money left over in its 
contingency fund. There are no targets set for debt reduction, 
absolutely no targets. The finance committee suggested that the 
government at least have a very lukewarm target of between 60% 
and 50% of GDP.  It completely ignored that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the government has is this sort of halfhearted promise that 
if it can get to it, it will start to pay down money from the 
contingency fund toward the debt. That is simply not acceptable. 
Canadians today know that when we live in a global economy we 
cannot count on just being secure in our country when we know 
that an Asian crisis as there just was or a Mexican peso crisis 
can have a profound impact on us especially when our economy is 
teetering atop a $583 billion debt, one-quarter of which is owed 
to foreigners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must begin to deal with the problem of the debt.  Do not take 
my word for it.  Listen to what some of the commentators have 
been saying about the issue of the debt in the wake of 
yesterday's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the Canadian Taxpayers Federation is saying. 
Everyone well knows that is a very credible institution. My 
friend from Calgary Southeast used to head the Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation.  It is saying “The federal government has also 
chosen to ignore the national debt and instead grow its way out 
of our debt woes.  Debt servicing charges are actually going to 
increase over the next three years from $41.5 billion to $45 
billion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Andrew Pyle, chief strategist of ABN Amro Bank, is calling the 
government's debt reduction strategy lazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally listen to this quote “I think the market could be less 
than enthusiastic about a plan that puts less emphasis on paying 
down debt, particularly during a period of robust growth and low 
interest rates”, said Aron Gampel, deputy chief economist with 
Scotia Capital Markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are real problems with the government's approach to 
dealing with the debt.  That is one of the chief reasons why we 
saw the dollar fall like a stone by half a cent right after the 
budget came out.  That is a tremendous shock for people who were 
expecting something a bit better from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also point out that the debt has a real impact on Canadians' 
lives, when the debt is as high as it is and Canadian families 
are paying $6,000 a year in taxes just to pay the interest on the 
debt.  It hurts many innocent people. I point out again that it 
is Canadians who have balanced this budget and they are the ones 
who deserve to see some tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the final big aspect of the budget. That is of 
course taxes.  I want to spend a bit more time on this issue than 
on some of the other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government has come to power we have seen the 
government introduce new tax increases 37 times.  We now have a 
government that is going to be taking in approximately $48 
billion more in revenues by the end of its mandate than when it 
came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where we are seeing Canadians' disposable 
income fall like a stone, $3,000 for the average family since the 
government came to power.  This is added on top of 10 years of 
misery under the Conservative government where we saw 71 tax 
increases.  There have been 108 tax increases in the last 
generation under Liberal and Tory governments. 
It even goes higher than that if we go back into the Trudeau era. 
It is an extraordinarily poor record on behalf of both 
Conservative and Liberal governments over the last many years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members again are arguing that they are taking the 
balanced approach.  They are saying “We are taking a balanced 
approach to spending” by driving spending up $11 billion.  That 
is the biggest spending increase in a generation.  They are 
taking a balanced approach in not dealing at all with the problem 
of the debt.  That is their argument.  They are saying “We do 
not have to deal with the debt”.  That is the balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they are saying that they are going to introduce $7 billion 
in tax relief over three years, but that will not come anywhere 
near offsetting the huge increase in CPP premiums which took 
effect January 1.  It was a huge increase.  We saw the largest 
tax hike in Canadian history come in on January 1 and they have 
the gall to suggest that they are somehow reducing taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the end of it.  We also know—and my friends will 
not deny this—that built in to the tax system is the phenomenon 
of bracket creep, which allows the government every year to take 
another $900 million out of taxpayers' pockets.  The taxation 
system is no longer indexed to inflation. Cost of living 
increases will push people into new tax brackets and the result 
is that they will pay new taxes.  A lot of people do not even 
realize it is happening.  The fact is, that alone will claw back 
about 50 cents of every dollar the government has offered in tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is simply that the government cannot argue that there 
is real tax relief in this budget.  In fact the revenue which the 
government is collecting is going up and up on an ever climbing 
track.  I would point out to my friends opposite that since the 
government took power in 1993, the year it promised to eliminate 
the GST, we are now seeing projections for GST revenue growth to 
be 46% higher than in 1993.  That is extraordinary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to bracket creep and increases in income tax, by redefining 
income in various ways, Canada now has some of the highest 
personal income taxes in the world.  I pointed out earlier that 
we have personal income taxes that are 56% higher than the G-7 
average, higher than those of our trading partners, higher than 
in Japan, the United States, the U.K., France, Italy and all the 
other countries.  We are 25% higher than the OECD average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen incomes in Canada drop so dramatically that more 
and more families are having to have both parents in the 
workforce, one just to pay the taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our argument is that it is time for a change to the approach the 
government has brought to us.  We do not think its approach is 
balanced at all.  We think it punishes the very people who 
balanced the budget.  We think it is time to give Canadians, if I 
dare say it, a fresh start.  We think it is time to secure their 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to ask my friends opposite to take my word for 
it.  I want to quote from some letters which the Reform Party has 
received. This is a letter from someone who lives in Nova Scotia: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Mr. Manning, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I read about the help you gave Kim Hicks in Sackville, 
N.B.  It is nice to see that you are listening and willing to 
help people in her situation.  There are many people that need 
your help to influence the government to lower the tax burden on 
ordinary Canadians.  Please find enclosed my documentation which 
says a great deal about how government taxation policy is hurting 
me and many others.  If this information is useful to you, please 
use it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to list his payroll stubs.  The letter continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—note that my taxable earnings for 1996 and 1997 are nearly the 
same; a difference of $33.60 between the two years.  The big 
difference is that in 1997 I paid $647.07 more taxes than in 1996 
on gross income that is nearly the same.

and to give them the real hope that only the Reform Party can 
truly give them.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>TAXATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my hon. colleague from Medicine Hat was speaking moments ago 
about the bracket creep which is a serious systemic flaw in our 
tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised a question in this place on November 18 last year of 
the government about a revenue department report, which had been 
released the previous day, indicating income taxes paid by the 
average taxpayer went up by 10% largely because the government 
had kept in place Brian Mulroney's hidden tax grab called bracket 
creep which the OECD says is hammering our economy.  I went on to 
say that if the finance minister will not commit to broad based 
tax relief, will he at least commit to stop raising taxes through 
the hidden tax grab called bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to following up on that question today.  As the 
hon. member mentioned, in the budget released yesterday there was 
a claim that there was tax relief for Canadians, particularly low 
and modest income Canadians.  In fact, when one takes into 
account the effect of the deindexation of the tax brackets, this 
sneaky, back door, malicious tax increase imposed on Canadians by 
the Tory party in 1986, one will find more Canadians paying taxes 
next year than they did last year and more Canadians paying more 
taxes than they ever did before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how bracket creep works.  The basic exemptions in the 
tax system and the marginal rates are only indexed for inflation 
over 3%.  We have had inflation, fortunately, under 3% thanks to 
the strict monetary policy of the Bank of Canada for several 
years now.  This means that in all the natural wage raises that 
people get, they are getting bumped up into the tax brackets 
which they previously did not have to pay.  This is why Canadians 
are now paying taxes on just $6,500 of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the opposition said in this place that these taxes 
are hidden and sneaky.  You don not really notice them until you 
get the bill.  They are practically invisible.  However, the 
sneakiest tax increase of all was the deindexation of personal 
income tax.  The minister keeps quiet about this.  The finance 
minister did not even mention it in his budget this year.  It is 
a very simple decision that will cost Canadians billions of 
dollars more annually but he kept quiet about it.  Here again, 
low and middle income Canadians will carry the heaviest burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the opposition went on to say that such underhanded 
and clandestine deindexation represents the most massive and 
heavy tax increase in Canada's history.  It will cost Canadians 
billions of dollars.  Sneaky, hidden, silent and automatic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not the current Leader of the Opposition.  That was the 
Right Hon. John Turner in this place on February 20, 1987.  That 
was the former leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another Liberal member at the time said: “The finance minister 
told us there was no tax increases in this budget.  That 
statement is false because taxes are going up in this country 
because of the deindexation of deductions which this government 
has done in its past budgets”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Which Liberal member said that?  It was the hon. member for 
Kingston and the Islands.  I gather he is still a Liberal member. 
Mr. Speaker, I can share your outrage which is why I close with a 
request for the parliamentary secretary to justify why this 
government is taking billions more out of the pockets of 
Canadians, and I know you will join me today in that request as 
you did in 1987, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member presumes a little on 
the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the change in 
personal income taxes paid in 1995, I urge the member to be a 
little more careful in his analysis of the tax trends.  In 
comparing the tax burdens between 1995 and 1994 the member does 
not consider the one time increase in capital gains income 
reported on 1994 tax returns made in anticipation of the 
elimination of the capital gains exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, an unusually high amount of capital gains 
exemptions were claimed in 1994 which lowered the overall tax 
rates in that year to below normal levels. Any comparison between 
1994 and the more typical 1995 average tax rates which does not 
take into account this fact exaggerates the rise in tax between 
these two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Growth in federal revenues since 1994 is primarily due to an 
increase in economic activity as reflected in the annual nominal 
GDP growth in the range of 4%.  As we witnessed yesterday, this 
government has taken the first step to reduce taxes for lower and 
middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party may think that tax relief for 13 million 
Canadians, for low and middle income families, for single mothers 
and working parents, for 90% of taxpayers is a waste of time, but 
we do not.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BANKING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in question period on November 25, I raised the issue of 
the need for a community reinvestment act in Canada.  At that 
time I asked the finance minister why, if the United States has a 
community reinvestment act and if Canadian banks such as the Bank 
of Montreal have to live by its provisions when they buy American 
banks like the Harris bank in Chicago, we could not enact a 
community reinvestment act in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal reply was right out of the briefing book supplied by 
the Canadian Bankers Association to all members of Parliament. I 
wish his officials would expand their reading list a bit on this 
topic. He misstated the purpose of a community reinvestment act 
and implied that it would ghettoize parts of Canada in terms of 
loans and investments made by the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain what a community reinvestment act really is for 
the secretary of state in the House.  I will also explain why the 
New Democratic Party advocates this policy.  When the Bank of 
Montreal wanted to buy the Harris bank in Chicago in 1993, U.S. 
regulators delayed approval until it met obligations under the 
American community reinvestment act to provide loan funding for 
small business and community development in the Chicago area. 
Eventually about $497 million Canadian in loan commitments was 
made to local housing projects and area small business over a 
five year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This idea has never been more relevant with the announcement of 
the monster merger of the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal. 
According to last Saturday's <I>Globe and Mail</I>, 206 
communities in Canada rely solely on either the Royal Bank or the 
Bank of Montreal for banking.  Matthew Barrett of the Bank of 
Montreal said yesterday that none of them will close but I think 
there are 206 communities in Canada waiting for the other shoe to 
drop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other banks are pulling out of communities.  In January, on the 
day it announced record profits to its annual shareholders 
meeting, the CIBC closed a branch, the only financial institution 
in Lynn Lake, Manitoba.  A Braxton Associates study last year 
estimated that 5,700 bank branches will close over the next 
decade, putting as many as 35,000 employees out of work.  We will 
start to see bank branches in small communities closing as fast 
as post offices.  The merger mania is one of the reasons these 
branches will close.  It is a sad commentary on the declining 
attention being paid to the needs of rural life in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A community reinvestment act makes financial institutions 
accountable for their behaviour in our communities.  It requires 
the banks to invest in the communities deemed in need.  In the 
U.S. banks have to prove they are meeting the credit needs of 
small business, community economic development and low income 
residential mortgages.  They have to keep lending statistics on 
loan requests, denials and approvals, and report their record in 
lending to visible minorities, women, low income neighbourhoods 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It requires those financial institutions to commit funds in 
order to meet these needs and to work together with community 
groups and businesses to make plans for doing so.  It is not 
rocket science.  At first, U.S. banks did not like the idea but 
now they have found they have very low default rates on 
residential mortgages.  Matthew Barrett knows all about it. He 
had to comply with these regulations before he bought the Harris 
bank in Chicago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is this.  We need jobs in Canada.  We have a higher 
unemployment rate than in the U.S.  Banks are making record 
profits in Canada but they are not investing in small businesses 
that create jobs or meeting their responsibilities to smaller 
communities in Canada.  In the U.S. they have to do it by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is one way for them to do it.  Why does the government not 
consider this idea? 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the availability of credit to 
the small business sector remains a critical issue for this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very aware of the importance of the small business 
community and its impact on our domestic economy.  That is why 
the government has worked hard over the past few years to improve 
the environment for small businesses in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The views of the task force on the future of the Canadian 
financial sector will be helpful to the government in deciding 
whether to approve or reject the particular merger transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure my hon. colleagues in the opposition that 
this government will not allow this merger to proceed without the 
understanding of its impacts on the small business community in 
Canada and without the full input of all Canadians, including the 
small business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said from the beginning that this government will not allow 
any financial institution to jump the cue.  We set a process in 
place.  That process was to allow the MacKay report to report. 
Once the MacKay report comes back to this House, the standing 
committee on finance will tour the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer the invitation to the hon. member who brought this 
question to the House to join us to hear from Canadians and to 
have input into what this government is prepared to do with 
respect to the merger of any financial institutions in this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the last day of 
the session before the holidays, or December 11, 1997, I questioned 
the Minister responsible for International Trade about what was 
happening about the guarantee of funding for the Spirit of Columbus 
platform, which MIL Davie had managed to bring in after several 
months of efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That platform has been anchored in the port of Quebec since 
August 30 of last year, but the wait on the guarantee of financing 
from the Export Development Corporation, which reports to the 
Minster of International Trade, has been going on for more than a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister's response was not very helpful, I am back at 
it again today to try and get some more details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke with Mr. Landry some months ago. I directed the 
EDC to speak with the Quebec SDI. Meetings were held. He had 
spoken with the MIL-Davie union president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government feels this is a very important 
undertaking. I respect the recommendations made by the EDC and 
the SDI on behalf of the governments of Quebec and of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been waiting ever since.  From time to time in this 
House, every couple of months, I bring it up again.  I know this is 
a complex matter, but we are now at the end of February, and next 
week the House adjourns.  Dominion Bridge, which owns the 
shipyards, is doing everything it can. 
It has even got new investments from American ECO, which is 
currently discussing a take-over of Dominion Bridge, and therefore 
of the yards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two other platform projects, each costing in excess 
of $100 million, Amethyst II and Amethyst III, for which 
applications have been made. The Government of Quebec is prepared 
to contribute.  As long ago as September 20, the SDI had given its 
agreement in principle for this project.  Now that we are talking 
in excess of $300 million for these platforms, we are still waiting 
on the federal government and the Export Development Corporation to 
find out what is going on about the guarantee of financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a quick review, in a few seconds, of one 
other Liberal government commitment.  In 1993 it had promised a 
summit on the future of marine construction in Canada. 
This was picked up on by then New Brunswick Premier McKenna who 
reminded the government of it at a federal-provincial conference 
before his resignation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now here we are in 1998, 5 years later,

otherwise legitimate activities are hidden and not taxed or 
regulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the untaxed wages of workers in the underground economy are 
added on to social program payments, they often earn more than 
workers on legitimate construction jobs, according to the report, 
and it so notes.  Those workers are also putting their future 
financial security at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers are being pressured into accepting less than legitimate 
working arrangements under which employment insurance premiums 
are not deducted, workers' compensation is not provided, and 
there is no protection against dangerous or unhealthy working 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that while economic factors are the largest 
factor in driving the underground economy, the picture is 
complicated by other factors including politics, an inverted 
sense of self-righteousness, various forms of sociocultural 
motivation and the role of EI, workers' compensation, social 
assistance and other benefits.  The underground economy therefore 
is not only flourishing, it would appear, but it is also growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the parliamentary secretary to outline exactly what 
the government plans to do to correct the abuse and what the 
government plans to do to stop the undermining of our social 
programs as a result of this underground activity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington for bringing this important 
issue to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Underground economic activity is indeed a problem in Canada 
which should be reduced.  Representatives of the construction 
industry take this issue very seriously, so much so that they 
expressed concern about the growing problem of underground 
employment and its implications for the future of their industry 
directly to the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
In response to their concern the minister agreed to work with 
them and subsequently developed a joint industry-government 
working group to examine this important issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The report the member brought forth in his question in the House 
a number of months ago referred to the results of the working 
group's study.  Its focus on labour market implications of 
underground employment in the construction industry is exactly 
what the member is asking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the member is suggesting and suggested in his 
question not too long ago, there was no leak to the media.  The 
fact is that over 1,000 copies of the report were made available 
to the working group members last December.  The intention of 
that was to get some input from all those members as to what was 
the best solution to deal with the underground economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the somewhat sensitive nature of the report—it 
describes in some detail how frauds are accomplished—the working 
group decided that its individual members could best determine 
how to distribute the report to their constituent organizations 
and concerned stakeholders.  The report will be used by the 
individual working group members to create action plans to reduce 
underground employment in the construction industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once that work is done I assure the member, the people at home 
who are watching and the House, that we will move very quickly on 
the underground economy.
