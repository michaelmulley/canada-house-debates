	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should oblige all railway 
companies that receive National Transportation Agency authorisation to 
abandon branch lines or sections under the National Transportation Act, 1987, 
to offer such branch lines or sections for public sale before abandoning them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to thank my 
colleague in the New Democratic Party, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg-Transcona, for letting me take his place this morning 
and for taking my turn last Monday. As you know, last Monday, 
this House, at the behest of the Leader of the Government, went so 
far as to sit on the day a referendum important to the future of 
Quebec and Canada was held in Quebec. Another demonstration of 
love and affection from our colleagues in the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I just want to say that in Quebec, we have a useful motto: <I>Je me 
souviens</I>. I can tell you Quebecers felt this decision was highly 
improper, as was the demonstration of love and affection in 
Montreal by 60,000 people on the Friday preceding the referendum 
and financed by Canadian Airlines, Air Canada and VIA Rail.
<P>
	I repeat, we have a useful motto in Quebec: <I>Je me souviens</I>. I can 
tell you that as the transport critic, as soon as I get a chance I will 
certainly return the favour to these three companies.
<P>
	Motion M-494 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should oblige all railway 
companies that receive National Transportation Agency authorisation to 
abandon branch lines or sections under the National Transportation Act, 1987, 
to offer such branch lines or sections for public sale before abandoning them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Perhaps I may explain that the purpose of this motion is, in a 
way, to apply retroactively a provision that  appears in Bill C-101. I 
imagine this will not be news to anyone who is familiar with the 
railway sector and especially with the decisions of the National 
Transportation Agency. As you know, when a company, either CN 
or CP, used to go before the National Transportation Agency, 
permission to abandon lines was practically automatic.
<P>
	Bill C-101 now before the Standing Committee on Transport 
provides that before a line is abandoned, it will first be offered for 
public sale. I should explain that if Bill C-101 is adopted in its 
present form, railway companies will have to submit a three-year 
plan, starting in 1996. The fact remains, however, that some branch 
lines are already in the process of being abandoned, although 
interested groups or provincial governments may have shown an 
interest in continuing operations.
<P>
	The purpose of this measure is therefore to deal with part of what 
has happened recently. However, if Bill C-101 is adopted as tabled, 
which means offering for sale prior to proceeding with 
abandonment, our party will not object to the substance of the bill. 
However, we will try to obtain extensions of the time limits 
because some are really too short to allow for a proper evaluation 
of the operations offered for sale. But we will have a chance to 
discuss that later on.
<P>
	As I was saying, the purpose of this motion is to save segments 
of railway lines for which a decision of abandonment has been 
issued by the National Transportation Agency. Bill C-101 provides 
that the railway companies must offer for sale the segments they 
wish to abandon. Even considering all the deficiencies of the 
abandonment procedure in Bill C-101, this measure should make it 
easier for these segments to be taken over by short line railway 
operations, because it would oblige railway companies to sell 
segments that are to be abandoned.
<P>
	There are segments in Quebec that would probably be viable as 
short line railways: the decision of abandonment has already been 
issued, but the tracks are still intact. Today we have no guarantee 
that railway companies will first try to sell to short line railways, in 
order to maintain segments. In fact, we could hardly expect railway 
companies to sell to short line railways if it is more attractive to 
sell a segment for uses other than railway transportation. It is 
common knowledge that railway companies in Canada own large 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16214"> 16214 </A></B>
<P>
amounts of real estate. They may prefer to speculate in real estate 
as opposed to  continuing a railway operation. That is the point I 
wanted to make.
<P>
	Public interest is not a consideration in commercial decisions by 
railway companies. That is unfortunate because, as you know, in 
some cases these companies obtained the land around a right of 
way when this country was first settled. Furthermore, Canada 
expanded from east to west thanks to the railways. Western Canada 
was developed thanks to the railways. These companies were given 
crown land for their railway rights of way and now are acting more 
like speculators.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	In Quebec there are at least three major branch lines in this 
situation: Chapais, Lachute and Québec Central, totalling some 550 
kilometres. Negotiations are currently under way concerning some 
of these lines.
<P>
	The effect of our motion would be to ensure that railway 
companies negotiate in good faith with those interested in creating 
SLRs to run these branch lines. You will note that my trust in the 
national railways is rather limited. Had we had been able to have 
faith in them, this motion would have been totally unnecessary; the 
necessity for it arises out of our less than total confidence in them.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec has already done its part with 
respect to the Lachute branch line by forbidding any change in its 
land use. If CP lets the situation get any worse, however, the tracks 
that are in place will deteriorate and no longer be useable.
<P>
	It is therefore important for the CP to put this branch line up for 
sale promptly. It is also interesting to see, since Quebec does not of 
course possess the fullness of its powers that would have come with 
sovereignty, the concrete action taken by Minister of Municipal 
Affairs and Regional Development Guy Chevrette in announcing 
this past October 16 that the rail corridor linking Mirabel and 
Thurso would be declared a special intervention zone. Publication 
on October 11 in the Quebec official gazette of a draft decree to that 
effect had the immediate result of reserving the land covered by the 
decree for railway purposes and of forbidding any operations 
contrary to that use.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to praise Mr. Chevrette, the 
minister responsible for regional development, for he-unlike 
certain of our friends across the way, the Minister of Transport for 
Canada in particular-is well placed to appreciate the importance 
of a rail line, an airport or a seaport as a tool of regional 
development. I mentioned before in this House and it bears 
repeating that several businesses are interested in locating in 
outlying areas of Quebec or elsewhere and insist as a 
prerequisite-it is sometimes their principle condition-on there 
being a deep water port, an adequate highway and superhighway 
system, and a rail line if the material to be shipped is very heavy 
and cannot be  trucked. Merely looking at the state of our highways 
and superhighways is enough to again convince us how lax the 
federal government is, compared to the U.S., when it comes to 
truck load limits.
<P>
	As an illustration of the railway's worth as a tool of economic 
development, let me give the example of a cement plant project at 
Port Daniel in the Gaspe, in the riding where my spouse was born. 
This is a village of some 3,500 people, with a very high rate of 
unemployment-we are all aware of the state of the fishing 
industry in Gaspe-and the developers interested in the cement 
plant have set two conditions. First, there must be a deep water 
seaport, which the Port Daniel bay provides, and second the cement 
dust, or powder, or whatever it is called, must be shippable by boat 
or by railcar, thus making the presence of a rail line a condition for 
the deal. CN is considering abandoning the Gaspe rail line. 
Obviously, if there is no rail line, the 450 jobs that would be created 
by the cement plant will never see the light of day, because of the 
two conditions set by the developers.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, who once again reveals that 
he is totally disconnected from his riding. He should, perhaps, go 
there a bit more often and be a bit more active. He should be aware 
that this was another of the requirements set by the promoters.
<P>
	What is a special intervention zone, such as the one the 
Government of Quebec established for the Mirabel-Thurso 
railway corridor? Quebec's act respecting land use planning and 
development permits it to establish special intervention zones in 
order to resolve land development problems whose urgency or 
seriousness justifies such an intervention.
<P>
	This is the first time, since the law came into effect in 1980, that 
a minister has used such power to declare a special intervention 
zone by order. This decision stresses the importance the 
government accords to maintaining the rail link between Thurso 
and Mirabel to protect the economic development of the region.
<P>
	I would also like to stress how important and how timely this 
matter is. We could perhaps come up with a short list to justify just 
how relevant and current our motion is. We could quickly make a 
list of abandoned lines. We could name some in each province.
<P>
	In Ontario, for example, the CN Chatham line is scheduled to be 
abandoned on July 14, 1996. There is also the Newmarket line. In 
Quebec, there is the CN Chapais line, from Franquet to Chapais, 
97.34 miles long; the CN Taschereau line, from La Sarre to 
Cochrane, 82.42 miles; the CN Montmagny line, from Harlaka to 
Saint-Romuald; the CN Chandler line, from Sainte-Adélaïde to 
Gaspé-you can see with what I was saying about the cement plant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16215"> 16215 </A></B>
<P>
project earlier, how  relevant this motion becomes-; the CN Sorel 
line, from Sorel to Tracy; and the list goes on.
<P>
	In British Columbia, there is the CP Slocan line; in Manitoba, 
the CN line at Erwood; there are other lines in Ontario; the CN line 
from Foothills to Spur Turo; the CN Graham line; the CN 
Manitouwadge line; the CN Midland line, and the list goes on. All 
of this adds up to a total number-and I will try to find my figures 
here-of abandoned lines for the year representing, by region, 48 
per cent in Ontario, 19 per cent in Quebec, 23 per cent in the 
Maritimes and 10 per cent in the Prairies.
<P>
	This motion clearly illustrates the urgency of ensuring the 
availability of lines already approved for abandon, until new 
provisions in Bill C-101 apply, if they are passed as a whole, and 
thus of ensuring that the recent past is covered, rather than have the 
companies ruthlessly abandoning lines with the support of the 
National Transportation Agency, because, I repeat, it was almost 
automatic. I had an opportunity to experience the trauma of arguing 
before the National Transportation Agency, when I argued in 
favour of the CP Lachute line, and we saw which way the Agency 
invariably leans. It is unfortunate, but, I think the number of 
decisions the Agency has made in favour of the railways clearly 
illustrates what I am saying.
<P>
	In conclusion, what we are seeking with this motion, is to force 
the government to implement the provisions of Bill C-101 
immediately in order to preserve railway branch lines that are 
important for Quebec, until Quebec achieves political sovereignty, 
of course, which we expect to be very soon. Then, it will be able to 
exercise its powers to the fullest and will not have to go and beg 
before the National Transportation Agency of Canada for decisions 
to be made. As Jean Lesage said in 1960, we will be ``Maîtres chez 
nous'', and that is what Quebecers want.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak 
to the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans.
<P>
	His concerns reflect an appreciation for the approach advocated 
by the government toward rail line rationalization. The wording of 
his motion implies support for the line rationalization process set 
out in Bill C-101, the National Transportation Act.
<P>
	The government has noted the widespread concerns expressed 
by several interested parties regarding the existing rail line 
rationalization process. Deficiencies have been recognized and we 
believe a remedy has been proposed through Bill C-101.
<P>
	On October 2, 1995, Bill C-101 was referred to the Standing 
Committee on Transport. Committee hearings are currently under 
way.
<P>
	Canada's rail network is overbuilt. Eight-four per cent of CN and 
CP traffic is moved over one-third of the network. Traffic density is 
only 60 per cent of the average of the top seven major railroads in 
the United States. It has been estimated that some 50 per cent of 
current CN and CP trackage is surplus to their needs. However, 
many of these lines could be successfully operated by short lines or 
regional railways.
<P>
	Rationalization is under way but it is occurring slowing due to 
the complicated abandonment process contained in the National 
Transportation Act, 1987. There is widespread recognition that 
future rail financial viability will depend greatly on the railway's 
ability to accelerate plant rationalization and restructuring its 
networks.
<P>
	Bill C-101, the National Transportation Act, is intended to 
streamline and modernize transportation regulations. In particular 
it will lift the regulatory burden on rail to increase its 
competitiveness in an increasingly continental market.
<P>
	The bill contains provisions to streamline and shorten the current 
process for rail rationalization, making it commercially oriented, 
less adversarial and more conducive to the sale or lease of surplus 
rail lines to new operators. In conjunction with those provisions, 
the process for entry of smaller low cost rail carriers to operate in 
co-operation with CN and CP has been eased.
<P>
	As demonstrated by the U.S. experience following deregulation 
of its railway industry in 1980 with the passage of the Staggers Act, 
railway rationalization need not result in the abandonment of track. 
In the United States since 1980, although 34 per cent of the total 
rail route miles were trimmed from the rail line railroad networks, 
less than half that track was abandoned. Almost 30,000 miles of 
track were sold to successful short line railways and saved from 
abandonment.
<P>
	Today there are over 500 short line railway companies in the 
United States, of which 263 were created since 1980. In Canada 
only 10 new independent short lines were created since 1988.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that the line rationalization process set out in 
Bill C-101 is not as radical as that in the United States. However 
one of its main features is that it will provide opportunities for any 
interested party to acquire lines surplus to the needs of CN or CP 
for continued use as rail lines.
<P>
	In the event that there is a lack of interest in purchasing a 
particular line for rail purposes or a sale agreement is not reached, 
each level of government will have an opportunity to decide 
whether or not to acquire a line at net salvage value for public 
purposes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16216"> 16216 </A></B>
<P>
	Only after a railway company has gone through the process I 
have described and it has been unsuccessful in transferring the line 
to a new owner, whether it be a private company or a government, 
will it be able to abandon operations over the line and dispose of 
the land corridor and track assets. This will be a major 
improvement over the current process.
<P>
	The current process has caused some parties significant concern. 
For example, some provincial governments have expressed their 
wish to preserve an economic rail line, even though they have not 
had any traffic on them for many years, in the event that some day 
there may be a need for them. However, it has been normal practice 
when lines are put forward for abandonment that the provinces do 
not take positive action to find a new operator or acquire the lines 
themselves.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Under the National Transportation Act, if a rail line is not 
purchased by new operators for continued rail purposes the onus is 
placed on governments at all levels to come forward and express 
their interest in the rail corridors by financing the cost of their 
acquisition at net salvage value.
<P>
	Even if the government possessed the powers to comply with the 
action requested in the member's motion there would be no 
beneficial outcomes. Currently only five rail lines have been 
ordered abandoned by the agency. Three of them are scheduled for 
abandonment in 1995 and the remainder in 1996. Negotiations are 
under way for the purchase of one of the lines to be abandoned in 
1996 and no interest has been expressed by anyone in the purchase 
of the others.
<P>
	There is really nothing more to add except that on the strength of 
the motion I look forward to the hon. member's support of Bill 
C-101, the National Transportation Act. We should not delay the 
bill, as the hon. member has suggested, but should get on with, 
hopefully in the next two to three weeks, getting it through the 
House so that the process is improved and interested parties, be 
they short lines, governments or other interests, can take advantage 
of the opportunities presented by the new rationalization policy of 
the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I prepared to speak on the motion it seemed the hon. 
member from the Bloc must not have realized what was in Bill 
C-101, because it is exactly what he is asking for.
<P>
	However I listened to the content and the direction of his speech 
and obviously he was aware of it. It seems as though he went 
around in a circle and fell out the middle. I am not really sure what 
its purpose was unless it was simply to take another 20-minute 
opportunity to bash Canada and promote Quebec's separation.
<P>
	The member is looking for a particular provision that is 
contained in Bill C-101, specifically in clauses 143 and 145. On the 
one hand he says this is an urgent matter and that he wants to get it 
done very quickly. At one point he used the word retroactively. 
There are a couple of things with the Bloc Quebecois that I would 
like to do retroactively.
<P>
	There is a bit of a paradox here. While the hon. member stood to 
say this was an urgent matter that needed to be taken of quickly, 
Bill C-101 is scheduled to go for clause by clause consideration and 
to come back to the House for final passage the week following 
next week's break. He also said that Bill C-101 needed to be 
extended, that there has not been enough time and that they want to 
stretch it out.
<P>
	I do not know why he needs more time. We have heard dozens 
and dozens of witnesses, intervenors in committee. The hon. 
member, as the transport critic for the official opposition, is a 
member of the committee. Perhaps he needs more time because he 
has not been at many of the committee meetings. He showed up 
once or twice.
<P>
	I am the national transport critic for the national opposition party 
and I have been at those meetings. Any time I have not been able to 
attend my colleagues have been there in my support and in support 
of people across Canada. People can approach the government and 
make application to the government. They can also approach a 
creditable, viable opposition party when they do not happen to 
agree with what the government is doing or they want to ensure 
there is more pressure and support.
<P>
	The hon. member has shown up at committee meetings on 
occasion. I cite one of those occasions to show how his interest has 
nothing to do with national transportation or with the act. It only 
has to do with his own sovereignty, separatist agenda. Last week 
one or two witnesses had already spoken and then we heard from a 
group of representatives of the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities representing municipalities across the country, 
including in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	Toward the end of the intervenors' presentation the hon. member 
joined the committee for a brief period of time. As questions to the 
delegation opened he immediately tore into them, in a very vicious 
and embarrassing manner, because the brief was not presented in 
French as well as in English. Had he been there at the beginning he 
would have heard the explanation and apology for the fact that it 
was not available in French, that it would be available the 
following day, that the delegates had only completed the brief that 
morning, that they would have normally done this, that they always 
do but on this occasion they did not have the time to do it. It was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16217"> 16217 </A></B>
<P>
quite an embarrassing outburst from someone who claims to be a 
member of  the national official opposition. It may be official by 
name, but it is certainly not national.
<P>
	The hon. member stayed for the next presentation, which 
happened to be by a delegation from the province of Quebec, and 
then left before any further presentations were made.
<P>
	I do not know what his real bottom line is. If his real bottom line 
is to have the amendments made that have been outlined in his 
motion, they are contained in Bill C-101. He can come to the 
committee and aid us in completing that bill. I am sure 
amendments will be offered. I shudder to think what will come 
from his party, but I am sure amendments will be proposed. I can 
guarantee that there will be amendments proposed by the Reform 
Party. Amendments have been proposed by the Liberal Party. The 
bill is there to be examined. The committee will hear presentations 
and will react to the needs of the Canadian people.
<P>
	If the hon. member comes to the committee for the purpose of 
aiding it and seeing the bill completed, then he will get the very 
things he asked for this morning. However, if he comes to the 
committee to delay and extend the proceedings, after having not 
been to any of them, then he is fighting not against Bill C-101, not 
against the Liberal government, but against his own motion. That 
will be a very interesting aspect for him to take up.
<P>
	I would close by pointing out one item for clarification. From 
time to time, prior to the referendum and since the referendum, the 
Reform Party has raised the question of who rightly should be the 
official opposition in the House. By past precedent it falls to the 
Bloc Quebecois because it has a superior number of one. Some 
people, both those sitting opposite and some misinformed people in 
the media, have claimed that the Reform Party has done this by 
way of opportunism. It was not opportunism; it was our duty to the 
Canadian people and our obligation as members of the House to 
represent all of Canada on all bills, including national 
transportation bills, rather than the narrow views of one separatist 
group within one province.
<P>
	If the hon. member co-operates he will get his wish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the 
opportunity to speak to Motion No. 494 this morning. The motion 
is somewhat redundant, but at the same time it is important to 
speak to an issue that is fundamentally important to all Canadians; 
that is, the national transportation system and in particular what 
takes place when rail rationalization occurs in a country that 
continues to change, as it normally would in a federation. The 
needs of the public and the regions of the country are changing as 
well, so it is important to understand that transportation needs 
change.
<P>
	Under Bill C-101 there are a number of clauses that deal with rail 
abandonment. In particular, the bill deals with the ability to transfer 
rail. This is a unique change in direction by the Government of 
Canada. It is a welcome change.
<P>
	For those of us who have followed the transportation system and 
the abandonment of lines, under the NTA of 1987 the process that 
had to be followed for certain lines to be abandoned was that they 
first had to go to the NTA to prove that the particular line did not 
have commercial viability. Can you imagine how easy that would 
be to do if you first of all demarketed the line, which is what they 
did to start off with.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Most railway companies would not admit this, but when I had 
the opportunity to chair a special committee that went across the 
country to look at CN privatization we ran into some 
documentation that proved that in certain cases high ranking 
officials in CN sent out memos to their regional management, 
dictating and explaining to them how to demarket a particular 
branch line so they could go to the NTA and have them signify that 
it was not commercially viable and allow them to abandon it.
<P>
	Bill C-101, and the motion presented by the member this 
morning suggest a different way of doing business. That is, to 
acknowledge that transportation companies are no different from 
any other business in Canada and that you cannot force them to 
deal with what governments are dealing with every day, and that is 
the public interest, when in fact transportation companies are more 
interested in the bottom line. If you force them to try to maintain a 
particular line without compensating them in a manner that would 
help the company to be successful, they will go about it in one 
fashion or another to make sure those lines do get abandoned.
<P>
	Public policy and public interest are a very important portion of 
this bill. The critics who look at it are continuing to say that the 
government is getting out of the public interest business in 
transportation, but we are putting it where it belongs. Public 
interest is being taken out of the hands of every day companies in 
the transportation sector and put back in the hands of the 
politicians, to make decisions whether they want to subsidize 
certain lines in this country and whether for regional purposes they 
want to maintain certain branch lines. Those particular public 
interest initiatives and policies will have to be put back in the hands 
of cabinet and parliamentarians if we are going to have a private 
sector transportation system that works.
<P>
	In the member's presentation to the House this morning he 
talked about time frames. It is important to talk about time frames 
because there is a perception left by the member that the 
government is not serious about short line railways becoming a 
new phenomenon in Canada, that it is just lip service and more than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16218"> 16218 </A></B>
<P>
likely  most of these lines will be abandoned because of the time 
frame.
<P>
	I totally disagree with the member, as is unfortunately usually 
the case. The time frame for sale of a line starts with the unique 
process in the bill of forcing the railways, through clause 141, to 
put forward a three-year plan that is available to anyone, including 
ourselves as members of Parliament. Can you believe that? They 
are going to let us see something for a change. In that three-year 
plan they will signify whether they want to continue a particular 
line or whether they are interested in selling it or if they cannot sell 
it whether they will eventually abandon it.
<P>
	That three-year plan, which the governments have asked the 
railways to table on a regular basis and to revamp whenever 
necessary, will give members of Parliament and the public an 
opportunity to review just what lines are not in the best interest of a 
private corporation's business plan.
<P>
	The next process is the intent of any individual municipality, any 
regional government, whoever is interested in owning a particular 
line that the other railways do not want to own. They will have 60 
days to signify interest in that particular line. Within 60 days all 
they have to do is write a letter to CP or CN or any other 
corporation that owns a railway and say they would like to look at 
purchasing that particular piece of track. Then the 60 days will be 
allowed to elapse. When that elapses, they have five months after 
the 60 days to sit down and negotiate the sale of that line to that 
individual, that municipality, that provincial government.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	As can be seen, 60 days is two months and after that is the 
five-month negotiation process, which gives seven months 
minimum. Of course if the negotiation is a serious one and both 
parties are moving along in their negotiations, I am quite sure the 
railways would be interested in an extension, because it is not in a 
railways' interest to abandon a line if they do not have to. If they 
can get an agreement with an individual to run a line to bring a 
particular shipment of goods from a particular corporation at the 
end of the line, which is the reason the railway is there, and get it 
down to the other end, certainly they would do so.
<P>
	I want to emphasize this. In clauses 141 and then 143 to 145 it 
lays out very specifically how these rail lines would be transferred 
from one corporation to the next. In the final analysis, if nobody is 
interested, be it the Quebec government, a municipality in Quebec, 
or a private sector individual, why would you want to force a 
corporation like CP or CN to run a line that absolutely nobody else 
would like to run? Quite frankly, I think it would have a right to 
abandon that line.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that the real issue is not whether a piece of 
track is torn up, it is what is done with the right  of way. That is the 
real issue in the long term. One of the problems the U.S. is having 
with the Staggers Act and the changes in policy it made for line 
abandonment is that when it abandons a line it does not look after 
the right of way but sells it to the private sector. Depending on 
where that land is, it is chopped up for residential lots and things 
like that. That land cannot be re-acquired 20 years from now 
without expropriation.
<P>
	One of the main issues that is going to face us as we rationalize 
our railway system is what do we do with that right of way when we 
tear the track up and pull it out there. That is all salvage value, 
which is fine, but if we keep that particular right of way we can 
always put the track back at some future date. Most people do not 
see the significance of that right of way.
<P>
	In southern Ontario, for example, that is a major issue, because 
most of that land is privately owned outside of that right of way. 
Once the private sector gets hold of it we are never going to get it 
back. Governments, in particular provincial and municipal, have a 
very important role to play on that issue. It is not a federal 
government jurisdiction. I think it is a provincial jurisdiction. That 
is where the member should be focusing his attention. That is the 
mistake that was made in the Staggers Act. Some companies in the 
U.S. wish they had not sold the right of way but kept it for future 
use and land banked it.
<P>
	Powers in this place rest in a number of ways and in a number of 
fashions. The Minister of Transport in this bill still has the power to 
subsidize branch lines. He still has the power to subsidize certain 
rail lines. I will use just one rail line as an example, which is close 
to my home.
<P>
	There is a line that runs all the way up to Churchill. It is a very 
important line to northern Manitoba for regional development. The 
line could be abandoned tomorrow if it were dealt with in dollars 
and cents, because it does not make a profit. However, that line is 
important in the long term to the viability of northern Manitoba. I 
would suggest that if the people of northern Manitoba, the 
municipalities that exist there and the shippers on that line were 
really interested in regional development and if the federal 
government would enter into a co-operative arrangement with 
them, someone else who is interested in it could run that line. 
Maybe they can make it closer to being profitable than it is now. At 
the same time, it is very transparent that we are subsidizing a line 
that does not make money because of regional development needs.
<P>
	That is where the public interest should lie, in a transparent 
fashion. Whether we want to subsidize a losing operation is a 
different story. However, forcing railways to carry losing lines is 
not the way to go about the business of running a corporation, 
whether it be private or public. I differ with many people on that 
argument.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16219"> 16219 </A></B>
<P>
	I hope the member who has brought this motion forward, as 
has been mentioned by the Reform Party, spends less time trying 
to break up Canada and more time in the committee. He will 
realize there are some very good parts to this bill. At the same 
time if he supports it he will find there are some good 
entrepreneurs in Quebec who would love to run a railway and who 
could run it a lot better than CN or CP ever did.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to my hon. colleague from Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke express his views on the official opposition. He 
believes it would be much more interesting if the Reform Party 
formed the official opposition in this debate about railways. I can 
assure that I, for one, will stick to the matter under consideration.
<P>
	The matter at issue is that the National Transport Agency has 
authorized CP and CN to abandon a number of sections on some 
important rail lines, in particular the Lachute, Chapais and central 
Quebec lines.
<P>
	These abandonments will certainly have a major, serious impact 
on regional development. For example, I will only talk about the 
Lachute line because my colleague from Argenteuil and myself 
tabled a brief asking that this line not be abandoned. The matter at 
issue is the abandonment of part of this line-that is, the central 
part and not the start or the end. Talk about a rational decision: they 
leave the start and end of the line but remove the middle.
<P>
	To show you just how lightly the agency gave this authorization, 
I will mention the fact that, in concluding that the line was not 
profitable, the commissioners simply relied on the argument that 
the railway had not made enough money over the past three years, 
when everyone knows that we were in a recession and that these 
three years therefore did not reflect the railway's real earning 
potential.
<P>
	During these hearings, it was conclusively proven that CP had 
made no effort to develop or even keep its clients. On the contrary, 
it seemed to try to drive them away.
<P>
	It got to the point that the Quebec Ministry of Transportation, 
using its urbanization powers, had to issue an order to at least 
prevent the dismantling of the Lachute line. The ministry cannot 
oppose the end of operations, but it can prevent the line from being 
dismantled.
<P>
	This brings me to the topic of Bill C-101, on which we will vote 
very soon and to which my colleague from 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans and myself will propose 
amendments.
<P>
	True, Bill C-101 will require CP and CN to sell the branch lines 
they abandon. However, it is clear that the government has a new 
rail policy in that, first, there will no longer be any public hearings 
and, second, the National Transportation Agency, whose name and 
role will change, will no longer have any authorization to give.
<P>
	In other words, the government has just about set aside the 
notion of public service in favour of a strictly for-profit mentality. I 
think that this is another example of the government's general 
tendency to disregard the public interest and think like an 
accountant rather than an entrepreneur. One would have expected a 
responsible government to encourage railway companies to 
contribute to regional development, thus spurring their own 
development and bringing in tax revenues for the government, 
instead of helping them sell off the branch lines they are not 
interested in.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, as my colleague pointed out, I think that only 
Quebec sovereignty will result in making the public interest a 
priority in government decisions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans wants the 
government to require the railway companies to put lines that have 
been ordered abandoned up for sale.
<P>
	I contend the lines have already been advertised as available for 
sale. The fact they have been subjected to the long abandonment 
process which is now in place should be seen as a clear indication 
the railways do not want them.
<P>
	Currently there are only five line segments that fall into the 
category defined by the member's motion. The CP Cornwall 
subdivision from Soulanges, Quebec to Cornwall, Ontario was 
approved by the National Transportation Agency for abandonment 
on December 27 of this year.
<P>
	The CP Chalk River subdivision from Smiths Falls to Pembroke 
is scheduled for abandonment on November 19 next, as are the CP 
Chalk River and North Bay subdivisions from Petawawa to 
Mattawa, Ontario. A segment of the CN Chatham subdivision 
between Bloomfield and Tucumseh, Ontario is to be abandoned on 
July 14, 1996. Finally, the agency has ordered CN to abandon the 
segment of the Newmarket subdivision between Barry and 
Longford, Ontario on September 21 next year.
<P>
	It should be noted that VIA has already expressed interest in 
acquiring the Chatham subdivision from CN, and the Ontario 
government has held and is holding discussions with CN regarding 
the Newmarket subdivision.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16220"> 16220 </A></B>
<P>
	As is clear even from the wording of the motion, Parliament 
has delegated the responsibility for regulating rail line 
abandonments and conveyance to the National Transportation 
Agency in accordance with the provisions of the National 
Transportation Act, 1987. Briefly, the agency's powers under the 
act extend to the receiving and processing of abandonment 
applications. The criteria for reaching an abandonment decision 
are set out in the act. Any line abandonment application results 
in an abandonment order if there is no opposition to that 
abandonment.
<P>
	However, if there is opposition expressed by anyone, the agency 
must publish the actual losses incurred from the operation of the 
line. Based on traffic and financial information provided by the 
railways and evidence submitted by intervenors in writing or at 
public hearings, it must make a determination as to whether 
operation of the line is economic or uneconomic.
<P>
	If the agency finds the line is economic, the application is 
dismissed. Where the agency finds the line is uneconomic it is then 
required to make a further determination as to whether there is any 
reasonable probability that it could become economic in the 
foreseeable future. If not, the agency must order abandonment. If 
yes, the agency must order continuation of operations over the line 
if it is in the public interest.
<P>
	For lines ordered continued in the public interest, the agency is 
required to reconsider the abandonment application at least once 
every three years. The agency is given some discretion in fixing 
abandonment dates to not less that 30 days or not more than one 
year after the date of an abandonment order. If VIA operates over 
the line the abandonment date is fixed at one year after the date of 
the order.
<P>
	The governor in council has powers under the abandonment 
provisions to postpone the date of abandonment if certain criteria 
can be satisfied. This is in addition to powers accorded under 
section 64, whereby the governor in council can rescind or vary any 
agency order, decision, rule or regulation.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	As members may have noticed neither the agency, the minister 
nor the governor in council has power to issue orders to the 
railways with respect to what properties they should put up for sale 
and when they should do so. It has always been possible for other 
governments, as my colleague from Rainy River said, to take an 
active role in promoting the sale of a line, or even to purchase the 
line itself.
<P>
	No other business sector or mode of transportation is subject to 
such strict regulation of exit as has been imposed on the railway 
industry. With the enactment of the Canada Transportation Act, the 
government hopes to place the responsibility for rail rationalization 
where it belongs, with the railway companies.
<P>
	The decision to withdraw from a certain segment of business is a 
commercial decision and does not justify government intervention. 
For example, if a trucking firm decides it no longer wants to serve a 
particular city because it is losing money, it simply stops going 
there. Why should a railway company not have the same freedom? 
If a grocery chain decides it wants to close a store at a particular 
location and possibly open one at a more profitable location, the 
government does not interfere. Why should that same government 
prevent a railway company from doing the same thing? This 
government does not exist to tell competing businesses such as 
transportation companies how to conduct their business.
<P>
	It is clear there is no overriding reason why the government 
cannot comply with the member's Motion 494. The member will 
find that the advanced publicity regarding railway rationalization 
plans required under the Canada Transportation Act fulfils the 
general intent of his motion.
<P>
	I appreciate the member's interest in this important topic. We are 
at a stage where we are moving from one railway regime to 
another. There are difficulties inevitably involved with that 
transition.
<P>
	The decisions made are very important indeed. To that extent I 
greatly appreciate the member's interest. However, I argue that his 
concerns are well met under the existing legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, as no other hon. member wishes 
to speak, I recognize the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans on debate. There are two or 
three minutes remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to use the time 
remaining in the debate on this motion, pursuant to our Standing 
Orders.
<P>
	I would like to correct something my hon. colleague from 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke, who sits with me on the Standing 
Committee on Transport, said in his remarks.
<P>
	He indicated earlier, in summarizing the motion to some extent, 
that the usefulness of such a motion is unclear, since Bill C-101 
will do what the hon. member is asking for. I think he should have 
read the motion and listened to what was being said. He would have 
realized that the motion in question is to ensure-not in a distant 
future; Bill C-101 has not yet been passed-that railways lines 
recently slated for abandonment will be covered by the provisions 
contained in Bill C-101, once passed. Again, my colleague from 
Kootenay misconstrued my meaning.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16221"> 16221 </A></B>
<P>
	Also, the hon. member of the Reform Party complained again 
about his party not having become the official opposition yet. I 
would like to inform the Reformers, through you, that if the Bloc 
Quebecois is the official opposition, it is neither to please the 
Liberal Party, nor to annoy the Reform Party. British 
parliamentary tradition has it that the largest minority group in 
the House of Commons forms the official opposition. We never 
asked to be the official opposition. It is just the way it is and shall 
continue to be, since we have decided to continue sitting in this 
Parliament to unmask the Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	A common thread goes through the whole federal transportation 
reform: the government intends to shift infrastructure costs onto 
municipalities, RCMs or the Quebec government, while at the 
same time maintaining control and keeping corresponding 
revenues. In fact, these so-called improved management objectives 
hide a sucker's deal.
<P>
	The defence of Quebec's interests is no longer tied exclusively to 
fruitless objections or demonstration too often ignored. It is now 
predicated on Quebecers taking the transportation issue into their 
own hands to ensure their future and the future of Quebec 
businesses and regions whose development depends on 
transportation.
<P>
	Only by becoming sovereign will we be able to put in place an 
integrated transportation policy, in which our local and public 
sector partners will be the first to gain from a unified transportation 
role within Quebec, combined with a partnership with our 
Canadian neighbours and NAFTA allies.
<P>
	We, members of the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, will 
keep on repeating this as long as it takes in this House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the consideration 
of Private Members' Business has now expired. Pursuant to 
Standing Order 96(1), this item is dropped from the Order Paper.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHEALTHACT">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 2 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-95, an act to establish the Department of Health 
and to amend and repeal certain acts, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of Bill C-95, legislation 
which will establish the Department of Health.
<P>
	Two weeks ago I spoke on another piece of legislation. I 
reminded the House and particularly our friends from Quebec of 
the desire of my constituents for a united and strong Canada. With 
the end of the referendum that desire still continues. The people of 
Guelph-Wellington, all crusaders for Canada will always support 
Canada first. We have a strong attachment to this great country. We 
celebrate the privilege of being Canadian and we thank the people 
of Quebec for saying no to separation.
<P>
	Over the past several weeks Canadians have heard much of the 
word change. We have before us a bill which changes the name of 
the Department of Health. That, as was said by the hon. Minister of 
Health, is the simplest part of this legislation. Within the bill there 
is a new focus. Bill C-95 contains a new vision of the future that 
promises to make improvements in what is already the best 
national health system in the world.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington want to give a clear message 
to Parliament. We want our health system preserved. We reject 
those who want to dismantle what we have built in favour of a 
system that judges patients on how much money they have rather 
than how sick they are.
<P>
	We recognize the need to respond to areas of concern, but we 
will not compromise the protection that is given to each of us by 
the Canada Health Act. This act declares that the health aspects of 
social well-being are the responsibility of the Department of 
Health.
<P>
	We all know that we were elected to assist the well-being of our 
constituents and also of every single Canadian. It is the obligation 
of the government in every department and by every single 
member of the House to ensure the well-being of the people who 
have entrusted us with all of their confidence. The people of 
Guelph-Wellington have elected me to be a member of a 
government that is tempered with compassion, motivated by care 
and strengthened through its ability to make Canada a better place 
to live.
<P>
	Our health care system is one of the values which makes Canada 
the best place in the world in which to live. Whether Canadians 
reside in Guelph, Ontario, Drummondville, Quebec, or St. John's, 
Newfoundland, they know they can depend on a federal 
government that is determined to protect the fabric of their health 
care system.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	This legislation clearly acknowledges the responsibility of the 
Department of Health to care for the social well-being of my 
constituents and the people of every single region throughout 
Canada. Through this legislation we are acknowledging that there 
is more to health than health care. Health means the complete state 
of physical, mental and social well-being.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington are fortunate to have quality 
health care providers who work for the  benefit of our community. 
Organizations like the Victorian Order of Nurses, Homewood 
Health Centre, St. John Ambulance Association and the Welling-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16222"> 16222 </A></B>
<P>
ton-Dufferin-Guelph Health Unit work together to provide 
assistance, plan health services, give information and support the 
people of my community.
<P>
	While Guelph-Wellington welcomes change, our people do not 
want an end to the government's commitment to the long tradition 
of ensuring health protection for every single Canadian. Ten years 
ago the Canada Health Act was debated and passed without any 
member voting against it in this House. Those were the days when 
the opposition parties joined the government in support of every 
Canadian regardless of their income.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act contains five principles: public 
administration; comprehensiveness; universality; portability; and 
accessibility. This act was the result of the efforts of strong 
ministers of health including Hon. Allan MacEachen; the father of 
the current Minister of Finance, Hon. Paul Martin Sr.; Hon. Marc 
Lalonde; and Hon. Monique Bégin. They were supported by 
Canadians in their quest for a health care system that offers care 
and protection. They were supported by opposition members who 
defended the rights of all Canadians, Canadians who deserve 
members of Parliament who wish to preserve our health care 
system rather than to destroy it.
<P>
	I mentioned organizations that work in my community to 
preserve quality health care. These are joined by hundreds of 
individuals working alone or through various agencies in building a 
growing awareness of the importance of nutrition, stress 
management, physical fitness, safety in the workplace, and the 
environment.
<P>
	We are fortunate in Guelph-Wellington because on top of 
quality care institutions like the Guelph General Hospital and St. 
Joseph's Hospital and Home, there are people who care. These 
people deal not only with cures but with prevention. They realize 
that health prevention is the real health care revolution in this 
country.
<P>
	My own family has been blessed with family doctors like Allan 
Simpson who was there when my children were born and has cared 
for them ever since. Anne Simpson, his wife, has also been a nurse 
and caregiver in our community. Without people such as them our 
health care system would not be the best in the world.
<P>
	Our government is determined to save, sustain and improve 
Canada's health care system. We will continue to fight against 
those who fail to recognize that health care weaves the fabric of our 
very nation.
<P>
	As part of the promises that we have kept since our election, the 
Prime Minister has initiated the National Forum on Health and has 
taken a real leadership role in finding solutions to the difficult 
questions facing all of us. The Prime Minister and Minister of 
Health are to be congratulated for this effort.
<P>
	The National Forum on Health is asking: Are we getting the best 
results from our expenditures? Should we be spending more in 
some areas and less in other areas? Are we taking full advantage of 
new opportunities in the health field? How can we learn from 
experiences within Canada and from other countries?
<P>
	These are important questions which deserve our time and our 
consideration. Canadians must dialogue about what our health 
system should look like over the longer term. We must develop a 
vision of the future. When I discussed priorities for federal 
spending with my constituents prior to the last federal budget, they 
told me that health care must remain a priority in Canada. In fact 
most of the people in Guelph-Wellington who responded to a 
questionnaire that I sent out clearly stated that health care should 
not be cut in any way. They are concerned about abuses. They are 
anxious to find solutions to what is wrong with our health care 
system but they absolutely reject the Reform Party's vision for 
health care in our community.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	As in everything else we do, we want to work on a solution that 
will make our country better. We cannot accept the doom and 
gloom that is so often embraced by the third party in this House. 
We know there are challenges to making these improvements, but 
the people of Guelph-Wellington welcome these challenges 
because we want to make our health care system work for our 
children and our grandchildren.
<P>
	I am pleased that one of the tasks of the national forum is to 
document case histories of health care approaches that have 
succeeded in improving the health of the population. I look forward 
to the policy recommendations that will be made in this area. The 
forum has taken the Guelph-Wellington approach to problems: 
build on successes, learn from mistakes and identify priorities.
<P>
	Health is more than health care. There are many aspects of life 
and lifestyle that go toward making people healthy. As a 
government we must continue to rebuild our society to make it 
healthier. How can we do this? We can provide employment to 
those unemployed, give hope to Canadians who feel a sense of 
abandonment. We can provide a strong social support network for 
our Canadian family. We can build a better education system, find 
more agreeable working conditions for our workers, free the 
environment from pollutants and rid ourselves from unsafe 
products that contribute to an unhealthy environment. Health care 
means all facets of our society.
<P>
	Each Canadian is also responsible for his or her own well-being. 
Personal health practices which include a positive outlook help 
reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer. I have 
encouraged my constituents to work with the many organizations in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16223"> 16223 </A></B>
<P>
Guelph and Wellington county that promote, educate, assist and 
support my constituents who suffer from epilepsy,  cancer, the 
effects of a stroke, and cystic fibrosis to name but a few. In 
Guelph-Wellington we believe that by supporting each other we 
can build a better community and a better Canada.
<P>
	The government continues to look at positive ways to improve 
the health care of our country. I wish to take a few seconds to speak 
about the prenatal nutrition program which was promised in the red 
book and implemented by Health Canada in July 1994.
<P>
	We know that prenatal and childhood health experiences will 
affect us throughout our lives. Low weight at birth is a problem for 
the growing child and in some cases contributes to ill health in 
adults and sometimes premature death. There is also increasing 
evidence that the way children are cared for at an early age 
influences their coping skills and health for the rest of their lives. 
We also know that it is possible to reverse some of the ill effects 
and positively influence later health and well-being by intervening 
with supplementary and enrichment programs at critical stages in 
the development of children and youth.
<P>
	The prenatal nutrition program is providing $66.4 million over 
four years to set up or expand prenatal nutrition programs for low 
income expectant mothers. This is an example of a positive 
contribution of government for the well-being of our future. As a 
mother of three, I know how precious children are. I worked with 
many children through my efforts at the Wellington County Board 
of Education. Preventive health, positive lifestyle promotion and 
health education are going to contribute to bettering the health of 
our children and saving valuable health care dollars in the future.
<P>
	Our health care system is probably regarded as one of the finest 
in the world and this is no exaggeration. At a time when Canadians 
are reflecting on what makes us so great, we need only to look at 
our health care system as an example of a country that truly works.
<P>
	True, there are ways that we can improve our health care system. 
It is not perfect, but it works and it works well. It ensures that the 
poorest of our citizens receive help when they are most in need. It 
ensures that our seniors need not sell their homes in the event of a 
lengthy illness. More important, it ensures that the people of 
Guelph-Wellington and those in all parts of Canada can 
concentrate on getting better when they are sick, free from the 
worry of who will pay for their health care. That is the kind of 
protection needed and wanted by a vast majority of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Many Canadians deserve credit for our health care system. 
Those who in the past had a vision of caring led the way. Volunteers 
throughout communities such as Guelph-Wellington ensure that 
people are cared for and educated about prevention programs. 
Health care professionals have the responsibility for providing care  
which has become extremely complex and extremely demanding.
<P>
	Advancements in health care have meant an explosion of 
medical knowledge and information involving all kinds of 
advances in equipment and procedures. The front line workers are 
there first to care for the sick and their families. They feed us, give 
us medicine and often are there to care for us when we die.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to pay tribute to the 
dedicated physicians, surgeons, nurses, attendants, paramedics, 
researchers and administrators who, along with many associates, 
have built for Canadians a health care system which is the envy of 
the world.
<P>
	I saw them care for my mother and I see them in their dedicated 
work when I visit hospitals and nursing homes throughout 
Guelph-Wellington. This past week they cared for my 
father-in-law who was struck down with a heart attack. They are 
wonderful people and we are lucky to have them.
<P>
	We have a good health care system. We are facing new realities 
and we are confronted by old problems but I am confident that the 
foundations are sound. I know the people of Guelph-Wellington 
support legislation which promotes the well-being of every 
Canadian. I know they do not want a society in which the poor, the 
elderly and those less fortunate cannot get quality health care.
<P>
	We in Guelph-Wellington are proud of Canada. We are proud 
of our health care system. There are those in the House who may 
wish to erode the principles of medicare, but in 
Guelph-Wellington we refuse to put a price on our health care 
system. To do so is to ignore our past and to let down our future. 
We accept the challenges ahead. We want to build on the principles 
of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Later this month I will meet with members of the Wellington 
County Medical Society, as I meet with concerned constituents 
every week who have asked me to protect their health care system. 
I will tell the members of the society we stand with them and we 
will not abandon health care in Canada. This is why this legislation 
needs our support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Wellington told us about the goodwill gestures made 
by her constituents towards Quebec. I hope that she and her 
constituents are sincere. However, the fact is that, according to a 
recent poll, only 30 per cent of Canadians outside Quebec agree 
that constitutional changes should be made, while two thirds of 
Quebecers are in favour of such changes. Today's reality is very 
different from the show of love witnessed before the referendum.
<P>
	My question relates to the hon. member's comments to the effect 
that we must preserve Canada's health care  system. How will we 
preserve that system, given that the federal government has been 
cutting for years in the transfers to the provinces, and that these 
cuts will likely be even greater following the next federal budget? 
How does the hon. member reconcile the preservation of Canada's 
health care system with the drastic cuts being made by the federal 
government?

<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will address the first 
comment by my colleague. When I spoke we did make eye contact. 
He asked if I was sincere about Quebec's staying in Canada. I have 
never been more sincere about anything in my life.
<P>
	There are many Guelph-Wellington residents who want 
Quebec to stay in Canada. They joined in the rally. They signed a 
petition last year stating that fact. They care. They know that united 
we stand and divided we do fall. We truly do want Quebec as a part 
of Canada. We will work with Quebec and all provinces to make 
everything we do stronger and better.
<P>
	This brings me to the health care issue we were talking about 
earlier. The question my hon. colleague put to me is about 
maintenance if transfer payments decrease. As we know, in this 
time of fiscal restraint all money is tight. We all have deficits, 
including provinces like Quebec which has a huge deficit. We all 
know that. We know we have to be protectors of health care. I 
believe Bloc members are protectors of health care. I also believe 
they know that in order to protect it, being a part of Canada will 
give them a much better opportunity. It will be preserved and it will 
be much stronger.
<P>
	When we talk about preserving health care, we have to look at 
new methods. We have to look at other countries. They do some 
things well. We also know, as the Prime Minister has stated many 
times, our health care is the envy of the world.
<P>
	Last week I met with Ralph Nader from the United States. He 
told us horrific stories about what is going on there with the health 
care system. He warned us to be very careful and ever vigilant not 
to move to the right, not to move with the Reform and look at a two 
tiered system. He warned us that would be the end of our health 
care system.
<P>
	I call on all members in the House to stand with us and with the 
health care professionals who have done a wonderful job in our 
communities to preserve our health care.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
ask the hon. member to look at the medicare system or the health 
insurance program and one of the five principles, accessibility.
<P>
	Accessibility tends to conjure a cost factor, that everyone is 
equal from a cost point of view. However, I  would like to bring up 
two or three other points. The first is transportation, those in the 
north getting to the services. If anyone breaks a leg in the city, he or 
she calls an ambulance and goes to the hospital. However, the same 
kind of accessibility is not that readily available in the north. That 
is one aspect of accessibility.
<P>
	The second is waiting lists. We are looking at health from a 
preventive point of view, a stitch in time saves nine kind of thing, 
but we have horrendous waiting lists. It deters accessibility if one 
has to wait to have a lump examined or whatever, something along 
that line.
<P>
	The third point is accessibility of services. Should we provide all 
services to all people in all areas? We can get into hospital debates 
of whether there should be heart surgery in every hospital, every 
community hospital, or kidney machines, these kinds of things 
which are not economically feasible.
<P>
	Therefore from the accessibility point of view, which everyone 
tends to zero in on, cost and the availability of the individual's 
economic position for accessibility, could you address the other 
three or four points?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sure the member meant to say 
``would the member address the issues''.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased about the three 
points my hon. colleague brought up. People in the north not being 
able to access services as quickly is an important factor. We have to 
always be vigilant on that in our decision making. We should not 
look only at the cities or the large centres, which is convenient and 
easier. We must always be thinking about our constituents in the far 
north or the far south, wherever that may be.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	The issue of waiting lists is also an absolutely valid point. 
Wherever we can we have to be constantly monitoring, constantly 
rechecking, constantly evaluating. What can we do better? I 
support the hon. member in bringing up these things because only 
through evaluating what we do now can we get better.
<P>
	Regarding services in every hospital, I do not know that every 
service has to be available in every hospital. There are centres with 
several hospitals. From an economical point of view we may have 
to look at certain services in one hospital and others located in a 
hospital five kilometres away, perhaps heart and kidney machines 
or whatever.
<P>
	I am in full concurrence with the three points the member 
brought up. Again I call on every member in the Chamber to keep 
looking at the points my colleague brought up. How do we make it 
better? How do we improve our health care? How do we save lives? 
How do we make a better quality of life in Canada?
<P>
	We will do that not simply by feeding money into the system but 
by priorizing and by being very careful to hone our knowledge, to 
talk to other countries, doctors,  nurses and caregivers who can tell 
us what we should be doing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16225"> 16225 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to make a call to all members that we need universal 
health care. We cannot start to erode this. I firmly believe in this 
principle.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, beyond 
the nice rhetoric on Canada's health care system, the real purpose 
of this bill is to confirm and expand the self-proclaimed federal 
mandate in the health sector, a sector which clearly falls under 
provincial jurisdiction and which is clearly Quebec's 
responsibility.
<P>
	I want to draw your attention to the amendments, the additions to 
that act. Paragraph 4(2)(<I>a</I>) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Without restricting the generality of subsection (1), the Minister's 
powers, duties and functions relating to health include the following matters:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) the promotion and preservation of the physical, mental and social 
well-being of the people of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Paragraph 4(2)(<I>b</I>), which was not there before, reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) the protection of the people of Canada against risks to health and the 
spreading of diseases;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are talking about an expanded mandate regarding prevention. 
Incidentally, the former act included a section on the protection of 
the social well-being. That provision is no longer there. It has 
probably become a responsibility of the Minister for Human 
Resources Development, who will call it something else.
<P>
	There is a federal will to take over the provinces' 
responsibilities-I will refer to Quebec throughout my speech; the 
other provinces can use a different approach if they wish-in fields 
which not only clearly fall under provincial jurisdiction-we will 
not discuss jurisdiction for the sake of jurisdiction-but in which 
only Quebec can work efficiently, because Quebec alone can 
implement an integrated policy.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	As for amendment (b)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>b) the protection of the people of Canada against risks and the spreading of 
diseases;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I find that this is evidence of incredible gall on the part of the 
government after the disaster-the word is not even strong 
enough-the horror of the tainted blood problem. There was a hue 
and a cry in that connection to identify those who were to blame for 
the tainted blood, and everybody seemed to be responsible except 
the department. And now this is the responsibility we want to 
broaden here to include risks to health.
<P>
	Risks to health are so closely linked to general conditions of 
poverty, sanitation, access to healthy accommodation, education, 
life, organization of life that one wonders how, in what appears 
otherwise to be merely a technical bill, the department's mandate 
could be made that broad.
<P>
	Either there is a need felt in the federal government, in Canada, 
to assign itself responsibilities it is not able to meet because they 
affect people, or there is an inability to admit that the exercise of 
those responsibilities falling strictly within federal jurisdiction has 
been a lamentable failure. And I am not referring only to the 
budget. I could also address transportation policies, 
communications policies, even, recently, international policies 
with the disgraceful events surrounding the visit of the Chinese 
Premier.
<P>
	It is, nevertheless, dangerous to lead citizens to believe that one 
is responsible for preventing risks to health when, in reality, one 
does not and cannot have the means to do so. To really have the 
means would require taking over the provinces' place. So, far from 
putting an end to duplication and overlap, the bill is typical of the 
inefficiency that exists in areas where there is the most crying need 
at this time, when resources are increasingly scarce.
<P>
	In reality, it is far more important to ask who is responsible than 
to ask who is competent, for this reaches people more directly. 
When talk is of competency, in reality the term that ought to be 
used is responsibility.
<P>
	Quebec is the one with responsibility, but not with the means 
because, as the Minister of Health has pointed out, since 1982-83, 
eight billion dollars have been cut from health alone, money which 
represented firm commitments to supposedly allow establishment 
of the health and social services system in Quebec at a time 
when-not because money was any more plentiful in Ottawa than 
in Quebec-there was an extraordinary central concentration of tax 
dollars. The original reason for this had been financing the Second 
World War, and that concentration suited to a T all of the senior 
public servants and politicians who had worked to get decisions on 
economic and social policies centred in Ottawa, with the provinces 
only as subcontractors.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	This policy was rejected unanimously in Quebec, by all parties. 
The money that was collected and is still being collected, 
something which Duplessis, yes Duplessis, tried to get around 
when he decided Quebec would have its own tax collection system, 
the federal government used this money so it could determine the 
direction, development and control of economic and social 
policies, instead of the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	This bill confirms clearly and unreservedly the government's 
policy of overlap and duplication and the irresponsibility we saw in 
the tainted blood scandal, for instance.
<P>
	The federal government takes credit for introducing the health 
care system, as though it would never have happened otherwise. I 
will not get into the history of this  policy which, although its 
origins go back to Saskatchewan, became a Canadian policy. A 
respected author on the subject, Thomas Duperré, said in 1987 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16226"> 16226 </A></B>
<P>
before the commission of inquiry on health and social services in 
Quebec that establishing federal programs merely shifted to the 
federal level a debate that had already started at the provincial level 
and would have led to the same results over the same period of 
time, give or take a few months or a few years.
<P>
	Quebec Health Minister Jean Rochon is, as everyone knows, an 
expert on these issues. He was involved in the work of the 
Castonguay-Neveu Commission and later chaired the commission 
that started its sittings in 1985 and developed the policies of both 
the previous and present government. So this is not a partisan 
position, anything but. According to Mr. Rochon, the Canadian 
health system is a myth. The truth is, we had developed a health 
and social services system, despite the fact that the federal 
government centralized its control over resources while ignoring 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction in this area as conferred under the 
constitution of the Canadian confederation.
<P>
	The minister went on to quote the Quebec Minister of Social 
Affairs and Welfare René Lévesque. At the federal-provincial 
conference on poverty in 1965, Lévesque, federalist minister in a 
Liberal government in Quebec, said that it had become imperative 
to establish a genuine economic and social policy. This policy 
should be integrated, flexible in its mechanisms and include a 
social security system centred on the family and based on the right 
to assistance on the basis of need.
<P>
	The same sentence, with few changes, could be used to express 
the same urgency voiced by sovereignists quite recently.Mr. Lévesque went on to say that for the sake of efficiency and on 
constitutional grounds, the Quebec government alone could and 
should, within its own territory, design and implement such a 
policy. Quebec could not let the Government of Canada assume 
this responsibility. Quebec did not, however, exclude 
interprovincial co-operation and mutual consultation.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	He also said that the social and economic development policy 
they had formulated would create an integrated social policy, 
regional development policy, manpower policy, health policy, 
housing policy and job training policy.
<P>
	Fourth, the federalist minister said that the general policy, while 
he did not necessarily condemn it, did not necessarily correspond, 
in terms of its spirit and terms of application, to one the 
Government of Canada might opt for. The people of Quebec would 
enjoy at least as many if not more benefits than other Canadians 
might.
<P>
	The central government's repeated interference, expanding into 
preventive medicine, is an affront to the intelligence of the history 
of the past 30 years. It is  compromising, in a way-and here I am 
talking of Canada outside Quebec-and it compromises, it seems 
to me, a now necessary reorganization. Instead of decentralizing, 
the federal government is busy reaffirming ever more resoundingly 
its responsibility for all areas of economic and social development. 
Through cuts and the transfer of the deficit, it is, moreover, 
usurping the ability of the poorest provinces, at least, to replace 
them.
<P>
	This is a historic moment in the history of Quebec and of 
Canada. It is not without some emotion that we view these 
bills-we will be debating Bill C-96 this afternoon or tomorrow 
and the human resources investment fund and unemployment in the 
days and weeks to come-that we note that the thinking behind all 
these bills is one of increasing centralization.
<P>
	It is an approach, as the Canada social transfer demonstrated in 
the budget, whereby the only thing transferred to Quebec is the 
deficit. We are moved by the fact of having to say that the central 
government wants to take over protecting the public against health 
risks, when we know the extent to which poverty affects health 
significantly. We know that centralized and centralizing policies 
are not going to provide us in Quebec with the tools we need to 
fight unemployment, poverty and with poor health at the more 
disadvantaged levels of society.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	We will continue to express the thoughts of the large majority of 
our fellow Quebecers. Even those who voted no, know that, 
through their municipal governments, their social groups and their 
Government of Quebec, closest to them, and the most effective 
integrator, they will not get to heaven, but at least they will have the 
assurance that every effort was made to provide equality for all in 
Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
intently to the comments of the member for Mercier, as I always 
do. I am always very interested in her deep understanding of social 
issues.
<P>
	As I listened to her speech, it ran across my mind what she was 
talking about were communicable diseases. I wondered whether 
she thought diseases like AIDS or other diseases knew national 
boundaries. Are specific diseases that could possibly occur in 
Quebec unique to the borders or indigenous to the borders of 
Quebec, or are they diseases that can occur throughout the country 
and indeed throughout the world?
<P>
	When we are talking about research in diseases and 
communicable diseases it seems to me that as a country we need to 
consolidate our work in these areas to try to find solutions rather 
than be fragmented and have separate research areas throughout the 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16227"> 16227 </A></B>
<P>
	Next is the whole aspect of governments being closer to the 
people. We have talked a lot in the House about the issue. I have 
often wondered if it is psychological talk. We look at a map and 
we see Ottawa and we see Quebec City. However, what does it 
mean to someone in Chicoutimi, Arvida or other places in Quebec 
to get government services closer to the people?
<P>
	I know in my province, for instance in the area of education, we 
say that it should be close to the people. The reality is our education 
system is run out of Toronto. It is not any closer to the people than 
if it were in Ottawa. I suspect this is true in Quebec as well. The 
actual government getting into the lives of people on the streets of 
those communities is not any more well developed from Quebec 
City than it is from Ottawa.
<P>
	An issue that really concerns me about Quebec and its economy 
is the over-preponderance of provincial debt in that province. Also 
there is the preponderance of the province of Quebec to borrow, 
incidentally outside its borders. Some 54 per cent of Quebec's debt 
is funded outside Canada with foreigners. The referendum actually 
required the Government of Quebec to borrow $35 million from 
foreigners to ask its people if they wanted to be an independent 
country. It seems a little absurd, quite frankly.
<P>
	Could the member address some of these issues but mainly the 
whole issue about how we are to get government closer to the 
people? The federal government, for instance, pays old pension 
cheques and the Canada pension plan. It deals directly with people. 
The Canadian employment services are right in our communities. 
They are the federal government but they are not in Ottawa. They 
are right in our communities and are dealing with community 
problems. I ask her whether some of this stuff is psychological.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Mercier will have 
as much time to answer as her colleague had to put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> I have more time, Mr. Speaker? I will be brief, 
because the hon. member took a lot up of time asking his question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I said that the hon. member would have as 
much time as the member who asked the question.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I mentioned health risks, and AIDS 
is not the only one. But for the sake of example, let us take the 
tainted blood issue. Do you think that it was any comfort to 
Quebecers to know that the so-called responsibility was being 
assumed nationally? It is important to know.
<P>
	Second, our hon. colleague seems to be telling us that, in Canada 
in general, people may feel it is quite normal  for the central 
government to try to be the one that is the closest to the people. But 
in Quebec, it is not so. René Lévesque himself said: ``We have 
nothing to prove''. We are a people and a nation, and we know that 
without one being necessarily better than the other, social, 
economic, cultural and political organization varies from one 
nation to another. That is what we are asking for with regard to 
health as well, and if I say so, it is because I know that I am 
speaking on behalf of the vast majority of Quebecers.
<P>
	As for the debt, we think that when the debt is high, it is essential 
that we be the ones to make the choices, as hard as they may be, and 
also that we concentrate our resources in areas where a structuring 
effect can be expected, which is not the case at present in the 
federal system. Employment centers are indeed a case in point. We 
have been fighting unanimously for years with ineffective weapons 
in Quebec to get back control over manpower training, because we 
know that manpower training is an essential economic 
development tool.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I should like to ask the hon. 
member a question about education in the province of Quebec, an 
area that has always interested me.
<P>
	Education, as the hon. member knows, is exclusively a 
provincial jurisdiction. Over the years Quebec has had complete 
control of it. If it was so important and useful in such a supreme 
system to have exclusive jurisdiction in this area and if it was better 
for the people, why is the dropout rate in Quebec one of the highest 
in Canada?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent question, and I 
am convinced that the drop out rate is a reflection of our whole 
social organization. The drop out rate has something to do with 
poverty. It has something to do with the lack of hope within Quebec 
and, if you must know, many people are sovereignists like me and 
will continue to pursue sovereignty because they are convinced that 
this is the only way to give people hope and make them drop back 
in.
<P>
	While there are technical means to bring young people back to 
school, we know that those who drop out do not do so because their 
teachers are boring. We know what makes them drop out. We know 
that an underprivileged youngster is much more likely to drop out.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I rise 
to speak in support of Bill C-95, an act to fix the name of the 
Department of Health, I am inclined to ask how many hon. 
members know that above all it is a department that puts its money 
where the greatest need is no matter where in the country.
<P>
	Counting all Canadians from coast to coast to coast the greatest 
health needs are found among the First Nations.  For native peoples 
life expectancy is seven years lower than the Canadian average. 
Newborn die four times as often. Substance abuse is prevalent. 
Sickness is more pervasive. Children are most at risk for 
malnutrition. For these reasons two out of every three dollars spent 
by the Department of Health excluding transfers to provinces go to 
enhance native health. More than 2,000 employees of the depart-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16228"> 16228 </A></B>
<P>
ment are in the direct care business, mostly dedicated to helping 
Indians on lands reserved for Indians.
<P>
	At a time when most government programs are being cut back, 
the Minister of Health prevailed to secure additional funds for 
native health in the recent budget. The government remains 
committed to mending the inequities that have persisted far too 
long.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The growth in expenditure will gradually taper down but lead 
time has been provided for native leaders in consultation with the 
department to explore alternate approaches to achieving the same 
levels of quality care that other Canadians have come to expect as 
their right. It is an essential part of Health Canada's mandate to 
help First Nations achieve the highest possible standards of health 
care. The department is expanding some programs and introducing 
others.
<P>
	Health Canada's building healthy communities strategy is 
funded by $243 million over five years to strengthen and expand 
existing health programs for native people in areas of critical need, 
including solvent abuse, mental health and home care nursing. The 
strategy is designed in consultation with First Nations and Inuit 
leaders.
<P>
	Last May the minister announced supplementary funding under 
the solvent abuse program for six new permanent treatment centres 
to deal with solvent abuse among First Nations and Inuit people. 
The centres are located in northern B.C., Saskatchewan, Manitoba, 
Ontario, southern Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	Last May the minister also announced the aboriginal head start 
aimed at helping disadvantaged children overcome some of 
poverty's life-drag effects. As it evolves it will provide more and 
more children with a positive self-image, a desire for learning, and 
an opportunity to develop social, emotional, physical and learning 
skills.
<P>
	Aboriginal people have told us there is a need for programs for 
young children and families that reflect the culture and experience 
of their communities. Together with Canada's aboriginal 
community we have embarked on a mission that will support the 
need. All Canadians can be proud of the program because its design 
was developed with input from aboriginal people in both urban and 
northern communities across the country.
<P>
	Aboriginal head start represents a made in Canada approach that 
can begin to address the unique needs of First Nations, Metis and 
Inuit preschool children and  their families. There is ample 
evidence of the health and educational differences that exist 
between the Indian, Inuit and Metis people when compared with 
other Canadians. We know that by working together we can better 
deal with these problems.
<P>
	Over half Canada's aboriginal population does not live on 
reserves and this population is very young. While 7 per cent of 
Canada's total population is under four years of age, 13 per cent of 
the aboriginal population is under four, nearly twice as high. 
Studies of head start programs have proven that investing in young 
children is one of the best investments society can make. Head start 
programs for young children can have a profound and positive 
effect on their lives.
<P>
	The elders tell us that every child has his or her own gift and that 
it is the responsibility of the community to identify that gift, 
nurture it and ensure that each child is aware of how special she or 
he is and that she or he is a gift from the creator. This traditional 
belief is a natural starting point for a healthy beginning in life. 
Aboriginal head start is similar to a community based early 
intervention program developed in the United States more than 30 
years ago. Those who are familiar with the head start program will 
be pleased to know that while we will build on their many 
successes we hope to improve on what they have done.
<P>
	An important recommendation from our talks with aboriginal 
people was to make the program flexible. Doing so allows the 
uniqueness of the First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities to be 
respected. Aboriginal head start is not complicated and it will have 
little red tape. It focuses on local non-profit organizations 
controlled and administered by aboriginal people who see the 
parent as the natural advocate of the child. Grandparents and elders 
play a significant role in aboriginal head start projects. Young 
aboriginal children will benefit from their wisdom and knowledge 
of tradition. All aboriginal head start projects will have strong 
parental involvement.
<P>
	Aboriginal head start will be guided in each region by a 
committee comprised of aboriginal people who have been 
nominated by their peers and bring with them an appreciation and 
understanding of aboriginal cultures, values, traditions, experience 
and educational expertise. They will assist in identifying priority 
sites and selecting projects.
<P>
	As well, a national aboriginal head start committee is being 
established to ensure the initiative has support and strength across 
Canada. Its members will be chosen because they have a broad 
understanding of early childhood development.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	It is clear to the federal government that programs for aboriginal 
people, designed and delivered by it, are more successful than 
those delivered by outside agencies. I  have no doubt that aborigi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16229"> 16229 </A></B>
<P>
nal head start committees and local head start projects will 
succeed.
<P>
	We have placed our investment and trust at the community level 
because we believe one of the ultimate goals of this initiative is to 
help parents and children build better futures for themselves. The 
Government of Canada will continue to work in strong partnership 
with Indian, Inuit, and Metis people in fulfilling the commitments 
made in the red book. Through the aboriginal head start program 
we are continuing to promote community action and empower 
communities by providing the tools and resources to improve 
overall economic and social opportunities for children and 
families.
<P>
	Although it was inspired by a community based program of early 
intervention and had its start in the U.S. more than 30 years ago, 
this head start program is much improved, based on substantial 
input from aboriginal people in urban and northern communities.
<P>
	Aboriginal head start will be flexible, respecting the unique 
characteristics of First Nations, Metis, and Inuit people. 
Grandparents, elders, and parents will play significant roles and the 
program will be guided in each region by a committee of aboriginal 
people nominated by their community.
<P>
	Head start programs for young children have profoundly positive 
long term effects. Their impact on aboriginal communities will be 
even greater elsewhere because in these communities there are 
nearly twice as many children under the age of four, nearly twice as 
many in proportion to their share of Canada's population.
<P>
	One specific program illustrates the care and concern manifest in 
this department. Last May, Health Canada was the major sponsor 
of the third annual international conference on diabetes and 
indigenous peoples, which was held in Winnipeg. Hon. members 
may be aware that diabetes is one of the most serious chronic 
diseases among aboriginal populations in Canada. Diabetes rates 
for natives are from two to five times greater than for Canadians in 
general.
<P>
	Health Canada works in partnership with aboriginal people to 
improve knowledge and treatment of diabetes. The department 
recognizes what the minister calls the critical role for traditional 
aboriginal practices in the healing process. This recognition of the 
value of traditional practices is of fundamental importance and 
reflects the department's major focus on the native front, which 
continues to be transfer of control of programs to First Nations.
<P>
	Over the years, Health Canada has come to recognize that health 
programs designed and delivered within aboriginal communities 
are often more successful than those delivered by outside agencies. 
Therefore, it now works with First Nations to enhance their control 
of  health resources. There have been more than 40 health transfer 
agreements concluded, involving about 100 First Nations, and the 
annual expenditures are more than $43 million. About twice as 
many again are under negotiation. Self-administered health care is 
one of the powers that will eventually enable First Nations to 
achieve self-government.
<P>
	I have used this occasion to remind hon. members and all 
Canadians of the commitment in this department to improving 
health and longevity for Canada's first peoples. There remains 
much to be done, but I know that our Department of Health, 
rechristened and recharged, will reconfirm its dedication to those 
most in need.
<P>
	I am pleased to support this clearing of the deck and positioning 
for the future brought about through Bill C-95.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address a couple of things in the bill. One is that there 
is a tendency to think of it as a housekeeping bill because it is a 
change of name. There are a couple of reasons for changing name. 
First, it can be done because we do not like the present name. 
Second, the mandate or the content of the department can be 
changed. I would like to suggest that the bill represents a little more 
than just changing the name of the department.
<P>
	I find it a little amusing that we are discussing the creation of the 
health department two years into our mandate. I believe we are 
going to be doing human resources a little later. Also, through Bill 
C-107 we have created the B.C. Treaty Commission approximately 
two years after it began functioning.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Getting back to the health department, the fact that it has been up 
and running under this mandate for two years gives me a little 
concern as to what its mandate actually is. Whether its mandate has 
been increased or decreased is the focus of what I am looking at 
here.
<P>
	The Department of Health is a product of the phasing out of the 
Department of Health and Welfare and the Department of 
Consumer and Corporate Affairs. It is my understanding that most 
of the mandate that was the Department of Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs went to the Ministry of Industry. I am assuming 
that a lot of the welfare aspect of the Department of Health and 
Welfare went to the Department of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	I am wondering what is left for the Department of Health. When 
we talk in our debates about health we tend to zero in on the health 
insurance or the medicare component of this department. I would 
think there is a lot more to health than that particular aspect. That is 
one component of what a good and functioning health department 
should be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16230"> 16230 </A></B>
<P>
	If we look at clause 4 of the bill itself, it states that the health 
department will promote and preserve the preservation of health 
for the people of Canada. I might add that it states it will do that 
where it has not been otherwise delegated to other jurisdictions 
within the government structure.
<P>
	The second part expands on that a little more. Paragraph 4.2(a) 
refers to the promotion and preservation of the physical, mental, 
and social well-being of the people of Canada. I would argue that 
the social well-being, as we heard earlier in the debate, involves 
such things as housing, jobs, et cetera. It goes into great parameters 
from that point of view as to our individual well-being. I would 
suggest that possibly that aspect is being removed with the removal 
of the welfare component. Consequently, the health department is 
in a position of having to collaborate with a number of other 
industries in actually addressing some of these concerns.
<P>
	The physical-mental component of that statement is relatively 
easy to address from a health point of view, because one can 
certainly look at that within this mandate. However, with the 
removal of the welfare component that mandate for health has been 
diminished to a point that now we are in more collaboration and 
co-operation with the other departments. There is not the same 
authority there the department once had.
<P>
	When we move further down the list as to what the mandate of 
this new department will be, in paragraph 4.2(b) it talks about the 
protection of the people of Canada against risks to health and the 
spreading of diseases. One would tend to think immediately in that 
component of communicable diseases and such other diseases that 
do not necessarily meet the definition of communicable diseases 
such as HIV-AIDS and possibly hepatitis B and C. These are 
pandemic kinds of situations. I would hope that a health 
department would have a major role in addressing these types of 
things that affect the Canadian people.
<P>
	We have had some experience in the past two years with both 
these issues. In my opinion, the response of the government has 
been reactive. I am wondering if this is a sign of some weakening 
in the department's ability to pick up the reins and lead when these 
situations occur.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	We go down to paragraph (c), which is ``investigation and 
research into public health, including the monitoring of diseases''. 
I am not sure if it is the only reference, but I believe it is the only 
reference made in the act to research.
<P>
	In this context, one tends to think of investigation and research, 
more studies. We are going to research this, study it. As we all 
know, we have done a lot of studies. In some areas the feeling is 
that we have done enough studies over the years and it is time to get 
into some action.
<P>
	I also would like to suggest that the research component of 
health is very important. It not only should be addressing diseases 
that are out there, but we should be looking at where we are going 
in the future from a technological point of view and how these 
things will affect our health.
<P>
	I am a little concerned that this is the only reference made to 
research. It tends to imply that we would be looking at diseases.
<P>
	Paragraph (d) states that the health department will establish and 
control the safety standards and safety information requirements 
for consumer products and safety information requirements for the 
products intended for use in the workplace. That is a program 
called WHIMS, which is being carried out by the provincial 
governments. The federal role in that now tends to deal with a 
problem within a company in which they feel the giving out of that 
information on their product may violate the marketing aspects of 
their product, put them in jeopardy of being duplicated or whatever. 
I would suggest that the federal government's role in WHIMS is 
minimal now that it has actually been established and 
implemented.
<P>
	Paragraph (e) refers to the protection of public health on 
railways, ships, aircraft and other methods of transportation. Here 
is a situation I made reference to earlier. The health department is 
in a position of not having necessarily authority in these areas but 
having to collaborate with other ministries. I suggest that this will 
weaken the leadership of this department.
<P>
	Paragraph (f) moves into the promotion and preservation of 
health in public servants and other employees. That stands on its 
own. The health department definitely is a major player there.
<P>
	Then we move into an environmental type of clause, 
international, dealing with the United States and others. Now we 
have another situation in which I am suggesting health is again in 
collaboration with another department, in this case environment, 
which means that there has to be a meeting of minds between the 
two departments for leadership to evolve in whatever situation has 
to be there.
<P>
	Paragraph (h) refers to the Statistics Act and the collection, 
analysis, interpretation, publication, and distribution of 
information relating to public health. I would like to say that this 
aspect is being well done and has been well done in the past. We 
have had experience in our past in which people have been able to 
get information about specific things. Having worked in the health 
care field before, I know that if one put the effort into obtaining 
information one certainly could get it. I suggest that the various 
departments in Health Canada, the bureaucratic component, have 
been the major bonus in this aspect of things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16231"> 16231 </A></B>
<P>
	We are gathering information and correlating it and then 
disseminating it to the people. I have dealt with the  health 
programs and services branch with Kay Stanley, specifically in 
relation to cardiac situations. I must say it has been excellent.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Two positive mandates of the health department have come up in 
my dialogue so far. One is the education and correlation of 
information and the other is public servants' health care.
<P>
	The last item is the co-operation with provincial authorities with 
a view to the co-ordination of efforts made or proposals for 
preserving and improving public health. My interpretation of that 
is it is the one which addresses medicare or health insurance. 
Again, the role has been delegated to the provinces to provide the 
service. The federal role is the Canada Health Act and the five 
principles thereof which ensure that the provinces meet those five 
standards.
<P>
	Through the amalgamation of departments we have weakened 
our health department with respect to giving it the necessary 
authority to address a great number of issues. Many other aspects 
of the health department, other than the health insurance aspect 
which has been transferred to the provinces, are tied up with other 
departments. One really does not know who has jurisdiction.
<P>
	Being the critic for aboriginal concerns I have seen many 
studies. We just heard a member speak about programs. There are 
numerous studies, such as the EAGLE study which is being done in 
collaboration with the environment department. There is a drinking 
water study in progress on which the department of health is 
collaborating with the department of Indian affairs. As a matter of 
fact, with respect to the drinking water project, I believe an 
education program has been established.
<P>
	All of these things are necessary. There is a great concern 
regarding the health of our aboriginal people which we should be 
addressing. We know that breast cancer is another problem which 
we should be addressing. There are many problems which need to 
be identified and addressed.
<P>
	The authority to address these health problems within other 
jurisdictions, for example, aboriginal people falling under the 
department of Indian affairs, tends to weaken the authority of the 
health department. We can get caught up with money, priorities or 
other things. My point is that I think it is a weakness.
<P>
	There is an abundance of money in the health care budget. There 
is a tendency to think of that money in relation to the health care 
insurance plan. We hear all kinds of dialogue about withholding 
transfers to the provinces and cutbacks in services. I realize there is 
a formula which is based on a dollar amount per head.
<P>
	I might suggest that when we start looking at all of the areas in 
which health is involved, such as the studies and  the various 
programs in collaboration with other ministries, possibly some of 
that money might be better used on the other side of the health 
department which is health insurance and medicare. I realize that 
entails changing the formula.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	The moneys available in health care for health insurance-and I 
do not know what the percentages would be on that through the 
whole budget-should be revisited in relation to all the other things 
the health department should or could be doing with the dollars it 
has but has allocated elsewhere into studies and various individual 
programs.
<P>
	Returning to the reference I made earlier that this bill is creating 
the health department, this department has been functioning for 
two years. It may support my argument that the department has 
been weakened. I hope there is a little more activity coming from 
the health department. We have had no legislation to date other 
than this bill. Bill C-7 was referred to the health committee but it 
was not introduced by the health department to this House.
<P>
	We had the tobacco situation early last year which again had a 
negative effect on the health situation. We have had the blood 
tainting and HIV-AIDS situations. We have had the comments 
about the transfer payments to the provinces in the west. We have 
had TB in the women's prisons and also the assisted suicide issue 
arise. There was not really any leadership from the health 
department. The medical profession actually expressed the pros 
and cons and the ethics of this and the other House undertook the 
study on palliative care issues.
<P>
	I have concerns. We are not just dealing with a name change. I 
have concerns about the role of the government. I have great 
concerns that it is being diffused.
<P>
	I have had some discussions with the Canadian Nurses 
Association. The association expressed the concern that with the 
removal of welfare the department would be restricted in its ability 
to address the whole human being which is important. The 
approach of health care workers in Canada has changed from an 
illness approach to a wellness approach where they must look at the 
whole body. There are concerns from the Canadian Nurses 
Association on that.
<P>
	The association is also concerned that the national standards 
coming from the department relate specifically, from what we have 
heard so far, to the Canada Health Act and the five principles which 
relate to the health insurance program.
<P>
	Those are some of my concerns. I will certainly be supporting 
this bill when the vote comes. I am concerned that it is being 
diffused. The team leader, the Prime Minister, calls the shots when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16232"> 16232 </A></B>
<P>
it comes to setting up the  ministries. I do have concerns that this 
department has been extremely weakened.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the hon. member's 
comments, some of which were well thought out. I appreciate her 
supporting the bill.
<P>
	The most important recurring theme I heard the hon. member 
refer to was that this new act will weaken the Ministry of Health in 
that the Ministry of Health will have to collaborate and co-operate 
with other departments. I do not see it that way.
<P>
	As the hon. member rightly said, health is more than just the 
absence of disease. Health has to do with environmental issues. It 
has to do with issues relating to poverty and socioeconomic status. 
It has to do with issues of public health which has to do with 
contagious or transferable diseases.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Departments such as environment, Indian affairs and northern 
development and human resources development are already in 
existence and are already dealing with these issues. What happens 
is a duplication of efforts. In the past, programs were going on 
within other departments and health would be duplicating some of 
them. The idea is that if there had been a concerted effort, then 
health and the other department, which in turn deals with its 
colleagues at the provincial level, can create a better understanding 
of the issue. Then the appropriate department working with health 
can set a healthy public policy with regard to those things.
<P>
	The positive thing about it is that in the past many departments 
have always felt that what they did did not impact on health. There 
is now a real opportunity here for departments to understand that 
health touches every single aspect of our lives. Those departments, 
whenever they make policy, can focus on looking at the healthy 
public policy component of their policy instead of just focusing on 
the other aspects of their policy that did not include health and left 
the health components up to health, in which case it was very 
diluted. It was more diluted in that case than it would be in this 
way.
<P>
	For example, let us look at the issue of poverty and the transfer 
of the welfare component of health and welfare to human resources 
development. We know that one of the things that has to do with 
poverty has to do with creating opportunity for people for 
employment training to become independent contributors to 
society. This is already a major part of human resources 
development. Therefore, developing human resources is going to 
decrease poverty in the long run which will then impact on health.
<P>
	This gives better focus to all of the departments which will in 
turn see that health is an important component of whatever they do 
across the spectrum. It also gives the Ministry of Health the ability 
to look at developing clear  health promotion and disease 
prevention guidelines, focusing on research and some of the things 
the hon. member spoke about.
<P>
	Research in terms of disease is not the only component of 
research one wants to do. The Medical Research Council is looking 
at health promotion research which will lead to the promotion of 
positive health status as opposed to just looking at the disease 
components.
<P>
	This gives the Department of Health a better focus on some of 
those issues including public health which, as members well know, 
means taking healthy public policy with regard to things like 
sewers, contagious diseases, quality of drinking water and safety, 
as the hon. member mentioned, which is an important part of what 
the department does right now. The department will focus on those 
issues very clearly and will work in co-operation and collaboration 
with the other departments. This will be a learning process with the 
other departments to see how what they do impacts on health.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
comments. I also appreciate that progress can be achieved much 
more quickly if we work together.
<P>
	I recognize the validity of ministries getting together and talking 
to avoid duplication and channelling their energies in the correct 
direction. This just does not apply to health; it can also be applied 
to the environment. Environment affects all the ministries as well.
<P>
	My concern is that somebody somewhere has to have the 
authority to take leadership in these situations. When one starts 
collaborating to that point, is it a committee decision, a health 
decision, or a ministry decision that we are talking about? How 
does the priority for recognizing the problem which has been 
identified actually come into being?
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	The authority of the department is diminishing because its role is 
becoming more of an associate role or an advisory role to the other 
ministries. It is picking up the gauntlet and running with the 
program out of its own budget or this type of thing. That is where 
my concern is. I have no problem with collaborating. That is 
excellent and it is time we got to it.
<P>
	I do not see any authority in this paper. If we have a health 
problem what authority does the department have to put it on the 
front burner? That is what I am concerned about.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the hon. member's 
comment. It is like the chicken and the egg syndrome.
<P>
	According to the member's vision of health it would be a super 
ministry encompassing all the ministries that will in turn look to 
the Department of Health to make decisions. Obviously that is not 
possible but it is an interesting concept.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16233"> 16233 </A></B>
<P>
	This is what we have to move to. If we are talking about sharing 
jurisdictions and incorporating, we are also educating other 
departments so that people do not continue to focus in a narrow 
tunnel vision in specific departments on only one component of 
what they do. It is better for public health policy if the Ministry 
of the Environment recognizes that whatever it does impacts 
health, as opposed to the Department of Health constantly saying 
that it must do this and that, and so on for every other ministry.
<P>
	I see it as a positive move as opposed to a negative move.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> Mr. Speaker, it might be the chicken and egg 
syndrome, but the concern first came to me with the EAGLE 
program. To my understanding that program is being done with the 
involvement of an aboriginal group. There is probably a specific 
group around the Great Lakes. The program is studying the effects 
on aboriginals of the Great Lakes environment. I believe it is being 
done in collaboration with Indian affairs.
<P>
	This collaboration is ongoing. We are studying the effects on 
aboriginals of the Great Lakes environment. I am sure it is 
affecting other people as well but because it was done in 
collaboration with one department we have zeroed in on a specific 
group. This is the trend I am seeing. Instead of the effects on 
Canadians, we studying the effects on aboriginals because of the 
ongoing collaboration. That could get out of hand eventually.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am supporting Bill C-95 because of the important role Health 
Canada plays in the life of Canadians. Too often Canadians, and 
even some hon. members of the Chamber, do not realize that there 
is more to health than the Canada Health Act. Health Canada 
supports unique federal roles and responsibilities. The work 
undertaken by the department is far reaching and important.
<P>
	Health Canada not only provides the benefits of universal health 
insurance. It also ensures the safety of food, drugs, cosmetics, 
medical devices and consumer products. It invests hundreds of 
millions of dollars in health research. It monitors disease in 
developing pathogens and it conducts a wide variety of health 
promotion programs and activities.
<P>
	Finally, Health Canada administers health services to First 
Nations, federal public servants, Canadian civil aviation personnel 
and Canadians in need of emergency health and social services in 
case of national civil disaster.
<P>
	The department touches Canadians every day in all aspects of 
their lives. Canadians look on their health system with pride. They 
have an overwhelming degree of satisfaction with what the 
department is doing. They expect governments to work hard to 
adapt to changing times and priorities. They understand the need 
for cost  effectiveness, but they demand the security of a 
department concerned with maintaining and improving the health 
of all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The government has recognized that economically 
disadvantaged, unemployed or poorly educated Canadians are 
more likely to suffer from ill health and to have a lower life 
expectancy. Like governments everywhere we will strive to deal 
with these problems. We are committed to an equitable health care 
system. The vast majority of Canadians are solidly behind the 
efforts being made by government, professional groups and other 
stakeholders to improve the efficiency of the system.
<P>
	Canada has a long history of commitment to these principles in 
serving a dispersed population in a federal system of government. 
We will maintain our commitment to these principles 
notwithstanding some difficult economic reality that we, as many 
nations of the world, are experiencing at the moment.
<P>
	Canadians look to Health Canada for reassurance whenever there 
are natural or civilian disasters or threats to national health from 
chronic diseases such as cancer and tuberculosis or communicable 
diseases such as AIDS, HIV or the Ebola virus.
<P>
	Within Health Canada 6,400 employees work to provide 
Canadians with the research data, programs, information and 
support they need to make positive lifestyle decisions. The 
business of the department is conducted in offices and laboratories, 
in cities and on reserves located on sites all across Canada. Just 
over half the department's employees work in the national capital 
region while the rest work in regional offices, collaborating with 
their provincial, territorial and non-government counterparts.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act is administered by about 25 employees 
in Ottawa. The face of Health Canada comprises many names and 
many talents. Forty per cent of Health Canada staff are involved in 
the area of health protection, keeping Canadians safe from risks to 
their health arising from emerging diseases, dangerous products, 
the environment or unsafe food or drugs.
<P>
	Defining, assessing and managing current and emerging health 
risks are also among branch responsibilities, along with 
maintaining the country's health protection infrastructure. More 
than 2,000 employees of Health Canada work in the area of First 
Nations health within the medical services branch. It is often 
forgotten that two-thirds of the budget of the department, excluding 
transfers to provinces, is devoted to native health.
<P>
	Health Canada provides community health services to status 
Indians on reserves and to residents of Yukon through 600 health 
facilities across Canada. In order to help First Nations to achieve 
the highest possible  standards of health care, the department has 
undertaken a variety of initiatives. These include the five-year 
building health communities strategy and the aboriginal head start 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16234"> 16234 </A></B>
<P>
program aimed at children. The latter is a government red book 
initiative.
<P>
	However the department's major focus remains the transfer of 
control of programs to First Nations. The first main program of 
Health Canada is the health promotion and programs branch 
involving some 525 people. They provide support to groups at risk, 
including children, families and seniors, and develop programs to 
prevent and reduce heart disease, breast cancer and other illnesses. 
They also work with and assist Canada's many national voluntary 
organizations.
<P>
	It is not well known that the federal government spends about 
$340 million on health research annually. Altogether we estimate 
that in Canada we spend about $1.5 billion a year on health 
research. This is a very impressive number.
<P>
	Each of the three program areas has staff in every province and 
territory. Not only are offices located in provincial capitals but 
members will find Health Canada staff in smaller centres like 
Trois-Rivières, Hamilton, Thompson, Port Qu'Appelle, the Sarcee 
reserve at Tsuu Pina in northern Alberta, and Prince George.
<P>
	Most of the remaining thousand or so employees work in the 
national capital region managing the department, developing 
health policy and legislation, undertaking consultation and 
managing essential departmental services. About 250 people work 
in the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, the Patented Medicine 
Prices Review Board and the Hazardous Materials Information 
Review Commission.
<P>
	Canadians have a strong attachment to their health system and 
the federal role in it. They look to the federal government to 
provide a viable, well managed national health care system. 
According to an Angus Reid poll of March 1995 almost all 
Canadians want national standards in health care, with 94 per cent 
saying such standards are somewhat or very essential.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	At a time when so much is changing in Canada and in the world 
people need security to cope with change. They expect their 
governments to play an important role in that regard by providing 
Canadians with the best health care system in the world and by 
reassuring them that they will be taken care of if they are sick, that 
the products they use are safe and that the most advanced research 
goes into the measures Health Canada takes to prevent disease. The 
Department of Health does this to earn the trust and confidence of 
Canadians.
<P>
	We have proven over and over again that a publicly administered 
health care system is the most effective, most inclusive and most 
successful system one in the world. Privatization of the health care 
system is a  weakening of the system of health care. It only makes 
the private corporations wealthier at the expense of those who need 
health care and at the expense of accessibility.
<P>
	This is why I support the bill and I encourage all members of the 
House to do so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
afternoon, we are considering Bill C-95, an act to establish the 
Department of Health.
<P>
	This bill contains a number of disturbing clauses, and the Bloc 
members who spoke before me in this debate pointed out that the 
provinces will have to pay close attention to how the federal health 
minister implements these clauses, because they give the federal 
government an opportunity to encroach on an area of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I think that our concerns are totally justified; I would like to go 
beyond the clauses themselves and look at how the Department of 
Health has been positioning itself for some time now.
<P>
	As hon. members will recall, in the throne speech almost two 
years ago, the government announced the national forum on health 
with great fanfare. What has happened since then?
<P>
	I would like to think about this because I think it puts the bill 
before us in a special light and allows us to express a number of 
reservations with arguments that everyone can understand better.
<P>
	This forum on health officially started its operations on October 
20, 1994, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister and the 
vice-chairmanship of the Minister of Health. The mandate of this 
forum is to improve the health of the Canadian people, increase the 
effectiveness and efficiency of health care services, and make 
recommendations to help the government achieve these goals.
<P>
	We should point out here that the federal government does not 
miss any opportunity to interfere in the area of health. The federal 
government therefore decided to participate in the debate and even 
to initiate the consulting process to assess the Canadian health 
system, despite the fact that this is an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction, while setting future priorities in order to improve the 
quality of health care.
<P>
	The federal government is making a lot of claims. As you will 
recall, it turned down the request by provinces to participate fully 
in the work of the national forum on health. Instead, the Liberals 
decided to let the provinces attend the forum but only as observers.
<P>
	How, I ask you, could the federal government disregard the main 
stakeholders in the area of health, namely the provinces? On 
September 27, 1994, the current Minister of Labour, who was then 
Quebec's Minister of Health, told <I>La Presse</I>: ``The federal  
government's conduct does not make any sense. How can they 
contemplate reviewing the health care system without the partici-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16235"> 16235 </A></B>
<P>
pation of the provinces, which must provide the services. It is 
simply unacceptable''.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Senator Thérèse Lavoie-Roux said, in the other place, on May 
31, 1994, that the government was headed in the wrong direction 
by overlooking the role of the provinces. She said, and I quote: 
``Are the provinces not considered major partners? Why were they 
not invited to participate in the forum? Does the leader find it 
appropriate for the government to be acting unilaterally on a matter 
of provincial responsibility?''
<P>
	Needless to say that the federal government went ahead with its 
national forum on health, in spite of the strong objections of the 
key players in the health sector, namely the provinces.
<P>
	On October 21, 1994, during question period, the Prime Minister 
said, and I quote: ``We in Canada cannot afford to lose our health 
insurance system because we did not take the time to plan for the 
future''.
<P>
	That statement from the Prime Minister is telling in more ways 
than one. First, the federal government sets itself up as keeper and 
promoter of the quality of health care services provided to the 
public. According to the Prime Minister, it is thanks to the federal 
government if the health care system, as it exists, is the pride of 
Canadians.
<P>
	Following a meeting with provincial officials in Victoria, the 
health minister said, in a press release: ``The October 15 date is 
final. However, I believe we can reach an agreement to end 
extra-billing by clinics to cover essential medical services. It was 
never my intention to penalize the provinces, but I firmly intend to 
preserve and to protect Canada's health care system''.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the federal government is careful not to mention the 
dramatic consequences of its financial withdrawal which, for 
Quebec alone, will have resulted in a shortfall of over $8 billion 
between 1982-83 and 1994-95. That is a lot of money, considering 
that the government claims to be the keeper of health care in 
Canada.
<P>
	The government is also trying to give the impression that it is the 
only one able and willing to propose efficient solutions to solve the 
thorny issue of funding for our health care system, as it currently 
exists. The federal government goes so far as to assume the 
responsibility of defining priorities to preserve the future of quality 
health care services.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's statement shows to what degree the federal 
government sees itself as the ``great thinker'' regarding Canada's 
current and future health care systems, as well as the one which can 
ensure that it remains accessible, free and universal.
<P>
	Let me quote an excerpt from a document on the 
federal-provincial perspective prepared by Thomas Duperré on 
behalf of Quebec's commission of inquiry on health and social 
services: ``By using several programs gradually put in place over 
the years, the federal health department tends to give itself overall 
responsibility for health and social services, and it does not hesitate 
to describe itself as the main architect of the implementation and 
smooth operation of Canada's health system. It should be noted 
that, for the Canadian government, health services (and, to a lesser 
degree, social services) in this country form, to a large extent, a 
nationwide system. Indeed, Ottawa sees provincial governments as 
mere health care providers, and provincial programs, which never 
seem to form a global structure, as mere elements of the national 
system. Provinces, and particularly Quebec, sometimes find it hard 
to understand the federal government's attitude in the health and 
social sector. This is because they forget that, rightly or wrongly, 
the central government gives itself a much larger role than the one 
provided in the constitution''.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, it is obvious that the provinces constitute the ideal 
sociopolitical agent for health system reform. According to the 
distribution of powers under the 1867 Constitution Act, only the 
provinces have the power to create, deliver and administer health 
and social services to the public.
<P>
	Let us look at the example of the various actions undertaken by 
the government of Quebec to transform, modify and improve the 
health system over the past ten years. Let us think of the Rochon 
Commission, which took a critical look at the entire health system 
in Quebec. Each component of the system was placed under 
scrutiny and a number of groups involved in the health field spoke 
before public Commission hearings, in order to make known their 
concerns, their anguish, and their suggestions for improving the 
irritants inherent to the system.
<P>
	After this brief review, I hardly need point out in connection with 
Bill C-95 that the provinces and Quebec are the ones best placed to 
intervene directly and knowledgeably in the system of health care 
and services. Who better than the provinces to know what the true 
issues are, and what solutions are required, to keep the health 
system accessible, universal and free of charge?
<P>
	The better solution by far would be to hand over to the provinces 
all taxes earmarked for health care, allowing them to provide their 
populations with appropriate and suitable health services. 
Interaction between the provinces would result in agreements to 
ensure the delivery of services that, while homogeneous and 
equivalent, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16236"> 16236 </A></B>
<P>
were tailored to the specific requirements and means of each 
province, Quebec in particular. I shall  close on this note,Mr. Speaker. Thank you for your kind attention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke about the health forum. He said the 
health forum is encroaching on provincial jurisdictions. The health 
forum is a dialogue by Canadians who form the forum and who 
were chosen from every province. They have an ongoing dialogue 
with Canadians to see Canadians' vision for health system as we 
move into the 21st century.
<P>
	I believe it is appropriate for the health forum to do exactly that 
because Canadian medicare is Canadian medicare. It is 
pan-provincial. It is a Canadian institution. Eighty-nine per cent of 
Canadians from every province agree and support medicare as 
something they treasure as a Canadian system of values and as 
being completely Canadian in its context.
<P>
	The provinces deliver services. Nothing in the dialogue the 
health forum is having with Canadians should interfere with that. 
These are Canadians speaking with Canadians to get a vision of 
their health care and reporting back to the Prime Minister on what 
they believe in. It is appropriate for the federal government to meet 
and speak with the Canadian people. We talk about a bottom up 
approach to health care. Everyone agrees we need to know what 
people think.
<P>
	Decisions in health care have always been made between 
governments and through discussion among governments in the 
health ministers' forum. It is very rare that the people of Canada 
get an opportunity to have an ongoing dialogue. This is putting the 
health care system into the hands of the people and letting them 
describe a vision for Canada as opposed to governments describing 
a vision for health care in Canada. I believe this is extremely 
appropriate.
<P>
	Nothing in this interferes with the parallel meetings that occur 
constantly between deputy ministers of health in every province 
and the deputy minister of health in the federal government, and 
between ministers of health of every province and the federal 
Minister of Health. They are parallel. They are government to 
government. They discuss what governments can do.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	This is important. Health care is a three-legged stool. That stool 
comprises of the consumer, the Canadian public, who uses those 
services, the provincial governments which provide, manage and 
administer those services, and the federal government which has 
been given the mandate under the Canada Health Act to ensure the 
five principles of Canadian medicare are kept.  One leg of that stool 
has been pretty shaky. No one has bothered to talk to that leg for a 
long time.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has said it is important for the people of 
Canada to speak about their vision. This is extremely appropriate if 
we see Canada as one country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will permit me to disagree 
completely with my hon. colleague's remarks.
<P>
	Health is a provincial matter. If the federal government wants to 
keep an eye on all the provinces, it should not go through the 
people of the provinces, but through the governments, whose job it 
is to administer the system within their province. When you start 
short-circuiting the authority of the individual provinces and going 
directly to individual citizens, you are short-circuiting a process 
that is normal, natural and desirable, because it is practical and 
necessary. You mess up the whole thing.
<P>
	In June 1994, a journalist called me and asked me about the 
forum. I said it was window dressing. I say the same thing today, 
almost two years after the speech from the throne, this forum has 
served absolutely no purpose. We have not made any progress, and 
the provinces are increasingly aware that they are being given 
responsibilities and deprived of the means to carry them out. This 
is both unfair and inefficient, and, in the final analysis, the 
provinces will have the last word, because common sense always 
prevails.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, it being two o'clock p.m., we 
will now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

to places they had fought and where many of their comrades laid 
down their lives in the defence of freedom. These veterans were 
greeted as the heroes they are. Dutch children have been taught 
about the Canadian sacrifice to liberate their country.
<P>
	It is imperative for Canadian children to learn those same 
lessons. This week is National Veterans' Week. My home province 
of Newfoundland has also signed a proclamation declaring this 
Remembrance Week, the first province to do so. The flag of 
remembrance will be flown outside schools and municipal and 
provincial buildings across our province.
<P>

ourselves and to teach our children about the courage and sacrifice 
of Canada's veterans.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the latest 
information on the practices of the former Airborne Regiment in 
Petawawa is distressing. The revelation of more and more 
repugnant practices by former members of the Regiment not only 
tarnishes the reputation of Canada's armed forces, but indicates 
that a significant change must take place within the armed forces.
<P>
	How could anyone tolerate a celebration of the anniversary of

These sordid celebrations are an insult for and an attack on all 
women.
<P>
	I call on the Minister of National Defence to act quickly to put an 
end to the unacceptable behaviour of the Canadian armed forces, 
which, it would appear, took place with the approval of higher

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Armed Forces Pensioners/Annuitants Association contracted a 
group dental insurance plan, but only under the proviso that 
monthly premiums be deducted at source.
<P>
	The request to do so went to Treasury Board in October 1993. 
Only after many follow-up inquiries did the minister, almost two 
years later, finally agree to consider the pension deductions.
<P>
	However, planned implementation could be no sooner than the 
summer of 1996 and at an estimated cost of ``no less than 
$100,000'' for system development.
<P>
	Treasury Board already processes payroll deductions for income 
tax, union dues, United Way campaigns, Canada savings bonds and 
other insurance plans. The software programs are in place and do 
not require the massive rewrites suggested by the minister.
<P>
	The association is willing to pay reasonable administrative 
charges so there would be no cost to the taxpayer. Rather than 
letting his bureaucrats place unreasonable impediments in the way, 
the minister should direct Treasury Board to provide this service to 
a group of people who simply wish to protect their dental health.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Premier 
McKenna is on a mission in western Canada. He wants to explain

Minister of Canada and he himself are referring is indeed the 
meaningless concept set out in the Charlottetown accord, even 
though this accord was rejected by a majority of Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	To support his arguments, he can also remind those unfamiliar 
with constitutional wrangling of the key role he played in killing 
the Meech Lake accord. Despite Mr. McKenna's assurances on the 
purely symbolic value of the distinct society clause, the premiers of 
Ontario and western Canada are incapable of recognizing, even 
half-heartedly, the existence of the people of Quebec.

worry, be happy; the economy is improving''. The 65,000 new 
entrants into the job market will not be happy until they find a job.
<P>
	The increase would have been even higher if it were not for the 
spinoff from the resurgence of the U.S. economy. While the Prime 
Minister and his cabinet were perfecting their do-nothing routine 
during the referendum, they failed to realize the status quo 
approach to the economy will bring Canada even closer to financial 
collapse.
<P>
	The minister of HRD's orchestrated leaks about new job creation 
schemes show he is still clinging to the socialist notion that 
governments can create jobs. History has proven this approach to 
be an unmitigated failure.
<P>
	Why does the government not get out of the way so the private 
sector can create some real jobs?

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
following the tragic death, two days ago, of Yitzhak Rabin, Israel 
and the whole international community have lost a great statesman.
<P>
	Yitzhak Rabin was one of the main architects of the peace 
process in the Middle East. His death must not end the hope for 
lasting peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours.
<P>
	Yitzhak Rabin was like a reflection of his country and of the 
whole Middle East. Born in a country under foreign control, he 
fought for national independence before becoming his country's 
defence chief of staff, and eventually ambassador, prime minister 
and peacemaker. It is thanks to his dedication to peace if, in recent 
years, we witnessed a rapprochement between Israel and its Arab 
neighbours.
<P>
	More than anything else in his distinguished career, Yitzhak 
Rabin will be remembered as a man of peace who was loved by his 
people, by neighbouring nations, and by us all.

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
only two years ago Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
proclaimed to the world: ``Enough of blood and tears. Enough''.
<P>
	Today citizens of the world remember those courageous words 
as they mourn the tragic loss of this great peacemaker. It is indeed 
ironic that a man of peace should be taken from the world so 
violently.
<P>
	Today as we mourn his death we also celebrate his life. We shall 
continue to remember him for the legacy he has left behind: peace 
in the Middle East which will be treasured by every child who 
comes of age in a better world.
<P>
	Mr. Rabin knew the soul of his people and his people came to 
him for leadership in war and in peace.
<P>
	As we grieve with his family and his nation, let us resolve that 
his death shall not still the life of peace.

witnessed a miracle. When a man can learn to give instead of take, 
we have surely witnessed a miracle.
<P>
	This miracle will be remembered as Yitzhak Rabin. The history 
he has written will become a beacon of hope, a symbol of peace, a 
miracle of humanity for all the world to share.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first set 
of supplementary estimates was tabled last week and with these 
estimates the government is proposing $936 million in new 
spending; spending that only six months ago was unforeseen, 
unimagined and completely unanticipated by the government.
<P>
	I am appalled by some of this spending. The government's 
failure to collect information and its efforts to hide information 
have led to an expensive Somalia inquiry budgeted at $7.4 million. 
This could have been, would have been and should have been 
avoided if the Department of National Defence had done its job 
correctly.
<P>
	There is a $4 million subsidy to Canada Post Corporation for 
providing services to the north. I thought Canadian postage rates 
are supposed to pay for delivery everywhere in Canada. Does 
Canada Post need an additional $4 million subsidy to do the job it is 
already paid to do?

<P>
	Each year there are 12,500 deaths, two million lost work days, 
and $150 million in lost earnings in Canada because people do not 
take their medications properly.
<P>
	The purpose of Pharmacy Awareness Week is to recognize the 
important role pharmacists play in health care, particularly in the 
use of medication. It also serves to encourage a dialogue between 
pharmacists and their patients on the proper and safe consumption 
of prescription drugs. Pharmacy Awareness Week is an opportunity 
for patients and pharmacists to reduce the risk involved with unsafe 
medication consumption.
<P>
	I recognize the efforts of pharmacists in the field of health and I 
encourage them to continue their efforts to ensure that medications 
and their proper use continue to improve the good health of all 
Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Wednesday, in response to a question, the Prime 
Minister said he was in favour of a veto right, not for the 
Government of Quebec but for Quebecers.
<P>
	When asked about this last week, both the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs and the Deputy Prime Minister were 
unable to explain what the Prime Minister meant.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Justice explain what the Prime Minister 
means when he talks about a veto right for Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, last week we said that the best way by far to give 
Quebecers the vote was to proceed with the good government we 
had started to put in place and implement the changes and reforms 
that  were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16241"> 16241 </A></B>
<P>
clearly demanded by the public. That was the best way to prevent 
the next referendum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I directed my question to the Minister of Justice because I 
thought that directing it to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs would not give us more of an answer than we had last week.
<P>
	I will again put my question to the Minister of Justice. Could he 
confirm his government's plans to table legislation in the House of 
Commons authorizing federal referendums in five regions in 
Canada, including Quebec, for the purpose of amending the 
constitution?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, obviously the government speaks with one voice, whether 
it does through the Prime Minister, who is in charge, the Minister 
of Justice or myself. Furthermore, the questions now being asked 
by the hon. member for the opposition are about purely speculative 
matters on which the government is not prepared to commit itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will keep trying to find out a little more about the 
vacuum that exists on the other side.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice realize that this plan to hold federal 
referendums that might amend the Canadian constitution means 
that his government intends to go over the head of the Quebec 
National Assembly, as it did in 1982?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the purpose of a referendum is to find out how the public 
feels. We know how the public feels. People want to stay in 
Canada, and they want changes made within Canada. They 
expressed their opinion. It is over. Because we believe in 
democracy, we concluded that their no was a real no, and we are 
acting on that basis. That is why we are going to put reforms in 
place in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice refuses to rule out, as a scenario for 
amending the constitution, the possibility that the federal could 
hold its own referenda in the five regions of Canada, including 
Quebec.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. In this context, are we 
to understand that the right of veto for Quebecers the Prime 
Minister of Canada referred to would consist in violating the 
authority of the Quebec national assembly by flouting its 
prerogative to hold its own referenda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> 
Everyone but the Minister of Justice answered, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	My second question is for the Minister of Justice. Is this federal 
initiative not an indication that Ottawa is trying to pave the way for 
another dirty trick like the one it played on us in 1982 by amending 
the constitution without the consent of the Quebec national 
assembly? They are at it again.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, all 
Canadians were shocked to hear of the break-in at 24 Sussex Drive 
on Saturday night.
<P>
	The Prime Minister deserves to be protected. He must be 
protected, especially in his own home. The more Canadians learn 
about this, the more outraged they are at this breach of security.
<P>
	I ask the Solicitor General of Canada, where in the world did our 
security system go wrong on Saturday night?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this is a very unfortunate situation.
<P>
	I met with the commissioner yesterday and discussed it with him 
again this morning. I can confirm that I have asked for a full 
investigation and he has agreed that such an investigation be 
carried out into the security of the Prime Minister and that of all 
official residences.
<P>
	A full investigation is being carried out into this incident by a 
senior officer of the RCMP not connected with the management of 
the security system. The purpose of this investigation is not only to 
find out what happened but to make sure it does not happen again.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister says it was an unfortunate incident. In fact it was 
terrifying. I have my sympathies for Mrs. Chrétien, who went to 
the door and found such a frightening thing. It is not acceptable that 
it just be deemed unfortunate, especially on the heels of the tragic 
murder on that same day of the Israeli Prime Minister.
<P>
	It took the RCMP almost 10 minutes to respond. If Mrs. Chrétien 
had called the fire department, their response time would have been 
three and a half minutes. Why did it take so long?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada,  Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have already pointed out that this incident is totally unacceptable. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16242"> 16242 </A></B>
<P>
The commissioner of the RCMP had a press conference earlier 
today and expressed his shock and dismay at what happened.
<P>
	Obviously a full investigation has not been completed. It would 
appear that the RCMP officers on the site did not follow 
procedures. Instead of moving immediately to the house, they 
surrounded the house before going in and arresting the person who 
had broken into the house and placing him under control.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
platitudes and investigations and all these kinds of things are one 
thing, but Canadians are demanding more. They are demanding 
action, not just reports and tabling reports and all that. They do not 
feel safe in their own homes. Now they find out that their Prime 
Minister is not safe in his.
<P>
	How can the solicitor general assure Canadians that this 
government has taken immediate steps so that this will never 
happen again? Will he commit today to tabling the report that is 
brought forward so that all Canadians can look at it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the report is going to be made to me by the commissioner. I will 
review it. To the extent that information can be made public 
without undermining security, I will certainly attempt to bring it 
forward to this House.
<P>
	I can also confirm to this House that enhancements and 
improvements to the security at 24 Sussex have already been made. 
The RCMP and the government are not waiting for the report 
before making necessary improvements in security.
<P>
	Above all, this incident is shocking and dismaying. It is 
unacceptable. As far as I am concerned, everything possible will be 
done to make sure it never happens again.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Saturday he confirmed that the federal government is opposed to 
any constitutional recognition of the distinct status of Quebec and 
that it is preparing instead to table in the House of Commons a 
simple and inconsequential resolution which will not change 
anything concretely for Quebec.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the fact that only one Canadian in 
three outside Quebec would be prepared to modify the constitution 
explains the federal intention to offer Quebecers only a simple 
resolution on the distinct society which will serve no useful 
purpose to the men and women of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I never said that, but it is our 
intention to respect the Prime Minister's commitments.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	As my colleague stated today, the most important thing is to 
ensure good government; then another referendum campaign will 
not be necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the reply by the real Minister of Justice. But I must 
regret the lack of insight in his answer, which lead to my 
supplementary question.
<P>
	Because two out of three Canadians are opposed to reopening the 
constitution, will the Minister of Justice admit that the only true 
path to change for Quebecers is the sovereignty of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
polls over the weekend indicate that in the wake of last week's no 
vote a strong majority of Canadians, both inside and outside 
Quebec, feel that the country should be more decentralized. The 
polls also indicate that support for a distinct society clause is weak 
and that such a clause would likely run into problems if the 
government tries to introduce it.
<P>
	Given these sentiments, will the government commit to 
abandoning the distinct society clause?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have made it clear that 
we intend to proceed with the engagements taken by the Prime 
Minister during the course of the referendum. We intend to respect 
those.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the answer is a little vague, but let us try to pin it down a bit more.
<P>
	Will the minister not agree that rather than trying to enshrine a 
distinct society into the Constitution, if that is what is meant by the 
answer, legitimate aspirations of everyone can be met through the 
devolution of powers for language and culture from the federal to 
all provincial governments without the need for constitutional 
change?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadians made it clear, 
both Quebecers who voted in the referendum and other Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16243"> 16243 </A></B>
<P>
across the country,  that they want governments that embrace 
change and governments that are prepared to challenge the status

<P>
	We are the government that over the last two years has not only 
challenged the status quo, we have laid out a path for 
harmonization to make sure that governments that can best deliver 
to the people are the governments that are in the position of doing 
so. We believe that process should continue.
<P>
	We challenge the status quo. Unfortunately, the two parties that 
seem to hide behind the status quo are the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Reform Party.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week as he left a cabinet meeting, the Minister of Justice clearly 
raised the possibility of dusting off an ancient federal power of 
disallowance which has not been used for more than half a century 
or going before the courts to stop Quebec if someday it wanted 
another referendum on its political future.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Justice. Could the 
minister confirm that he intends to use the power of disallowance 
which, according to the Supreme Court, has become obsolete, to 
prevent Quebecers from voting democratically on their political 
future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the real question, the most 
important one for the future, is good government for Canada. The 
Prime Minister promised to provide good government for Canada. 
Constructive changes in the government's administration have 
been discussed, and once these are implemented, we are confident 
there will be no need for another referendum campaign in the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I 
understood correctly, the Minister of Justice does not deny what he 
said last week, so I am back with a supplementary.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice not think it was indecent to consider 
resurrecting the power of disallowance or going before the courts 
to silence the voice of the people of Quebec?
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the questions last week about 
constitutional powers were technical but the concerns of this

government's responsibility for political stability in Canada. The 
source of that stability is good government.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
kind of sick to think that the Conservative and Liberal governments 
over all these years have raised the debt in this country to $567 
billion.
<P>
	On the very day of the referendum, the government quietly 
tabled legislation to increase Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation's loan liability by $50 billion, from $100 billion to 
$150 billion.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister of public works why is this 
government adding a further $50 billion liability to this country 
and an already overburdened economy, thereby expanding the 
government's authority in the area of housing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised at 
the question from the hon. member who continues to show a lack of 
understanding on the various programs operated by the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	In the premise of his question, once again the hon. member 
alludes to facts which are incorrect. The hon. member and all hon. 
members should know that this fund is self-sustaining. There are 
no appropriations from the Government of Canada for this fund. In 
point of fact over 330,000 Canadians have benefited from this 
program.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that once in a while he 
should get his facts straight.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
guess after the rough ride the minister had this summer he wants to 
get back. That is interesting.
<P>
	There are two types of liability in this country. One type is on the 
books of the government and the other rest in the 24 seats in the 
front here.
<P>
	I confirmed with the vice-president of finance for CMHC that if 
any of these mortgages are defaulted they are a liability against the 
government. Perhaps the minister missed that idea.
<P>
	Will the minister commit today to introducing legislation to 
guarantee exclusive provincial control of housing, and if not, why 
not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to the first 
part of the hon. member's question is no. The reason is that unlike 
the third party, the government does not have an ideology that the 
role of the national government is to be a Visa or Chargex for 
provincial governments.

	We have been constantly asking the government to exercise its 
constitutional duty to be responsible for Indians and lands reserved

<P>
	What is the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development going to do about the situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is the B.C. treaty process 
which was really a creature of the present leader of the Reform 
Party in B.C. when he was a member of the other government in 
cabinet. We have to make it work. We have put a lot of money and 
lot of time into it. That deals with related issues.
<P>
	The hon. member knows because we have discussed it that on 
roadblocks all kinds of other issues come in. The roadblock is used 
per se, almost as a bargaining tool for land, for the Penticton lodge, 
for all of these things. We have to keep those in the B.C. treaty 
process or we will destroy a process that we both support. It will 
not work unless we go to that process.
<P>
	Specifically on roads, I met with the B.C. minister of transport 
Jackie Pement for an hour just before question period. We are 
trying to set up a process where we can work collectively if it is a 
road issue. If it is a broader  issue we are trying to encourage the 
First Nations to go to the table. Otherwise, if there is success on all

<P>
the issues just because there is a roadblock, there will be more 
roadblocks and the 70 per cent of the First Nations of B.C. at the 
B.C. table will walk away.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister knows full well that there is no roadblock 
at this particular point.
<P>
	I have spent the past two weeks personally seeking out the 
minister in an attempt to have him do something about this 
situation. The British Columbia government is helpless. Its hands 
are tied. Canadians have already learned that the federal 
government's inaction was a major cause of the Oka crisis. The 
B.C. government has been consistently reminding the federal 
government of its duties and responsibilities.
<P>
	Will the minister take action now and prevent another Gustafsen 
Lake?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I disagree with the premise. We 
are working positively with the B.C. government and it is doing 
fine work.
<P>
	In October 1993 we came into office. In December 1993 we 
opened up the office of the B.C. Treaty Commission. No other 
government before us was able to do that.
<P>
	We have worked 10 solid weeks to get the formula which 
members have seen in the paper in the last few days and it is getting 
there for the B.C. treaty process. We are close to settling the 
Nisga'a. We deal positively on all matters.
<P>
	My problem is not with the B.C. government; my problem is 
with the Reform members who come from B.C. and refuse to 
address the issues.

<P>
	Following a question asked on May 15 about copyright, the hon. 
member for Saint-Hubert was finally told, five months later, by the

responsible, namely the industry and heritage ministers.
<P>
	Given that Quebec and Canadian composers, authors and 
performers have been waiting eleven years for this bill, will the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage pledge to table this legislation in the 
House as soon as possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, it is perfectly normal to have several ministers 
involved. There is of course the Minister of  Justice, since the bill 
must be drafted by his department. There is also the Minister of 
Industry, since he is responsible for the Copyright Act. And, 
finally, there is the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who is 
responsible for proposing amendments to the act.
<P>
	The three ministers work together, make decisions together, and 
will get results together. As for the duration of the process, I 
publicly stated on several occasions that we are going as fast as we 
can, that the issue is complex, and that the bill will be tabled in the 
House as soon as it is ready.

<P>
	Will the Minister of Canadian Heritage make sure, through the 
copyright bill, that the rights paid to creators will not be reduced by 
providing numerous exceptions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, we have to find a good balance between the rights of 
creators-we are establishing new ones-and the rights of users. 
This is the real issue. This is where we have to find a balance, and 
the hon. member will see how we do it when the bill is tabled.

small and medium size businesses compete not only directly with 
one another but also with American businesses right across the 
border. These American businesses have an advantage because of 
the so-called free trade zones.
<P>
	Could the minister tell the House what measures he has taken to 
allow Canadian businesses to compete more effectively in the 
international market?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-102, designed 
to amend the Customs Act, has exactly that purpose in mind. It will 
encourage businesses to locate in Canada. It contains 
improvements that will streamline the duty deferral program and 
will make programs more user friendly and accessible. It will 
remove administrative restrictions and will ease cash flow 
pressures by providing as much up front duty relief as possible.
<P>
	Regions, municipalities and businesses will be able to co-operate 
as a result in promoting their communities because a critical

	It is our intention before the House of Commons rises for

sponsorship.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

brother and family to settle in Alberta. Since then Alberta 
taxpayers have shelled out $40,000 in welfare payments to support 
the family.
<P>
	Assaf then attempted to sponsor his second wife to Canada and 
was refused by immigration officials. He decided to go to the IRB 
that in turn ruled that Assaf did not have to pay his first obligations 
before sponsoring his second wife.
<P>
	How will the minister accomplish the task of reducing 
sponsorship defaults when the IRB is telling sponsors that it does 
not make any difference whether or not they repay those defaults?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike the Reform Party that 
uses a negative, cynical case analogy or example, we prefer to deal 
with issues on a national basis with some degree of thought, due 
course and reflection. We will not be deterred by listening to 
comments on the floor of the House of Commons about individual 
cases.
<P>
	We can always learn from cases whether they are in my portfolio 
or anywhere else, but we would be wrong if we looked at one case, 
generalized and made it applicable to all immigrants or refugees 
coming to Canada. We will not engage in a small kind of world that

deal with facts. Let us find solutions that work.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
legislation which privatizes CN guarantees that Montreal will 
always be the headquarters of CN. The Transcona shops have just 
as proud a place in the history of CN as Montreal does, yet many 
are worried that Transcona is slated for extinction given the 485 
layoffs on Friday last and the 266 before that in September.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister or for the Minister 
of Human Resources Development answering in his capacity as 
regional minister. Will the minister now, in the interests of regional 
fairness and national unity, instruct CN either administratively or  
legislatively to stop the decimation of the Transcona shops, to keep 
Transcona as CN's main repair shop and to ensure the Transcona 
work is not siphoned off to CN's wholly owned subsidiary in 
Montreal, AMF, or anywhere else for that matter? Will the Liberal 
government give Winnipeg the kind of guarantees that Montreal 
has received?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question but I think he ought to get the facts straight.
<P>
	The jobs being lost at Transcona in Winnipeg are only of a 
temporary nature. Therefore to assume that these are permanent 
layoffs by Canadian National would be inappropriate.
<P>
	The hon. member would know that CN is on the brink of its 
commercialization and privatization. It needs to get its house in 
order so that it can be a competitive and viable railroad, providing 
service from sea to sea to sea and providing employment to all 
Canadians across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
will the government give a guarantee that the recall date will be 
honoured and that the recall date is not just a way of appeasing 
employees?
<P>
	Will the government answer my first question? Why guarantees 
for Montreal and no guarantees for Transcona and Winnipeg that 
have just as much a place in CN as anyone else?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I tell the hon. member that 
the layoff notices are temporary.
<P>
	I am sure as CN moves toward privatization it will become much 
more efficient as a national railroad in the country. In fact there will 
be future job opportunities for everyone in Canada, not only in 
Quebec but in Winnipeg, B.C. and Atlantic Canada.

<P>
	The government has now served two years since it was officially

celebrate that event is to point out, with the employment statistics 
released on Friday, that since the election over 500,000 full time 
permanent jobs have been created in Canada.

	In particular it is important to point out that last month alone 
46,000 jobs were created for young people, which is the highest

peace accord signed by both nations shows that his efforts have 
borne fruit and brought hope to this part of the world. We are 
convinced that he did not sacrifice his life in vain and that the 
road to reconciliation now taken by his people and the people of 
Palestine will lead to a better future for all who believe in peace 
in the Middle East.
<P>
	We earnestly hope that his violent death will not halt the 
diplomatic negotiations he initiated with Yasser Arafat to establish 
a plan for peace in the region. We firmly believe that the process 
started by these two leaders will prevail over radical movements 
that are oblivious to democratic values and condone violence.
<P>
	On behalf of my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, I wish to 
express our condolences to the family and relatives of Mr. Rabin, 
the Jewish people, the international Jewish community including 
that in Quebec, and to show that we share the grief of losing a 
unique human being. Shalom Yitzhak Rabin!
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of my leader and our party I rise this afternoon to pay tribute 
to the late Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzahk Rabin.
<P>
	Rabin earned his reputation with Israelis as a soldier and then as 
a politician. His first hand knowledge of the military and his deep 
commitment to preserving Israel's security, first through arms and 
later through peace, made him undeniably one of the world's 
greatest statesmen.
<P>
	It is well known that Mr. Rabin earned his credibility on the 
battlefield. However, Rabin's greatest honour and truest victory 
came through his pursuit of a lasting peace with his former 
enemies.
<P>
	He sought peace not through fear but through courage, seeing it 
as the only hope for the future. He understood that true peace is not 
the absence of all differences, but genuine goodwill and the putting 
aside of those differences for the common good. Of the necessity 
for peace, Rabin said: ``We should not let the land flowing with 
milk and honey become the land flowing with blood and tears''.
<P>
	Yitzahk Rabin truly believed that ``the majority of people want 
peace and are ready to take a chance for peace''. He himself took 
that chance and paid recently with his life.
<P>
	Just six weeks ago, King Hussein of Jordan, President Mubarak 
of Egypt, Chairman Arafat, and Prime Minister Rabin signed a 
peace agreement on the White House lawn. In words that seem 
almost prophetic today, Prime Minister Rabin said: ``Only poets 
have dreamt of this  moment, and to our great pain soldier and 
civilian went to their deaths to make this moment possible''.
<P>
	He was soldier and civilian both, as well as one of Israel's 
greatest leaders. We hope and pray that his death, although tragic 
and untimely, will leave a legacy for lasting Middle East peace, for 
which he sought so valiantly.
<P>
	Our sympathy and prayers are with Mrs. Rabin and her family. 
Shalom, Prime Minister Rabin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Yitzahk Rabin was a soldier in war who became a soldier 
in peace. He fought as hard to achieve peace as he did in war. His 
greatest victory will unfortunately come only after his death.
<P>
	The proof of the strength and durability of the move toward 
peace that Prime Minister Rabin created is that there can be no 
doubt this peace process will continue. It will continue until we 
reach the comprehensive peace that Mr. Rabin so eloquently lauded 
in the speech he gave before hundreds of thousands of Israelis 
demonstrating for peace last weekend, just shortly before his tragic 
death. There remains much to be done, but Mr. Rabin has made a 
start possible.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Together with two other New Democrat members of Parliament, 
Howard McCurdy and Ian Deans, I had the privilege and 
opportunity to meet with our Labour Party colleague, Yitzhak 
Rabin, in the mid-1980s. We had a vigorous exchange of views and 
certainly some profound disagreements, but there was a sense of 
openness and mutual respect.
<P>
	Since his election as Prime Minister in 1992, I have been 
enormously impressed by his courage and determination to bring a 
just and lasting peace to the Middle East. As others have noted, we 
were all profoundly moved to see Mr. Rabin and Yasser Arafat 
shake hands on the White House lawn. That handshake symbolized 
the partnership in peace that has been forged between Israel and the 
Palestinians.
<P>
	The member for Beaver River and the Deputy Prime Minister 
both quoted some of the words spoken that historic day. I would 
like to quote some others. He said in prophetic words: ``We the 
soldiers who have returned from battles stained with blood, we who 
have seen our relatives and friends killed before our eyes, we who 
have come from a land where parents bury their children, we say 
today in a loud and clear voice: Enough of blood and tears. 
Enough.''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
On the evening of his death, Mr. Rabin made a passionate plea 
against violence. ``Violence, he said, undermines the foundations 
of democracy in Israel. It cannot be condoned and must be 
condemned.'' During the weeks and months that preceded the 
tragedy on  Saturday night, statements made by certain politicians 
and citizens of Israel in the course of the debate on the peace 
accords were not only filled with anger but showed undercurrents 
of violence. Yitzhak Rabin has proven that in a civilized society, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16251"> 16251 </A></B>
<P>
political debate, however deep its roots, must be based on respect 
for every individual.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I would like to extend condolences on behalf of 
myself and my colleagues in the New Democratic Party of Canada 
to Mr. Rabin's family, the people of Israel, and the Jewish 
community in Canada and around the world. We share your 
profound sense of anguish and loss. Remember that the Kaddish, 
the Jewish prayer for the dead, is an affirmation of the power of 
faith and hope in the midst of despair.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
like millions of people in Israel and around the world, I was 
shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic death of Yitzhak Rabin 
Saturday afternoon.
<P>
	I was shocked because his death came just after he had spoken 
and sung for peace at a rally of 100,000 Israelis. I was shocked 
because his murder was completely inconsistent with the way of 
life in Israel, where this kind of violence has not been a means of 
dealing with political differences. It has not been a part of the life 
of that democratic country. I was shocked and also saddened that 
Prime Minister Rabin's own life, so filled with achievement and 
service, had been cruelly ended before his main work could be 
completed: the work of making peace between Israel and all its 
neighbours.
<P>
	Yitzhak Rabin proved he could be successful as a leader in 
making war. He was proving he could be equally successful as a 
leader in achieving peace. He had made war to protect his country, 
but he wanted and preferred peace for Israel and all the peoples of 
the Middle East.
<P>
	It has been said that Yitzhak Rabin was a martyr for peace. 
Therefore, the best way to honour his life and his memory is to 
make sure that his work for peace continues and is successfully 
concluded.
<P>
	Just after this government took office, two years ago last week, 
its first official visitors were Yitzhak Rabin and his wife. I, together 
with my wife, had the honour of officially welcoming them to our 
country. At that time, in talking with him all too briefly, I was 
struck and impressed by his mixture of firmness, resolve, personal 
modesty, and his commitment to achieving his goal of peace for 
Israel with its neighbours.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	There is a word in Hebrew that is used as a greeting. It is also 
used to say goodbye and at the same time it signifies peace, that 
most sublime of human conditions. Unfortunately we cannot 
extend a greeting to Yitzhak  Rabin on this earth again, but we can 
say goodbye by using that word which had come to mean more to 
him than almost anything else. We can say shalom. Shalom 
Yitzhak.
<P>
	The Kaddish prayer said by Jewish mourners concludes with 
these words: ``He who maketh peace in his high places, may he 
make peace for us and for all Israel''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to express my since condolences to Mrs. Rabin and the 
family of Yitzhak Rabin.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To Mrs. Rabin, to her family, to the people of Israel and to all 
people of goodwill everywhere, I conclude with the traditional 
Hebrew words of sympathy and condolence:
<P>
	Hamakom y'nahaim etkhem b'tokh sh'ar availai tziyon 
veeyerushalayim.
<P>
	May the Lord comfort you with all the mourners of Zion and 
Jerusalem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
send our deepest condolences to the family of Yitzhak Rabin and 
the people of Israel.
<P>
	Although Mr. Rabin has fallen, he leaves behind a tremendous 
legacy of peace and a lifetime of work for the people of Israel.
<P>
	As a soldier, Mr. Rabin learned to meet adversity with courage 
and determination, and as a statesman this courage continued as he 
dared to make peace with the Palestinians and with Jordan, even in 
the face of bitter criticism from the opponents of peace.
<P>
	In a world filled with conflict and strife, Mr. Rabin did not 
despair or allow anger to move him. He chose instead to dedicate 
his life to laying the groundwork for a peace that will be enjoyed by 
his children and grandchildren and by all the children of the Middle 
East.
<P>
	On this sad day, though the torch must be passed, Mr. Rabin is 
gone but the need for hard work in the name of peace endures. As 
Mr. Rabin said, we will continue the peace process. There is no 
alternative to that regardless of what the enemies of peace might 
do.
<P>
	We must remember these words. In so doing I join with all 
Canadians in hoping that others will step forward to finish the 
peaceful battle so well fought by Mr. Yitzhak Rabin, an example 
for us all.
<P>

preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

<P>
Question No.195-<B>Mr. Riis:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the government policy regarding the protection of workers 
from environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), (<I>a</I>) are there any estimates of the 
number of workers under the federal jurisdiction who are (i) exposed to ETS 
resulting from smoking where smoking is permitted, (ii) exposed to ETS 
resulting from smoking where smoking is not permitted, and if so, what are 
these estimates, (<I>b</I>) are workers who are exposed to ETS justified in quitting 
their jobs within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Act, and (<I>c</I>) since 
1989, (i) have any inspections been made to ensure compliance with the 
Non-Smokers' Health Act, and if so, how many, (ii) have any tickets been issued 
pursuant to the Non-Smokers' Health Act and if so, how many?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour):</B> The 
Non-Smokers Health Act affects almost 650,000 workers in about 
26,700 workplaces under federal jurisdiction and approximately 
240,000 employees of the Public Service of Canada.
<P>
	(<I>a</I>) (i) There is no estimate of the number or percentage of 
federally regulated workers who are exposed to environmental 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16253"> 16253 </A></B>
<P>
tobacco smoke resulting from smoking where smoking is permitted 
and (<I>a</I>) (ii) where smoking is not permitted.
<P>
	(<I>b</I>) Under the UI act, ``just cause'' for voluntarily leaving an 
employment exists where, having regard to all the circumstances, 
the claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving employment.
<P>
	Working conditions that constitute a danger to health or safety is 
one of the 13 specific circumstances identified by the legislation 
that may constitute just cause for voluntarily leaving employment.
<P>
	Before leaving the employment, a reasonable alternative for the 
person working in such a place would be to report the situation to 
the employer and/or the union so that the situation can be remedied 
within a reasonable period of time. If the situation still does not 
improve and the working conditions likely affect his or her health, 
a person could reasonably prove his or her point by means of a 
medical certificate or other similar document.
<P>
	(<I>c</I>) (i) The national statistics at our disposal reveal that from 
April 1, 1990 to March 31, 1995, there were 144 inspections and 
467 complaint investigations conducted under the Non-smokers 
Health Act.
<P>
	(<I>c</I>) (ii) Until the Contraventions Act (Bill C-46) is proclaimed, 
issuing warnings or initiating prosecutions are the only alternatives 
to ``ticketing'' an individual for non-compliance. To this end, 
labour branch officials ask the employer or employee to sign an 
assurance of voluntary compliance (AVCs), by which they make 
the commitment to cease the contravention within a specified 
period of time. Failure to do so can lead to prosecution. From April 
1, 1990 to March 31, 1995, a total of 156 AVCs have been received 
by safety officers and no prosecutions have been initiated.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">GOVERNMENT ORDERS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHEALTHACT">DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-95, 
an act to establish the Department of Health and to amend and 
repeal certain acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we consider Bill C-95, hon. members will want to 
reflect on the business of the Department of Health as it embarks 
on its new life, its new beginnings.
<P>
	The department is no longer responsible for social assistance. 
Does this reduce its importance in the national structure? Is it 
fading away? Is it weakened? Far from it. As I read the results, the 
Department of Health is now poised and primed to take on perhaps 
the greatest challenge it has ever known. It has gathered its strength 
in order to guard the health of Canadians through an era of stress, 
strain and dislocation that is testing us all.
<P>
	It is finding alternatives to the financial resources once thought 
inexhaustible but now known to be limited alternatives described 
by words such as collaboration, knowledge and intelligence, waste 
reduction and value for money. These are the watch words of the 
new department, focused today more than ever on health because it 
is focused on health alone.
<P>
	The basic facts of Bill C-95 are as follows. The department is 
renamed. Some inspectors are empowered. The social well-being 
dimension of health is acknowledged and there are to be charges to 
businesses for services that have business value.
<P>
	A new name means a new focus. This is what the bill is about, 
what is in the bill and who can object. It is eminently reasonable. It 
has been well set out by the minister and by other hon. members 
and the significance of the new name, the Department of Health, is 
personified in that single word because of the very importance of 
health to Canadians.
<P>
	I would go one step further. The Department of Health is a 
symbol of a new beginning. This nominal act speaks volumes about 
a determination to focus intensely on the health of Canadians, our 
most precious resource.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	The renamed department will continue all the essential work that 
has helped Canadians reach the top of the world rankings in health. 
However, it will do far more than maintain hallowed traditions. It 
intends to be a dynamic player in a world filled with new 
challenges and opportunities for health care.
<P>
	The department is in business to protect the health of Canadians 
but it is doing that business in a new way, streamlined by a new 
vision of the way things must work in the future.
<P>
	What indicators are there of this new approach? None is more 
practical or more telling than the consolidation in the department of 
11 separate activities distinguished as such even up to the recent 
main estimates into just four business lines. This move reflects 
what has been learned from the program review process and 
participation in the science and technology policy review. More 
than this, it  reflects a willingness to consult, to listen, to learn and 
to change.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16254"> 16254 </A></B>
<P>
	The first of the new business lines will position the department 
to support and renew the health system in Canada. It will try to 
achieve a better balance among health care, disease prevention and 
health protection and promotion.
<P>
	Quality health care services contribute to the health of the 
population, but good health is not simply the result of health care. 
Rather, it is more true to say health care is the result of ill health. 
Good health arises from a host of social, economic and 
environmental lifestyles and genetic factors.
<P>
	Hon. members are aware of the initiatives undertaken by the 
Prime Minister's national forum on health to determine the 
necessary and sufficient conditions for health and identify the root 
cause of illness. The recommendations of the national forum will 
guide the department in its efforts to make the system healthier for 
all Canadians.
<P>
	It will work with the provinces and territories to contain costs, 
including the costs of prescription drugs, in order to ease spending 
pressure on governments and the private health care system. It will 
lead consultation aimed at interpreting the Canada Health Act but it 
will not cease to enforce the act so that universal access to 
appropriate health care is maintained throughout Canada.
<P>
	Canadians look to the federal government, to hon. members here 
in the House, to create bridges among the provinces. They want us 
to ensure national standards for health care. They insist we 
intervene to remedy inequalities and protect infrastructure. For all 
of this the Department of Health is our means, our instrument.
<P>
	Another line of business the department has recently adapted 
will focus on the health problems of disadvantaged groups. This 
involves marshalling a number of existing programs toward this 
single objective. It involves new programs to be delivered in 
partnership with the provinces. As well, it involves improving the 
flexibility to respond when a new health need arises.
<P>
	The department will intervene to help protect those at most risk 
when it is clear that the federal government is placed to provide the 
best care at the lowest cost. Affordable health care of the highest 
quality is the aim, the objective, while eliminating overlap and 
duplication with the provinces and other partners.
<P>
	I will not dwell on the delivery of health services to First 
Nations, Inuit and the people of Yukon. I pass over it not because it 
is less important. Indeed it accounts for the largest share of the 
department's entire budget. I pass over it because it has been 
thoroughly explored in the representation of the minister and other 
hon. members speaking on the bill.
<P>
	This is the new business line that flows least change from the 
department's previous portfolio of responsibilities. Helping native 
people and northerners attain a level of health comparable to that of 
other Canadians who live in similar conditions has long been a goal 
of this department, a goal of this government. The goal has not yet 
been achieved, but great strides are being made in the right 
direction to serve the people of the north.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The fourth reconstituted business line of the Department of 
Health seeks to reduce the health risks to Canadians arising from 
food and drugs, from consumer products and medical devices, from 
disease and disaster. This is the regulatory and compliance thrust of 
the department. This is the heart of health protection, where the 
department stands on guard to preserve the health of Canadians. It 
is here that Bill C-95 adds some muscle and meat to the refocused 
mission of the Department of Health.
<P>
	The transfer of responsibility for the safety of consumer 
products and workplace equipment is formalized in the bill. 
Officials of the department get powers in the bill to inspect possible 
disease-carrying agents entering this country by way of foreign 
products. The costs of services provided to businesses may be 
recovered under a provision of the bill. If risks to Canadians are 
going to be managed effectively in an era of restraint, new ways to 
meet those costs must be found. This is one such way.
<P>
	The late Lewis Thomas was a physician who taught at Yale. He 
was a great essayist and was called the poet laureate of 20th century 
medical science. Dr. Thomas wrote that the term health industry 
provides the illusion that it is in a general way all one thing and that 
it turns out on demand a single unambiguous product which is 
health.
<P>
	Thus, health care has become the new name for medicine. Health 
care delivery is what doctors and nurses do along with hospitals 
and other professionals working with them. They are now known 
collectively as the health providers or the health team. Patients 
have become health consumers. Once we start on this line, there is 
no stopping.
<P>
	We tend to forget sometimes that health is not simply a product 
distributed in neat little packages from a constantly replenished 
inventory on a shelf somewhere. We also forget sometimes in our 
rhapsodies over a multibillion dollar health system that it 
ultimately comes down to one patient, often hurt and scared, and 
one medical professional who may or may not be sure either about 
the cause of the complaint or what to do about it. It is a face to face, 
one to one confrontation as to what to do. This reality is part of the 
new understanding of the department which will be renamed with 
the passage of the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16255"> 16255 </A></B>
<P>
	I take the minister at her word, given to doctors at the CMA 
leadership conference in March, that decisions will be based on 
solid Canadian values such as fairness, compassion and respect 
for the fundamental dignity of all people, of all Canadians.
<P>
	In the October edition of the <I>Fraser Forum</I>, which is published 
by the Fraser Institute, there was an article entitled: ``Two-tier 
health care system''. I quote from the article:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would say that of all the government health plans in Europe the German 
system is the king among the blind. However, it's still one-eyed, it is still 
inferior compared to a purely private system, I believe. Now, the German 
system does not guarantee universal coverage-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Canadian system is the best system, the single tier system. 
Only last week we heard that great American, Ralph Nader, telling 
us here in Canada to be vigilant, to be watchful and not to lose that 
single tier system where all Canadians have access to excellent 
health care.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak on Bill C-95 today. I am pleased to 
enunciate for the second time the new name, Department of Health, 
and the significance we in this government place on the health of 
our people and the well-being of all Canadians. It is because of this 
naming, the single word health, that we give no extended situations 
to other things but singly the health of Canadians and the 
prominence it will play within our government.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	I urge hon. members in this House to support the government 
with this very important bill. It is the fibre that helps this country 
maintain the strength of its unity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak on Bill C-95, an act to establish the Department of Health 
and to amend and repeal certain acts.
<P>
	The main change brought about by Bill C-95 is the change in 
designation from Department of National Health and Welfare to 
Department of Health. I welcome this opportunity today, because 
this bill speaks volumes about this government's intention to 
further centralize and strengthen its powers despite its 
pre-referendum rhetoric about decentralizing.
<P>
	On the face of it, this bill looks completely innocuous, technical, 
minor and inconsequential. Yet, some provisions of this bill could 
have a major impact on the exclusive provincial jurisdiction over 
health care.
<P>
	I will go over them rapidly because my colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois have already reviewed significant health issues since the 
beginning of the Canadian confederation. Just the same, it is 
imperative, in my opinion, to bear in mind what, obviously, this  
government tends to forget, and that is that, under the constitution, 
health is an exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Everyone agree on this. How can certain provisions of this bill 
be justified in that context, I wonder? I am referring in particular to 
clause 4, which states that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4.(1) The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include 
all matters-relating to the promotion and preservation of the health of 
people-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2)-the Minister's powers, duties and functions-include the following 
matters:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) the promotion and preservation of the physical, mental and social 
well-being of the people of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) the protection of the people of Canada against risks to health and the 
spreading of diseases;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) investigation and research into public health-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>d</I>) the establishment and control of safety standards-for consumer 
products-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>e</I>) the protection of public health on railways, ships, aircraft-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>f</I>) the promotion and preservation of the health of the public servants and other 
employees of the Government of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>h</I>)-the collection, analysis, interpretation, publication and distribution of 
information relating to public health; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>i</I>) cooperation with provincial authorities with a view to the coordination of 
efforts made or proposed for preserving and improving public health.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are provisions which are far-reaching and whose legal 
implications are difficult to foresee. This is especially worrisome 
since part of these are new provisions which were not found in the 
former act, that is to say the act respecting the Department of 
National Health and Welfare.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	This bill reveals the federal government's will to centralize, as 
do other facts. I refer you in particular to the red book published by 
the Liberal Party of Canada, which called for widespread 
consultations on health care in the form of a public forum. I quote 
from page 80 of the red book: ``The role of the federal government 
should include the mobilization of effort to bring together Canada's 
wealth of talent and knowledge in the health care field. This is a 
societal issue in which every Canadian has an interest. The federal 
government must provide the means to ensure that Canadians are 
involved and informed, and can understand the issues and the 
options''. These sentences speak for themselves and clearly show 
the Liberal Party's intentions even before they came to power.
<P>
	In June of 1994, the Minister of Health announced the creation 
of this forum. Though its own Minister of Health, Quebec 
vigorously denounced this initiative and refused to take part in this 
exercise. And Quebec was not the only province that registered a 
protest. To this day, no province is a participant in this forum.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16256"> 16256 </A></B>
<P>
	A few days before the referendum, some federal spokespersons 
changed their tune in order to win. They were focusing on change, 
decentralization, and powers to be negotiated with the provinces. 
What is happening now? Exactly a week after a significant vote 
that clearly revealed Quebecers' desire for change, we in this 
House are debating a bill that brings us back to the sad reality. 
No change can be expected from the current government.
<P>
	The government has no intention of relinquishing any of its 
powers, despite what it said before the referendum. I hope that the 
minister will fully comply with clause 12 of the bill, which reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>12. Nothing in this act or the regulations authorizes the minister or any officer 
or employee of the department to exercise any jurisdiction or control over any 
health authority operating under the laws of any province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, allow me to give a historical overview of the 
legislation and of the federal government's interference in the area 
of health care. First, let us not forget that section 92.16 of the 
Constitution Act gives the provinces overall jurisdiction over 
health issues on their territory, by providing the following, and I 
quote: ``-generally all matters of a merely local or private nature 
in the province''.
<P>
	Moreover, subsections 7, 13 and 16 of section 92 recognize the 
provinces' jurisdiction over hospitals, the medical profession and 
practice, as well as health care, on their territory.
<P>
	Health is clearly a provincial, not a federal responsibility. 
However, the federal government has always managed to interfere 
in that sector, either through legislative measures such as the Food 
and Drug Act, or indirectly through its spending power.
<P>
	Such interference has often generated tension and conflicts 
between the central and provincial governments. Quebec has 
certainly been the one denouncing most often and most directly 
Ottawa's interference in its field of jurisdiction. In 1919, the 
federal government established the health department and gave it 
the authority to provide grants.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In 1945, during a federal-provincial conference, the federal 
government proposed the establishment of a national health care 
program for which it would assume total responsibility. It should 
be pointed out that, in those days, after the war, the federal 
government exercised almost total control over the primary fields 
of taxation.
<P>
	In 1948, a national health grant program was set up. In 1957, the 
federal Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act was 
passed, followed in 1966 by the Medical Care Act. The Canada 
Health Act was then passed in 1984, after a long debate and a lot of 
criticism. The central government had decided to legislate to 
ensure that health care and services that were medically  necessary 
would remain accessible, available to all and free.
<P>
	That federal act had the effect of imposing on the provinces the 
obligation to comply with these principles, in spite of budget cuts 
that the central government would make in transfer payments to the 
provinces for the health sector. The federal government also gave 
itself the power to impose monetary penalties on non-complying 
provinces. That act establishes national standards, namely, as I 
said, the universality of services, accessibility, transferability from 
province to province, public management and comprehensiveness. 
If these standards are not met, Ottawa can withhold its transfer 
payments for health care.
<P>
	Based on the 1995-96 budget, Health Canada will spend some 
$1.5 billion to operate the program and some $7.4 billion in 
transfer payments. This department funds, among other things, the 
integration of people with disabilities, the fight against domestic 
violence, the new horizons program, the Seniors Secretariat, the 
fight against smoking, the national anti drug campaign, the national 
AIDS strategy, programs on pregnancy and child development, the 
Children's Bureau and the national health forum.
<P>
	I have always supported a health insurance scheme that is 
universal, free, provincially administered, funded by our taxes and 
available to all. I do not support a system with two tiers: one for the 
rich and the other for the poor. I am, for example, concerned about 
what is happening in the United States, which does not have a 
public health scheme, preventing millions of people from having 
access to proper health care. Health, in my opinion, is people's 
most precious possession. This is why we must protect this system, 
and make preventing disease and promoting health our priority.
<P>
	Naturally, with Canada's and Quebec's aging population, health 
care costs more and more. But services must not be rationed, nor 
cuts made unjustifiably. Unfortunately, Canada's entire health care 
system is in an acute state of crisis. Since the program's inception 
in 1977, the rate of growth of its funding has not kept up. This has 
meant a shortfall for the provinces. For example, in 1986, the 
federal government cut the rate of growth of transfers by 2 per cent. 
In 1989, the indexing factor was reduced by 1 per cent. In 1990, 
Bill C-69 froze transfers at the 1989-90 level for a two-year period. 
In 1991, the federal government extended the freeze another three 
years. All this time, the Liberals were vigorously criticizing these 
cuts.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Now that they are in power, they have totally changed their 
position and continue to nibble away at the Canadian health 
system. Scandalous.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that, between 1977 and 1994, Ottawa's 
contribution to the health system dropped from  45.9 per cent to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16257"> 16257 </A></B>
<P>
33.7 per cent, and Quebec and the provinces have had to absorb this 
10.6 per cent shortfall, with great difficulty.
<P>
	The forecasts for 1997-98 indicate that the federal share of 
funding will be 28.5 per cent. Total cuts for Quebec alone are $8 
billion dollars. To this must be added the $308 million reduction 
for 1995-96 and the $587 for 1997-98 in the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	Is this what the flexible federalism of the Liberal government 
means? The only thing it is decentralizing is the deficit.
<P>
	My fear is that these cuts will lead to the end of the health system 
as we know it. I am against social program cuts, as I have stated in 
this House on numerous occasions, particularly cuts in health 
programs through the drastic reductions in transfers to the 
provinces.
<P>
	I support the campaign by the Canadian Labour Congress, the 
CLC, to save the Canadian health system. This coming December 
5, the leaders of that organization will be here to meet some of the 
ministers and members as part of their campaign. The same battle 
is being waged in Quebec by the FTQ.
<P>
	As a sovereignist, I voted Yes on October 30 because of my 
conviction that we in Quebec can build a more just society, a more 
egalitarian, more humane society. I am concerned about the Liberal 
Government's lean to the right, its blind cuts in unemployment 
insurance, social assistance, old age pensions, postsecondary 
education and so on. I am concerned about the antisocial 
orientations, with their lack of concern for what becomes of the 
least advantaged members of society, developed by the 
governments of Ralph Klein in Alberta and Mike Harris in Ontario, 
both Conservative governments.
<P>
	In addition, I am greatly concerned about the right-wing, 
sometimes ultraright philosophy of the Reform, particularly when 
it comes to immigration, firearms control, cuts and the battle 
against the deficit.
<P>
	The British Columbia NDP government's decision to refuse 
social assistance to anyone who has not been in the province for 
three months concerns me.
<P>
	So, nearly all of English Canada is aligning along the most 
conservative of lines. In my opinion, the federal government ought 
to show some compassion, understanding and generosity towards 
our poor and needy fellow citizens. Canada has the means to 
protect the unemployed, the welfare recipients, the sick and so on.
<P>
	My wish in closing is for the federal government to do 
everything necessary to preserve the health system in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the 
words of the member for Bourassa. I wonder if he could clarify a 
few things.
<P>
	He again reminds us that he is a sovereignist. I do not know what 
that has to do with this bill. I would remind him to reflect on the 
words the former Premier of Quebec and his own leader used about 
the kinds of people they want to live in that part of Canada. So 
when he says he is a sovereignist, I assume he means that he is a 
Canadian sovereignist.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I get this feeling in statements in the foreign affairs committee 
and in the House that to that party everything seems to be a 
provincial jurisdiction. There seems to be nothing left for the 
federal government and provinces to co-operate on. Here is a bill 
that calls for co-operation to maintain health standards across 
Canada and keep costs down, and the hon. member cannot even 
support that.
<P>
	He quoted from clause 2. I refer him to paragraph (i), where the 
minister's powers, duties, and functions relating to health include 
``co-operation with provincial authorities with a view to the 
co-ordination of efforts made or proposed for preserving and 
improving public health''. Is the hon. member honestly against this 
kind of a bill?
<P>
	He also went on to say that he is against the two-tier system. 
Great, I agree with him. So am I, and so is everyone on this side of 
the House, the government side. How does he expect to prevent the 
two-tier system if he allows health care to be the total 
responsibility of the province?
<P>
	My wife happens to live in Ontario and her brothers live in 
Quebec. Their mother used to switch from Quebec to Ontario. She 
would live at her son's at one time and at her daughter's another 
time. If each province is responsible for its own health system, 
their mother could not have done that. Under the present system 
she was able to move from province to province and have her 
prescriptions, doctor bills, and everything covered. Thank God, she 
lived to 89. She had gone through Siberia and had the kind of life 
that no one would want to hear about in this House. Yet she lived in 
this country happily until she was 89 because of the health system 
in this country and because of the standards that were kept from 
province to province.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to clarify what he means. He is 
against the two-tier system, yet he wants no federal involvement at 
all. How does he expect to maintain Canadian standards if he wants 
health to be the sole jurisdiction of the provinces?
<P>

<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
remind the hon. member, as I did in my address, that health is a 
provincial matter, not because I say so, but because the constitution 
says so. Very clearly. I quoted section 92 earlier.
<P>
	I am sure, as I have already said, that we in Quebec are capable 
of providing care to the entire population, care funded from our 
taxes, quality care. We in Quebec have no need of the federal 
government to provide our entire population with such care.
<P>
	Furthermore, the health system in Canada is at risk today, not 
because of the provinces, but because of federal cuts in transfers to 
the provinces. That is where the true danger lies.
<P>
	I think that the hon. member ought to get up to criticize his own 
government's cuts in the system of transfers to the provinces. I 
trust that he will react to the next federal budget because it will 
seriously aggravate the situation. The government will be making 
cuts everywhere, including health care, in the next budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to comment on the hon. 
member's statement.
<P>
	Much has been said about paragraph 4.(2)(a) and that it in fact 
has begun to encroach on provincial jurisdiction. I would like to 
refer the hon. member to clause 12, which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nothing in this Act or the regulations authorizes the Minister or any officer or 
employee of the Department to exercise any jurisdiction or control over any 
health authority operating under the laws of any province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That clearly specifies that the bill does not move into provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I will quickly touch on the issue of transfer payments. In 
1991-92 federal health transfers as a percentage of provincial 
expenditures were 31.2 per cent. In 1993-94 to Quebec it was 31.9 
per cent. In 1994-95 it was 31.7 per cent. In 1995-96 it is 32.2 per 
cent. I may not be an accountant but I surely know that is an 
increase in terms of percentage of expenditure.
<P>
	The major transfer to Quebec will approach $11.7 billion in 
1995-96. It will account for over 30 per cent of Quebec's estimated 
revenues in 1995-96. It means that roughly $1,590 per person is 
spent in Quebec by the federal government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez: </B>Mr. Speaker, briefly, I appreciate the hon. member's 
comments but I find that there are certain contradictions in clause 
12 of this bill, which have been pointed out by the critic for our 
party. Furthermore,  practice and experience have shown us that, 
even where there are clauses to forbid federal interference in 
provincial matters, the federal level retains the spending power, 
which it sometimes uses to interfere unduly in provincial matters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the last number of years a significant trend has occurred in 
health care in Canada in relation to the average length of stay that 
Canadians have in hospitals. In Ontario alone the average length of 
stay has reduced from some seven days to about 4.2 days.
<P>
	There has also been a major shift toward ambulatory care. Rather 
than having people go to the hospital and wait for a day for surgery 
and so on, they come in on the same day of surgery and are out a lot 
quicker; similarly with regard to maternity.
<P>
	The member should also appreciate that there have been 
substantial changes in medical technology as well as in 
medications and that in fact Canadians are living longer today than 
they have historically. They continue to live longer. In addition 
there has been a tremendous elimination of duplication of services 
between hospitals and community agencies.
<P>
	All this results in a substantial reduction in health care costs. Yet 
the member will clearly find out, if he checks the figures, that our 
health care institutions province by province have been able to 
service as many or more Canadians with less facilities. Those are 
the savings.
<P>
	Because the savings have been achieved by the provinces the 
federal government has not achieved any benefit from the savings. 
The member should realize that health care is much cheaper to 
provide now and that the cuts simply reflect the lower cost of 
providing health care to all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said in my speech, I am in favour 
of a universal health system that is free of charge and funded from 
tax revenues. I think that this is a major benefit for the population, 
and one I would not like to see endangered. That is why I would 
invite the hon. member across the way to pressure the Minister of 
Finance to stop making cuts in transfer payments to the provinces 
in order to finance the health program.
<P>
	Contrary to what the hon. member states, I feel that costs are on 
the upswing at present, particularly because of longer life 
expectancies. The population wants care, increased care. In my 
riding of Bourassa there are very many seniors who complain of 
not having proper health care. We can work together to improve the 
system, but not to destroy it, as you will by making cuts in the 
health field.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I say that 
it gives me a great deal of pride today to speak in support of Bill 
C-95 to establish the Department of Health.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	My pride lies not just in the federal government's record of 
accomplishment and achievement in the broad health domain, 
although I have a great deal of pride in that, but also in a health 
system that is the envy of the world. On top of that I have pride in 
the knowledge that the genius of Canada's Constitution is found in 
the fact that the world's finest health system did not come about at 
the expense of a fundamental respect for the letter and spirit of our 
Constitution.
<P>
	While we are batting around our good and much maligned 
Constitution I should like to make a slight comment. Members of 
either the official opposition or the third party who are fond of 
making comments about the Constitution could perhaps learn a bit 
if they would read the Constitution. Many of the misapprehensions 
we have heard from both those opposition sides might be cleared 
up if they would merely read it. Maybe they need some help in 
reading it. However they should read it.
<P>
	We could speculate on how the Fathers of Confederation would 
have dealt with health care had they any idea of the enormous 
technological changes that would take place in the first century of 
our country's history and in the even more profound technological 
advances that continue to arise each and every day. Perhaps we 
could speculate on how the Constitution would have been written if 
anyone in 1867 could have imagined the day when health 
expenditures would account for about one-tenth of Canada's 
economy.
<P>
	Last Thursday the hon. member for Drummond enumerated the 
various heads of power over health the Constitution assigns to 
provincial legislatures. She drew particular attention to subsections 
92(7), 92(13) and 92(16) which deal with health institutions, 
property and civil rights, and local matters. The hon. member could 
have added that subsection 92(2) deals with local taxation and 
spending and has health implications.
<P>
	Those listening to the hon. member's stirring defence of 
Canada's Constitution could have been forgiven for thinking that 
everything the Constitution has to say about health is encapsulated 
in subsection 92. The fact of the matter is that other subsections 
also have considerable relevance. In the interest of peace, order and 
good government and in the interest of ensuring the people of 
Canada understand what is actually happening I should like to 
name some of them.
<P>
	Subsection 91(27) gives the Parliament of Canada exclusive 
jurisdiction over criminal law. ``Ah'', I hear some people cry, 
``what does that have to do with  health?'' I will tell them. It is the 
basis of a number of statutes protecting public health and safety. 
That is federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Subsection 91(2) assigns to the federal Parliament 
responsibilities for international and interprovincial trade. It again 
supports the basis for federal regulations, as a small example, in the 
area of drugs and medical devices. That is federal jurisdiction once 
again.
<P>
	Subsection 91(11) gives the federal Parliament explicit power 
over quarantine and marine hospitals. That is an interesting 
sidelight. It reveals a good deal of the thinking in 1867 about where 
matters cease to be local and take on national significance: 
quarantine and marine hospitals. It is not too big a stretch to see 
that should be and indeed is constitutionally within the federal 
domain.
<P>
	Subsection 91(7) concerns the military and veterans. It is 
federal. Subsection 91(8) has to do with the federal public service 
and subsection 91(4) concerns aboriginals and lands reserved for 
aboriginals.
<P>
	All these powers account for a great deal of the federal role in 
health. They account for the considerable array of the duties and 
responsibilities set out in clause 4 of Bill C-95 and by extension 
they account for the vast majority of Health Canada's operating 
expenses.
<P>
	When viewed from the perspective of federal constitutional 
responsibilities, health is clearly a great deal broader than my hon. 
friend's narrow view of health care delivery, important though that 
is. No one in the Department of Health and no one on the 
government side is trying to minimize the responsibility of the 
provinces in health care. It is clearly not my intention to reopen the 
Constitution on this occasion but to separate myths from reality, 
particularly as they regard the application of federal spending 
powers in the health field.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I will again reiterate my earlier comment. The Constitution is a 
wonderful compilation of documents that has been much maligned 
both by the official opposition for obvious reasons and by the third 
party for reasons I can only claim are obscure. Most of their 
reasons are pretty obscure to me.
<P>
	The biggest myth is that the spending power broadens the sphere 
of federal regulation. The reality is that nothing in the Constitution 
gives the federal Parliament the means to regulate provincial 
matters in the guise of spending power. Perhaps I could say it again 
very slowly. It can attach conditions to the funds it makes available 
to the provinces. However, just as it cannot compel the provinces to 
accept the funds it offers, neither does it buy jurisdiction when its 
offer of funds is accepted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16260"> 16260 </A></B>
<P>
	Clause 12 of Bill C-95 makes the limitation clear just as the 
existing Department of National Health and Welfare Act also 
makes it clear. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nothing in this act or the regulations authorizes the minister or any officer or 
employee of the department to exercise any jurisdiction or control over any 
health authority operating under the laws of any province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is why the Canada Health Act does not forbid user fees. It 
does not require that provincial legislatures forbid them. It simply 
makes it clear that any province which decides to finance medically 
necessary health services through such means cannot count on 
receiving the full amount of financial assistance the federal 
government is prepared to offer.
<P>
	This brings me to the matter that the federal government is 
intruding into provincial prerogatives. There is an immense 
distinction to be drawn between intrusion and involvement. The 
motivation for the federal government's involvement in health 
financing does not derive from any desire to centralize powers or to 
colonize a field of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The federal role in health care has been the exercise of 
leadership. There are those who would hold that leadership is a 
dirty word or a symptom of megalomania. I hold differently, as do 
members on this side of the House. I hold that leadership is a 
characteristic all Canadians value. All Canadians from all regions 
of the country expect and demand their federal Parliament to 
display leadership. It is not a dirty word. It is a great word which 
we over here absolutely applaud.
<P>
	It is here that doctors and hospitals cease to have just local 
significance. The value that all Canadians share transcends being 
merely local. The importance that all Canadians attach to the 
principles of universal health care is a defining characteristic of the 
Canadian psyche. This is who we are. This is what we stand for. 
This is what we are proud of and this is what we fight for.
<P>
	How is it possible to overlook this aspect of health care? I do not 
understand it. It is beyond me. At a time when all Canadians 
welcome the positive forces of reconciliation and partnership, I 
cannot understand how we in the House would allow ourselves to 
ignore the positive contribution that the federal government has 
made and continues to make to the health and well-being of all 
Canadians and to the articulation of the spirit of community that 
hold us in high regard the world over.
<P>
	Before I close I should like to tell a little story about something 
that took place in my first session of Parliament in the House when 
we were in opposition. There had been a debate, again I believe it 
was an opposition day debate on the question of health care. After 
the debate was over, I joined two of my colleagues, one from my 
own region of Atlantic Canada and another from Ontario. We 
talked about how important medicare and the Canadian health care 
system was to each one of us.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	It turned out that each one of us had had fathers who had suffered 
and families that suffered because of injury and illness prior to the 
development of medicare in this country, prior to the Canadian 
health care system. We came from three different backgrounds, 
from three different areas of the country, but all three of us 
remembered what it was like in childhood and how our families 
had suffered because the Canadian health care system had not yet 
been put into place, put into place I might add by the federal 
government, a federal Liberal government.
<P>
	This is why I am pleased to have had an opportunity to speak in 
support of Bill C-95. This is why I and my colleagues on this side 
of the House in the Government of Canada will fight and maintain 
the Canadian health care system in the face of all odds.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak today in the debate on Bill C-95, 
an act to establish the Department of Health and to amend and 
repeal certain acts.
<P>
	I feel particularly concerned by this bill since in my riding, 50 
per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and the 
quality of health care is extremely important. Although the 
government claims it is only a technical bill, its purpose merely to 
change the name of the Department of Health, that is not the case.
<P>
	Since 1919, we have seen the same situation time and time 
again. Once more, the federal government has shown its desire to 
invade provincial jurisdictions, as we will show later on.
<P>
	I must firmly condemn the latest in a series of hijackings by the 
federal government. It hijacked the jurisdiction of the provinces 
over health care. It started many years ago in 1945, and it is about 
to finish the job.
<P>
	Particularly revealing in this respect is the well known national 
forum on health. This forum, announced during the election 
campaign in the fall of 1993, was established a year later. Its 
mandate was very clear: to develop a vision of the future of 
Canada's health care system, foster discussion with Canadians on 
their health care system, identify priorities for the future and 
achieve a broader consensus on the changes that are required.
<P>
	We know that the provinces, which according to the constitution 
have jurisdiction over health care, are not involved in the forum.
<P>
	What this means? The answer is simple. Instead of showing 
some willingness to respect the jurisdictions of the provinces, the 
government has simply gone over their heads without consulting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16261"> 16261 </A></B>
<P>
them. The membership of the forum is a case in point, and I quote 
the Minister of Health: ``The forum now has 22 members with a 
vast experience in health care, either as professionals,  volunteers 
or consumers, and it will be a pleasure to join them in the months to 
come to work on a wide range of issues''.
<P>
	As you can see, the federal government did not bother to appoint 
representatives for the provincial governments. Consumers, 
professionals and volunteers come under the exclusive jurisdiction 
of the provinces. If any doubts remain as to the determination of 
this government to get the provinces out of this area, let me 
eliminate them immediately by quoting what was said by the 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health at the twelfth 
international convention of the International Society for Quality in 
Health Care last May. She said, speaking on behalf of the 
government: ``Canada has already taken many steps to achieve its 
goal: renewal of the health care system. We are reinforcing the 
community aspect of health care, improving the role of consumers 
in this respect and looking for a more integrated approach to health 
which goes beyond care as such''. She went on to say: ``We want to 
improve the effectiveness and quality of health care, and one of our 
common priorities is to promote the use of guidelines for clinical 
practice. We want health care to focus on the practices that are most 
effective for various high-risk groups''.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	These are fighting words for the provinces. Since when has the 
community aspect of health care or the role of consumers and 
health care been a federal responsibility? Are these not the 
exclusive responsibility of the provincial governments?
<P>
	Why did the federal government, as it paid lip service to 
eliminating duplication and overlap, set up the national forum on 
health? I wonder. The answer is clear: this government is caught up 
in its desire for centralization and its obsession with encroachment. 
It never intended to withdraw from the areas of provincial 
jurisdiction it has invaded with impunity since 1919.
<P>
	It is too bad that public opinion and the opinion of governments, 
including that of Quebec, are not important at all to this 
government. If only this duplication could be an asset, but 
unfortunately, that is not the case, as we shall see.
<P>
	Let us look at the repercussions of this obnoxious policy on 
provincial governments. In Quebec, the provincial government has 
for a number of years considered the changes that will be necessary 
to deal with budgetary constraints and at the same time improve 
health care services to the public.
<P>
	Through broad public consultations, Quebecers had a chance to 
express their needs and expectations and help identify priorities 
and implementation mechanisms. The Quebec government's action 
plan is ready and is now being implemented. Is there any 
justification for the expense of the new consultations carried out by 
the  forum? Would it not have been better to respect the autonomy 
and jurisdiction of the Government of Quebec and transfer all 
moneys concerned directly to it for the benefit of Quebecers?
<P>
	I am sure this option never crossed the mind of the federal 
Liberals. Now it cannot be done, because the federal Minister of 
Health announced in March her firm intention to direct all health 
policy matters.
<P>
	As they were thus assuming their so-called leadership, they cut 
transfers to the provinces, thus depriving those who provide the 
services of the funds they need to set up their own policies. In fact, 
provincial governments, not only Quebec, will have to slash health 
spending. In addition to their own budget constraints, they will 
have to deal with cuts in federal funding.
<P>
	Once again it will be women who feel the effect. A report on 
women's health prepared by the International Federation of 
Gynaecology and Obstetrics revealed a year ago that women were 
sick or incapacitated longer than men. Moreover, as their life 
expectancy is longer than men's, it is primarily they who will be 
deprived of necessary health care because of the expenses arising 
from duplication in health matters and cuts in federal spending.
<P>
	For Quebec, these cuts represent more than $8 billion over 10 
years. The provinces were not consulted, although they have to 
incorporate them and suffer the wrath of their citizens. We have to 
bear the unbearable.
<P>
	Allow me to conclude with a quote from an article that appeared 
in <I>La Presse</I> on March 4, 1995, which aptly summarizes the 
situation. It said that, together with the provinces, Ottawa would 
have to establish a list of essential services that would continue to 
be covered by the health insurance plan. It felt that this was the way 
Ottawa intended to allow the provinces to deal with increased 
health costs in a context of reduced federal transfers. In the end, 
according to the article, the bill for services not considered 
essential would have to be paid by taxpayers.
<P>
	The aim of Bill C-95 is to enshrine government control over 
health. We have no intention of supporting this greed, which will 
mean Quebecers and Canadians alike will suffer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the comments made by my colleague from Quebec. 
She raised what I think is an extremely important point, which I 
would like her to develop further.
<P>
	She talked about centralization and decentralization. We now see 
that the federal government, in particular the Department of 
Health, is trying to centralize a number of health matters, 
especially the general direction of health care in Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16262"> 16262 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	At the same time, we see that the provinces, including Quebec, 
want to make innovative, creative decisions to better manage 
health care within their territories. In Quebec, there is a wide 
consensus to decentralize health care decisions to administrative 
regions. I am not talking about Canada's administrative regions but 
about administrative regions in Quebec. We see that the people 
want to be able to define in their own communities the kind of 
health care services they need and to have access to them.
<P>
	This is in complete opposition to the tendency evident in the 
federal government's measures. Our concerns are justified. The 
federal government's centralizing vision is totally out of touch with 
the expectations of people in every province, including Quebec.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member for Quebec to expand on this, to 
give the people listening to us and the members of this House an 
overview of Quebec's favoured approach, which seems to strike a 
chord in some other provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course, this debate we are having 
today, members and ministers of previous governments have 
already had it. Legislation has been passed since 1919 that 
basically encroaches on provincial areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	That is not what the constitution of 1866 intended. What it 
intended was for the provinces to have full and complete 
jurisdiction over health, education and manpower training. I think 
that what is happening-When I look at the federal government's 
expenditures, I think that the problem comes from the federal 
spending power.
<P>
	Federal spending for 1995-96 is $1.5 billion for operations, $347 
million for personnel and $703 million for goods and services. If 
this money had been transferred to the provinces, Quebec and the 
other provinces would have had more money for health care, and 
would not have had to impose budgetary restraints and to cut back 
personnel and services at the taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	What do you do at a forum? You discuss. You try to find a way to 
sing the same tune as the other provinces. But in the end, as 
minister Rochon pointed out in the Quebec national assembly, all 
that the provinces do at meetings and federal-provincial 
conferences is complain about not having enough money. There are 
costs involved with holding forums and conferences. When you do 
not have enough money, you stop discussing and start acting.
<P>
	And in acting, you need money to follow these actions through. I 
think that agonizing choices lie ahead. Quebec's goal has always 
been to provide a safety net in several areas such as social services, 
health and education.
<P>
	The federal government is driving us back against the wall by 
providing less funding. Federal transfers to the provinces have 
been reduced by $8 billion. Who does the public turn to? To the one 
making the cuts, the one that says: ``We will not be improving 
services this year because we do not have enough money. Instead, 
we will be downsizing''. As a result, employees too are concerned.
<P>
	I think that I am not the first person to make this point. Since 
1919, other parliamentarians, from Taschereau to Jean Lesage, 
have made it before me. I think that there must be some truth in 
what we say. I cannot understand the federal government. We have 
to keep hitting it with the same arguments over and over again. 
What a waste of time. Time has come to act. And to act, we need 
money.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the speech made by the hon. member. I 
would like to try to put this in a simpler context. I think what the 
hon. member was saying and what many Bloc members are saying 
is that they would like the province to be totally responsible for 
health care with no federal involvement whatsoever.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to give the member a simple example and ask the 
member's comment on one particular aspect of health care that we 
take care of, and that is the research, study, and recommendations 
to deal with specific problems Canadians have. One of them I am 
quite interested in is fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects. 
That disease affects about one in 500 births. It also accounts for 
five per cent of all fetal defects in Canada. That particular disease 
results in central nervous system disorders, brain damage, 
cognitive problems, attention problems, and so on. It is a very 
serious problem.
<P>
	The federal government, using part of its money, one of many 
studies and programs it does, looked into this in 1992 and 
apparently is coming out again with a joint statement with the 
provinces with regard to a strategy to deal with fetal alcohol 
syndrome and fetal alcohol effects. That is just one example.
<P>
	Does the member not agree that there are problems of health in 
Canada that are much better dealt with as a national Canada-wide 
effort-AIDS, aboriginal health, alcoholism, drugs, and so 
on-and are better handled by the federal government rather than 
handled individually in each and every province?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not deny that there are health 
problems, but the provinces are certainly able to meet the needs of 
the public. The federal government is not there to set standards, 
organize forums and make  studies. Rather, its role is to transfer 
money to the provinces, so that they can act directly where it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16263"> 16263 </A></B>
<P>
needed. I do not deny that there are problems with alcoholism. 
However, I believe that Quebec is certainly capable of setting up its 
own programs and making realistic decisions, based on the existing 
demand and need.
<P>
	You talk about national standards. These may be appropriate for 
a province, but less so for another. When you set national 
standards, you must also provide financial support. We are 
discussing eligibility for all. I agree with that principle. However, 
do you not think that the federal government jeopardizes access, 
for the population as a whole, to quality health services, by 
spending and generating costs without even seeking our approval?
<P>
	The issue is not health care, but transfer payments and the 
provinces' responsibility.
<P>
	As I said before, ministers and members of provincial 
legislatures, not only in Quebec, have been wondering about 
decentralization since 1919. The word ``decentralization'' was not 
invented in Quebec. Other provinces are also concerned. Just look 
at what is happening in Ontario and in British Columbia, which 
will pass a law that may not please everyone. The federal 
government interferes in fields of provincial jurisdiction. Given 
that $603 million is spent on goods and services, and another $347 
million on personnel, the federal should let the provinces spend the 
money where it is really needed and avoid duplication of services 
and personnel.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to address the House in support of Bill C-95, an act 
respecting the Department of Health.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the minister 
who proposes this bill for the efforts she has made over the past 
year to defend and strengthen the principles enshrined in the 
Canada Health Act that underpin Canada's magnificent medicare 
system. I might add, it is a system of which I was proud to be a part 
in my previous position as a health care professional.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	The department this bill deals with is an essential part of the 
fabric of this nation. The minister has said that it touches the life of 
every Canadian every day. Medicare in Canada transcends 
medicine. It is both a service for Canadians and a critical bond with 
Canadian federalism. Without it we would suffer as individuals and 
as a country.
<P>
	It is essential that medicare be sustained and strengthened and 
that it remain as a bond within the country. This is the challenge 
and the responsibility of this department. This is the reason for 
Health Canada,  and the reason I will support Bill C-95 without 
reservation.
<P>
	It is true that the provinces have primary responsibility for the 
design and delivery of health care services. This is as it should be. 
Health care is a local responsibility. Doctors and hospitals work in 
communities. Provincial control of health care is not a weakness of 
the system, it is a considerable strength. The values, beliefs, wants 
and aspirations that define Canada and the Canadian identity are 
not unique to any sector of the Canadian population or to any 
region of this great country of ours. But the circumstances in which 
health care is delivered differ across regions, and the health care 
needs and priorities of these regions will differ. What we have is an 
opportunity system, where 12 variations on a common set of 
principles all going at medical problems in slightly different ways 
provide administrators and practitioners in different parts of the 
country with the opportunity to learn from each other.
<P>
	The provinces plan, manage, and operate the health care system, 
but through the exercise of the federal role and through its transfers 
to the province, a national health system is the reality in Canada.
<P>
	There are clearly many important health matters that require 
national leadership and co-ordination. There would be little to be 
gained, for example, if the work of the federal laboratory for 
disease control were duplicated in each province.
<P>
	Many federal initiatives in the areas of health promotion and 
disease prevention have stimulated provinces, public health 
authorities, and non-governmental organizations to work to 
improve the health of all Canadians. Health Canada also has a 
special role to play with respect to the delivery of certain health 
services to First Nations, which will continue until the process of 
devolving responsibility for self-government has been completed.
<P>
	After World War II ended, our forefathers and our predecessors, 
federal and provincial, looked down the road and asked what kind 
of nation we wanted to have. What kind of health care system do 
we want to have? What kinds of values do we have? As a country, 
as a people, and as the Liberal Party, we concluded that top-flight 
medical care was of paramount importance. We also recognized 
certain principles of fairness, equity, and efficiency that reflect the 
ideal of Canadians. Out of all this, our system of medicare was 
assembled just over a decade ago. It was anchored by the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	If I may remind hon. members, the Canada Health Act came into 
being in order to defend the principles that were the foundation of 
medicare, principles of equal and universal access, principles that 
were even then under attack by various schemes that allowed extra 
billing and user fees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16264"> 16264 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1983, extra billing in various provinces amounted to $100 
million, a total that had doubled over the previous five years. An 
erosion of medicare was taking place. The erosion was stopped 
by the minister in 1984. When there were signs of it restarting 
in 1994 under the guise of private clinics, it was stopped again 
by this minister, who has insisted that the federal government will 
ensure that the fundamental principles of the health care act are 
maintained.
<P>
	The minister has said that it is not her intention to preclude the 
use of private clinics, which are often a cost-effective way to 
deliver services. She has said though that they have the potential to 
create a two-tiered system of health care: one level of service for 
the wealthy and another for the rest of Canadians. This is 
unacceptable today, just as it has been unacceptable through all the 
years we have been building and defending Canada's medicare 
system.
<P>
	There is no mistaking where Canadians stand on this issue. 
Canadians want effective federal leadership in the health field. This 
is evident from the favourable reaction to the minister's 
announcement regarding user fees at private clinics.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	Hon. members who have concerned themselves with the 
evolution of the health care system will be familiar with the work 
ofDr. Michael Rachlis. He was co-author of <I>Second Opinion</I>, an 
influential book that examined the Canadian system. Dr. Rachlis 
recently criticized the combining of public and private medicare, 
saying ``it entails a wrong prescription for what is wrong with our 
health care system and then issues a wrong diagnosis''.
<P>
	Frank Maynard, former Deputy Minister of Health for Manitoba, 
warned:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We already have the beginnings of a two-tier system; we should not enlarge it. 
Health care is not a commodity, so it is not a valid choice to offer the rich faster 
access to required medical service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Wendy Armstrong, president of the Alberta chapter of the 
Consumers' Association of Canada, wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What happens is private clinics choose to treat things with the least risk of 
complication, least overhead cost and with potentially high volume. It's 
skimming the cream.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I could multiply these quotations by the hundreds, but I will 
conclude with only one. This segment is from a letter to the editor 
published by the <I>Calgary Herald</I> on October 16, 1995:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is time for Albertans to stand behind the federal government and demand 
universality of health care. This issue has nothing to do with political affiliation. 
It has everything to do with preserving a cornerstone of what makes Canada the 
best country in the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That just about sums it up. We are all in it together. For the most 
part we are all delighted to be in it, because there is no better 
system to be in, anywhere in the world.
<P>
	The role of the Department of Health is to sustain and improve 
Canada's health system, to keep it intact. That is why I support the 
department, and that is why I support this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we know 
that transfer payments for health and postsecondary education have 
been reduced over the last several years.
<P>
	I personally asked the Minister of Health to give me the figures 
in constant dollars on a per capita basis. There has been indeed a 7 
per cent reduction over the last four or five years. Obviously, this 
has had an impact on the provinces' ability to assume their 
responsibilities with regard to health.
<P>
	In Quebec, for example, we know that the Minister of Finance 
has announced a $1.5 billion reduction in transfer payments for 
health and postsecondary education for next year. At the same time, 
we learn that the federal government is going to spend $2 billion to 
buy armoured vehicles.
<P>
	There is some type of dichotomy here. I want to believe that we 
do need armoured vehicles, but health is also essential. Armoured 
vehicles will not be much help to us when we get sick. There are 
societal choices to be made.
<P>
	I know that Quebec would not have made that choice. I know 
that if Quebec had collected its tax money directly from the 
taxpayers, it would not have chosen to invest that money in 
armoured vehicles rather than in health care.
<P>
	I would like my colleague opposite, if she can listen to me, to 
talk about the societal choices that are made here, in this House, 
and that have an impact not only in Quebec but in every province. 
These are the choices that have Canadians increasingly worried 
about their province's ability to provide them with the health care 
services they need, considering the fact that they have paid for 
these services but, for some reason or other, that money seems to 
have come to Ottawa on a one way ticket.
<P>
	How is it that this money finds its way here but is not being 
returned where it should to fund something as essential and 
fundamental as health?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Lip service is a nice thing, but here we should do something 
more. We heard from the MP opposite. I am waiting for your 
answer.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
questions. To reassure the member, I indeed was listening. I had my 
earphone in and I did understand his question.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16265"> 16265 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	I can certainly vouch for the efficiencies within Health Canada 
as a health care professional. Dollars are being cut and a lot of 
Canadians are going to suffer.
<P>
	The member can rest assured that with efficiencies within Health 
Canada, new technologies and research and development, they 
enable us to work more efficiently with less dollars and to look at 
eliminating duplication and look at where services can be done 
differently. This is the direction we are headed. It does not mean 
that Canadians will be getting less health care, but that they will get 
health care that all Canadians can afford, rich or poor. I can attest to 
that avenue in the health care system or any other department.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like the hon. member to expand in other areas the act covers 
besides the medicare or health insurance component.
<P>
	One concern I have is in relation to section 4(2)(a) where it 
actually says that the department will be responsible for the 
promotion and preservation of the physical, mental and social 
well-being of the people of Canada. What I am thinking about here 
is the social well-being component of the statement. With the 
removal of welfare from the health and welfare department making 
it strictly health, does the hon. member not think that addressing 
the social well-being aspect is being inhibited now by having to 
deal and collaborate with other departments? Following on that, the 
Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs was deleted and a 
lot of that mandate when to industry.
<P>
	I feel that the department is being diluted in its ability to address 
the actual social component.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for her 
question. We have worked hard at health committee meetings and I 
understand her sincere question.
<P>
	There has been sufficient research and involvement within 
Health Canada to make this diversity within the ministry as to who 
best can allocate for all Canadians. I believe the right choice has 
been made by looking at the ministry and the Department of 
Consumer and Corporate Affairs working in conjunction with 
Health Canada. It is going to be more productive because of the 
avenues taken and it will be beneficial to all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment the hon. member for Lambton-Middlesex on her 
debate on this important bill.
<P>
	I know the member is a nurse by training. I also know she is a 
member of the important health subcommittee on AIDS. It is an 
important issue for all members to understand that the federal 
government has a role to play in terms of major diseases such as 
AIDS which affect all Canadians.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member would like to comment on the work 
she has seen through the subcommittee on AIDS that the federal 
government has been doing for the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be one of the members on 
the subcommittee for HIV-AIDS. It certainly has been a learning 
experience to say the least, to sit on that committee and hear 
witnesses.
<P>
	The ministry has been allocating dollars proportionately to 
research regarding HIV-AIDS. Many issues have been addressed. 
This disease certainly is not under control by any means, judging 
from the stats that come by our desks daily. The dollars that have 
been funded through the minister have been allocated most 
effectively. I hope that in the not too distant future we will see 
positive ramifications from those dollars. There has been very good 
ongoing research.
<P>
	Again, sitting on that committee has been a learning experience. 
I am sure its work will be most valuable to the House.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened a 
few moments ago to the answer of the hon. member opposite. She 
said that access to health care should not depend on the wallet, that 
poor and rich people should have equal access to services. I could 
not agree more with that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> I thank the members opposite for applauding 
these words. However, the question is: What kind of services? I 
have a problem I want to share with the hon. member. She will 
probably have an interesting answer and I am eager to listen to it.
<P>
	Two years ago, former first minister Bourassa had skin cancer. 
Where did he go for treatment? Washington, D.C. I want to know if 
people with a fat wallet will have to cross the border to get proper 
treatment. How come Mr. Bourassa could not be treated either in 
Quebec or in Canada? What was special? How would health care in 
Canada be able to cope with such a situation?
<P>
	I am sure the member has a proper answer and I am eager to hear 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I again thank my hon. colleague with 
whom I had the pleasure of working on the health committee. I 
know his question is most sincere.
<P>
	With respect to that individual, I believe it was freedom of 
choice. It was his choice to seek medical help elsewhere. I can also 
relate a story. My husband had a heart attack five years ago. I did 
not have to go south; I was able to deliver my husband to an 
emergency room. He was having a heart attack and they did not ask 
me what my bank account was. I was able to go in there with my 
only concern being to make sure my husband had the  best health 
care service. I knew he had it because that is Canada's health care 
system.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> This brings questions and 
comments to a close. It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, 
to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment is the following one: the hon. member for 
Mackenzie-public works.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will now move on to the next stage of debate. We have 
exhausted the five hours of debate with 20-minute speeches and 
10-minute questions and comments. We now go to straight 10 
minute speeches without questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with my 
colleagues to speak to Bill C-95, an act to establish the Department 
of Health and to amend and repeal certain acts. I want to assure all 
Canadians who are watching today's debate that this is a 
housekeeping bill. It is not a bill encroaching on provincial powers. 
It is not a bill kidnapping powers. It is not a bill discussing a two 
tier system, one for the rich and one for the poor.
<P>
	In any of the polls done, it has been shown that 89 per cent of 
Canadians believe we have the most important and the best health 
care system in the world. They believe in the principles involved in 
the health act: universality, portability, accessibility, 
comprehensiveness, public administration.
<P>
	Health Canada has certain responsibilities that are implicit in its 
mandate. Bill C-95 is attempting to make this explicitly 
acknowledged. Bill C-95 is before the House at a time when so 
many things within the world of biomedical technology are before 
us.
<P>
	Bill C-95 affirms a whole series of things we promised in our red 
book. Partnership and co-ordination are words that are very 
important to us as we move on this issue. Those are the reasons for 
this proposed legislation. It is to confirm the existence of the 
Department of Health and to specify that mandate working with the 
provinces, working for a holistic approach to health, taking into 
consideration the social as well as the physical and mental 
well-being of our population.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	This proposed legislation contains a series of provisions 
concerning the transfer of responsibility. I want to affirm-I think 
there was general agreement on all sides-that the history of 
universal medicare and the health department are intertwined.
<P>
	The department has played an essential role in the evolution of 
medicare from its infancy in the 1950s and 1960s to its current 
status as one of the most respected health systems in the world. 
Why is Canada's health  system so respected? One of the reasons is 
that it is predominantly a single payer, publicly financed health 
system. That unique feature of our health system has been there 
from the beginning.
<P>
	When we were putting in place universal hospital insurance 
coverage under the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services 
Act, the federal government cost shared the start up of this 
component of the health system. The same happened when it came 
time to establish universal coverage for physician services under 
the Medical Care Act. Federal cost sharing was essential to 
assisting provinces and territories in establishing their medical care 
insurance programs. Medicare as we know it would not have gotten 
off the ground without the federal role in and commitment to health 
and its financing.
<P>
	Cost sharing gave Canada universal hospital and medical care 
insurance, but cost sharing had its shortcomings. The change in 
financing arrangements in 1977 to block funding under the EPF, 
established programs financing, provided the provinces and 
territories with the flexibility necessary to focus beyond the 
traditional hospital and medical components of their health 
systems.
<P>
	Anyone who says that the federal government is not a financial 
player in health is not looking at the numbers, which I will provide. 
In 1995-96, $15.5 billion in EPF health contributions will go to the 
provinces and territories. The long tradition of block funding and 
the flexibility it affords provinces and territories in their health 
programs will continue with the Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	Scheduled to begin in 1996-97, the CHST will transfer $26.9 
billion to the provinces and territories for their health, 
post-secondary education and social assistance programs. In 
1997-98, the CHST will contribute $25.1 billion. No one is denying 
the importance of the CHST reductions but let us put these 
reductions in perspective.
<P>
	The reduction of $2.5 billion for 1996-97 amounts to less than 3 
per cent of total estimated provincial spending on health, 
post-secondary education and social services and less than 2 per 
cent of provincial government revenues. The CHST is a balanced 
and fair approach to dealing with Canada's deficit and debt in 
making our health system fiscally sustainable.
<P>
	Federal transfer reductions do not threaten our universal publicly 
financed health system. The minister has said this over and over in 
the House. Let us not be fooled by those who say it will and that 
privatization will save the health system.
<P>
	The Canadian experience bears out results from studies by the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the 
World Bank. Both have said that cost containment is more 
successful in health systems with a high share of public financing. 
The public  share of health expenditures in Canada was about 72 
per cent in 1993. The rest, 28 per cent, came from private sources 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16267"> 16267 </A></B>
<P>
ranging from employment based supplementary benefits to 
individual out of pocket purchases.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	In terms of cost control the public sector succeeded in containing 
the rates of increase to 2 per cent in 1993. Private sector health 
expenditures grew three times faster, with an increase of 6.4 per 
cent.
<P>
	Canada's publicly financed, single payer health system has the 
built in capability to pull various levers to rein in costs. Global 
budgets for hospitals and capping payments to physicians are two 
examples which come to mind. There are many others which 
provinces and territories can use without resorting to privatization 
or putting national health principles in jeopardy.
<P>
	The federal government and the Department of Health played a 
key and necessary role in building our publicly financed, single 
payer health system which continues to reflect the values of 
fairness and equity on which the system was originally built. The 
need for a strong federal presence and role in health remains 
important in ensuring that fairness and equity are at the centre of 
our health system.
<P>
	I assure all Canadians, especially the seniors in 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore who are watching the debate in the House, 
that Bill C-95 is a housekeeping bill and deserves the attention of 
all members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to speak today to Bill C-95. Health is one of the 
most important things in Canadian life, if not the most important. 
The human being is the most valuable resource we have. We can 
talk about resources, human and natural, but it is our human 
resources which make Canada the best country in the world.
<P>
	Today a fundamental piece of legislation for the operation of the 
federal government is under discussion. Contrary to what has been 
implied in the House, the role of the federal government in health 
care is very important. It is crucial for the continued health and 
well-being of Canadians.
<P>
	Everyone is familiar with the major role the federal government 
has played as the architect of a national health insurance system for 
Canada. Everywhere in the world it is regarded as an excellent 
example of public sector innovation in a crucial field of service 
provision. We should not forget what the health system in Canada 
was like before the advent of national health insurance.
<P>
	Lack of infrastructure in the health area was highlighted during 
the Depression when financing was so desperately short that many 
doctors had to go on relief in the western provinces because 
patients could not pay their bills. Military recruiting drives for 
World War II demonstrated the poor health of the overall 
population, especially military aged males.
<P>
	Saskatchewan pioneered the national health insurance model, 
first for hospital services and then for medical services.
<P>
	The national health system we have today owes its origins to the 
leadership of consecutive federal governments, first to build 
infrastructure with hospital grants, with the Hospitals and 
Diagnostic Services Act and the Medicare Act, and in our own era 
with the Canada Health Act and established programs financing.
<P>
	Who among us doubts the importance of this multi-decade effort 
to build a national health insurance system, both in terms of nation 
building and in terms of the security it provides each and every 
Canadian that their medical needs will be met regardless of their 
pocketbook.
<P>
	We should not forget that the Canada Health Act, the last 
incarnation of this major national effort, is a piece of legislation 
which received all-party support in 1984.
<P>
	Since this government was elected it has taken its 
responsibilities under the Canada Health Act very seriously. Under 
the private clinics policy a rigorous distinction is being drawn 
between the public health sector for insured services and 
entrepreneurial medicine. This is a critical distinction. No 
Canadian should be able to buy his or her way to the front of a 
queue for services. Services ought to be rendered on the basis of 
medical need, not by the pocket book.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	As important as the CHA is, however, it is but a small part of the 
federal role in health. Health Canada is operative across Canada to 
ensure that the food Canadians eat, the drugs they consume and the 
medical devices they use are safe. It is important to recognize how 
much the department is operative behind the scenes to guarantee 
security in these areas. For example, for well-being during a baby 
examination, the immunization series is provided by a provincially 
paid practitioner but the quality of the vaccine and vaccination is 
ensured by the federal government.
<P>
	Health Canada also plays a major role in encouraging both the 
public and private sectors to promote health and prevent illness and 
accidents.
<P>
	Whatever the hazard of the day, smoking, AIDS, nuclear 
fall-out, radon, ebola, the plague, there is a Health Canada 
employee with direct responsibility for ensuring Canadians have 
the information they require to reduce their risk and that they are 
aware of the various protective strategies that exist to combat risk. 
They can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16268"> 16268 </A></B>
<P>
build on those factors in their social and physical environment 
which will ensure Canadians are protected now and into the future.
<P>
	Let us look at an instance of how this works. The ebola scare is 
fresh in Canadian minds. The Quarantine Act was recently invoked 
to ensure there was no risk of the ebola virus spreading in Canada. 
Networks of federal officials from Health Canada and, with Health 
Canada's lead, many federal departments were mobilized to ensure 
security was always in place to reduce risk and follow up on any 
and all suspicious circumstances.
<P>
	Working with Canadians across this great country of ours, using 
our public health intelligence of the highest calibre, Canadians 
acquired worldwide respect for their handling of the ebola crisis 
and their management of a situation with a high potential for panic 
and public disorder.
<P>
	Ebola is but one of the many instances in which Health Canada 
rolls into action to protect Canadians. Many hazards have less 
public profile. Many require detailed risk assessment to determine 
how they should be managed. At all times Health Canada has the 
responsibility for dealing with the national dimensions of hazards 
to health and reducing them to ensure the high quality of life 
Canadians enjoy.
<P>
	Another key role in the department is in the population health 
area. Recently we have come to understand the power of taking 
population and sub-populations as the primary unit of analysis in 
the development of health policy and programming. The health 
status of populations is heavily influenced by a number of key 
health determinants including biology, income, education, 
environment, to mention a few. The department is now in the 
process of operationalizing the health determinants perspective on 
issues with the help of many of the country's most creative thinkers 
in the health area.
<P>
	As an illustration, take Canada's children as a key 
sub-population. Concern is increasing about key social indicators 
such as rates of youth offences and incarceration. Quite recently 
there was a study on young women which is very troubling partly 
because of our poor economy.
<P>
	The preconditions for these increases in rates are set much 
earlier in the development of a young person. There are recognized 
determinants that are predictors of pathways that lead to healthy 
child development; for example, supportive families, social 
networks, parental employment and so on. There are others that are 
strong predictors of difficulties in achieving healthy development; 
for example, inadequate nutrition, high risk socialization patterns.
<P>
	Important policy factors in development include developing 
positive relationships, experiencing success and developing 
self-esteem.
<P>
	We need to take these types of development considerations into 
account if we are to build a society in which all young people are 
able to thrive.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Health Canada is working to make this possible. Programs such 
as prenatal nutrition and aboriginal headstart are breaking down 
many of the barriers to a healthy development.
<P>
	With a population optic on these issues and key investments 
targeted early in life, we will achieve much to reverse some of 
society's most ingrained problems.
<P>
	Health Canada has therefore a major role to play in improving 
Canadian society. Proof of these important efforts lies in the high 
quality of life Canadians continue to enjoy despite the rigours of 
the economic climate of today, the quality of which is unrivalled in 
the world and will do much to strengthen the federation as we 
proceed to implement the important post referendum change 
agenda.
<P>
	I come from a rural riding. In that riding medicare is important 
but with the changes we have, the changes in technology for 
instance, practitioners and people with experience could use video 
conferences. We will be recruiting very young, good positions and 
finding ways to look after rural ridings.

	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (for the Minister of the Environment, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-94, an act to regulate interprovincial trade 
in and the importation for commercial purposes of certain 
manganese based substances, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will explain to the House what is in Bill C-94 and why 
we are taking immediate action against MMT. I will also respond to 
some of the misplaced concerns expressed by members of the 
opposition as well as identify why the government is addressing the 
MMT question.
<P>
	As many members are now aware, MMT is a manganese based 
fuel additive used to increase the octane rating of gasoline. It has 
been used in Canada since 1977 as a replacement for lead in 
unleaded gasoline. Lead was phased out of virtually all Canadian 
gasoline by 1990. Canada is one of the few countries that use 
MMT. The United States banned it from unleaded gasoline in 1978.
<P>
	Gasoline containing MMT adversely impacts the operation of 
sophisticated onboard diagnostic systems. These OBD systems are 
important because they monitor the performance of emission 
control components in vehicles.
<P>
	The auto industry has made the decision that it will no longer 
accept the risk of increased warranty repair costs caused by MMT 
related damage.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	Some companies have even indicated they will disconnect the 
OBD systems in whole or in part and may reduce Canadian vehicle 
warranty coverage starting with the 1996 model year if MMT 
continues to be used in Canadian gasoline. That means the 
increased cost of maintaining these systems would be passed on 
directly to the Canadian consumer.
<P>
	The Canadian Automobile Association is a 3.7 million member 
consumer advocate organization for automobile owners. During its 
presentation to the standing committee it articulately outlined 
concerns facing Canadians both environmentally and 
economically. It stated that MMT is a heavy metal based fuel 
additive. When the sensors of the OBDs are coated with the heavy 
metal they cannot properly detect oxygen.
<P>
	It is easy to see then that when sensors give a false reading, the 
warning light signals the motorist and the motorist would bring the 
car in for unnecessary warranty covered repair work. This cost will 
undoubtedly be transferred to the consumer down the road in the 
form of higher automobile sale prices, making already difficult  car 
purchases an impossibility for many prospective car buyers.
<P>
	Because the new OBDs are an advanced system of detection that 
catches ignition problems as soon as they fall below standard, the 
CAA states that the new system of OBDs will be one of the best 
things that could happen to cars from an environmental 
perspective, and if MMT would reduce its effectiveness, CAA 
wholeheartedly endorses a ban on the substance.
<P>
	Consumers will opt not to use MMT in their fuel. The Reform 
Party is against this ban. The Reform Party should remember to 
represent its constituents and not take the position of defending a 
special interest lobby group against the wishes and protection of 
the people of Canada.
<P>
	Who is the Reform Party standing up for, Ethyl Corporation, an 
American based firm which is the sole manufacturer of MMT? 
Ethyl Corporation manufactures MMT in the U.S. and ships it to 
Canada.
<P>
	The Reform Party claims there is no reason for this bill. It says 
the minister is unilaterally pushing the legislation through. This 
process began under the previous government, which saw the 
necessity to examine the MMT question.
<P>
	Last October the Minister of the Environment urged both the 
automotive and petroleum producing industries to voluntarily 
resolve the issue of MMT in Canada by the end of 1994, otherwise 
the government would take action. This deadline was subsequently 
extended into February of this year to review automobile and 
petroleum industry proposals.
<P>
	The matter was not resolved and so the federal government has 
had to step in. The result is Bill C-94. The MMT issue is no longer 
an industry dispute and this is important to understand. Its outcome 
can affect the vehicle emissions programs we are putting into 
place. It could also negatively impact the automotive sector which 
would pass the newly incurred costs on to the Canadian consumer.
<P>
	Some members of the House have gone so far as to suggest 
MMT creates great benefits for Canada's environment. They 
suggest that nitrous oxide emissions are reduced by 20 per cent 
when MMT is used. What they do not say is that this claim is based 
on data collected by Ethyl Corporation, the makers of MMT, from 
test cars that were driven 50,000 to 110,000 miles. This was then 
extrapolated to 195,000 miles.
<P>
	This does not take into consideration the adverse wear and tear 
of the automobile which is degraded over time. Because of this it 
has been determined that there has been no rigorous scientific basis 
for applying the Ethyl Corporation's average emission values to 
Canada-wide projections.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16270"> 16270 </A></B>
<P>
	When examined in the context of the current Canadian fleet, 
Environment Canada's analysis indicates that NOx reduction 
would be only about 5 per cent. This has been substantiated by 
the University of Waterloo institute for improvement in quality 
and productivity. The report also indicates that the results of a 
study by Ethyl Corporation on reduction of NOx emissions greatly 
overestimates the reductions in NOx.
<P>
	The Ethyl Corporation experiments have not been shown to be 
representative of field vehicle use, and the scientific rigour of the 
experiments is uncertain.
<P>
	Ethyl's research was conducted and presented by a private 
consultant from the U.S. When I asked about the extreme 
differences in statistical data between the Ethyl Corporation report 
and the University of Waterloo analysis, she replied: ``Statistics is 
not an exact science. There isn't only one right way to look at a set 
of numbers''.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	As every member of the House knows, the University of 
Waterloo is a Canadian university whose research is of national and 
international acclaim. The University of Waterloo does not have a 
particular vested interest, being a public university. So whose 
interpretation of the statistics is more likely to be in the public 
interest?
<P>
	What would the Reform Party know about scientifically proven 
environmental concerns? Very little. This is the same Reform Party 
whose member for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia 
stated earlier in the House: ``There is an awful lot of voodoo 
science around with respect to the effects of man made carbon 
dioxide on global warming''. Can anyone believe this? Voodoo 
science?
<P>
	I am continuously shocked by statements made by the Reform 
members who choose to ignore accepted realities. Ninety-nine of 
the one hundred and ninety-six living Nobel Laureate scientists 
along with roughly 2,000 other world scientists jointly signed an 
urgent warning to humanity. In their declaration they appealed to 
the people of the world to take immediate action to halt the 
accelerating damage threatening humanity's global life support 
systems.
<P>
	I quote from their media release when I say human activities 
may so alter the living world that it will be unable to sustain life in 
the manner we know. A great change in our stewardship of the 
earth and the life on it is required if vast human misery is to be 
avoided. This kind of consensus is truly unprecedented.
<P>
	The urgent appeal goes on to say that no more than one or a few 
decades remain before the chance to revert the threats we now 
confront will be lost and the prospects for humanity immeasurably 
diminished.
<P>
	The Reform Party openly scorns the leading scientists of our 
planet. Voodoo science? Is the Reform Party suggesting the Nobel 
Prize is a mystical, voodoo award?
<P>
	To return to the claim by Ethyl Corporation of a 20 per cent 
reduction of NOx emissions, if this 20 per cent reduction claim 
were true, why would the people who make cars in this country be 
working hard to make onboard diagnostic systems so advanced if 
MMT fuel could do the job by itself? The reason they are working 
hard is simple. MMT does not provide the answers to NOx 
reduction that its makers claim. Let us be very clear about this.
<P>
	Los Angeles has some of the worst pollution problems in North 
America. California has taken strong action against environmental 
pollutants, including a ban on the use of MMT. If MMT is what 
Ethyl Corporation and the Reform Party advocate as a product to 
reduce NOx emissions, perhaps they should consider why the state 
of California has acted decisively on the issue.
<P>
	Canada is one of the few countries that uses MMT. While we are 
on the topic, some members opposite are citing a recent U.S. court 
hearing in favour of the Ethyl Corporation, the producers of MMT. 
MMT will still be banned in California and in those states that 
require federal reformulated gasolines to be used. That means 30 
per cent of the United States will continue with the ban on the use 
of MMT in fuel.
<P>
	Furthermore, witnesses have told the committee that given the 
negative consumer attitudes toward MMT it is very likely 
consumers will demand to use MMT free gasoline, just as the 
consumers have chosen to use unleaded gasoline. What is more, we 
have yet to see if the U.S. government will appeal the decision.
<P>
	Some members opposite also quite conveniently fail to talk 
about what the onboard diagnostic system does and what can 
happen if and when MMT causes the system to fail. Onboard 
diagnostic systems are designed to monitor the performance of 
pollution control systems, in particular the catalytic converter, and 
alert the driver to malfunctions.
<P>
	If the OBD system is not working a 50 per cent reduction in the 
efficiency of the catalyst translates into a twofold increase in 
emissions compared with a properly functioning vehicle. What we 
are talking about is the failure of new emissions technology in 
automobiles resulting in increased car emissions harmful to our 
environment.
<P>
	Let us also be clear about the economic impact of removing 
MMT. Some members of the House have suggested the cost would 
be in the billions of dollars. In fact the costs will be small for the 
entire petroleum industry. Estimates of the costs of MMT removal 
provided by the industry itself range from $50 million to $83 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16271"> 16271 </A></B>
<P>
million per year which means an additional  one-tenth to 
one-quarter of a cent per litre increase at the pumps.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, likely alternatives to MMT would be produced in 
Canada, creating more jobs and opportunities for Canadians, 
whereas MMT is produced exclusively in the U.S. My question to 
the members of the Reform Party is why are they opposing this 
bill? Whose interests are they protecting?
<P>
	The bill has a number of important improvements for Canadians. 
here are some of the key highlights of the bill. It will prohibit the 
import or interprovincial trade for a commercial purpose of MMT 
or anything containing MMT. It will give the minister the power to 
authorize exceptions for MMT that will not be used in unleaded 
gasoline subject to a monitoring requirement. Coverage of the act 
can be expanded by order in council to cover other manganese 
based substances used in automotive fuel.
<P>
	The act is binding on all persons and entities including the 
federal and provincial governments. The enforcement tools are 
similar to those in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The 
penalties are strict. For the unauthorized import or interprovincial 
trade of MMT the maximum penalty on summary conviction is a 
$300,000 fine and/or six months in jail, and on indictment the 
maximum fine is $1 million and/or three years in jail. For 
knowingly providing false or misleading information on the 
importation or interprovincial trade of MMT the penalties are the 
same but with a maximum of five years in jail instead of three on 
indictment.
<P>
	On conviction, as in CEPA, the court can also order an additional 
fine equal to the monetary benefits resulting from the offence, 
prohibit conduct that may lead to a repeat offence and direct the 
offender to notify third parties about the conviction.
<P>
	In summary, we have two polarized positions on this issue. On 
one hand, over 20 automotive manufacturers, competitors, 
independently came to the same conclusion that MMT is harmful 
to OBD systems on their cars, OBD systems that are necessary to 
reduce emissions. The CAA, a consumer advocate organization, 
supports this position. A report from the University of Waterloo 
supports its claims with regard to NOx emissions. It has undertaken 
a considerable amount of work to prepare its support of the ban. If 
MMT really reduced NOx in the quantities suggested by Ethyl 
Corporation it could reduce emissions for the automotive 
manufacturers for free.
<P>
	On the other hand, we have an American company, the sole 
manufacturer of MMT, holding an opposing position. I remind the 
House that Ethyl Corporation fought against the reduction of lead 
in gasoline in 1984.
<P>
	This legislation is for Canadians. It is to protect Canadians from 
increases in automobile prices. It is legislation to protect our 
environment by ensuring the  effective use of new, advanced 
onboard diagnostic systems for cleaner exhaust emissions. It is my 
commitment to the people of York-Simcoe for a better 
community.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
are now at third reading of Bill C-94, an act to regulate 
interprovincial trade in and the importation for commercial 
purposes of certain manganese-based substances.
<P>
	This bill is more directly aimed at prohibiting the commercial 
use of MMT in Canada. MMT is added to gasoline to raise its 
octane level, and, consequently, to improve engine performance. 
The Minister of the Environment reached this decision on April 5, 
and today we are being asked to vote on the decision to ban the use 
of MMT in Canada.
<P>
	But the minister has not been very convincing in this matter. 
Indeed, there are many questions on this bill, which remain 
unanswered, and the minister totally refuses to look at them. She is 
dismissing all other analyses, studies and solutions put forward. It 
cannot be said that open-mindedness and a sense of conciliation are 
the strongest qualities of the Minister of the Environment, who is 
also Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	In this case, as in many others, the minister has decided and 
stands firm, in spite of the strong opposition of the petroleum 
industry and Ethyl, the company producing MMT. The minister is 
closing her eyes and seems to be simply responding to the 
carmakers' lobby which, strange coincidence, is concentrated in 
her part of the country.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	I am not saying that the automotive industry does not have valid 
reasons or arguments for not wanting MMT in its vehicles. I am 
simply saying that the minister is leaning to one side and that she 
does not listen to the arguments of the other side. But this attitude 
on the part of the Minister of the Environment is not new. In many 
other instances, she has acted the same way.
<P>
	There is, among others, the ongoing and very disturbing case of 
the <I>Irving Whale</I>. Once more, the minister, through her lack of 
openness which, in my opinion, looks more and more like a lack of 
competence, is creating very serious problems that threaten the 
environment. The issue of the <I>Irving Whale</I>, a total fiasco, is a case 
in point.
<P>
	By refusing to take into account studies made by Marex and 
CEF, the minister has embarked on an adventure which is 
dangerous for the environment of the gulf and which has already 
cost $12 million. This amount represents the total cost initially 
forecasted and the barge still lies on the bottom of the gulf.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16272"> 16272 </A></B>
<P>
	It must be pointed out that the method chosen is not the safest 
one. The operations we saw this summer proved it and smacked 
of amateurism. I would also underline that the barge is still 
leaking, now more than ever. According to a report of the 
Canadian Coast Guard, more than 500 litrres have recently leaked 
from the wreck.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Davenport on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Madam Speaker, I am sorry to interrupt, but I 
believe that the hon. member is not dealing with the bill presently 
before the House, Bill C-94.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I believe you have raised a 
matter of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Madam Speaker, there are facts which have to be 
brought to light and this is part of the bill. The minister does not 
want to go further on this issue as in the case of the bill we are 
debating today. She stubbornly refuses to be further advised on 
such important decisions that have to be taken. Her reasons for 
refusing any new course of action clearly appear to be unfounded.
<P>
	I would even go further and say that the minister definitely 
shows her bad faith on many issues, as we saw during Question 
Period in recent days. Her answers to questions relating to the 
environment showed her ignorance and incompetence. All she tells 
us, and I think it is totally childish and silly, is that, when he was 
Minister of the Environment, Mr. Bouchard, our leader, said this 
and that, did this, did not do that, and so on. This is how the 
minister has been answering our questions for the last two years.
<P>
	Come on. Let us be serious and exercise a little intellectual rigor. 
On any other question, she is big on quotes, which proves that she 
is no authority and misinformed on important issues. Frankly, I 
think that such behaviour from a deputy prime minister is quite 
alarming.
<P>
	As for the <I>Irving Whale</I>, she rejects the solution recommended in 
the Marex study, although it was commissioned by her department 
and the Coast Guard-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I recognize the hon. 
member for Davenport on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Madam Speaker, I am sorry but again I must remind 
the member that the bill is about gasoline and the manganese 
content of gasoline. It is not about the <I>Irving Whale</I>. I invite the 
member to discuss the bill-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Again, this is a matter of 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Madam Speaker, as for the <I>Irving Whale</I>, the 
minister says she rejects the solution recommended in the Marex 
study, although it was commissioned by her department and the 
Coast Guard, because, according to her, this firm has financial 
interests in the pumping method it recommended.
<P>
	Last week, after last summer's failed refloating attempt that cost 
us $12 million, the minister said she was rejecting the offer to 
strike an expert panel to review the issue, made by the Société pour 
vaincre la pollution, or SVP, on account of Daniel Green's financial 
interest in this proposal. I recall that, last year, the minister went as 
far as claiming in this House that SVP had gone bankrupt. She has 
some nerve. What is obvious is that the minister is always trying to 
discredit those who think differently from her in order to 
compensate for and hide her incompetence and lack of action in 
several areas
<P>
	Discrediting is what the minister does best. On another-

for Davenport, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Madam Speaker, again I am sorry, but it seems to 
me that we must adhere to the rule of relevancy. We are debating 
Bill C-94.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would ask the member to 
make a connection between her comments and the bill before us.
<P>
	The member for Gaspé, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Madam Speaker, currently the Bloc 
Quebecois is the official opposition in Ottawa. Whether they like it 
or not, people will have to listen to what we have to say. The 
member for Davenport is simply filibustering.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> This is not a point of order.
<P>
	Resuming debate. The member for Laurentides.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Madam Speaker, if I was allowed to make my 
speech, the connection with Bill C-94 would become obvious; I 
would ask the member for Davenport to listen for once and stop his 
filibustering during my speech. I will respect his to the extent he 
will respect mine. Allow me to continue.
<P>
	To another question I was asking him regarding-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> It is about time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Madam Speaker, could you call the member to 
order and ask him to show some respect?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> I can go on then. I asked the minister another 
question concerning the ban on PCB exports to the United States. 
The minister said in this House that she was making 
representations to the EPA, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency.
<P>
	A few days later, we received confirmation from the chair of the 
hearings on the PCB issue that the EPA had never heard from our 
environment minister on that issue, in spite of the invitation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16273"> 16273 </A></B>
<P>
extended by the EPA to the  minister. Just smoke and mirrors once 
again, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	Why is the minister saying such poppycock? Does she really 
think Canadians are that naive?
<P>
	It is easy to see that environmental stakeholders are 
disenchanted with the minister's performance. She who was to be 
the great champion of the environment became the great 
speechmaker on the environment instead. As we say in Quebec, she 
is all talk and no action.
<P>
	Bill C-94 follows this erroneous way of-

Peterborough, on a point of order.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
listened to part of this speech on television and I have just arrived 
in the House. I was under the impression that we were debating Bill 
C-94, the Manganese based Fuel Additives Act. I wonder if I have 
arrived at the wrong time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would ask the member to 
make sure her comments relate to Bill C-94.
<P>
	The hon. member for Gaspé, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Madam Speaker, two liberal members 
have now interrupted my colleague. She is doing a good job.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu): </B>This is not a point of order 
either.
<P>
	The hon. member for Laurentides.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Madam Speaker, I will go on until my speech is 
finished.
<P>
	Bill C-94-I hope this will please my colleagues-is just one 
more example of this improper way of doing our best. The minister 
started out with an idea and she will not change her mind, even if 
her idea is not the best one. It is impossible to go any further with 
other studies and analyses. The minister said no, and her no is 
irrevocable. Yet, there is room for debate on the issue of MMT. Let 
us look at the arguments both sides are making, and try to find the 
best route to follow.
<P>
	First, we will talk about the MMT lobby, which is composed of 
oil companies and Ethyl Corporation. This lobby came to defend 
MMT before the standing committee, besides meeting many 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	The MMT lobby tells us that by removing this additive from 
gasoline, we will aggravate the problem of urban smog, since we 
are increasing the nitrogen oxide emissions by 20 per cent. Health 
Canada studies indicate that the MMT additive does not constitute 
a major threat for human health.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Independent laboratory experiments prove that, contrary to the 
statements made by the automobile lobby, MMT used in Canada is 
totally compatible with the new onboard diagnostic systems for 
pollution control, the OBD-II systems.
<P>
	Also according to the MMT lobby, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency should reintroduce this additive very soon in 
that country. In fact, under an October 20 ruling by the United 
States Court of Appeal, District of Columbia, in the case Ethyl v. 
Browner, chief administrator of the EPA, the EPA has been 
compelled to register MMT as an additive for unleaded gasoline, 
something the EPA had refused to do until now. In its ruling, the 
court stated:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On November 30, 1993 the EPA found that MMT had no adverse 
effects on automobile emission control systems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Consequently, the EPA was recognizing de facto that MMT did 
not adversely affect pollution control systems. At the refining 
stage, MMT allows to reduce some polluting emissions. It would 
cost refineries about $100 million in capital and about $10 million 
in operating expenses to replace MMT. Plants would then have to 
extend the whole refining process. Extra refining costs more 
money and pollutes more.
<P>
	So, these are essentially the arguments made by the MMT lobby. 
I want to emphasize that, to substantiate its arguments, only Ethyl 
Corporation made a series of experiments on the effect of MMT on 
vehicle pollution control devices. You tell us that those tests go 
back quite some time and that the same components are no longer 
used? That may be, but Ethyl was the only one to conduct those 
tests, which seem to prove that MMT does not gum up the systems.
<P>
	Furthermore, the carmakers' lobby claims that MMT affects the 
emission control system and more specifically the electronic 
pollutant detection system. In concrete terms, this system uses a 
light to indicate that your car's emission control device is 
defective.
<P>
	However, there is no scientific evidence to sustain the theory of 
MMT causing a malfunction of this light. The carmakers' lobby 
tells us they have evidence, but they have made nothing public to 
prove it. Besides, the industry in the United States is only just 
beginning to conduct scientific tests to support its claims.
<P>
	To bring more pressure to bear, the minister, together with the 
carmakers' lobby, is claiming that it could cost as much as $3,000 
more to buy a car, that guarantees could be reduced, and even that 
the famous detection device could be disconnected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16274"> 16274 </A></B>
<P>
	After checking recently, we found that the guarantees on 1996 
cars have not yet been changed, contrary to what the minister was 
claiming. This pressure can be seen as a form of blackmail on the 
part of the industry, but according to the minister, it is serious.
<P>
	The other major argument used by the minister has to do with the 
harmonization of fuel standards in Canada with those in the United 
States. Now, as we saw earlier, the U.S. could very soon have the 
same MMT rates that we presently have in Canada. Some even talk 
about next December, when close to 50 per cent of American 
refineries could use MMT.
<P>
	If this should happen, the minister, who is now talking about 
harmonization, would look rather silly. Why not wait a few weeks 
and see what happens in the United States? This is what both sides 
are saying.
<P>
	The minister, who naturally tends to lean towards the car 
manufacturers' lobbyists, has decided to order this ban, not 
because of the toxic or polluting effects of the MMT on health, but 
because of its impact on a new electronic system being used in cars.
<P>
	MMT in itself is not recognized as a toxic or hazardous product 
as evidenced by the fact that the minister cannot regulate the use of 
this product through the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 
or CEPA, which deals with toxic substances. The minister has no 
other alternative but to pass a specific act on the sale of this 
product.
<P>
	In her press release dated April 5, the minister indicates that this 
decision follows almost two years of discussions between the oil 
industry and the automotive industry. One can wonder about the 
relevancy of these discussions and their true value, since the 
minister has warned both parties that, if they did not come to an 
agreement, an act banning MMT would be passed.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	In saying so, was the minister not telling the automotive 
industry: ``There is no need to discuss this much further, since I 
support your position and will legislate on this matter.''
<P>
	Again, the minister was showing her clear support for the 
automotive industry, which does not want to use MMT anymore 
and does not seem to support any of the fuel additives. Therefore, I 
wonder what will happen to ethanol, a favourite among additives, 
for which the government has recently set up a $70 million 
investment program.
<P>
	If the automotive industry does not want to hear about additives, 
why would the government want to develop such a product? What a 
blatant inconsistency it is to ban one additive while speaking of 
developing another one, when the automotive industry does not 
want any additives at all.
<P>
	How can we be sure that the automotive industry will not soon 
ask the government to ban ethanol because of its negative effects 
on a component or some equipment used in their cars? It is 
certainly not easy to rule in favour of one side or the other. The 
arguments used look valid. However, the ball is now obviously in 
the court of the automotive industry and of the minister who, once 
again, has not done her homework in a responsible and transparent 
manner.
<P>
	Granted, the automotive industry knows these systems well but 
its concerns about the effects of MMT are not based on scientific 
studies. It is important to note that the automotive industry has 
made great progress in the exhaust emission control over the past 
25 years. According to a study by the Canadian Automobile 
Association, the adoption of emission standards has greatly 
improved air quality. Indeed, the study reveals that, for every 
kilometre driven, a 1970 model polluted as much as 20 cars made 
in 1995. As far as I know, all this progress has been made in spite of 
the presence of MMT in fuel.
<P>
	One can give the benefit of the doubt to the automotive industry 
as the minister does, but that does not seem enough. I firmly 
believe that it would be a great mistake to always give the benefit 
of the doubt on environmental issues.
<P>
	One needs accurate information to make the best decisions. One 
must not to be afraid to ask for more. On environmental issues, 
asking for too much is better than asking for too little. It is the 
future of this planet that is in jeopardy, the survival of our children. 
Care must be taken not to make decisions lightly and without 
sufficient justification.
<P>
	The minister has not done so, right from the beginning of her 
mandate. I would like to quote an article over the byline of 
Terrence Corcoran in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of October 21, headlined 
``Sheila Galileo meets MMT''. It reads as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Scientific rigour has never been at the heart of the environment movement, 
nor does it appear to be the first love of Canada's Environment Minister-In a 
speech last Monday, Ms. Copps demonstrated her scientific flair by accusing all 
who doubt the existence of the greenhouse effect as ``the same kind of people 
who rejected Galileo''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now there's nothing deeply offensive about that accusation, except that it 
came from Ms. Copps midway through a speech in which any kind of science, 
let alone good science, was totally ignored. Speaking to the international panel 
on climate change in Montreal, Ms. Copps reviewed a list of ``weather events 
from this summer documented by scientists'' to prove the existence of the 
greenhouse effect.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Space does not permit a full rundown, but here are some of the items identified 
by Sheila Galileo as evidence for the greenhouse effect: the second worst year in 
history for forest fires; record rains in Alberta; record electricity production in 
Ontario; the death of a half million chickens and turkeys on one  August weekend; 
wind damage on every property in Oxbow, Saskatchewan; a record number of </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>icebergs floating off Newfoundland; a steady stream of migraine sufferers, heart 
patients and asthmatics admitted to hospital emergency departments.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ms. Copps said ``these are facts provided by Canada's leading scientists''. 
Could be, although the list looks more like the output of a good newspaper 
clipping service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There's already evidence that bad science, or no science at all, drives 
environmental politics in Canada, and Ms. Copps is at the leading edge of the 
movement. Indeed, her department and the entire Government of Canada are 
now up to their test tubes in a murky scientific and political game they've been 
playing over a gasoline additive called MMT. In the wake of a ruling yesterday 
by a Washington court over MMT use in the United States, there's now a good 
chance that Ottawa's entire fuel emissions program is about to go up in a cloud 
of smoke, the victim of scientific and political negligence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	End of quote, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	So much for the scientific rigour of the Minister. In light of the 
information available at this time, and recent developments in the 
US, I feel that delaying adoption of this bill is mandatory. It seems 
vital for studies by independent experts to be carried out to set us 
completely straight, so that we will have a clear idea of the impact 
of MMT-and why not of any other additive such as ethanol-on 
pollution control systems. This would be a more appropriate and 
more reasonable approach as things stand at the present time.
<P>
	When the Minister of the Environment is constantly speaking of 
harmonization, bragging that this is what her policy is all about, a 
lot of questions come to mind. Canada is composed of provinces, 
each of which has an environmental policy, each of which has 
different needs depending on its industries. Our environment must 
be constantly improved, and I am convinced they are all aware of 
that.
<P>
	In Quebec, the environment is the third-ranking priority after 
jobs and health. The minister must learn how to listen to people 
instead of stubbornly dictating her philosophies to them. The 
mistakes in the Department of the Environment have done nothing 
but constantly increase under her leadership. Her reputation as a 
brawler was normal when she was in the opposition. But now that 
she is in power, it is her duty to examine issues thoroughly, carry 
out studies when uncertain, and harmonize with the provinces, in 
other words forget all that stuff about sustainable development and 
the environment.
<P>
	Let the minister show us, and prove to us, her true desire to make 
positive and realistic pro-environment decisions, not politically 
dictated ones. It is obvious that she seems determined to move this 
bill through at any price. We cannot support it, therefore, because 
we feel it  lacks a large number of elements for banning MMT in 
Canada. In the aftermath of the American decision of October 20, 
we find it extremely difficult to support a bill that will no longer 
harmonize in the least with the US decisions.
<P>
	Madam Minister, get back to your books, and you can write a 
makeup test later on.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
again to take part in the debate on Bill C-94.
<P>
	First I thank all the witnesses who came before the committee to 
discuss and make presentations on this subject. It really was 
unfortunate that it was apparent right from the introduction of the 
bill and the hearings in committee that members of the government 
were not really interested in hearing, listening or learning any of 
the facts behind the issue. They were destined to support the 
political agenda of the Minister of the Environment or they would 
face the wrath of the minister. We on this side of the House 
certainly know how intimidating that can be.
<P>
	From the very beginning it was apparent to me that either one 
side or the other on this issue was distorting the facts brought 
before us. Therefore my staff and I spent the summer doing 
extensive research into the issue. The more we studied, the more 
convinced we became that the minister was not so much concerned 
about protecting the environment as she was about fulfilling a 
political commitment.
<P>
	I will review some of the facts that led me to this conclusion. On 
the issue of the onboard diagnostic computer system, the 
contention brought out in committee was the question of whether 
or not MMT gums up the OBD II systems.
<P>
	In December 1993 following the largest fuel additive testing 
program in the history of the U.S. EPA, it was concluded that the 
use of MMT would not cause or contribute to the failure of any 
emission control device or system including onboard diagnostic 
systems.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	The EPA, the U.S. court and subsequently the U.S. Court of 
Appeal rejected concerns about the impact of MMT on OBD 
systems as presented by U.S. automakers. U.S. automakers have 
experienced significant difficulties with the certification of OBD 
systems in United States where MMT is not currently used in 
unleaded gasoline.
<P>
	The U.S. EPA and the California Air Resources Board have 
recently changed their regulations to allow for certification of 
vehicles that do not comply with the OBD II requirements. The 
U.S. EPA stated in the federal register that automobile 
manufacturers have expressed and demonstrated difficulty in 
complying with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16276"> 16276 </A></B>
<P>
every  aspect of the OBD requirements. Such difficulty appears 
likely to continue into 1996 and 1997 model years.
<P>
	In Canada, the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association 
appears to be blaming OBD II system difficulties on MMT. 
MVMA members have lobbied the Canadian government 
threatening to disconnect OBD warning systems and pass costs on 
to consumers unless the government passes legislation to ban 
MMT. The Canadian government appears to have responded to the 
threats without noting that vehicle manufacturers have failed to 
achieve OBD II certification in the U.S. for most new car models.
<P>
	Furthermore I should like to know how the minister could 
explain her statement that if vehicle manufacturers carry through 
on threats to remove OBD systems it would result in a tenfold 
increase in vehicle emissions. This is simply representative of the 
rhetoric coming from the minister and from that side of the House 
with no real facts to back up those statements. This false claim 
shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the technical issues 
involved and underlines the need for an independent technical 
assessment of the MVMA claims.
<P>
	OBD systems do not reduce emissions on vehicles. OBD is a 
monitoring system designed to notify the driver when emission 
control equipment does not operate properly. Removal or more 
likely the disconnection of OBD systems would only serve to 
prevent a dashboard malfunction indicating light from 
illuminating, which is exactly what is happening already in the 
United States without MMT. No emission control equipment would 
be removed from the vehicle.
<P>
	The issue of sparkplug failure was used by the minister with 
great gusto to demonstrate her reason for banning MMT. General 
Motors Canada has claimed that MMT is responsible for warranty 
claims for sparkplug failure being 17 times higher in Canada than 
in the U.S. It is alleged that higher claims are due to manganese 
deposits on sparkplugs causing the plug to arc under certain 
conditions from electrode to the outer shell rather than from 
electrode to electrode.
<P>
	Arcing leads to sparkplug misfire which can contribute to 
drivability problems. The Minister of the Environment has cited 
these claims to help justify her proposed legislation to remove 
MMT. However she failed to point out that automakers' claims 
related to one type of platinum tipped sparkplug used primarily in a 
one-engine version used in GM automobiles. The sparkplug in 
question was discontinued by GM indicating the problems were 
related to the design of the plug, not MMT. No casual link was ever 
established between MMT and sparkplug problems and no 
warranty data have ever been made public.
<P>
	To further assess the validity of GM's concerns independent 
testing was conducted by the Southwest Research Institute in San 
Antonio, Texas, using the platinum tipped long life plugs used in 
all 1994 2.2  Chevrolet Cavaliers. The goal of the study initiated 
with General Motors Corporation in the U.S. was to determine the 
differences between new sparkplug failures and the plugs were 
provided by GM.
<P>
	The sparkplugs were fired under a power supply that increased 
output to the plugs in a ramped manner. Current leakage until the 
plugs fired was measured and movies were taken to document 
whether arcing occurs between electrodes or from electrode to 
shell.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PUBLICWORKS">PUBLIC WORKS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
October 19 I questioned the minister of public works regarding 
some problems over the summer with harassment of a female 
engineer on the job site outside the Peace Tower.
<P>
	The ministry of public works subsequent to that harassment 
rewarded one of the subcontractors with further work, including the 
whole of the Centre Block. I was wondering why the minister 
would allow his officials to do that. He replied that 
``notwithstanding the fact it is beyond the legal ramifications of the 
Government of Canada in terms of privity of contract, we will 
ensure this kind of behaviour is not tolerated''.
<P>
	Since that time it has come to my attention that officials at public 
works have been closing their eyes to this sort of behaviour for 
some time. In fact, this same company, Colonial Builders, and Mr. 
Karmash who is the perpetrator on this site, have been active on 
other sites in previous summers, including the Kingston military 
college and the Kingston penitentiary. Harassment of another 
female engineer took place to the point where her supervisor took 
over because it was virtually impossible to work with the 
subcontractor on the site. He would simply have nothing to do with 
a female on his job site.
<P>
	Public works should have been aware of this pattern of 
behaviour, yet it has continued to permit the company and this 
individual to do work of very great importance since that time, 
including work on the Parliament Buildings.
<P>
	Public Works officials have not shown much competence or 
judgment, not only in this matter but in other matters related to it. 
The minister is aware that the female engineer's crew walked off in 
sympathy with her plight and were left being owed $165,000 or 
thereabouts. Public works officials have not acted there either.
<P>
	In order to receive pay for work completed, the contractor and 
subcontractor have to fill out statutory declarations. They swear 
that all work they are billing the government for has been 
completed and that all payments have been made. The statutory 
declarations could not have been very accurate on the Peace Tower 
project because if the declarations were true, the group of workers 
who were with Ann Raney and who are still owned some $165,000 
would have been paid. Yet the statutory declaration stating that all 
accounts are paid  and up to date have been submitted and paid by 
Public Works Canada.
<P>
	That they are owed the money is not in dispute. The court has in 
fact found in their favour and has permitted a lien to be placed 
against the Peace Tower project. Surely that should tell officials at 
the department of public works that something is wrong. The 
minister should be aware and should be making certain that he 
finds out why his officials are so lax in their duties. Not only does 
public works appear to support and justify the harassment of 
women on the worksite, but it appears to be ignoring the basic 
management and accounting procedures that are its role as well.
<P>
	I call on the minister to assure us that his department will act 
honourably and see to it that justice is done in this case. These 
workers who had the strength of character to do the right thing in 
resisting the unfairness of the harassment against their female 
engineer must not be the only Canadians who resist harassment of 
females on the worksite.
<P>
	The public and this House expect nothing less than fair treatment 
and justice from our government departments and from their 
officials. The minister must act now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for Mackenzie for giving the government 
a chance to respond to this matter because it is a very important 
subject.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First it is a matter of taking stock. Public Works and Government 
Services Canada concluded a contract with Fuller Construction, the 
principal contractor in the Peace Tower restoration project. 
Therefore, this department must ensure the quality of the work 
being done on the Peace Tower and that the work done by Fuller 
Construction, the general contractor, meets very high standards.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The issue raised by the member for Mackenzie concerns a 
dispute between two subcontractors working on the project, 
Pro-Tech Building Restoration and Colonial Building Restoration. 
The dispute, based on the non-payment of wages and harassment, 
has resulted in Pro-Tech being removed from the job by Colonial. 
An employee of Pro-Tech, Ms. Ann Raney, has made allegations of 
gender discrimination.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In this matter, the government has a contractual link with Fuller 
Construction only, whereas the dispute involves the two 
subcontractors: Pro-Tech and Colonial. Public Works therefore has 
no direct involvement with the subcontractors working on the 
project.
<P>

<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However, the contract with Fuller Construction, like any other 
major work contract, includes an anti-discrimination clause. As I 
said before, Public Works Canada's contract specifications do not 
permit discrimination in hiring in the workplace.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the general contractor, Fuller is responsible for settling this 
dispute.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the House that progress is being made and 
that the general contractor has taken steps to ensure that a solution 
is reached in the very near future. Both parties have agreed in 
principle to resolve the alleged discrimination issue through a third 
party independent arbitrator. Until the issue is resolved, the party 
alleged to have harassed has been removed from the job by Fuller.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The member for Mackenzie also raised the question about 
ownership of the tools. I would like to take this opportunity to set 
the record straight. On August 18, 1995, tools worth $5,000 were 
taken from the site. These tools remain in the hands of the 
Ottawa-Carleton police.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to assure members of the House that complaints of 
the nature raised by Ms. Raney are taken very seriously by the 
minister of public works. His department does not tolerate 
harassment or discrimination.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.39 p.m.)
<P>
