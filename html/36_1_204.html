financial services in support of the disadvantaged are 
concerned, as well as not going far enough.  We also consider it 
an injustice toward provincially chartered insurance companies 
in Quebec, which cannot at present acquire blocks of insurance 
from federally chartered companies, and this is an injustice 
which must be remedied promptly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, it is truly unfortunate that I have to stand today 
in the House to address a very serious issue that happened in the 
House of Commons yesterday.  I will take my time to go through 
it.  From a personal perspective, I am going to tell members what 
kind of impact this decision has had on my community and many 
communities throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concurrence report and motion, which I originally put on 
October 28, 1998, No. 17, refers to the justice committee and 
issues relative to victims' rights, the sentencing of offenders 
and that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rights of individuals, in particular victims of crime, the 
issues related to prison reform and what happens to individuals 
who walk away from our prisons and commit crimes has been an 
issue that has been very near and dear to my heart.  I can tell 
those people listening and members opposite that not only is it a 
very serious issue for me and my community, which has affected my 
community very dearly, but I can assure the House that members on 
this side, in particular, have been fighting these issues for 
some time.  I have a private member's bill that is very close to 
the issue that I am about to bring up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just an issue of the Reform Party.  There was a very 
interesting private member's bill that was introduced by the 
member for Mississauga East.  It was brought into the House some 
time ago.  On second reading only three people in the House 
opposed the motion to send this private member's  bill to 
committee to be further developed.  I am glad to see the 
solicitor general here this morning because I hope to impress 
upon him how important this particular issue is and how the 
decision of the justice committee yesterday affects this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga East knew full well when she 
developed her private member's bill just what the implications 
were of the kind of justice issues that we have today.  She 
introduced Bill C-251, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act respecting cumulative 
sentences for first reading on October 21, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have said all along in the House, the relevance of Private 
Members' Business is important to all of us.  This is not just an 
issue where the cabinet should be able to say “That is nice. You 
have a bill, but that is not our decision, so nothing else 
matters”.  The fact is that the member for Mississauga East who 
developed this private member's bill was not only speaking for 
the people of Mississauga East, she was speaking for many members 
on all sides of the House, including me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not laugh over there.  This is damn serious stuff and those 
members better get used to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the folks who are listening, the revenue minister is taunting 
us on something that is very important to this country.  It may 
not be important to him in Vancouver, but I can assure him that 
it is damn well important to most people in this country.  That 
is the problem with this government and its ministers.  They have 
the unmitigated gall to cancel good business that comes into this 
House from private members, but they do not seem to have one 
ounce of regard for private members when it is their cabinet 
business that comes into the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Revenue is heckling us.  I would like 
you, Mr. Speaker, and the rest of the people listening to 
understand exactly what that fellow is heckling.  This is the 
nature of the bill that was quashed in committee yesterday, which 
was supported by all members of the House, save three, last 
October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the bill reads and this is what a minister of this 
government is heckling: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment provides for the imposition of consecutive 
sentences where a person commits—

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to stop for a moment because a member of the cabinet 
is trying to disrupt the process.  The member is from Vancouver. 
I guess the victims of crime in Vancouver would be a bit more 
than disturbed to understand that a cabinet minister is heckling, 
because we are trying to get this cabinet to understand that this 
is an important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to see the solicitor general sitting quietly and 
attentively.  If we could finally get the revenue minister from 
Vancouver to shut up for a little bit, maybe— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford is an experienced member of the House.  He 
knows, as we all know, that heckling is something that does 
happen in the House from time to time.  I think he would 
recognize that while he may disagree with what some members are 
saying in the House from time to time while heckling, as we all 
do, I cannot hear the heckling very well.  I think his speech 
perhaps is not being unduly interrupted by the noise in the 
House.  It is fairly quiet in here today.  Perhaps we could 
continue with the remarks with a little more spirit of 
co-operation on all sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am an experienced member 
of this House and that is why I am standing today.  I am sick and 
tired of private members bringing legislation into this House— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am having difficulty hearing my hon. friend, the House 
leader for the Reform Party.  I was in fact sitting behind him 
for awhile and still had difficulty hearing him because of the 
heckling of the revenue minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate the opportunity to hear the speech this 
morning.  It is just a matter of respect to allow that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We all want to hear the speech that 
the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford is making.  I am sure 
hon. members will bear that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I sit considerably farther from my colleague in the Reform Party 
and I am having absolutely no trouble, using my earphone, 
understanding what the hon. member is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think we will manage.  We will do 
our best to all hear the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford.  I 
am sure all hon. members appreciate the assistance of the hon. 
member for West Nova. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to get back to 
something that is very serious indeed and I will forget the 
heckling of the minister of the government from Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the private member's bill that was passed in this House. 
I will read it so that everybody will understand. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment provides for the imposition of consecutive 
sentences where a person commits sexual assault and another 
offence arising out of the same events or where the person is 
already serving another sentence at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment also provides that a person sentenced to life 
imprisonment for first degree murder or second degree murder is 
not eligible for parole until the person has served, in addition 
to the portion of sentence that the person must serve for murder, 
one-third or a maximum of seven years of any other sentence 
imposed on the person in respect of an offence arising out of the 
same events or that the person is already serving.  The mandatory 
portion of each life sentence imposed on a person who is 
convicted of a second murder must be served consecutively before 
the person is eligible for parole. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask, what in blue blazes is wrong with that?  This is 
an issue that all sides of this House felt was very important to 
Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in an area that has seven federal penitentiaries and 
numerous provincial penitentiaries around it.  In our communities 
of Abbotsford and Langley, and throughout Mission where some of 
my colleagues live, in Chilliwack and, indeed, throughout the 
lower mainland, people are walking out of prison, and in some 
cases, like the Sumas Centre, just walking out of prison and 
committing such crimes as rape and murder, very serious offences. 
What happens?  They go back, get tried and, if they are lifers, 
nothing really happens.  They get a concurrent sentence with no 
additional time added to their sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might say that they are serving life anyway, so why does it 
matter?

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that life does not mean life in Canada.  First 
degree murderers, for goodness sake, can be out after 15 years 
under the faint hope clause, section 745.  The problem is that 
this Liberal member for Mississauga East introduced a completely 
logical private member's bill.  And we applaud her for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so typical in this House where it is a logical issue that 
the justice minister or the solicitor general, who I appreciate 
is listening today, says that yes, that is logical and we do not 
want to fight this one publicly, because if we do the public will 
ask what is wrong with that and they may not vote for the 
government, and therefore we better be concerned because the 
general public is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens?  Ministers stand in the House of Commons on second 
reading on a private member's bill such as this and they say that 
as a cabinet they will support it; that, indeed, they are the 
champions of the rights of Canadians and the protectors of 
law-abiding Canadian citizens; that they will see this goes 
through second reading of the House of Commons, that it goes into 
committee and everybody will be happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took the word of the ministers on that.  What happened 
yesterday in committee?  It took all but three minutes plus a few 
odd seconds for Liberal members to go clause by clause through 
this private member's bill and nix, negate, forget, throw away, 
quash every darned word of this bill.  There were no amendments, 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Shame.  They deleted the whole bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It was not only the Liberals.  It was not 
just the Liberals, though, there was a Bloc MP.  Put it on the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  A member says it was not just the 
Liberals.  Yes, I believe we do have one member who is not a 
Liberal who did not quash this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we face the situation in the House of Commons today where 
all but three members of the House on second reading said yes, 
but when it went to committee the Liberals, who have a majority 
on the committee, said no?  What happened?  Did these very 
members on that committee who voted no yesterday vote yes in 
1997?  The answer is yes.  So what happened?  Only three members 
said no to it way back when and we had seven nixing the bill 
yesterday.  If they cared that much about it, then what changed 
between the vote on second reading and a committee meeting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell hon. members what changed.  The cabinet sat down and 
said that it never did like this bill.  Cabinet members only 
wanted to stand in the House of Commons to tell Canadians they 
were all for it and then go behind closed doors to tell the 
chairman of the committee to scrap it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliament secretary for justice was on that committee and 
voted against the bill yesterday.  Government members sitting on 
that committee said “We do not give one damn what we did at 
second reading.  We are telling you now that is not going to 
go”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two issues here.  There is the issue of criminals who 
perpetrate crimes, serious offences, who go to prison and get out 
on an unescorted leave of absence or an escorted leave of absence 
or parole or some form of exit from prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Or when they are golfing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Or when they are golfing or riding their 
horses.  Maybe they jump over the fence.  Who knows?  When they 
get out, they commit another crime and then nothing else happens. 
The public says “He certainly will get punished for raping my 
daughter.  After all, this guy is a rapist”, but nothing 
happens.  They are given a concurrent sentence, which means no 
additional time.  It says on their record that they committed 
another rape or another murder.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what the Liberal government wants?  Was this the agenda 
all along?  It did not care about this issue. When Liberals were 
standing up in the House voting for it, they lied to the Canadian 
public.  That is what they did.  They gave a false impression 
that they support this kind of stuff but as soon as they get out 
of the House of Commons, hey, bury that thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really too bad.  It is just sickening for somebody in a 
community who has seen more than his share of this kind of thing 
happening.  I have recently been working with a victim, an 
individual who was raped by an inmate who was out on a unescorted 
temporary absence, a UTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what that inmate will get.  We know he got his pound of 
flesh and the legal system will give him a concurrent sentence. 
That is what this bill was all about.  It was all about showing 
inmates that just one crime or as many crimes as they want are 
punishable by the same sentence.  That indeed is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say from personal experience that every time I come into 
the House on these kinds of issues I get a little more 
disappointed in how the Liberal government operates.  How long 
did we wait for the Young Offenders Act to be amended?  We came 
in here in 1993 and pushed and pushed again.  There was minor 
tinkering and lots of press announcements by the group over 
there.  It was tabled after two sessions of parliament. Even that 
is not adequate enough today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not hard to see that the public wants a change in the 
country.  If the public wants real meaningful change it will not 
get it from the government and it should understand that all the 
rhetoric will not in any way get or deliver justice in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House and all those who are listening of three 
things.  First, the Liberal government save three people in the 
House of Commons passed on second reading the bill I have here. I 
will read the contents of the bill once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, after getting it to a committee, it deliberately behind 
closed doors told its members on that committee of which it has a 
majority to squash it.  It deliberately misled the Canadian 
public on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the good intentions of this private member's bill have 
been lost.  They are gone.  The process now may well take another 
two or three years to get this back and that is sad because I can 
guarantee there are many people who will become victims of crime, 
the subject of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read it once again and remind everybody what the 
Liberal government has done.  The bill said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment provides for the imposition of consecutive 
sentences where a person commits sexual assault and another 
offence arising out of the same events or where the person is 
already serving another sentence at the time.

imprisonment for first degree murder or second degree murder is 
not eligible for parole until the person has served, in addition 
to the portion of sentence that the person must serve for murder, 
one-third or a maximum of seven years of any other sentence 
imposed on the person in respect of an offence arising out of the 
same events or that the person is already serving.  The mandatory 
portion of each life sentence imposed on a person who is 
convicted of a second murder must be served consecutively before 
the person is eligible for parole.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to speak to the debate on this 
motion.  It is particularly a pleasure to do so, as a result of 
the most disgusting performance I have ever seen in my life that 
happened in the justice committee yesterday when the member for 
Mississauga East had her private member's bill destroyed by a 
bunch of sheep Liberals who were following orders from their 
justice minister and from the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was on Bill C-251, a bill that was overwhelmingly passed in 
the House.  It was approved by all but one Liberal member of the 
government; all but one voted for it to go to committee. In a 
matter of five seconds, following the orders of the government 
and the Minister of Justice, Bill C-251 in the name of the member 
for Mississauga East was destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shall the first clause pass?  No.  Shall the second clause pass? 
No. Shall the title pass?  No.  It was destroyed by her own 
people, stabbed in the back by her colleagues, joined by Bloc 
members and NDP members.  In disgusting solidarity NDP, Bloc and 
Liberal members voted down a very acceptable private member's 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read Bill C-251 for the pleasure of the Liberal 
government that destroyed it yesterday and for the interest of 
the Canadian public that is watching today.  Her bill read as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment provides for the imposition of consecutive 
sentences where a person commits sexual assault and another 
offence arising out of the same events or where the person is 
already serving another sentence at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment also provides that a person sentenced to life 
imprisonment for first degree murder or second degree murder is 
not eligible for parole until this person has served, in addition 
to the portion of sentence that the person must serve for murder, 
one-third or a maximum seven years of any other sentence imposed 
on the person in respect for an offence arising out of the same 
events or that the person is already serving. The mandatory 
portion of each life sentence imposed on a person who is 
convicted of a second murder must be served consecutively before 
the person is eligible for parole. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the bill was presented to take the discount out 
of sentencing which the Liberal government supports.  We are 
talking about getting rid of the discount sale of the government 
in its justice system if one commits more than one serious 
offence like murder or sexual assault.  That is disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals destroyed private member's Bill C-251 by the member 
for Mississauga East in five seconds and then laughed.  They 
laughed and joked in committee about how easy it was to destroy a 
colleague's bill in committee.  They laughed and the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice laughed as well. 
She laughed and all her colleagues laughed.  They thought it was 
funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  They deny it, Mr. Speaker.  Why 
would they admit to such a disgusting display as laughing at a 
bill as important— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The Chair is finding 
it very difficult to hear the hon. member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley.  Perhaps members on all sides could 
restrain themselves so we can hear the debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I distinctly heard the loud mouthed parliamentary secretary 
shouting “liar” on several occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I realize that debate in 
the House on issues such as this can be pointed and tough at 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked a moment ago about the parliamentary secretary calling 
one of our members a liar.  She reaffirmed that in the House.  I 
would expect that we will be asking for a question of privilege 
that this member be asked either to take those words back or be 
removed from the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair asks the hon. parliamentary 
secretary did she use the words that have been complained of? If 
so I ask her to withdraw them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw my 
comments and my calling the member a liar if that member returns 
to what actually happened in the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There are no ifs involved in 
this. The hon. parliamentary secretary is an experienced member. 
She knows that it is not in order to use the word liar.  I ask 
her to stand up and please withdraw the word immediately and 
unequivocally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I said that was a lie. 
I did not call the member a liar.  I said his facts were a lie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the parliamentary 
secretary cannot get out of this on that basis.  I ask her to 
withdraw the word lie or liar unequivocally right now, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, considering that I have 
great respect for this institution I withdraw the words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I thank the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me name the 
ridings of the Liberal members who attended as well and who 
laughed and joked when that bill was destroyed in five seconds.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice, the member for Winnipeg South also thought it was a big 
joke.  The member for Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford thought it was a 
big joke.  The member for Simcoe North thought it was a big joke. 
The member for Oshawa thought it was a big joke.  The member for 
Brossard—La Prairie thought it was a big joke.  The member for 
Scarborough East thought it was a big joke.  They all thought it 
was a big joke to destroy the private member's bill of the member 
for Mississauga East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals voted overwhelmingly in favour of second reading 
and to go to committee.  Did they mean it?  Of course not.  They 
did not want this bill.  They wanted it to get to committee so 
that the government orders could be followed to destroy this bill 
in under five seconds in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen some disgusting things out of this government since 
1993 and this one rates right near the top.  Not only was this 
bill, which had a tremendous amount of merit and a tremendous 
amount of benefit to the public safety of this country, destroyed 
by this government, by the sheep that follow the orders of the 
whip, the House leader or the Minister of Justice, but this act 
has destroyed what little confidence the Canadian people might 
have in the effectiveness of private members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened yesterday sent a clear message out to every member 
of parliament, who represent millions of Canadians across the 
country, that if one puts a private member's bill forward, no 
matter what happens in the House in first and second reading, no 
matter if there is overwhelming consent or not, if it gets to 
committee and someone on the government benches, the cabinet, 
does not want this bill, it is destroyed.  Is that democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there any semblance of democracy in that process?  The answer 
is no.  This malicious, disgusting act by the Liberal government 
has destroyed whatever confidence Canadians had in the ability of 
their elected members to present a private member's bill in the 
House and have any chance of it going through if some member of 
the government benches does not want it.  That is a crime in 
itself. That was a criminal act yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Liberal members did yesterday, following the orders 
from their dictator, whoever he or she was, was nothing less than 
a criminal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If I heard the hon. member right, he 
said members committed a criminal act.  If that is what he said I 
am sure he would want to withdraw those words. Members in their 
capacity as members of the House voting on bills and motions in 
committee or in the House surely are not committing such an act. 
I am sure the hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley would 
want to withdraw any such suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course I will 
withdraw.  What I said was in passion.  What I should have said 
is that what the Liberal members did in committee could be 
described as nothing less than a criminal act.  It was so vile 
and so disgusting that it could be accurately called an immoral 
act or an obscene act of power hungry dictators in the government 
having their orders carried out by their minions who show up for 
these committee meetings attempting to give some impression that 
they are actually interested in what is going on. They are 
attempting to give some impression that they actually care about 
business in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The killing of this bill by the Liberals yesterday also had 
another effect.  It had a profound effect on the ability of 
law-abiding Canadians to have a sense of security about the 
safety of their families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, had it passed, would have kept murderers and rapists 
and others who commit heinous violent crimes of that nature in 
jail.  It would have ended the volume discounts for murderers, 
rapists and other violent criminals the Liberals government 
supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act yesterday was a clear example of the Liberal 
government's supporting the most lenient treatment possible for 
violent criminals. That is what it did yesterday. It supported 
the most lenient treatment possible under the Criminal Code. 
That is what the Liberal government is all about.  That is what 
it supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disgusting.  How can any law-abiding Canadian citizen have 
any sense of security about the safety of their family when this 
worthless government does not have the guts, does not have the 
intestinal— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the hon. member is 
perhaps overwrought today, but he is going beyond the bounds of 
proper discourse.  He knows it has been ruled unparliamentary on 
numerous occasions to use the last words he used.  I would invite 
him again to withdraw the words and perhaps show a little 
temperance in his language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on this issue it is 
very difficult to show temperance but I will try. I will withdraw 
that.  What did I just withdraw? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this for the benefit of the Canadian people. The 
government killed Bill C-251, a bill that would keep in jail 
violent criminals, criminals who commit the most heinous and 
serious crimes, a bill that would end the volume discounts where, 
if a person commits three murders, they would only serve time for 
one and if a person rapes three or four or five women, they would 
only serve time for one. That is the way the law is now.  This 
would have changed it. This would have provided for consecutive 
sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government clearly displayed yesterday that it supports 
violent criminals being treated in the most lenient manner 
possible.  That is the message it sent out yesterday.  That is 
the message this government sent out yesterday when it destroyed 
Bill C-251. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat there in utter amazement as I watched this bill destroyed 
in under five seconds.  All the efforts of the member for 
Mississauga East in putting this bill forward, the turncoating of 
the Liberal members who supported her bill in second reading, now 
cast aside as if it were some worthless piece of paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Liberals showed no support for law enforcement 
officers.  They have clearly demonstrated in everything they have 
done in justice terms that they do not support police forces in 
this country.  They do not support law-abiding citizens. Who are 
they supporting?  They appear to be supporting and have given 
credibility to the thought that the people they support are the 
people who commit crimes.

Simcoe North.

rising at the same time.  Some members stood up and sat down, and

floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it has now been three 
full years since I first introduced my private member's bill on 
consecutive sentencing for multiple murderers and rapists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was blocked once by the subcommittee on private members' 
business.  It was blocked again by the same committee six months 
later when I reintroduced the bill.  Then again after the 
election it was finally permitted to be made votable and was 
voted at second reading and referred to the justice committee 
which did hear from many witnesses.  Yesterday the bill's three 
year journey ended in three minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has the unfettered support of the attorney general and 
the solicitor general of Ontario, the justice minister of Alberta 
and the justice minister of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-251 passed second reading, as I mentioned, 81 to 3.  The 
bill has the support of the Canadian Police Association, the 
Canadian police chiefs, the police services board and every major 
victims organization in the country. Bill C-251 has the support 
of both NAC and REAL Women.  The bill has the support of the 
national Union of Solicitor General Employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is the second of three key legislative requests made by 
the Canadian Police Association during its 1999 annual 
legislative conference and lobby day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this will likely be the last time in this parliament that 
concurrent sentences for multiple murderers and rapists are 
challenged, I would like to read into the record some of the 
arguments that were presented in opposition to the bill and 
respond to them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Lawyers' Association asked the question: Why does 
this particular offence, referring to sexual assault, have to 
attract consecutive sentences?  Why is it centred out?  Why do we 
not pick robbery, break and enters, car jackings, or home 
invasions? A convicted murderer who also presented to the 
justice committee had a similar problem distinguishing between 
rape and going through someone's drawers during a break and 
enter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sexual assault I would maintain is different from break and 
enter in that sexual assaults cause permanent, often catastrophic 
harm to the victim.  From the perspective of the assailant or his 
legal representatives, this impact on the victim may not be of 
great importance. But again I remind the House that not long ago 
this House both supported consecutive sentences and mandatory 
minimums for offences involving firearms, including imitation 
firearms. Is a conviction for sexual assault any less important 
than a conviction for the use of an imitation firearm? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The myth that life is life was also perpetuated.  The Criminal 
Lawyers' Association, the John Howard Society and Lifeline, a 
society of paroled murderers, all protested that a life sentence 
actually means life imprisonment:  “The punishment for murder, 
regardless of whether it is first or second degree is 
imprisonment.  There can be no greater term of imprisonment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Multiple murderers, according to Correctional Service Canada 
using its own statistics, serve an average of only 18.8 years in 
prison.  That was the evidence of a witness from the Department 
of the Solicitor General who presented data to the committee 
showing that the largest group of multiple murderers in the 
system, 292 multiple murderers in total, can expect to spend only 
that long in prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that Denis Lortie was luckier.  He was 
released on full parole after 11 years after committing three 
murders.  Three and one-half years for each murder.  That is the 
reality of today's justice system.  Once parole is granted, a 
life sentence can mean as little as one visit to a parole officer 
every three months.  It usually means one visit a month according 
to one witness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the current law there is a degree of differentiation 
within a life sentence.  The minimum parole ineligibility for 
first degree murder is 25 years, while the minimum for second 
degree is 10.  Hence there is already ample precedent for 
applying different parole and eligibility periods for different 
crimes within a life sentence, as is called for in Bill C-251. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assertion that a life sentence results in imprisonment for 
life is an Orwellian deception that serves to mislead Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice committee heard evidence of the extent of volume 
discounts in the current system.  The committee was told that 321 
multiple murderers had received concurrent sentences, and 
according to statistics, an average volume discount of 58%.  That 
means the average multiple murderer will actually serve less than 
half his cumulative sentence in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also heard that 60% of all sex offenders admitted 
to federal prisons were multiple sex offenders who received 
concurrent sentences.  The average volume discount was 68%. Time 
served under concurrent sentences was shown to be less than 
one-third of the time that would have been served under a 
consecutive sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also heard of the threat to society posed by 
paroled murderers.  Various organizations claimed that released 
murderers posed no great threat to society but sadly, statistics 
tell a very different story.  Paroled murderers, according to 
Correctional Service Canada, using its own statistics, are 100 
times more likely to commit a future murder than the average 
Canadian.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians would believe that a rehabilitated person should 
be no more likely to commit another murder than their neighbour. 
That is not the case.  Paroled murderers remain a high risk 
group, 100 times more risky than any other Canadian. We were told 
in committee that five Canadians have been murdered because of 
the early release of murderers who were not genuinely 
rehabilitated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument of constitutionality was raised.  Various groups 
attempted to give the impression that Bill C-251 would not 
survive a charter challenge.  But what the supreme court has 
actually said, and I cite Steel v Mountain: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will only be on rare and unique occasions that a court will 
find a sentence so grossly disproportionate that it violates the 
provisions of section 12 of the charter which deals with cruel 
and unusual punishment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I cite Queen v Smith: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The test for review under section 12 is one of gross 
disproportionality because it is aimed at punishments that are 
more than merely excessive. We should be careful not to 
stigmatize every disproportionate or excessive sentence as being 
a constitutional violation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The above cases and others demonstrate that there is no basis 
whatsoever to assume that consecutive sentences will fail a 
charter challenge.  The only constitutional lawyer who testified 
before the committee expressed his legal opinion that there is no 
charter vulnerability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no precedent anywhere in the world that would directly 
support a charter challenge.  It is telling that no witness who 
spoke against the bill provided a legal opinion on the 
constitutional matter, choosing instead in large part to focus on 
matters of policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that Bill C-68, imposed by the 
same justice committee, imposed consecutive minimum prison terms 
for the use of a firearm or an imitation firearm in the 
commission of a crime.  These consecutive minimums actually 
exceed the median time served for sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judicial discretion was raised.  For multiple sexual offenders 
witnesses opposed to the bill could not agree among themselves as 
to the impact that the bill would have on the total sentence 
received by a multiple sex offender.  Some said that it would 
cause a substantial increase.  Others suggested that judges might 
adjust sentences for each offence to reach the same overall 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witnesses obviously have different views as to the impact of the 
bill on sentencing because they cannot predict the reaction of 
judges.  Witnesses cannot predict the reaction of judges because 
judges will continue to maintain judicial discretion as to the 
overall sentences in these cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, in the case of multiple murderers there is no 
judicial discretion in sentences for first degree murder.  Bill 
C-251 does not change that.  A mandatory period of parole 
ineligibility will still apply but must be of a length that is 
proportional to the number of victims.  Is that so unjust? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of costs was raised.  Various organizations 
referred to cost and resource issues potentially associated with 
Bill C-251 in relation to multiple murderers.  One presented a 
misleading figure that totalled the annual cost for the next 69 
years. Bill C-251 can have no cost impact whatsoever for at least 
10 years. The bill is not retroactive and can only have an impact 
on resources when future murderers come up for parole not less 
than 10 years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delayed parole for multiple murderers will cause an annual 
increase in prison population of about .1% per year for about 20 
years beginning in the year 2010.  This is derived from 
information provided to the justice committee by Mary Campbell of 
the Department of the Solicitor General.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the position of women's groups one witness 
claimed that the women's movement and NAC in particular were 
opposed to separate penalties for male offenders who victimized 
women and children.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have stopped short of calling for stiffer penalties or for 
longer periods of incarceration. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement is clearly intended to give the impression that 
NAC opposed the bill.  As I mentioned earlier, the National 
Action Committee on the Status of Women sent a letter of support 
for Bill C-225.  It supported the principle of my bill.  REAL 
women also sent a letter of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were the arguments.  The bill is supported by three 
provinces, police associations, women's groups and victims' 
groups.  I leave it to the House as to whether it wishes to have 
a vote to provide Canadians with the view of parliamentarians on 
volume discounts for murderers and rapists.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for Mississauga East for her words.  I know how 
much this means to her.  I know her persistence in trying to get 
it through for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does she have some thoughts on the impact this kind of 
legislation would have?  Should we eventually get this kind of 
legislation, what does she feel the impact will be on Canadian 
society as a whole? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. 
I know he has a particular sensitivity to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my fervent hope that the wisdom of the House will prevail 
and that legislation, whether it emanates from the department or 
whether it is translated by my bill, will come forward to ensure 
that the bulk rate for murder and volume discounts for rapists do 
not prevail.  Currently that is the law in Canada today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have a few comments and questions.  It is important for those 
watching today to understand exactly what has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating today a private members' bill that has been 
before the House numerous times, as indicated by the actual mover 
of the debate who was the last speaker.  She indicated a witness 
list.  We should also indicate that of the witnesses that 
appeared before the committee many were opposed to it, including 
the National Association Active in Criminal Justice, the Canadian 
Criminal Justice Association and the Church Council on Justice 
and Corrections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear members of the Reform Party throwing jibes at these 
witnesses:  the Church Council on Justice and Corrections, the 
Criminal Lawyers Association, the Canadian Bar Association made 
up of prosecutors that prosecute those people who are charged, 
the John Howard Society, and the Elizabeth Fry Society.  The John 
Howard Society said that the bill and the intimidation tactics 
used to support it were regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for people to understand what debate was 
interrupted today by members of the Reform Party.  It was a 
debate dealing with fish stocks.  It is important for people and 
fishermen in British Columbia to understand that the important 
issues affecting them and affecting the fishermen in Atlantic 
Canada were interrupted by a tactical manoeuvre by the Reform 
Party, which says it is a populist party, to play games and get 
this issue before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make that comment so that fishermen on both sides of the 
country will understand that if we do not get to the fish stocks 
debate, which is crucial to the livelihood of fishermen, it is 
because members of the Reform Party wanted to play this game and 
make certain political points with a bill that has already been 
debated in the House numerous times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I direct my comments in that vein.  They are important for 
members to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no denying 
that fish stocks is a crucial issue and is pertinent to the lives 
of fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the initiative of the Reform Party and my colleagues 
opposite in the Tory party who have chosen to highlight one of 
the obscenities in the Canadian justice system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that despite the witness list he cites, 
I commissioned a Pollara poll which indicated nine out of ten 
Canadians agree with this position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  So what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri:</B>  I hear someone saying “so what”. 
Perhaps there is a disconnect between the justice committee and 
the will of the majority of Canadians.  I believe it is 
imperative and important for the matter to have a full hearing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am the a member who said “so what”.  On issues like 
this one, issues involving the lives of people and understanding 
justice issues, we should not conduct opinion polls in order to 
enact legislation.  Those people, the Mulroney Tories, were the 
ones who tried to run the government and the country by opinion 
polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill got due process in committee.  It heard from witnesses 
who found fault with it.  I suggest that members of the Reform 
Party accept parliament as it is.  Members of parliament have 
spoken to the bill, so let us leave it and move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like clarification, if I could, from the Chair whether 
the member is indicating that the lives of Canadian citizens are 
more important than fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the hon. member knows 
that is not a point of order.  He is really raising debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, tempers are rising 
here.  I am sure my colleague did not mean to suggest that this 
is not an important issue for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is my firm belief, after being here 10 years, that 
the only way the bill should be dealt with is by a vote in 
parliament.  A handful of individuals may be thoroughly 
disconnected from reality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to commend the member for 
Mississauga East for her diligence and persistence, much against 
the will of her own party.  I do not want to get into the 
partisan side of it.  I do not want to respond to the remarks 
in the previous intervention with respect to which parties best 
represent public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very important element here of representing what it 
is that the public wants.  As has been quite clearly demonstrated 
by the comments of the member for Mississauga East, this is a 
very emotional and visceral issue for most Canadians when we 
start talking about volume discounts and shortening the parole 
eligibility of murderers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about repeat offenders, those who have not 
committed just one offence but have committed multiple offences 
and offences on the very high end of Criminal Code violations in 
terms of their seriousness.  The consecutive sentences that would 
result from this private member's bill would obviously—and I 
defy anyone to argue otherwise—protect Canadians from those 
specific offenders to which these sentences would attach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Implicit in the bill is the very genuine intention to deal with 
habitual criminals who are released by virtue of early parole. 
The current government and the current commissioner of 
Correctional Service Canada have a very insidious plan with 
respect to the release of prisoners on parole, a 50% release plan 
that would see by the year 2000, 50% of current inmates back on 
the street through one form or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that should be alarming and shocking to all 
Canadians.  The point of the bill is to ensure that convicted 
offenders, murderers and rapists, do not have an opportunity to 
go out on to the streets and perpetrate the same types of 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most startling and disturbing statistic was that the 
likelihood a person who has committed an offence of murder or 
rape will reoffend, compared to average law-abiding citizen, was 
100% more likely to commit a murder or a rape after being 
released on the conviction of such an offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the member for Mississauga East to respond to the 
intent of the bill and what it would accomplish in terms of its 
broad spread application on our parole system and the effect it 
would have in terms of protecting Canadians from repeat offenders 
for these types of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his very astute comments and insights into my bill. 
Since I presented the bill I have sadly been visited by far too 
many victims who have told me their tales of woe in terms of how 
the justice system impacts on their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are far too familiar with the story of Don Edwards 
whose sister was raped and subsequently her assailant ended up 
murdering her parents.  Don Edwards has told me his story of how 
his family has gone into hiding, how dysfunctional it has been 
for the community and for the extended family.  His sister is in 
hiding.  He has moved his family south of the border.  One of the 
saddest commentaries I have ever heard in my life, including the 
10 years I have been here, is when Don Edwards said the border 
would be his protection for his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would impact on victims in giving them a sense of 
security so they would— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Previously the member for Sydney—Victoria suggested this 
debate would replace a critical fish debate.  The debate it is 
replacing is not worthy of support and he should know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member knows that is not a 
point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
privilege.  I want to take the opportunity to respond to some of 
the comments made by the hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley.  He named me specifically as a member of the justice 
committee and he used the term these criminal acts, which he has 
now withdrawn, in reference to the activities of the committee 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out a couple of inaccuracies where he implied that 
all members of the justice committee on the Liberal side who 
voted not to approve the bill had voted in the House to send it 
for second reading.  I would like to correct that, in that I did 
not vote for that bill.  The implication that the bill was 
disposed of in five seconds is not accurate.  There were many 
witnesses— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid we are getting into 
debate.  It is one thing for the hon. member to air a grievance 
in respect of how he voted, but beyond that I am afraid the hon. 
member is entering into a debate which I do not believe is a 
question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that he had one on the first point.  It may have 
been a grievance.  I think the hon. member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley recognized that this was not a question of 
privilege.

Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that today, when we were to 
debate Bill C-27, we are spending so much time debating a private 
member's bill because of delaying tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into an argument about the possible merits 
of this bill, but since spring is upon us and the government is 
taking such a long time defining a fisheries management policy,

<A NAME="LINK82">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-27, an act to amend 
the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the Canada Shipping Act 
to enable Canada to implement the agreement for the 
implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the 
conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly 
migratory fish stocks and other international fisheries treaties 
or arrangements, as reported (with amendments) from the 
committee; and of Group Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it seems to be very difficult for me today to 
finally get down to work on the fisheries problem, but here we 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those members who have just joined us, and for those 
listening to the television, I repeat that the purpose of Bill 
C-27 is to implement the United Nations fisheries agreement. 
This agreement flows from the United Nations Convention on the 
Law of the Sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the first two amendments the Bloc Quebecois 
wishes to move to Bill C-27 is to clarify meaning and to ensure 
that Canadian legislation is consistent with the international 
agreement.  In my view, there were oversights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by looking at Motion No. 2 and then go to Motion 
No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Motion No. 2, which we wish to introduce 
concerning Bill C-27, is to provide a basis for interpretation 
for tribunals that will be called upon to use this Canadian law. 
It reminds them that interpretation of Bill C-27 shall be in 
accordance with the fisheries agreement based on the United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may seem highly technical, but my colleague for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry has reminded me that all laws and 
agreements must draw their essence from somewhere.  When an act 
is to be interpreted, when a case goes before a judge, it is 
important that the basis for interpretation of that act be 
written down in black and white. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I return to Motion No. 1, still in Group 1. For the benefit 
of the public and of those who sat on the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans, the objective of this motion is to add a 
new clause, 2.1, to Bill C-27, making reference to article 5 of 
the United Nations fisheries agreement, part 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I take the time to make this clarification?  Because the 
purpose of clause 2.1 is to provide a philosophical base for 
administration of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada wants to sign an international agreement, when it 
wants to implement this treaty, we must be assured of having the 
tools here in Canada to go along with the international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have merely asked the clerk to include, word for word, the 
contents of article 5 of the UNFA, as I have already explained. 
I am simply trying to summarize, since it is a fairly long 
clause, unless the House will give me permission to read it 
entirely, without shortening my speech.  I am summarizing it in 
order to provide some principles of the philosophy of 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause sets out in subclause (<I>a</I>) administrative measures to 
ensure the long term sustainability of straddling fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In subclause (<I>b</I>) our intention is to ensure as well that there 
is a data base containing verifiable and reliable scientific 
information that serves the interests of all parties concerned 
for the welfare of the so-called migratory species.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause (<I>d</I>) concerns the assessment of the impacts of fishing 
and other human activities on the marine ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause (<I>e</I>) concerns the adoption of conservation and 
management measures.  I would remind people that these are 
general management philosophy principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I draw members' attention especially to the following. 
Our reference in subclause (<I>f</I>) to minimizing pollution, waste, 
discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear and such things should 
be noted. 
This is why I want this introduced into Bill C-27, so Canada may 
then set out its future policy on fishing, a statement of 
policy.  For example, what will Canada do with respect to the 
measures including the development and use of selective 
environmentally safe and cost effective fishing gear and 
techniques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means we are prepared to be ecological and to give thought 
to the environment, but always from a cost effective standpoint. 
I agree with that, but we will have to get into the details one 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would draw members' attention to another point, still in this 
clause 2.1 we are proposing to the House.  It is subclause (<I>i</I>), 
which provides that we must take into account the interests of 
artisanal and subsistence fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important for me because I live in a coastal area.  My 
house looks out on Gaspé Bay and the Gulf of St. Lawrence 
beyond, so there are lots of fish going by.  We want to make 
sure that all those living in maritime areas will have artisanal 
and subsistence fishing rights because they were born near the 
sea and it is very much a part of their lives.  We want to make 
sure that this right will always be respected.  That is why it 
is important that this be included in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is much more and I will try to summarize it in more 
general terms.  When Canada is allowed to ratify and implement 
an agreement with an international treaty, Bill C-27 tends to 
Canadianize things.  I did not find the management principles 
that are part of this agreement in the bill. 
Nor did I find them clearly stated in earlier legislation, 
unless members opposite can tell me where. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned—and I would remind members that the 
auditor general had already asked the government to come up with 
a national policy—we in the Bloc Quebecois are still interested 
in helping to define such a policy, not that I intend to stay 
shackled to the centralist federal system forever, but so that 
we can have our say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we be given an opportunity to provide 
input.  I would like to be able to go into more detail in this 
clause, but because its only purpose is to implement the 
fisheries agreement, I would merely remind the House that spring 
is upon us. 
On April 1, the fishing season will be opening in the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence for many fisheries, including shrimp and crab in 
certain areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the fishing season opens, there is always a debate 
among fishers from the various regions. Since quotas are set by 
the federal government, there are very few mechanisms, if any, 
to guarantee to these fishers what quotas they will get. Some 
would like to have, to the extent that it is possible, historic 
quotas by province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would go even further. We should take into account provincial 
historic quotas, the proximity of stocks as well as the regions 
within a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am asking hon. members to think about the French 
management model, which includes since 1992 the criteria of 
relative stability; it is designed to put an end to the 
bickering between fishing regions since people know what their 
quotas are and can work with them. This would help fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, and we often forget this, plant workers should be 
allowed to know what volumes will be handled by and go through 
their plant during the year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to the other groups later, unless the House 
consents to my continuing to speak, but I see the other side is 
in a hurry to talk too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Since I am told I may continue to speak, I 
will address the criterion of relative stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to use the 
meeting to be held in Quebec City after the parliamentary Easter 
break to ask his provincial colleagues what they think of the 
criterion of relative stability. Then we could total the factors 
the various ministers might take into account to establish the 
stability criterion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think traditional share should be a factor, and the proximity 
of the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point concerns the problem of new species, new 
fisheries.  I think this should be addressed urgently. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before I recognize 
the member for Vancouver Quadra, I want to clarify that we are 
debating all of the amendments before the House.  It is quite 
legitimate for anyone to speak to any of the amendments before 
the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that the government members can talk about any 
group they want, but I want to make sure that I will be allowed 
to speak to the other groups.  Usually, a member can speak only 
once to a group of motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand my sheet, I should be able to rise another three 
times.  For example, if certain members have to leave and if one 
wants to speak to the fourth group before the first, I have no 
objection, but on the condition that I may return to speak to 
the three other groups. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The order made 
earlier today indicates that all groupings are on the floor. 
Having said that, I understand that the critics very often have 
specific interventions on specific groups.  I will seek further 
clarification on the member's specific concern.  However, given 
the circumstances, the member would find that the Chair and the 
House are favourably disposed, through consent, but we cannot 
count on it.  I will get a specific ruling on that intervention 
before we proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a technical glitch.  All of the amendments are before 
the House to accommodate some members who are not able 
to be here for all stages of this debate.  However, the critic 
for the Bloc has to speak to each of the preordained groupings. 
May we have the unanimous consent of the House to afford the 
critic for each party or a representative from each party to 
speak to the groupings, even though all are before the House at 
this time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have no problem with 
that, as long as that includes the critic for each party and the 
parliamentary secretary on this side.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would hope that if 
we give unanimous consent it would include all of the members of 
the committee, all of the critics who sit on that particular 
committee and the official opposition party as well.  Could that 
be included? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Please give us a 
second to sort this out.  I think that the Chair understands the 
mood of the House in what we are trying to achieve.  We need to 
make sure that we can do this technically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Clerk has brought to my attention the fact that the only 
member who was compromised by the fact that I did not indicate 
that all motions are before the House is the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, the critic for 
the Bloc.  Would it be the pleasure of the House to provide for 
the member to intervene a second time on the motions as they are 
presented?  Everyone else has the option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand what the member 
from Gaspé is trying to do and I agree with his intent.  However 
he will have an opportunity to come back and speak again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is exactly the 
problem.  Under the rules the Bloc critic does not have the 
opportunity to speak to the other amendments and was not advised 
thereof before he spoke for the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the way for us to get around this is to 
provide for the member from the Bloc to be able to speak to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, would not a much 
simpler solution be to gain unanimous consent to debate each 
group separately and then we can just move through the groups 
very quickly.  If no one has any comments, then away we go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We could do that. It 
is a good point but there is no way that we could necessarily get 
back to all groups today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would give consent to 
giving the member an opportunity to speak again at the end of the 
rotation, if we have unanimous consent.  The member would have an 
opportunity to speak once more at the end of the rotation. That 
would resolve it and we could carry on.  I make that motion and 
ask for unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion presented 
by the hon. member for Saanich—Gulf Islands for unanimous 
consent would be that because the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok was not aware of 
the fact that all motions were on the table, that the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok and only that 
member be given the last 10 minutes of debate so as to ensure 
that he does have the opportunity to speak to all of the 
amendments on the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to be clear, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok will have one 
more opportunity to speak for 10 minutes during debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Agreed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to be sure I understood 
correctly.  I will be allowed to speak again, but will that be 
after all members in the House have spoken, or when my party 
comes up again in the rotation?  That is my first point. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1335

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I understand that the members who speak now will have 
only 10 minutes to address four groups of motions. If that is 
what the House wants, I will bow to its wishes, but I think 
members should understand that 10 minutes for four groups of 
motions is very little time, since the future of the fishery and 
the fate of an international treaty are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if that is what the House wants, rest assured that when 
we come back at third reading I would like my speaking time to 
be longer than any fish ever seen. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I think the House 
has been very generous in affording the critic time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the House understands the very real interest that all 
members, but particularly the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok has in the 
fisheries.  The member may speak during the normal rotation.  It 
would probably be best to speak again in normal rotation. 
Therefore, resuming debate, the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
would like to thank the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok for his helpful 
contribution to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, I was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans.  The hon. member is an intelligent man 
and an unfailingly co-operative committee member. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to the subject specifically, the kernel of our 
discussion is of course the 1982 United Nations convention on the 
law of the sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthwhile reminding the House that Canada, with Singapore 
and Venezuela, in effect was the conscience of this great 
international law making project.  It lasted for 12 years. Alan 
Beesley who was legal adviser to our foreign ministry, Tommy Koh 
of Singapore, and Aguilar Mawdsley who later became a judge at 
the World Court, provided the modernizing ideas on the law of the 
sea.  It is a great credit to their initiatives that this became 
a convention after 12 long years of negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have not ratified the convention which recently became 
law with the 60th instrument of ratification and there were 
reasons for that.  It was thought that there were gaps in the 
treaty which became apparent in the light of subsequent 
developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those hon. members who were in the previous parliament will 
remember the problems the minister of fisheries of that period 
had with flagrant overfishing as we saw it by certain long range 
European fishing countries just outside Canadian territorial 
waters.  This overfishing contributed to the degradation and 
ultimately the threat of disappearance of scarce fisheries 
stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, on excellent and imaginative advice, decided to go 
ahead anyway.  He was right that there was a legal base for the 
control action we took.  It was necessary to go back to the 1958 
and 1960 conventions, the first and second United Nations 
conventions, to get the main philosophical support for what we 
did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be remembered that Canada was taken to the World Court 
over this by Spain.  In a ruling in December, the World Court 
upheld Canada's position but on a technical adjectival law issue, 
not the main substantive issue, of the ability to conserve 
endangered or diminishing stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, to make assurance doubly sure we went ahead 
with negotiation of supplementary international agreements that 
would fill the gaps as they had now become apparent in the 1982 
convention.  These were the 1994 and 1995 UN agreements on 
straddling and highly migratory fish stocks which are the 
substance of the United Nations agreements on straddling and 
highly migratory fish stocks, UNFA as it is referred to.  For 
these treaties to be able to go ahead, in our view we need to 
supplement what the then minister of fisheries did by divine 
inspiration and the power of the apple. 
This is not an instrument of discord, an apple of discord.  It is 
a friendly object in international negotiations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister went ahead and took the action but it would be very 
important to cross all the <I>t's</I> and dot all the <I>i's</I> 
and make sure that Canadian internal legislation provides the 
enforcement powers for the purposes of Canadian internal law that 
the minister found, correctly, in international law as it then 
existed before 1982 and as imaginatively reinterpreted to meet 
new conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That essentially is what this bill is all about. It will tidy up 
our national law.  It will then put us in a position to do what I 
have asked for at least five or six times in the House over the 
last several years, to go ahead and finally ratify the 1982 
convention on the law of the sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a convention that Canadians inspired, in very large 
measure.  We gave it the interesting dynamic elements.  We did 
not have the problems that our American friends had.  They 
worried about damage to their internal mining and other interests 
by the convention's very imaginative provisions on sharing some 
of the to be expected wealth from ocean depth mining with 
underdeveloped countries and others under a special United 
Nations fund and a special United Nations administration. We did 
not have these fears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did have this feeling and commitment to environmental 
protection, the special concern that Canadians have had for 
protecting endangered species and species in danger of extinction 
as we have seen both on the east coast and the west coast.  On 
the east coast it is Europeans and on the west coast we feel it 
is sometimes internal states within the American system that do 
not respect the United States treaty obligations under 
international law and on the west coast, the 1985 Canada-U.S. 
Pacific salmon treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a measure to tidy up our law.  It will remove the 
objections that some have made to our ratifying the 1982 
convention.  Immediately after the adoption of this law, it will 
enable us to do everything to present a 200% perfect legal case 
on which the then minister of fisheries in 1994-95, with great 
imagination and that special gift of poetry that Newfoundlanders 
and I suppose people from all of Canada's maritime regions have, 
decided to go ahead.  He cited the duty of protecting endangered 
species, the notion that it is one world of scarce resources. 
One country diminished by unnecessary illegal acts in terms of 
general international law damages all the world community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very constructive piece of legislation.  We welcome the 
contributions that have been made from all parts of the House in 
support of the measures conveyed in this.  It is my great 
pleasure to endorse the legislation, to urge its support and to 
thank members from all parties in the fisheries committee and in 
other arenas for the support they have given these general 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a law-abiding country.  We support international law, not 
international law narrowly construed, but international law 
captured in its full spirit and with an eye to emerging needs. It 
is not simply a static re-statement of the old in relation to old 
problems.  It is capturing the new problems and finding creative 
solutions for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am assured by the former minister of fisheries and the 
fisheries minister that this will enable us to proceed to 
ratification of the 1982 convention.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we agree with the intent of this legislation.  It is obviously 
trying to implement the UN fisheries agreement which was 
negotiated in 1995 and also the UN convention on the law of the 
sea of December 1982, some 15 years ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one very troubling clause, and that is clause 4 which 
will change section 7.01.  This is with respect to enforcement on

waters, in a NAFTA regulatory area.  I will read it word for

subparagraph 6(e)(ii) or (f)(ii), the officer may, with the 
consent of that state, take any enforcement action— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It completely nullifies this entire agreement.  It waters down 
our existing provisions.  If we have a foreign vessel fishing in 
our waters illegally in the NAFTA regulatory area, before we can 
proceed with enforcement action we must get the consent of the 
flag state.  They will argue that that has to be in there because 
it is part of the UN fisheries agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to the enabling legislation, Bill C-96, which was 
introduced by the former fisheries minister back in April 1997. 
He introduced the enabling legislation for the same UN agreement. 
This is the enforcement section which he intended: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A protection officer may, subject to any regulations made under 
subparagraph 6(e)(iii), arrest without warrant any person who the 
officer suspects on reasonable grounds has committed an offence 
under this act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our difficulty.  This makes it meaningless.  It waters 
down our position.  In fact the Premier of Newfoundland, Mr. 
Tobin, has written letters to the committee with respect to this 
very issue.  His concern is why we would water down our current 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have amendments which would correct that and we would ask the 
government to look at them.  What we are asking under the 
amendments we put forward is to give the minister the power of 
consent.  In other words, if there is a foreign vessel fishing in 
our waters in the NAFTA regulatory area, that enforcement could 
be taken with the minister's consent.  We are saying, in these 
circumstances, let us have a clause that if this exact situation 
existed enforcement officials would have to contact the 
department and, with the consent of the minister, they could take 
enforcement action.  Right now they have to go to the flag state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver Quadra talked about a very colourful 
moment.  Let me read a paragraph from Michael Harris' book 
<I>Lament for an Ocean</I>.  This takes us back to 1995: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the other shot that was heard around the world.  The 
50-calibre machine-gun burst from the <I>Cape Roger</I>, three in 
all, marked the first time since Confederation that Canada had 
fired on another country in defence of the national interest. 
When the order came to open fire, the officers aboard the 
fisheries patrol vessel were so taken aback, they asked that the 
command be repeated.  The faithful words crackled once more over 
the ship's radio:  An initial burst was to be fired over the bow 
of the Spanish trawler <I>Estai</I>, the next rounds into her 
screw sixty seconds later if she refused to stop. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was Mr. Tobin who did that.  We had illegal fishing.  What 
we ask is that this legislation protect our sovereignty and our 
interests.  The issue we keep coming back to is that we have to 
get the consent of the flag state.  That waters it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read the provision, word for word.  We have to get the 
consent of the flag state to take enforcement action.  What I ask 
is that we amend that section so that officers on the high seas, 
with the consent of the minister, can take enforcement action.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would correct this fundamental flaw in the bill.  Again, 
the intent is worthwhile.  But if we correct that fundamental 
flaw, put that power into the minister's hands in this rare 
exception, then we could take enforcement measures against 
foreign vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on one other thing.  I will be quick because I 
would like to give a couple of minutes to my friend from 
Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have laws for foreign vessels so we can protect our 
sovereignty, but what is even more troubling is that in British 
Columbia, in the town of Ucluelet, our government is giving 
Canadian fish away to foreign nations.  Foreign nations are 
fishing in our waters.  This bill does nothing about that issue, 
even though it was brought up over and over again in an east 
coast report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a piece of legislation, an international agreement, 
with respect to foreign fishing.  However, I would encourage our 
government to really look on both coasts at what foreign nations 
are doing inside our waters, both on the processing and the 
fishing side, to ensure that we take action and give fishermen on 
both coasts priority to this resource.  Our fishermen should get 
first crack.  Unemployed fishermen on both coasts do not know how 
they are going to pay their mortgages or make ends meet, and yet 
we have foreigners processing our fish and fishing in our waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is possible, I would like to share the couple of minutes 
that are left to me with the member for Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Saanich—Gulf Islands is requesting the unanimous consent of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was hoping to get this time at the beginning of the 
debate to outline for the various members what is happening and 
how things are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, we reverted to orders of the day today.  A bill 
was being debated that had been supported by the majority of MPs 
in this House.  It had been sent to committee where the Liberals 
and the NDP killed it.  That bill was on consecutive sentencing. 
It was something which nine out of ten Canadians supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We are debating 
report stage of Bill C-27.  If the member for Yorkton—Melville 
does not have words that are germane to that bill, he is out of 
order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to speak to the first two amendments to Bill C-27 which 
were proposed by the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first proposed amendment is to include in Bill C-27 the 
general principles of article 5 of the United Nations fisheries 
agreement.  The second, as members know, is to add an 
interpretation clause to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate on a sound 
piece of legislation that clears the way for the ratification of 
an essential international agreement.  The bill amends the 
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the Canada Shipping Act to 
enable Canada to implement certain provisions of the UN fisheries 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ratification of this agreement and, more importantly, its full 
implementation are crucial to the conservation of straddling and 
highly migratory fish stocks.  The agreement will not come into 
force until 30 nations have ratified it.  So far 19 nations have 
done so, but Canada's name is not yet among them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we move forward with the passage of Bill 
C-27.  Once Canada has ratified the agreement we will be in a 
much stronger position to urge others to do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians across the country, and certainly people in my riding 
of Waterloo—Wellington, want to see the resources of the sea 
protected.  No one wants to see a repetition of the devastation 
caused by the collapse of the Atlantic groundfish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As important as this bill is, the democratic process cannot be 
hurried.  The government has, accordingly, given full 
consideration to the concerns raised by members of the opposition 
parties in committee.  However, in the case of the first two 
amendments proposed by the hon. member the government cannot 
agree.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first would include in Bill C-27 the general principles of 
article 5 of the UN fisheries agreement and I would like to first 
speak to this proposed amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada ratifies the UNFA, which will happen as soon as Bill 
C-27 is passed and the requisite regulations are made, Canada 
will be bound by the obligations and the responsibilities 
provided by that, including the general principles found in 
article 5 of the UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada pushed for the inclusion of these principles in that 
agreement during negotiation of the agreement.  We used, as a 
basis for these principles, our Canadian fisheries management 
policies and practices, and I think that is important to note. 
Canada, therefore, already has in place scientific and fisheries 
management policies and practices which implement these 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has, for instance, 
adopted a precautionary approach as a policy objective.  I would 
like to note at this time the obligations for UNFA parties, which 
include that we adopt measures to ensure long term sustainability 
of fish stocks, that we ensure the use of best scientific 
evidence, that we assess the impacts of fishing, that we adopt 
conservation and management measures, that we minimize pollution, 
that we take measures to prevent or eliminate overfishing, that 
we take into account the interests of subsistence fishers, that 
we collect and share data concerning fishing, that we conduct 
scientific research and, finally, that we implement and enforce 
conservation and management measures.  Many of these obligations 
are met through DFO's process of developing integrated fisheries 
management plans for individual fisheries in our land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will continue to co-operate with other fishing nations 
and coastal states, as UNFA provides, in order to implement all 
those principles through decisions taken within regional 
fisheries organizations to which Canada is a party, such as NAFO 
and ICCAT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members can see, the first proposed amendment is not 
necessary as the amendment of the principles contained in the 
UNFA does not require specific authority in the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act.  Canada has been and continues to apply these 
principles through the application of existing and revised 
fisheries management policies and practices, and we would on this 
basis urge the House to vote against this first motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that I am out of time.  I wonder if I would be 
allowed to come back later to deal with the second amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Yes, the member is not out of time. As a matter 
of fact, you have about five and a half minutes left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I thought I would intervene now and you can bring your 
arguments to bear on your second topic as you see fit.  You will 
be recognized when we return to orders of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it is almost 2 p.m., we will proceed to Statements by 
Members, and I will recognize the hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra.

Speaker, the big oil companies have confirmed what every Canadian 
consumer believes when they said to the <I>National Post</I>, 
“When did costs have anything to do with gasoline pricing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world crude oil price fell 60%, 17 months ago, but it took 
15 long months for gas prices in Saskatchewan to drop even a 
couple of cents.  Now crude oil prices are rising slowly but it 
only takes 15 hours for gas prices to jump right back again, an 
unjustifiable gouging of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major oil companies brag that Canada has among the lowest 
gas prices of the G-7 countries, but they do not tell Canadians 
that we have the highest prices of any oil exporters.  The gas 
retail market in Canada is dominated by those four big elephants 
that sing “It's every man for himself” to their tiny 
competitors while they dance all over them, according to Tommy 
Douglas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of this annual marathon is commendable in its efforts 
to eliminate racism everywhere.  Efforts such as this touch on

racism and discrimination will be eradicated completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I express sincere congratulations to Henderson Paris, a resident

making against the people of Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully the air campaign will come to a conclusion as quickly

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

trend, the key to building success in the next century.

Airlines, Metronet, Canadarm, the list goes on.  Slowly but

Today it is Ameritech acquiring 20% of Bell Canada.  Head offices

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Let us look at the facts.  In 1994 the sellout was $8 billion. By 
1998 it was up to $50 billion.  In information technology the 
sell-off increased sixfold in just one year.  Does the minister 
refute these Industry Canada figures or will he admit there is a 
direct relationship between Canadian control and growth in the R

<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  What is 
happening increasingly, in particular in technology related 
sectors, is that the world is becoming smaller and much of the 
market is global and international.  It might be interesting for 
the leader of the NDP to realize that while investment in Canada 
has been growing, Canadian investment abroad has also been 
growing, so much so that in 1997 income from Canadian direct 
investment abroad reached $11.5 billion, the highest figure ever, 
which is almost equal to the amount that has been paid on foreign 
direct investment into Canada in the same year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

$50 million to the RRAP program.  We did not wait for a 
conference.  We financed the Anne Golden report.  We participated 
financially in today's conference in Toronto.  Our ministers are

can answer their needs.

is just more talk and what the homeless need is more action from 
this government.  The finance minister mentioned the word 
homeless in his budget speech but no funding was actually 
provided to deal with this very serious problem.  Since then we 
have seen the appointment of a new minister for the homeless and 
she has not been provided with the resources needed to get the 
job done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Reports are being censored, conference presentations cancelled

it is the deputy minister who appears to be simplifying this by 
saying that our standard of living is low, taxes are too high and 
our depreciating dollar seems to be totally responsible for this. 
That is the minister's own deputy minister. It is sort of like 
<I>Pravda</I> which said that wheat production in the Soviet Union 
was just absolutely terrific when in fact there were food

of those views by the hon. member for Edmonton North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member had the faintest understanding of what she is 
talking about, she would be standing in shame and saying that she 
regrets that she voted against support for research and 
development in the private sector.  She would say she is sorry 
that she has not put a focus on the lack of training in Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

Canadian exports of painted and manufactured wood product by

out duties on value added products to create free trade. That is 
why U.S. special interests want to classify these products so 
they become subject to restrictions under the softwood lumber

order is very succinct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 30(5) says that during Standing Order 31 members 
other than ministers of the crown may make statements. Then with 
respect to Statements by Ministers Standing Order 33(1) says a

statement of government policy.  It goes on to say a member from 
each of the parties in opposition to the government may comment 
briefly thereon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker is very familiar with those standing orders. The 
government has taken to using question period for this, depriving 
us of being able to respond. The example today was the minister 
announcing the pay raise for privates in the military. I think 
that should be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, like you, I enjoy question period

administrative responsibility of one of the ministers of the 
government, will be allowed.

seeking information from ministers, very infrequently have I 
intervened.  If the hon. members from the governing party wish to

</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are all in a good mood, I would ask for the consent of 
the House to allow members to discuss the four groups during the 
10 minutes allocated to them if they wish to do so. I would not 
object to that.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington has five and a half 
minutes remaining. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
prior to question period I noted and I reiterate that the first 
proposed amendment as outlined by the hon. member opposite is not 
necessary insofar as the implementation of the principles 
contained in the UNFA do not require specific authority in the 
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second motion proposed by the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, the scope of the 
proposed amendment is much broader than the scope of Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in its title, the purpose of Bill C-27 is solely to 
deal with the implementation of UNFA and other international 
fisheries agreements to which Canada is a party.  Furthermore, 
this amendment is unnecessary.  This is in effect supported by 
the fact that the government and governor in council's authority 
to make regulations in Bill C-27 related to UNFA is restricted to 
making regulations “for the implementation of UNFA”. Adopting 
this amendment then would open the whole of the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act to interpretation in accordance with UNFA, whereas 
this act covers situations falling outside the scope of UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment also refers to the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea.  Canada participated actively 
in the negotiation of the law of the sea convention and members 
will recall the member for Vancouver Quadra spoke about that and 
noted that aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, Canada participated actively in the negotiation of 
the two treaties concluded in 1994 and 1995 to implement the 
convention, an agreement dealing with sea bed mining and an 
agreement dealing with straddling and highly migratory fish 
stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has also participated actively in the development and 
work of the institutions contemplated by the convention.  I 
mention in particular the International Marine Organization, the 
International Sea Bed Authority and the Continental Shelf 
Commission.  I think that is important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government is committed to ratifying the 
convention, I think rightfully so, something all Canadians want. 
However, the timing of this ratification must be placed in the 
context of Canada's broader policy regarding high seas fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNCLOS does not effectively address concerns over high seas 
fisheries management and therefore we must have an effective 
international high seas enforcement regime to protect fish stocks 
which straddle Canada's 200 mile fishing zone in adjacent high 
seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UNFA was negotiated to fill the gaps left in the convention 
relating to high seas fisheries management.  Canada's immediate 
priority then is to ratify UNFA, and Bill C-27 will enable us to 
do so.  I think in that sense we need to hurry and move on this 
expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effective functioning of the high seas enforcement regime 
under UNFA will pave the way then for Canada to ratify the 
convention, and while Canada is committed to the ratification of 
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the timing 
of this ratification has yet to be decided.  It would therefore 
be improper in the meantime to bind ourselves to the convention 
as a whole in such a broad way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the government cannot agree to the second proposed 
amendment as it stands to add an interpretation clause to Bill 
C-27 and therefore I urge the House to reject it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally and by way of conclusion I want to add my voice to those 
who have urged the House to move quickly to adopt Bill C-27.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has learned the hard way that unregulated fishing has 
disastrous consequences wherever it takes place.  Overfishing 
outside our 200 mile limit contributed to the collapse of our 
groundfish stocks.  Collapse of that fishery has damaged many 
Canadian coastal communities.  It is something we all regret 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we took the steps needed to ensure this kind of 
destruction will never happen again off the coast of Atlantic 
Canada or anywhere in the world.  Therefore we need to move 
expeditiously in this very important area.  I urge all members to 
vote for the bill accordingly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me as 
the fisheries critic for the federal NDP to rise in the House to 
speak about a very important piece of legislation.  We do support 
it although we would like to see accepted a few of the amendments 
being put forward to make the legislation even stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry for 
his expert legal opinion when he offered our committee help.  He 
is a fine member of the Bloc Quebecois.  His expertise in helping 
us draft some of the legislation was greatly appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also three other people I would like to acknowledge 
publicly who assisted me in deliberations over the bill: 
Professor Tony Charles of St. Mary's University;  Professor 
Trevor Kenchington from Musquodoboit Harbour, Nova Scotia; and 
Mr. Sam Elsworth of the Sambro fisheries in Nova Scotia who is 
one of the finest experts when it comes to fisheries management 
and the international fisheries agreements of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A former prime minister, Mr. Trudeau, once 
said “The problem with fish is that they swim and that is the 
problem”.  We need international agreements to control, conserve 
and protect fish stocks so that we can protect not only the 
thousands of jobs in coastal communities in our country but the 
millions of jobs in coastal communities around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver Quadra was correct when he said that 
the Law of the Sea Convention was enacted in 1982.  We are now in 
1999 and we have not ratified it.  Canada has dragged its heels 
for 17 years.  The reason is that they waited for me to be 
elected as a member of parliament.  Now the legislation is before 
the House and I greatly appreciate the government and you, Mr. 
Speaker, for recognizing that very simple fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27, the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, was part of an 
initiative in 1995 when the <I>Estai</I> ship from Spain caught 
headlines around the world.  For the first time in a long time 
Canada got tough and shot at someone.  We did not want to hurt 
anyone.  We just wanted to scare them a bit.  The former 
fisheries minister, the present Premier of Newfoundland, ordered 
it.  He became known as Captain Canada and the hero of Canada. 
Everyone loved him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really happened with the <I>Estai</I> ship?  The ship went 
back to Spain along with all the fish that had been caught.  It 
cost the taxpayers of Newfoundland $110,000 to keep the crew in 
Newfoundland.  I love Newfoundland as much as anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eloquent speaker from St. John's will speak on this matter. 
He would love everyone to go to Newfoundland to visit his 
province. The only thing is that he will not pay for it.  We did. 
We paid $110,000 through our taxes for the Spanish crew to stay 
in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What resulted in the end?  We now have Bill C-27, the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act.  The parliamentary secretary from the 
beautiful area of Malpeque, P.E.I., stated quite clearly, 
although it is not written, that their intention is that Canadian 
fish caught by Canadian fishermen be processed in Canadian 
plants.  My party and I have been saying that since we got here. 
As always, a good idea takes a long time before it sinks in.  We 
hope Canadian fish will be caught by Canadian fishermen and women 
and processed by Canadian workers in Canadian plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my amendments to the bill will be that fisheries 
officers, when they realize there is an infraction in our seas, 
will have to ask permission from the foreign state in order to 
enact any kind of action. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Saanich—Gulf Islands was incorrect ever so 
slightly by saying we could not do anything.  I know that if 
officers suspect a wrongdoing, they can board the ship. They have 
to notify the foreign nation of the action being taken.  If I am 
correct, 72 hours notice is needed for the foreign nation to 
respond to Canada on exactly what action can or cannot be taken. 
That is an awfully long time for our peace officers, our coast 
guard officials or even our military people to be on board a 
foreign vessel.  It is also not clear in the act whether that is 
72 hour of business days.  What happens on a weekend or a 
national holiday in the particular country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment of 48 hours simplifies it and makes it much more 
clear.  It does not state whether it is over a weekend or on a 
business day.  I think 48 hours is enough time to give any nation 
warning of what Canada plans to do when we suspect illegal 
fishing in our waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also glad to note that one of the amendments the 
parliamentary secretary will be bringing forth concerns stateless 
vessels.  We are very concerned about what Spain, Iceland or any 
other nation has done when it comes into our waters, but what 
about those with flags of convenience or stateless vessels?  I 
call them pirates.  If I had my way I would not have missed the 
last time; I would have got them.  Every time a foreign vessel 
comes into our water and takes away tonnes of our fish, they 
destroy the hopes, the lives and the aspirations of hardworking 
people in the country from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sinful and it is a shame that we have become the laughing 
stock of the world when we sit back and ask what we can do now. 
These are Canadian resources and they should be controlled by 
Canadian management policies in agreement with other nations.  I 
realize we just cannot arbitrarily do it when it comes to 
straddling stocks and stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the government credit.  Effective today, it is 
starting to talk about it and starting to do it.  The problem is 
that it took so long to get around to it.  As I have already 
explained, I am here now and we will get this problem corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say something to the members of the Standing Committee 
on Fisheries and Oceans from all parties.  I keep saying it is 
the best committee in the House because we try to work as 
co-operatively as possible.  The member from the Gaspé area is a 
very constructive member of our committee, along with his 
colleague who also helped with drafting the amendments.  They are 
very good amendments.  We will be reviewing them and deciding in 
the future whether or not we will be supporting them.  In 
essence, from what we have read up to now, we should have no 
problem supporting the majority of his amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to a great Newfoundlander speaking about the 
problems of the fisheries.  It should be a very interesting 
debate.  Hopefully we can all learn something from this wonderful 
individual. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Nova Scotia who always speaks with such 
great sense and passion about the fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise today to speak to this good piece of 
legislation which all my caucus colleagues and I will be 
supporting.  I am especially delighted to be speaking on behalf 
of our fisheries critic, the member for Burin—St. George's, who 
has become a leader on both the fisheries committee and in the 
House of Commons on all matters relating to fisheries, especially 
on conservation and protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Burin—St. George's cannot be with us today 
because his father is in the hospital having some surgery.  On 
behalf of all members, we offer our good wishes to Mr. Matthews, 
Senior, who is in the hospital today.  Hopefully he is doing 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act is obviously an act that gets a lot of support from all 
people in Newfoundland and Labrador.  It has extensive industry 
support from all sectors.  It is a piece of legislation primarily 
designed to add to our enforcement capabilities, to add to our 
abilities to protect conservation, to protect the fish off the 
coast of Newfoundland and to protect the jobs of many Atlantic 
Canadians who depend on the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act is not perfect, and probably no piece of legislation 
ever is, but it is certainly an improvement. 
Even though it is not perfect we will be supporting it because we 
know of the tremendous pressures that have been placed on the 
fish stocks off the coast of Atlantic Canada.  They are badly 
in need of some protection and certainly in need of enforcement 
of our present laws.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fish we are talking about in particular are the migratory 
species especially on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks.  They 
include cod, flounder, turbot, tuna and swordfish.  Those are the 
fish we protect, but the people who depend on the fishery are the 
people we are really trying to protect in this regard.  They are 
mainly Atlantic Canadians, especially Newfoundlanders, who depend 
upon the fishery.  All Canadians are also well served by 
protecting this tremendous resource which feeds many of the 
world's people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 will have the support of our caucus.  However, I want 
to move an amendment.  There is a problem with the act.  Yes, it 
is an improvement over the old act, but there is one very serious 
gaping fault with the act.  The amendment I will propose would 
change that problem.  The act has to be made stronger. I will 
give a very quick history lesson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1966 in Newfoundland waters there were 266,000 metric tons of 
cod taken.  Although my math may not be great, to me that is well 
in excess of 532 million pounds or more than a half billion 
pounds of fish in fishing year 1966.  In 1977 through an act of 
the House of Commons we brought in the 200 mile limit.  There was 
euphoria in Newfoundland; there was joy and bliss.  We were 
finally to have within Canada control of our resource.  Everyone 
thought that there would be more jobs in Newfoundland, that there 
would be more fish resources and that we would have a very 
vibrant economy based on that fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a real short history lesson we went from 532 million pounds 
of cod in 1966 to zero pounds in a little less than 25 years, in 
1992, even with a new fisheries management regime in Canada and 
even with the 200 mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often during the 25 year period from 1966 to 1990 or so we 
lost a lot of fish because the fishery was not managed by the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  Often the fisheries industry 
was managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs for trade 
purposes, the department of external affairs or foreign trade, 
and a lot of our fish were bargained away and given away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, with the few short moments I have today I want to 
move an amendment to subsection 7.01(1).  This is the most 
important part of the act.  It gives strength to our enforcement 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reads, as the previous member mentioned: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a protection officer believes on reasonable grounds that a 
fishing vessel of a participating state...has engaged in 
unauthorized fishing in Canadian fisheries waters and the officer 
finds the vessel in an area of the sea designated...the officer 
may, with the consent of the state, take any enforcement action 
that is consistent with this act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, when the enforcement officer finds something 
that he thinks is seriously wrong, a new set of laws takes place 
for that and only that act within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically what it says is that if the enforcement officer thinks 
this person, this vessel or this captain has committed a crime in 
Canadian waters, the officer must call the home country and get 
permission to lay a charge.  Maybe then the officer will be 
allowed to lay the charge.  Therefore I move: 
<A NAME="LINK253">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That section 7.01(1) be amended by removing the words “may with 
the consent of that state” and “any” and inserting the word 
“shall” before the word “take”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect I am saying that the enforcement officer, not that he 
may, not that he might, not that there might be some minister of 
fisheries as proposed by the member from British Columbia, shall 
take action consistent with the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will give the enforcement officer at sea exactly the same 
provisions as RCMP officers and wildlife officers and in effect 
the same provisions that enforcement officer has in our offshore 
to lay a charge against a Canadian vessel.  He does not have to 
call the minister of external affairs, the Prime Minister of 
Canada or the Minister of Justice of Canada to lay a charge 
against a Canadian vessel.  If it is a foreign vessel in Canadian 
waters, why in the name of God would we want the enforcement 
officer to somehow call some foreign country to get permission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just imagine if it were the other way around. 
Imagine if this law were in place in Greenland and a Canadian 
vessel was found overfishing or was suspected of overfishing in 
Greenland waters.  Greenland's external affairs department would 
call external affairs in Canada who would get in touch with the 
minister of fisheries.  A cabinet meeting would probably have to 
be called in Canada to get the permission of the minister. If it 
involved a Newfoundland vessel, the premier of Newfoundland would 
talk to the federal minister of fisheries and ask the minister 
not to lay this charge.   How in the name of God even in a 
country as organized, disciplined and democratic as Canada, would 
you get permission of the state government of the vessel 
committing the crime?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at it in the absurd, most of these pirate fishing 
vessels are registered in Panama.  Imagine some poor fisheries 
officer off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland who comes upon a 
Panamanian vessel.  This is what happened with the <I>Estai</I> 
and others.  They are probably from Spain, Portugal or some other 
country but are registered in Panama.  That would be the state we 
would have to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the poor old fisheries officer trying to get hold of 
Foreign Affairs Canada to get permission from the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs to call Panama's minister of foreign affairs to 
get permission to lay a charge off the coast of Newfoundland.  It 
simply would never happen.  It could not happen.  It would take 
so long the evidence would be all gone.  As a result we would 
never get a charge laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment, which I hope will be supported by all members of 
this House of Commons, simply says that if a foreigner commits a 
crime or is suspected of committing a crime in Canadian fishing 
waters, then he will be treated like any other foreigner who 
commits any other crime in Canadian jurisdiction.  He lives by 
Canadian law, that a charge be laid by the enforcement officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is so absurd.  It reminds me of a police officer in Canada 
finding a juvenile delinquent breaking into a shopping mall and 
having to call the delinquent's mom first to see if he can lay a 
charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These fishing vessels off the coast of Newfoundland have 
devastated our stocks.  They have taken us from 532 million 
pounds of fish in 1966 to no pounds in 1992.  We have gradually 
been bringing it up in the last few years.  That protection and 
enforcement is crucial to the fishing industry and its people in 
Newfoundland and all of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is very simple. It gives the enforcement officer 
the right to enforce a law that is consistent whether you are a 
Canadian or a foreigner.  We are talking about foreigners 
breaking the law in Canadian waters. From the point of view of 
Newfoundland and on behalf of my colleague from Burin—St. 
George's I want to say that if we are going to have a successful 
fishery in Newfoundland that employs a lot of people, then we 
certainly need this law changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If the hon. member 
for St. John's West would permit me to interrupt, would you be 
kind enough to give the amendment to the page so we can bring it 
forward before your time expires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this bill is a good one. 
It is good for the Canadian people.  It is good for the Canadian 
fishing industry.  It will be an enforceable act and an act that 
can do exactly what it chooses.  If we remove or change the 
amendment I just mentioned, it will be more similar to acts that 
have been passed in other parts of the world to agree with the 
United Nations agreement on fisheries and oceans.  It is a good 
suggestion that will make the act stronger and better for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The amendment is in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of some members who were not here earlier today, 
all of the amendments are deemed to be put.  Everything is on the 
table, but we are speaking to the amendments in groups.  So it is 
quite in order for this amendment to be accepted by the Chair. 
Resuming debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

very short.  At this point I want to make a couple of comments on 
the last two speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no choice but to oppose the amendment put forward by the 
member for St. John's West in that it is not needed.  We do not 
need to ask permission within our 200 mile limit to board and 
take actions against vessels.  The member is certainly wrong on 
that point, but we do welcome his support and the support of his 
party on Bill C-27.

the three government motions are for the purpose of ensuring that 
Bill C-27 effectively covers stateless vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk on those amendments when we get to that point a 
little later.  We would certainly welcome the member's support in 
that regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will make a few brief remarks with regard to this bill 
before us which amends the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and 
the Canada Shipping Act. I understand the purpose of Bill C-27 is 
to amend domestic legislation to implement an international 
agreement on the conservation and long term sustainable use of 
straddling fish stocks and highly migratory species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The background of the legislation is interesting. In the first 
instance the legislation was brought forward in the last 
parliament by the former fisheries minister, a member from 
Newfoundland. That was on April 17, 1997.  It died on the Order 
Paper when the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one item among many in the bill that I want to address 
which causes me some concern.  It is the notion that the 
fisheries enforcement officials are inhibited if they attempt to 
enforce conservation laws outside Canada's 200 mile limit.  The 
predecessor to this bill, Bill C-96, did not require the express 
consent of participating states in order for Canadian officials 
to take enforcement action. In other words, if a foreign vessel 
was operating in a way that was contrary to Canadian law outside 
our 200 mile limit, on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks for 
example, Canadian vessels would have been able to take 
enforcement action under that bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That particular part of the legislation was one that Canadians 
were quite proud of achieving.  I would like to give a little 
history on how that came about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was fortunate enough to attend the UN on two instances when 
the convention on straddling stocks and migratory species was 
being discussed. At that time one of the concerns Canadians had 
was that they would not be able to apprehend a vessel which was 
in violation of Canadian conservation laws if it was outside the 
200 mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall the shameful incident of the Minister of 
Fisheries in the previous government, the current premier of 
Newfoundland, firing upon an unarmed fishing vessel in the north 
Atlantic.  I say shameful because he was not firing on a military 
vessel but he was firing on an unarmed vessel which was manned by 
some poor fishermen from Spain, men who were making just a few 
thousand dollars for five months work in the north Atlantic in 
very unpleasant conditions, guys just trying to make a living. 
Because we did not have some good legislation in place that would 
allow us to take enforcement actions or compel the people on the 
<I>Estai</I> to abide by our laws, this action was taken.  The 
action was still inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The later action of the former fisheries minister in attempting 
to sever the net from the vessel was just as inappropriate.  He 
put at risk the lives of people not only on the coast guard 
vessel involved but also on that fishing vessel.  Anybody who has 
any sense of the inherent danger of operating or working on the 
ocean knows that you do not play around like that man did.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was shameful.  I thought it was shameful at the time, 
and I still do. I do not want to see it happen again.  The act 
will not prevent that kind of action.  It simply will not do it 
because we have given up the right.  How did we give it up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that I had been at the UN when this was being 
discussed.  The Canadian negotiators were absolutely delighted 
with one item.  They got U.S. consent to allow U.S. vessels to be 
boarded if they were in violation of conservation laws off the 
shore of any country, outside the 200 mile limit of any country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans were very reluctant to allow that to happen. They 
could not abide the thought that some foreign nation would be 
able to board their vessels and enforce some conservation laws, 
but they did come to the table and they agreed that they would do 
that.  The pressure came from the non-governmental organizations 
in the United States.  It did not come from the legislators, but 
from the non-governmental organizations which are concerned about 
conservation matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian delegation felt that they had achieved a great 
victory when they got this consent from the Americans. Back in 
Canada those of us in parliament and on the committee as well as 
those who are interested felt a great victory had been achieved 
as well.  We felt that if a foreign vessel was operating in a 
manner that was detrimental to the welfare of fish stocks outside 
Canada's 200 mile limit on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks, 
Canadian vessels would have the authority to apprehend.  They do 
not have it now, but they would have had that authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Canada is not too proud of its actions at the time 
of the <I>Estai</I>.  We know that Canada knows it was operating 
outside the law.  When the Spanish people took that matter to the 
World Court at The Hague, Canada refused to square off in the 
courtroom.  Canada said no, it was not going.  The court's 
jurisdiction did not apply because Canada would not agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have problems with the Americans.  We would like to get the 
Americans into the court at The Hague and square off with them 
over the problem of the A/B line in B.C. or over the problem 
with the salmon, but they will not go.  They can always say that 
as Canada did not go in the case of the <I>Estai</I>, why should 
the Americans go on this issue when they think they may lose. 
That is the problem.  If we violate international law, it is 
pretty hard to take the high ground and ask somebody else to 
abide by it when we will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we needed to do in this bill was to ensure that Canada 
would have the authority to enforce its conservation laws outside 
our 200 mile limit when the laws were being broken by a foreign 
vessel.  Without that, this whole thing really is worthless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In talking about this point and the actions of the premier of 
Newfoundland up to that point I think Canada was inching slowly 
toward the notion of not just having control of the seabed on the 
nose and tail of the Grand Banks, but also the water column. That 
is important to be able to enforce fisheries laws beyond the 200 
mile limit on the nose and tail.  Up until the <I>Estai</I> 
incident, we were making some progress in staking our claim to 
the water column as well as the seabed.  That initiative really 
has died as a result of the <I>Estai</I> incident and we still 
suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that with this bill the government has backed away from 
an important concession it got from the Americans, an important 
concession that it won at the UN in my understanding of it, by 
not insisting in the bill that we would have the authority to 
arrest foreign vessels which are violating our conservation laws 
beyond the 200 mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this bill is worth the time we are taking to 
discuss it.  This morning the member for Sydney—Victoria 
commented about what he referred to as a diversion when we were 
talking about a private member's bill on consecutive sentencing. 
He said we were taking away from the debate on an important 
fisheries bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is not important because it is not doing the job. 
It is not doing the job because this government caved in. To whom 
I do not know.  It caved in on the important concession it had 
won at the UN, that we would have had the ability to force 
conservation laws outside our 200 mile limit on the straddling 
stocks and migratory species.  We do not have it in this bill. 
The bill is not worth wasting time on until we do get it.

<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make sure that, in the time 
remaining until the end of the sitting today, which is 5.30 p.m. 
I believe, the three groups of motions can be debated.  I urge 
all participants to make sure that we can cover all three.  This 
will mean splitting our time at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will therefore set an example by picking up the pace.  The 
purpose of the motions in Group No. 2, Motions Nos. 5, 6, 9, 11 
and 17—I am trying to put this briefly to give people the idea—is 
to address the so-called extraterritorial role the Canadian 
government could assume by slipping certain terms into Bill C-27 
that, in my view, are open to interpretation because they are 
not consistent with the terms already used in the UN fisheries 
agreement, or UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-27, let us not forget, is to implement this 
agreement.  It would be very wise to use the terminology found 
in the agreement as an example to bring other countries around 
the world to sign that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I would like, if I may, to make use of some notes 
left to me by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, when he had to leave to travel with the 
foreign affairs committee this week.  The member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry worked with the members of the standing 
committee on fisheries, precisely because an international 
treaty is involved and he is far more familiar with 
international jargon than I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the notes my colleague wanted me to bring to the 
attention of the hon. members.  Reference is made to changes 
that ought to be made to Bill C-27 to ensure full conformity with 
the UNFA.  One of these changes would be to replace, in French, 
the term “délimitation” by “désignation” throughout the bill; 
clauses 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 would be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would bring the French more in line with the English 
version of the text.  In French the term “délimiter” confers 
a kind of power upon Canada to decide what the zones will be, 
while the fisheries agreement speaks of “désigner”, and 
in English “designated”.  So why not take advantage of this 
opportunity?

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as bringing the terminology more in line with 
the English version of the text, using the word “désignation” would 
also have reassured Canada's partners, particularly those in the 
European Union, who are still concerned that Canada may again 
wish to confer an extraterritorial scope to its Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act, in contravention of its new 
obligations to be assumed when it becomes a party to UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to ensure that the bill does not assume this scope, we 
also proposed adding a new clause 2.1, to which reference has 
already been made earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of all that is to bring the report into line with the 
fisheries agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still on the subject of the bill's conformity with the UNFA, we 
also proposed that the words “serious reasons” used in the text 
of the agreement itself replace the words “reasonable grounds”, 
as we were not convinced that the test of reasonability the 
government wanted was as exigent as that provided in the treaty 
being implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interpretative provision we proposed to add to clause 2.1 
could also have promoted the alignment of the concept of 
reasonable grounds with that of serious reasons, but its 
rejection by the government does not guarantee it would 
necessarily be interpreted in this sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should be understood here, and I am pleased other members 
have already mentioned it, is that the fisheries agreement is 
inherently good. 
What the government is trying to do is ensure that it is indeed 
the United Nations fisheries agreement they want to allow to be 
Canadianized and to incorporate in our laws.  However, they must 
be very careful.  As someone mentioned earlier, only six 
countries have signed and ratified this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example must be set.  Insofar as possible, it must be 
incorporated textually into Canadian law.  I think the 
parliamentary secretary said that we can do it integrally for 
the moment, since it has not yet become international law.  For 
sure, but I would remind the House we may have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim is to permit the maximum number of countries to sign it. 
Thirty countries are required for it to become international law. 
Right now, there are people getting ready to sign, the European 
Community in particular, and there are 11 countries that I think 
will sign this agreement.  We must show confidence and then urge 
these people to sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we do this?  By means of the United Nations fisheries 
agreement.  If we do not agree with the agreement, let us use 
international diplomatic channels to amend and improve and, in 
certain cases, as the member for St. John's has proposed, put 
more bite into this agreement, so that straddling fish stocks 
will be off limits in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree, except that, with the present wording of Bill C-27 
making it possible to Canadianize certain passages of the 
fisheries agreement, I am afraid we are missing the boat.  I am 
concerned that we are scaring off allies who are getting ready 
to sign this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the member for Delta—South Richmond mentioned the 
problem raised by the boarding of the <I>Estai</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally took part in drafting Bill C-29, which allowed the 
boarding of vessels fishing our straddling stocks.  The Bloc 
Quebecois worked on Bill C-29 to prevent illegal fishing because 
it could not be stopped under international law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, with the UN fisheries agreement, we have a proposed 
framework, but the spirit of the letter included in that 
agreement is in contradiction with the fact that to implement 
the agreement by enacting Bill C-27 is to forget that Bill C-29 
contradicts this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favour of the agreement, but I do not agree with how 
Canada wants to implement it in its own legislation. It is 
inappropriate and even contradictory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what we want to do exactly, particularly since the 
Canadian government can, without consulting the House, without 
getting its approval, sign and ratify this agreement on its own, 
thus promoting its signing by other countries, including the 
European Community. As the parliamentary secretary pointed out, 
we will come back later in this House to Canadianize the texts 
of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to implement that agreement, we might drop 
Bill C-29. I am in favour of having a system based on the rule of 
law. If we do not agree with such a system, we must notify the 
proper authorities. As the hon. member for Delta pointed out, we 
will have to go back to the UN and ask for a clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize we were dragging so far behind, internationally, as 
regards the conservation of fish stocks, that this first step, 
with the UNFA, is a necessary one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the terminology used in Bill C-27 leads us to believe 
that Canada does not intend to respect the spirit of the 
agreement, but to assume the role of a protector, which is good 
in itself. However, one cannot have it both ways. We will have 
to choose.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, while I want to 
deal specifically with Group No. 2, the member for Delta—South 
Richmond mentioned a couple of points earlier in his general 
comments.  He said he did not think this bill was worthy of 
discussion.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I do not 
know where the member comes from in terms of making that point. 
He has expressed endless times that we need better management 
plans, that we need to conserve fish stocks. That is what this 
agreement is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important international agreement through which 
Canada has provided leadership to the world in terms of getting 
to this stage.  Now we are at the stage within our country where 
we need Bill C-27 in order to ratify the UNFA agreement as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok seems quite 
supportive of the bill he kind of inferred that the bill is 
somewhat about motherhood.  It is much more than that.  The bill 
does provide guiding principles of conservation and management 
which we all in the House want to move forward on.  We want to 
ensure we do a better job of managing the fishery, that stocks 
are conserved and that it becomes an industry of the future both 
in this country close to our shore and globally around the world 
for other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides strong measures such that we will have an 
enforcement regime in place.  That will be in a number of areas. 
The bill provides a compulsory binding mechanism for the 
settlement of disputes.  All those points are important.  As a 
country we are showing leadership to the world on the whole area. 
As I mentioned earlier today in question period, we set the tone 
of discussions at the FAO, in which we are moving forward, on 
stock conservation and management measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak on the Group No. 2 amendments, Motions Nos. 3, 5, 
6, 9, 11 and 17, tabled by the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok with regard to 
the French text of the bill. 
The concerns raised by these amendments, with respect to the use 
of the word “délimité” in the French text of Bill C-27, where 
the English text uses the word “designated”, were raised by the 
hon. member and his colleague during discussions at the standing 
committee.  We discussed it at quite some length.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government fully appreciates the strong need for precision 
and clarity in both official languages.  However, after careful 
consideration by expert legal and linguistic advisers, we have 
determined that the best term to be used in the circumstances is 
the term “délimité”, which is currently used in Bill C-27.  We 
are certainly standing with that word because it provides, in our 
opinion and based on legal and linguistic advice, the best 
clarity to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to the other motions, the governor in council's 
authority to make regulations designating areas of the high seas 
subject to the UNFA regime is not open ended.  The designation 
must be for the implementation of UNFA or other fisheries 
treaties.  Only those areas of the sea regulated by the relevant 
regional fisheries organizations can and will be designated, 
neither more nor less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore urge the House to vote against the second 
group of amendments proposed by the member opposite for the 
reasons I have outlined.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to very briefly ask the 
parliamentary secretary for fisheries and oceans a couple of 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previously the member for Delta—South Richmond indicated a 
concern about UN conversations at meetings or groups that he had 
been to a few years previously.  He raised a couple of very 
interesting points about the possibility that Canada may have 
reduced any kind of managerial control over or opportunity to 
toughen our conservation laws, especially on the nose and tail 
of the Grand Banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask if it is at all possible for the 
parliamentary secretary to respond to the Reform member's 
assertions and if he could table any kind of response to the 
House of Commons so that all of us could review the comments from 
the department and the government on what the member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how the member got a holiday named after him.  I guess 
he was lucky in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I want to wish you, all the pages and all of my 
political colleagues in the House of Commons, as well as the 
people of Canada, a very happy Easter and a very restful holiday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to clarify

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Group No. 3 comprises Motions 4 and 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 is made for concordance purposes.  The purpose of 
Motion No. 7 is to ensure that MPs have a right to review when 
the minister wishes to enter into other treaties or when the 
minister or the governor in council wishes to apply something 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not speaking here of restricting the power of the minister, 
but of allowing us as parliamentarians, since we are asked to 
participate in the ratification and implementation of the UNFA, 
to have a say in it subsequently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ratification of an international treaty does not require the 
creation of Canadian legislation.  At the very least, out of 
simple politeness, they could have simply tabled a notice of 
motion.  We would have treated this like a motion, exactly as 
they did in the case of the motion on distinct society.  It was 
fine to use that approach for distinct society, but not for Bill 
C-27, while all their legal experts tell us that they could have 
signed and ratified this agreement without asking us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have the microphone at this time and we are still on the 
air, allow me to point out that the purpose of Motion No. 7 is 
to introduce two new subsections. 
First, subsection (2) reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) No regulations shall be made under paragraph 6(<I>e</I>) or (<I>f</I>) 
unless the Minister has laid before the House of Commons a draft 
of the regulations that are to be made at least 120 days before 
the regulations are made. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hundred and twenty days, or four months, is not all that 
long.  It allows the parties time to learn the contents of the 
regulations, to sound out those who will have to live with 
application of these regulations, or in other words the fishers, 
and to get back to the House, to the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans, to make comments.  This could not help but improve 
any regulations the minister would be tempted to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this would allow us, as parliamentarians, to have a 
say in the matter. 
We are the ones who are accountable to the public—public servants 
are accountable to their minister—but we should also be given the 
opportunity to have a say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 proposes to add subsection (3), which reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) No regulations made under paragraph 6(<I>e</I>) or (<I>f</I>) of this Act 
shall come into force unless they have been approved by the 
committee of the House of Commons that normally considers 
matters relating to fisheries and oceans. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this only makes sense. 
If the House of Commons says that it needs a standing committee 
on fisheries to clarify and understand marine-related issues, it 
would be appropriate for the department and the minister himself 
to respect the wishes of the House regarding anything that may 
concern the implementation agreement, and have the issue come 
back before that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is based on common sense. I will sum things up by 
saying that parliamentarians must have a look at the issue. This 
is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to the motions we discussed earlier. Since I 
am the sponsor of the motions included in the first three 
groups, I was the first one to speak, but I have not yet had the 
opportunity to comment on remarks made by hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did mention that the fisheries agreement could be ratified and 
signed without the approval of this House. I would like members 
opposite to realize what we are really trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the way to protect our stocks at the 
Canadian level—the hon. member from Newfoundland wished we would 
go further—but we already have Bill C-29 for that. We have the 
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act to protect what is in our 
waters. As for straddling stocks, we already have Bill C-29, 
which allowed us to behave the way we did with the <I>Estai</I>. The 
international community understands that. The important thing is 
to make the international community understand.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The subtleties of language are very important in international 
diplomacy.  If a word is used in French or English, the people 
who have to live with the French expression provided by the 
government are perhaps better qualified to say care should be 
used in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not claiming to be the best linguist Quebec or the 
francophone community ever produced.  Sometimes I murder my own 
mother tongue. But God knows I want to try to improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask that care be used in choosing the words, it is 
because we feel, perhaps with our Latin blood, that it is 
important for the countries we will be inviting to sign the 
agreement.  I think that is what counts at the moment.  We want 
a UN fisheries agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this umbrella, we can try to add a little more bite and 
make sure people understand the same thing, but if to increase 
the bite we frighten potential signatories, we will miss the 
boat.  So we must choose our words carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois knows a good thing when it sees it.  In this 
case, is that not getting the largest possible number of 
signatories to the agreement?  I think that is the aim.  Or does 
it lie in protecting fish stocks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has already helped do this in the absence of 
international law.  We worked with the government to move Bill 
C-29 through all three stages in a single day.  We have shown 
common sense and co-operation because we believe that our stocks 
must be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-29, Canada has already done its part.  The important 
thing is to get the maximum number of countries on board.  The 
Bloc Quebecois is holding out its hand precisely so that the 
House will be careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether I will be allowed to table the document. 
I will not hold it up right now, but it is here on my desk.  It 
is a press release dated March 11 issued by the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans when it took part in an FAO forum in Rome. 
There was a question about this earlier during Oral Question 
Period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This press release is very eloquent. The fifth paragraph reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Rome today, Canada called on all nations that have not 
already done so to ratify and fully implement key international 
agreements, in particular the UNFA, before the end of 2000. For 
its part, Canada has already introduced legislation in 
Parliament with the objective of ratifying UNFA by the end of 
the year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key word in this paragraph is not something I made up.  It 
is the representative of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
addressing all countries of the world in Rome and calling on 
them to fully implement key international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ask that some provisions of the UNFA, like article 5 of 
part II, be included as general interpretation and management 
principles, I am not being mean. I did not write them, they are 
in the agreement. Now I am told “This is not necessary. DFO 
already applies these principles in the measures it is taking”, 
but a measure and legislation are two very different things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can change a measure like one changes one's shirt—some people 
change shirts every day. I have the feeling DFO sometimes changes 
its mind two to three times a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to know that DFO recommends integral measures. I 
think the minor amendments we put forward to ensure that Canada 
can get the most people possible to sign the agreement are 
laudable efforts and I urge all my hon. colleagues to weigh all 
of this very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Bloc supports the UNFA, but has some 
difficulty accepting the way the government is using Bill C-27 
to pick and choose the parts of the agreement that suit it. We 
could miss the boat here.

Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I am really 
pleased that the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok recognizes the 
elegance of DFO press releases.  I am sure those in the DFO 
headquarters communications branch will be putting that one on 
the wall because it is something we have not heard that often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the remarks just made, we on the government side 
appreciate the efforts made by the member opposite in terms of 
trying to debate and discuss and get the best bill forward we 
can.  I clarify that we did listen intently to the discussions 
held at committee in terms of the concerns coming forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois on wording.  We had it checked out by legal and 
linguistic experts and it was found that better wording and 
better clarity rests with the wording we have currently in the 
bill.  We certainly thank the members opposite for their interest 
and the points they raised in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 3 motions, Motions Nos. 4 and 7, propose amendments to 
Bill C-27 that would require that regulations made pursuant to 
the bill be reviewed and approved by the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans.  I believe Motion No. 
4 is consequential to Motion No. 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 does amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and 
the Canada Shipping Act.  Its passage is required for Canada to 
be able to ratify the UN fisheries agreement which we need to 
protect straddling and highly migratory fish stocks.  Existing 
legislation is for the most part sufficient to allow Canada to 
implement the UN agreement.  There are, however, some gaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 is intended to allow Canada to assert the rights and 
meet the obligations set out in the agreement.  Various speakers 
talked about some of those rights and obligations earlier and I 
specifically indicated that it does create guiding principles of 
conservation and management, that it creates an enforcement 
regime, that we all have to respect and give some authority to 
our fisheries officers, and creates compulsory binding mechanisms 
for the settlement of disputes.  They are all very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has worked hard to ensure the bill is fully 
consistent with the agreement. Once the bill is passed and 
subordinate regulations are made, Canada will be in a position to 
ratify the United Nations fisheries agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general the purpose of regulations is to set out the details, 
the nuts and bolts, of a legislative regime.  This is the intent 
of the proposed regulation making power found in Bill C-27.  This 
regulation making power allows for the making of regulations that 
would set out such details as the fishing rules adopted by 
regional fisheries organizations such as NAFO that vessels of 
states party to UNFA or to the other treaties implemented 
pursuant to Bill C-27 must comply with, in the areas of 
the high seas where these rules apply, and the circumstances and 
procedures that must be followed to enforce these rules, a very 
important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have such regulations approved by parliament would be both 
impractical and inefficient.  The member for St. John's West made 
that very point, that we need to act with haste in terms of 
people violating these agreements.  The fishing rules adopted by 
regional fisheries organizations are amended every year.  These 
rules provide for such details as the amount of fish that can be 
caught, where the fish can or cannot be caught, the size of the 
fish that can be caught, bycatch restrictions, gear restrictions 
and so on.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these rules are valid for only one year and must be put 
in regulations quickly so as to be applicable in as short a time 
as one month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is already the Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of 
Regulations which has the express role of reviewing government 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit the House should not usurp the role of that committee. 
Having the House review and approve regulations made pursuant to 
Bill C-27 would be inefficient, impractical and not in the best 
interests of Canadians in terms of acting quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons the government cannot accept these two 
amendments and I urge the House to reject them.  Furthermore, I 
call on all members to continue to give their support to Bill 
C-27, which will clear the way for the implementation of this 
valuable and necessary international agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are serious about conservation, and I know all members 
are, we need to ratify UNFA and get on with the task of 
rebuilding what is left of our straddling and highly migratory 
fish stocks before it is too late.  As I said earlier today, we 
are making progress in the House. We made progress a couple of 
weeks ago at the FAO in Rome and Canada can continue to provide 
leadership in that regard.  With the support of hon. members on 
this bill it will move us a huge step forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to go back on these Group No. 3 amendments to section 7, 
enforcement and the heart of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this act will be an enforcement act rather than a diplomatic 
act then section 7 seriously needs to be amended.  I will read it 
again as it stands now.  It talks about a foreign vessel in 
Canadian waters committing an apparent offence: “The enforcement 
officer may, with the consent of that foreign state, take any 
enforcement action that is consistent with this act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I amended that to say that the officer “shall take any 
enforcement action that is consistent with this act”. It 
actually gives some power to the enforcement officer.  I am very 
disappointed that the government seems unwilling to listen to 
logic in this section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  What other enforcement agency in the 
Canadian system has to ask permission of the foreign state of 
citizenship of a person who has committed a crime? If a 
Panamanian citizen kills a Canadian citizen, does the RCMP have 
to call the president of Panama, the minister of external affairs 
from Panama and ask them if it can lay a charge of first degree 
murder against the person?  Obviously it is too silly to talk 
about. I do not mind picking on Panama because it really is in 
fisheries the pirate country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person from Panama came to Newfoundland and took up 
partridge hunting, which I dearly love in the fall, and he wanted 
to shoot partridge in February or March, does the Newfoundland 
wildlife officer actually have to call and say he cannot lay a 
charge against this person from Panama until he gets permission 
from somebody? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a customs officer finds a person from Panama with a trunk 
full of cocaine, does he have to call the minister of 
international trade from Panama to get permission to lay a 
charge?  Obviously not. It is too silly to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment our caucus is suggesting in section 7(1) is to 
provide for the enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary might say he does not agree with 
this but it is funny that he did unanimously agree with it when 
he was a member of the fisheries committee, when it had some 
leadership under the member for Gander—Grand Falls.  The 
fisheries committee agreed to change that section of the act to 
put in that the enforcement officer shall take whatever action is 
consistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we also know the parliamentary secretary came in the 
House and would not concur or agree with the fisheries committee 
report which he had also agreed with at committee.  That is how 
Liberals do things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary and all the Liberals and everybody 
on the fisheries committee realized that section of the act was 
very weak and a change was required. 
They made in the committee exactly the same recommendation I am 
making, that the enforcement officer shall take any action 
consistent with the act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the parliamentary secretary to tell his caucus that 
this is not a diplomatic act we are talking about here.  We are 
talking about an enforcement and conservation act that is crucial 
to the way of life of many persons in Atlantic Canada, especially 
Newfoundlanders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary to reconsider the Liberal 
position on this and to really put some teeth in this so it 
really does become an enforcement act rather than a diplomatic 
act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was not going to speak again but 
a couple of issues have just risen that I think need 
clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is not question and answer period but I want to 
reiterate something. My colleague from St. John's West is correct 
on what happened in committee. We had agreed on a certain wording 
of a piece of legislation.  Unfortunately it has been changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the parliamentary secretary if he can ask the 
department for complete clarification one more time and table 
that response in the House so that not only my colleague from St. 
John's West but the Bloc, the Reform and we can have a clear 
answer on what the department sees as a response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another question for the parliamentary secretary. If Bill 
C-27 passes in the House and passes in the Senate, how quickly 
will we be able to sign the law of the sea agreement? Will Canada 
sign it?  Will the government do it immediately or will it wait? 
I think that is a very important question.  I know the 
parliamentary secretary cannot respond right now.  If he could 
agree to table those responses in the House, we would greatly 
appreciate it on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, have a great Easter, you and your family, and to 
everyone in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, after a full day of practice, you are now able to 
pronounce the name of my constituency almost perfectly. I invite 
you to visit my beautiful riding this summer. You will love it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now looking at the fourth group. I know that clerks are 
trying to work miracles to find a connection between motions but 
I will do my best to quickly find the link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 8 and 12 were both introduced by the Bloc 
Quebecois. Motion No. 8 concerns section 7.01, which would read, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>7.01(1) If a protection officer has serious reasons to believe 
that a fishing vessel— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this change is to bring the terminology in line 
with that found in the United Nations fisheries agreement, 
instead of referring to reasonable grounds. Some will say I am 
splitting hairs here. This is not my intention but, if we 
want to make the work of lawyers easier, I believe that in 
dealing with an international treaty special attention must be 
paid to terminology and format. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for Motion No. 12. The Bloc Quebecois proposed 
these motions in order to bring the terminology used in the bill 
in line with that found in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now comment on Motions Nos. 10 and 13 put forward by the 
Reform Party. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 10 also concerns clause 4 and relates to terminology. 
They replace “with the consent of that state”, that is the flag 
country of the offending vessel, with “with the consent of the 
Minister”, which would enable the Minister to decide what he 
will do. Same thing in Motion No. 13 I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult. I will read immediately Motion No. 14, put 
forward by the NDP member who spoke earlier. With respect to 
clause 8, he asks through this motion—and this was the subject of 
his first speech this afternoon—that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) has not responded within forty-eight hours after a 
notification was given to the state under subsection (2); or 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the 48-hour concept the NDP member would like to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a big problem when I listen to what Newfoundlanders, NDP 
members and all other members are saying. Everybody seems to 
want to protect our fisheries, and that is fine. They are right 
when they say this agreement on fisheries does not have enough 
teeth. The point the NDP member is making in Motion No. 14 says 
a lot. I do not want to create any panic, but I want to show if 
I may the new weapon the fishery officer will now have to use 
when he boards and inspects a vessel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Try to imagine a fishery officer boarding a ship. He will wear a 
uniform, he will have a handgun on one hip, but what will he 
have on his other hip, under the regulations? His new weapon is 
here, a cellular phone. He will need a phone to enforce this 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From now on, he will not be allowed to board and inspect a 
fishing vessel without first notifying the country of the vessel 
caught in the act. Gun in hand, he will have to ask “Okay, wait 
a minute. What is the phone number of your government? I have to 
call your prime minister to ask for his permission”. That is 
what we have in this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a more serious mode, I am sure members understand the problem 
I have. I come from a fishing community, and I want to protect 
our fisheries, like all other members here. 
This is what we did with Bill C-29, when international law did 
not cover this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the <I>Estai</I> episode in 1995 and, oddly enough, it is in 
1995 that the UN fisheries agreement was drafted, and Canada was 
actively involved in that agreement. But what do we want to do 
exactly? Today, the House is not being asked to protect 
fisheries, but to agree to implement the UN fisheries agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not negotiate this agreement. I hear members say that it 
is not strong enough. Is this the proper forum to discuss it? I 
do not think so. We will have to go back to Rome with DFO 
drafters, as the parliamentary secretary said earlier, because 
we are being asked to comply with the agreement in its entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means the Department of Fisheries and Oceans believes it is 
the best tool in the world. 
Now it recommends “the new best tool in the world”, as our Prime 
Minister would say, to its fishery officers, saying “Now, you 
must have a phone because that is the way that, at the 
international level, it was decided to proceed when you want to 
board and inspect a boat or when you have serious reasons to 
believe that someone did something illegal with regard to 
fishing”. But the proper forum to talk about it is at the 
international level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is really to protect fisheries, and we all agree to say 
“We are strong and we try to have it our way like this”, let us 
stick with Bill C-29. However, if Canada is now ready to sign 
such an agreement, it may mean that Bill C-29 is not enough at 
the international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find allies. People have to understand that fisheries 
need to be protected. Foreign countries must streamline their 
fisheries as we did on the east coast and on the west coast too. 
If we want to stop our stocks from being depleted, we have to 
ask people not to help themselves to our food locker. But we 
also have to understand that people need time. 
A way to increase public awareness through international 
diplomacy is to implement a fisheries agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to what I have heard here today, the proposed 
agreement would not be enough. If people really want strong 
tools, this agreement will not be enough. I would expect that 
when the House returns on the Tuesday following the Easter 
break, all the parties in the House will not agree to let Canada 
sign the agreement, because we really want stronger tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main point here, that tool in question, is a telephone given 
to fisheries officers, who have to contact the foreign countries 
involved and give them three days to respond. It is as if the 
telephone service in these countries did not allow them to 
respond any faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to live in an international law environment, and I 
think we must educate people about this, we may have to set 
aside our desire to get tough internationally and try this 
mediation, have the agreement ratified; once covered by this 
agreement, we could then try to find some way of incorporating 
into it the stronger measures requested by the hon. members, but 
if we want firm measures now, this agreement should not be 
ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois agrees with an international law system. We 
will support the United Nations fisheries agreement, but we do 
not agree with Bill C-27, which I believe completely misses the 
mark and fails to respect the spirit and the letter of the 
agreement. By trying to keep two pots on the boil, Canada might 
miss the boat.

for St. John's West, a member of the NDP and the member opposite 
raised about the consent requirement in section 7.01.  I will 
outline it in some detail in the hope that before third reading 
they will see the good logic in it, understand that there is not 
a problem as a result of section 7.01, understand that their 
concerns are being taken care of, and be able to come into the 
House and support the bill in its totality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consent requirement in section 7.01 is there for a legal 
reason.  International law requires that consent of the flag 
state be obtained in the circumstances described in section 7.01. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 7.01 deals with a very narrow situation.  It deals with 
the situation where a foreign vessel is spotted in Canadian 
waters and there is reason to believe that it has committed a 
violation in Canadian waters.  For some reason Canadian 
enforcement officials are unable or were unable to follow the 
vessel in hot pursuit when it escaped from Canadian waters to the 
high seas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In such a specific situation international law requires that the 
flag state's consent be obtained if Canada wants to board the 
vessel on the high seas, if it is spotted there later.  In other 
words, if there is not a hot pursuit or the pursuit is broken, 
Canada cannot simply board that vessel on the high seas two days 
later, for instance, without the flag state's consent.  This 
would be contrary to international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's proposed amendment would be contrary to the 
international law as reflected in UNFA.  We should understand it 
is only in that specific instance where that occurs.  We 
certainly want to abide by international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with the government amendments to the bill as a 
result of the standing committee's discussion that we think 
improve it substantially.  Bill C-27, in the final analysis, will 
enable the Government of Canada to implement the agreement.  The 
bill amends the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the Canada 
Shipping Act which is necessary before the agreement can be 
ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once this is done and Canada has implemented the agreement, we 
will have an important tool for protecting straddling and highly 
migratory fish stocks.  Specifically Motions Nos. 15, 16 and 18, 
which are government motions, are necessary and were decided as a 
result of the discussions in the Standing Committee on Fisheries 
and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments are to clauses 11 and 12 of the bill. 
Clause 11, which amends sections 18.01 and 18.02 of the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act, provides for procedural rules 
applicable to prosecutions and to the collection of fines where 
the vessel is the defendant as opposed to a person.  UNFA 
contemplates actions against vessels, not against persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New sections 18.01 and 18.02 will enable the crown to institute 
proceedings and collect fines against vessels rather than 
persons.  This is what is sometimes referred to in maritime law 
as an in rem procedure.  These two procedural rules were meant to 
apply to pursuits and collection of fines from all vessels 
including vessels that are stateless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 12 of the bill proposes an amendment to section 18.01 of 
the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act.  This amendment provides 
that whenever an enforcement officer exercises power under this 
act on the high seas, as described in Bill C-27, the rules 
provided by criminal law, including those contained in the 
Criminal Code, apply to the enforcement officer's actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example of the application of this provision is the 
protection that the Criminal Code offers to enforcement officers 
when using reasonable force in the exercise of their duties.  It 
is to protect our officers who are doing work for Canada and for 
its fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section is amended by Bill C-27 to apply to situations 
where enforcement officers exercise powers in relation to vessels 
of state party to UNFA or to other relevant fisheries treaties. 
Stateless vessels should have been covered in this provision, and 
the government's proposed amendment will ensure that it covers 
stateless vessels.  Therefore I encourage all members of the 
House to support Motions Nos. 15, 16 and 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the other motions in Group No. 4, we will be 
opposing those particular motions.  In the time remaining I will 
try to get through them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first two amendments proposed by the member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, provided in 
Motions Nos. 8 and 12, seek to substitute the term “reasonable 
grounds” currently used in Bill C-27 for the term “clear 
grounds” used in UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-27 uses the term “reasonable grounds” for good reason. 
This standard has been tested in light of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms and has obtained approval from Canada's 
highest court.  It is equivalent to the standard of clear grounds 
used in UNFA.  I therefore would urge the House to understand 
this reasoning and to vote against the proposed change submitted 
by Motions Nos. 8 and 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to comment on the amendments proposed in 
Motions Nos. 10 and 13 tabled by the member for Saanich—Gulf 
Islands, which really refer to the point raised earlier on 7.01. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both motions seek to substitute the consent of the minister for 
the flag state's consent prior to exercising certain powers. Flag 
state consent in the situations described in Bill C-27, for 
example, sections 7.01 and 16.2, is required under international 
law, which I explained a moment ago.  To do otherwise would be 
contrary to international law and Canada's obligations under the 
United Nations fisheries agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to address the one amendment proposed by 
the member for Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore in 
Motion No. 14 with respect to Canada's obligations under UNFA to 
implement a three day waiting period before taking any further 
enforcement action once on board the vessel of a state party to 
UNFA.  Adopting a shorter time period, as proposed by Motion No. 
14, would put Canada in breach of its international obligations. 
We certainly do not want to do that.  We want other countries to 
abide by the agreement and we should ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government intends to prescribe the three day period in the 
regulations to be made under Bill C-27.  It would not be 
practical to specify this period in the bill itself because if 
this period was shortened we would have to amend, yet again, the 
Coastal Fisheries Protection Act.  The proposed amendment would, 
therefore, not only be impractical, it would be contrary to the 
United Nations fisheries agreement.  For these reasons I would 
urge the House to vote against Motion No. 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members of the House, in order for us to move 
ahead and continue to provide the leadership that we have been 
providing with regard to fisheries around the world, to support 
the government amendments I have talked about, Motions Nos. 15, 
16 and 18, and reject the others I have mentioned for the reasons 
outlined.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK269">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 9 consideration of the motion 
that Bill S-11, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act in 
order to add social condition as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to this bill and to discuss an issue that 
is important to many Canadians, the human rights issue in Canada. 
Although I am not convinced it is the proper way to address the 
issue, it at least raises the issue of human rights.  Often a 
discussion of it and the debate that surrounds this kind of 
important issue helps to not only educate members of parliament, 
but also to make sure that we put it on the front burner instead 
of the back burner here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed that this bill originated in the Senate.  As 
usual, anything that comes from the Senate is a little tainted in 
the sense that it did not come from elected representatives, 
those chosen by the electorate.  Those people are chosen by prime 
ministers, and that is unfortunate.  We might say that the party 
with convictions is over there.  Unfortunately, the Senate is not 
the place to originate bills.  Bills should come from the House 
of Commons, from both government and opposition benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 has good intentions.  The bill is intended to add 
social condition as one of the designations in the charter of 
rights that cannot be discriminated against.  I believe that the 
intention of the bill was to make sure that poor people are not 
discriminated against.  That is what it amounts to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a lot of legislators may feel they are looking after the 
poor by adding social condition as one of the listed items in the 
charter, I do not believe this technical listing is going to add 
another red cent or look after the needs of the poor at all, if 
that is the intention.  I do not believe it will change the 
personal situation of the hundreds of thousands and maybe 
millions of people who have the greatest needs in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It almost makes a mockery of the real solutions to helping poor 
people by easing the conscience of legislators who say “Maybe if 
we just put this into the legislation then the poor people will 
go away and we will not have to worry about the situations that 
are causing the poverty and the distress for families and so 
on”.  That is almost worse than nothing.  Then it means that 
instead of putting together taxation laws and actions and 
creating a society that gives poor people the greatest 
opportunities, we somehow ease our conscience by putting a word 
in the charter.  I do not believe that will help people in the 
long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Liberals have actually hurt the poor over the past 
years.  With their pay more, get less budgets they have gutted 
health care without providing an alternative for most people. 
They have hiked taxes to the tune of billions of dollars.  They 
now take $39 billion to $40 billion more out of the economy than 
they did a few years ago.  There is the usual waste in 
government.  We have been talking in the House over the last 
while about the decline in the standard of living, the decline in 
productivity and the decline in opportunities for Canadians, as 
well as the tax discrimination against single income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often some of the poorest families in the land are the single 
income families and this government has chosen not to address 
that taxation discrimination.  It found itself before the United 
Nations in a rather embarrassing situation trying to justify why 
its tax laws discriminate against single income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is not just a children's issue, it is not just a single 
income family issue, but it certainly does affect entire 
families.  People are not poor in isolation.  Often they are poor 
due to a whole set of circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lowering taxes is one way to help those who are poor.  That is 
not just putting words in the charter, that will actually help 
people. If we allowed them to increase their personal deductions, 
a proposal put forward by the Reform Party, we would actually put 
more money in their pockets, which would allow them to make the 
decisions that would help them out of the poverty trap.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK277">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-11, an 
act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act in order to add social 
condition as a prohibited ground of discrimination, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad we had that interruption.  It is nice to know that the 
Senate is actually doing something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been talking about adding social condition to the 
charter as one of the conditions that we would no longer be able 
to discriminate against in Canada, although, again, I do not know 
how we would define social condition.  There is no definition in 
the dictionary, so it is a hard thing to know exactly how to 
define. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to the second point which talks about judicial 
activism. 
I am concerned that by adding another category called social 
condition to the charter the lawyers are going to have a field 
day trying to interpret for the benefit of the judges and to have 
the judges rule on what social condition means.  Will social 
condition be used to justify all sorts of interference by the 
courts into the lives of ordinary Canadians?  How do we prove to 
someone that a social condition is a discriminatory act? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we need to mail someone a letter, can we ask whether they 
have a job, or a mailing address, or whether we can do a 
background check on them?  Would that be a discriminatory act? Is 
it somehow meanspirited and nasty to ask people to do certain 
things based on their social condition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other provinces have added social condition to their provincial 
charters.  Almost without exception they have not been able to 
use it in the courts. It is so undefined it takes a lot of court 
time and a lot of imaginative work by the lawyers with very 
little constructive action on behalf of poor people themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern for judicial activism is well grounded in recent 
decisions that have happened here in Canada.  Judges have taken 
it upon themselves to write laws, reinterpret laws and rewrite 
laws on behalf of Canada and override the express wishes of the 
House of Commons. That is a bad trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House have voted on the extension of spousal benefits 
to same sex couples.  I think that is a good subject to debate in 
this place.  We will hear good arguments pro and con. Regardless 
of a person's personal position on it or what they may say in 
debate, this is the place to decide those things.  Instead the 
courts step in and overrule what was an express decision of 
parliament that I voted on in the last House.  The courts say 
that regardless of what was done in the House, they are going to 
make that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this place took a position on child pornography and said 
it is wrong for people to use and possess child pornography. Then 
a judge in my own home province stepped in and said, “I do not 
care what you guys said.  I am going to interpret that law 
differently.  I am going to strike down the child pornography 
ruling”.   And the justice minister said not to feel so bad, at 
least it is only in my province.  In my province, there is no law 
now against the use and possession of child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When judges choose to step in and overrule and make the law in 
huge decisions, like the Delgamuukw decision which has now tossed 
my province into complete turmoil on land use and aboriginal use 
of land issues, it causes havoc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the Reform Party we believe that rather than allow judges 
to exercise increased and increasing influence in Canada, there 
needs to be a reasonable balance between the judiciary branch and 
the legislative branch here in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of that balance means that this House should have an 
opportunity to be involved in the selection and appointment of 
justices, in reviewing controversial decisions by a judicial 
review committee, by ensuring that legislation has an adequate 
preamble as to the purpose of the legislation, what we are trying 
to accomplish with it, what we do not want accomplished with it 
and by having good definitions within the law itself and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of ways to make sure the House of Commons is the 
supreme law making body in the country and that we do not turn 
over, by abdicating our role to the judiciary, the chance to 
unduly not just interpret laws but to actually make laws.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker,  I 
would first like to thank the member for Shefford who introduced 
this bill on the important issue of discrimination to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the Reform Party did not understand this bill at 
all. It is totally wrong, totally false to say that social 
condition has produced no result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that, since 1977, when social condition was added to 
the prohibited grounds of discrimination in Quebec's charter of 
rights, 21 decisions have been handed down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What tangible results did this have? It was recognized that 
income security beneficiaries were a group whose social 
condition was special. The member for Shefford is saying that 
poor people have a special social condition. This, in my 
opinion, can be easily proven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the 21 decisions handed down in Quebec, the first province, 
I repeat, to add social condition to the prohibited grounds of 
discrimination in its charter, five extremely important 
conclusions were drawn. 
First of all, it was established that discrimination based on 
social condition is totally unacceptable and that people, 
particularly the poor to whom housing may have been refused, 
have a redress mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many legal precedents. There are many decisions on 
social condition. And they make it clear to owners that 
discrimination based on social condition will not be tolerated. 
Those who are refused an apartment, because they supposedly do 
not earn enough money as welfare recipients, have a redress 
mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the inclusion of social condition in the Quebec Charter 
of Human Rights gave redress mechanisms to single parents. As I 
already said, the rich, the well off and those who are free from 
want do not need this kind of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why our Reform colleague would ask what 
useful purpose it can serve. In view of the plight of the 
disadvantaged, the legal precedents and the changes it has 
brought about, that kind of comment is totally uncalled for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Courts ruled in favour of single parents. One case comes to 
mind, D'Aoust v Vallières. This was the case of a single mother 
who had been refused a mortgage to buy her first house despite 
the fact that she had an income of about $1,000. That decision 
was handed down in the early 1980s. Her mortgage would have been 
$300, which is what she was paying in rent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because she was a single parent registered for income security, 
the credit union—I will not name it but it was a credit union 
in the Quebec City area—refused to even consider her 
application, even though she could qualify as a home buyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, some decisions recognized that social condition included a 
criminal record, so the fact that somebody had a criminal record 
was not an acceptable ground of discrimination. In other words, 
social condition means something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means at least three things. First, it means education. It 
also means income, personal wealth, general capital and, above 
all, it means how people are perceived within the community, 
according to social class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would dare claim nowadays that the unemployed, welfare 
recipients and single parents are not victims of stereotypes and 
prejudice? But what is more, and more unacceptable still, is the 
fact that such prejudice still has a voice in an institution 
like the Parliament of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House without hesitation that it is often Reform 
members who promote social prejudice. I do not say all members. 
Some are obviously very progressive, but a number are not. The 
remark made earlier by our colleague shows that he is 
unbelievably unenlightened, and I think his comments are 
unworthy of a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not forget that we do not live in a society where 
poverty is on the wane. We do not live in a society where the 
number of poor people is dropping. We live in a society where 
there are more poor people than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report by the OECD—not a report by the Bloc Quebecois or the 
Conservative Party or the Liberal Party—a report by the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which is 
neutral, reminded us that Canada ranks third for poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our society is producing more and more poor and that is thanks 
to government policies. Among industrialized countries, only the 
United States and Australia have a worse record in this score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would social condition offer if it was included in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act? It would offer redress to have a 
number of sections in the Employment Insurance Act invalidated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which sections? Those who know human rights, those who know 
Canadian law, those who, like me, have read all the decisions 
handed down since 1978 know which ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has led to significant improvements in the situation of 
welfare recipients and single parents. I am willing to bet that 
as soon as social condition is included in the Canada Human 
Rights Act as a prohibited ground of discrimination, we will be 
able to challenge sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the Employment 
Insurance Act, which discriminate against labour force entrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who have never had a job and who make their first 
employment insurance claim must have 910 hours of work. They are 
the only ones who have to meet that requirement. This is 
discrimination. It is not equal treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that if challenges on the basis of social 
condition were allowed under the Canada Human Rights Act, those 
who are unemployed would win their case, because it must be 
recognized that unemployment is a social condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for sections 12.3 and 22 regarding maternity 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B> I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> My colleague agrees with me and it makes me 
happy. That shows he has a progressive mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B> I always agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> He always agrees with me. I want to say he is 
my friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could challenge, based on sections 12.3 and 22, the 710 hours 
eligibility requirement for maternity benefits, since that 
requirement does not exist in other parts of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge parliament to pass this bill brought forward by the 
member for Shefford, and I think we would help those less 
fortunate in our society by giving them the opportunity to 
challenge and obtain redress, based on social condition, because 
social condition is a reality. The poor are discriminated 
against, and we must give them the opportunity to take their 
case to a human rights tribunal.

<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, poverty is a recognized source of inequality and 
disadvantage in society.  In Canada the federal government has 
lost or relinquished most of its capacity to support Canadian 
citizens and is creating a culture that puts far more value on 
wealth than on human values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past Canada has managed to move away from discrimination 
based on gender or ethnic background, but today we are moving 
toward a system of discrimination based on wealth.  On February 
13, 1998, our party put forward the following motion in the House 
of Commons: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemns the government for promoting an economy 
where the gap between the super rich and ordinary Canadian 
families is widening, risking the future of our youth, and 
strongly urges the government to introduce in the coming budget 
measures ensuring every Canadian an opportunity to share in a new 
prosperity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Figures tend to indicate that in today's economy a few are 
getting richer while the majority of the population is not 
getting a fair share of the wealth in our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent report by the Centre for Social Justice indicates that 
the average income for the richest 10% of families in 1971 was 
$170,000, 21 times that of the poorest 10%.  By 1996 Canada's 
richest were making 314 times the average income of the poorest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 is related to a recommendation from the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission which calls for, among other things, an 
amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act that would outlaw 
discrimination against the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is discriminatory enough.  It prevents full 
participation in society and can deny adequate housing.  It 
certainly affects educational opportunities and keeps a child in 
hunger.  As Canadians we must not add to that litany by giving 
the poor no protection or recognition under our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the case of Vriend v 
Alberta that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law confers a significant benefit by providing state 
recognition of the legitimacy of a particular status.  The denial 
of that recognition may have a serious detrimental effect upon 
the sense of self-worth and dignity of members of a group because 
it stigmatizes them—.  Such legislation would clearly infringe on 
section 15(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Code because its 
provisions would indicate that the excluded groups were inferior 
and less deserving of benefits. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is still not recognized as a source of inequality in 
society.  It is true that attitudes cannot be legislated, but 
attitudes can be changed and can be challenged, especially when 
decisions such as denying a service are based on discrimination. 
We will support the objective of ensuring that poverty or social 
condition cannot be used as a reason for discriminating in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is a party that promotes an egalitarian society.  We 
believe in the role of the state in supporting a fair and 
equitable distribution of the benefits or the wealth generated. 
For us, society should be a humanistic one in which all members 
are treated equally, with respect, dignity and fairness.  The law 
must protect a large segment of society that is being 
discriminated against just because it is living in poverty. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to note that the motion before us today 
gives us an opportunity to speak to the issue of poverty in this 
country.  I believe that this week the Liberal government has 
finally admitted that there was a great deal of poverty in 
Canada, given that it is considering appointing a minister 
responsible for the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the Liberal government would decide to 
appoint a minister for the homeless.  One would need to look at 
why there are homeless people in this country today.  There are 
homeless people because there is poverty.  I am pretty sure that 
it is not the rich who are living in our streets.  There are 
very few rich street people out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at why they are in the street, why there are 
people in my riding who have to go to the food bank, why there 
are children going to school without breakfast.  Teachers know 
that when such children go home after school, there is probably 
no supper for them either.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happens in the counties of Kent, Westmorland and Albert just 
as it happens in Toronto, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland.  We can pretend it is not there, but that will not 
resolve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has appointed the Minister of Labour as 
minister responsible for the homeless.  We are pleased he did, 
but we must note that no money or information resources came 
with the title.  The minister was given a title.  What is her 
mandate?  What resources are available?  Who will be working 
with her? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also asked for a parliamentary committee to be struck. 
We know that, if the minister is to really do her job, she will 
have to review and criticize the policies of her own government. 
When they changed the unemployment insurance program, they made 
people poorer.  People are not poor for no reason.  There are 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laws passed in this House continue to attack the poor.  There 
has to be someone to make sure that, when legislation is 
introduced in this House, no group is attacked by it.  It is 
clear that with the changes to the unemployment insurance 
program the poorest suffered.  That is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be someone to make sure it remains.  I hope the 
minister responsible for the homeless will have the tools and 
the freedom to change the policies of her own party.  That is 
where the problem starts. 
She will also need a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If no members of the opposition work with her, how can we be 
sure that her appointment is not just a title to hide behind? 
We must make sure that the Liberal government does not find a 
way to go outside the House and blame everyone else if there are 
homeless people or poor children in our society so that it is 
not held responsible. We must ensure that the minister has the 
tools and latitude she needs to do her job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 is necessary. This week, I took part in a press 
conference with my Bloc Quebecois and Progressive Conservative 
colleagues and our views on this are similar.  I supported them. 
I think that we must sometimes put aside all partisanship and 
use common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see something that can help someone in difficulty, I do 
it.  That is what I did this week when I supported the bill 
introduced by my Bloc Quebecois colleague. The Progressive 
Conservative Party joined in as well, but the Reform Party 
refused.  That is often the case.  We are having the problems we 
are encountering today because the Liberal Party is promoting 
Reform Party policies.  This is causing a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to rise in the House today to speak in favour 
of this bill.  I have no problem supporting it, nor does my 
party.  We must start to pay attention to poverty, to the 
discrimination that takes place when someone is prevented from 
opening a bank account because they are on welfare.  That is 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an individual living in poverty declares personal bankruptcy, 
he will file for bankruptcy. That person will be told he must 
have $1,500 to declare personal bankruptcy. The majority of 
people living in poverty who declare personal bankruptcy do not 
have $1,500. But the service responsible for managing personal 
bankruptcies has this arrangement with the government, whereby 
the child tax credit can be used toward paying this $1,500 fee. 
The government takes that money out of the pockets of the family 
to give it to the personal bankruptcy service.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the children are the ones who are made to suffer when 
their family is in dire straits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are but a few examples of how much injustice there is in 
this country. I hope all opposition parties that object to the 
growth of poverty in this country will work together to make the 
Liberal government more accountable.

<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague, the hon. member for Shefford who sponsored Bill S-11, 
asked me to convey to the House her deep regret at not being able 
to take part in today's debate.  The member for Shefford who has 
become a leader in our caucus, a leader in the House and a leader 
in the country on all issues relating to poverty, was called away 
at the last moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore speaking for her when I thank all hon. members 
who have spoken to this private member's bill.  Honoured as I am 
to speak on my colleague's behalf, I am equally proud to speak for 
myself about Bill S-11, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights 
Act in order to add social condition as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As its title indicates, the purpose of the bill is to amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act so that no one can be discriminated 
against simply because they are poor and to offer genuine 
recourse when such discrimination occurs, for example, when a 
landlord refuses to rent to someone on social assistance or a 
bank refuses to open an account for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of all the contributions to the debate on the bill, it 
seems that reservations about it are centred mainly on the 
following two points.  One is the wording which has been 
criticized as too vague to achieve the desired results.  The 
other is the need for wider consultation or an indepth review of 
the whole issue leading to a complete revision of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act.  I would like to take a few moments to respond 
to these two objections before wrapping up the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many speakers have voiced concern about the wording.  The term 
social condition is considered too general.  Questions have been 
raised about the possible impact of too broad an interpretation 
of the term and the legal implications that could result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While social condition may seem a vague expression to some, I 
want to point out that specialists in the area of human rights 
and the Canadian anti-poverty movement prefer it to all others. 
It allows for an individual situation to be interpreted on the 
basis of a whole range of social economic factors, unlike the 
word poverty which is deemed to be too narrow because it focuses 
exclusively on economic factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Jackman of the faculty of law at the University of 
Ottawa said when she appeared before the Standing Senate 
Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To entrench a prohibition against discrimination based on poverty 
does not really encapsulate all dimensions of the type of 
discrimination which people experience.  That discrimination 
relates not only to their economic circumstances, but to all the 
social and political sterotypes that emanate from being poor. 
Again, the advantage of talking about social condition rather 
than poverty is that, within social conditions, we encapsulate 
notions like source of income, receipt of social assistance, 
perhaps even the status of being unemployed.  These are all 
conditions that tend to go together, but are not necessarily 
always together. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Canada's chief commissioner of human rights, Ms. 
Falardeau-Ramsay, the very person who would have to manage the 
legal repercussions of this addition to the Canadian Human Rights 
Act, has come out firmly in favour of the term social condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally in March 1998 Ms. Falardeau-Ramsay stressed with 
respect to this whole issue that human rights were indivisible, 
affirming that economic and social rights could not be separated 
from political and legal rights or equality rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, those who have expressed concern about this choice of 
terminology should bear in mind that social condition has been 
used in Quebec's charter of human rights and freedoms for almost 
three years and was approved for more than a year by the British 
Columbia Human Rights Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on to the second point of objection to Bill S-11, we find 
it is primarily based on a perceived need to carry out an 
expanded consultation with more stakeholders before this addition 
is made to the act.  We are told that it would be better to wait 
for the next comprehensive review of the act announced by the 
Minister of Justice several months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Senate Committee on Legal and 
Constitutional Affairs held wide-ranging consultations before the 
bill was passed by the Senate.  It is possible that some points 
of view were not heard during the process, but there is no reason 
whatsoever to delay or prevent the passage of Bill S-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interested parties who did not participate in the Senate's 
consultations will still have the opportunity to propose any 
amendments they consider helpful during the comprehensive review 
of the act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting this bill we can both correct a legislative 
omission that for many years has been the target of criticism 
from national anti-poverty organizations and at the same time 
bring Canada into compliance with the recommendations made in 
December 1998 and in 1993 by the United Nations Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing we will, among other things, be sending a strong 
message across Canada that in this country discrimination against 
poor people will not be tolerated. It is high time in my opinion 
that fundamental human rights should be respected in a country 
like Canada, especially the right to equal opportunity in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House however, in the words of my 
colleague, the hon. member for Laval Centre: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrenching Bill S-11 in the charter should amount to more than 
wishful thinking.  The best way to fight discrimination against 
social condition is to improve the living conditions of our 
fellow citizens who find themselves in difficult economic straits 
incompatible with human dignity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government thus has an urgent responsibility to take 
concrete action to ensure that justice is done to the most 
disadvantaged members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, as my colleague, the hon. member for Shefford said 
in her original remarks to the House on Bill S-11, the general 
obsession with deficit reduction often impels our political 
leaders to take measures that add to the proliferation of laws 
and regulations, making it more difficult for the poor and 
blocking any possibility of their improving their situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This state of affairs confirms the popular belief that the 
people with the power to change things, i.e., the people who make 
the laws, often just do not realize the scale of the oppression 
and discrimination suffered by their fellow low income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague the hon. member for Vancouver East so justly 
remarked, “The greatest challenge for us is to get governments, 
not just the Liberal government but all governments, to examine 
their record and acknowledge their policies which have quite 
deliberately and consciously created increased poverty within 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity today as parliamentarians to do what 
needs to be done by uniting our efforts as we did in 1989 with 
the resolution on eliminating poverty.  We can recognize social 
condition as a prohibited ground of discrimination and include it 
as such in the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the act is neither clear nor consistent. 
While it aims at promoting equity for all Canadians, in effect it 
perpetuates the discrimination it seeks to eliminate by 
protecting only certain vulnerable groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Canadian Human Rights Act does not include 
social condition among prohibited grounds of discrimination is an 
indication of the social and economic alienation of the poor and 
of their lack of influence in the Canadian political system. To 
correct this unacceptable situation, we must change our approach 
and look at poverty from the human rights perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be said often enough.  The prejudices the poor have to 
face in Canada are similar to those faced by the marginalized 
groups who are listed in the Canadian Human Rights Act.  Yet 
poverty is still not recognized in law as a direct and dominant 
cause of inequality and disadvantage in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I call on all my hon. colleagues in this House to 
join me in rectifying this deplorable legislative omission by 
voting for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also I, like others, would like to wish all members, our pages 
and our support staff an excellent and safe Easter break.
