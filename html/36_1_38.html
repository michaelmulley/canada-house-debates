</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, television is our most powerful communications tool. 
Canadians watch it at least 24 hours a week but what they watch 
is what is in abundance, American programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve Canadian programming.  The renewal of the 
Canada television and cable production fund will go a long way to 
achieve this end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fund represents a uniquely successful partnership of public 
and private funding.  It couples government and cable industry 
contributed moneys to increase the presence of high quality 
Canadian programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the fund supported 376 projects and employed over 
19,000 Canadians, with direct and indirect economic benefits 
estimated at $525 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fine example of this was the Avro Arrow mini-series which was 
produced by two of my constituents.  It was written by Keith 
Leckie and co-produced by Marie Young-Leckie.  This show has now 
been sold throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewal of the fund represents not only the government's 
commitment to Canadian television, but also recognizes the 
positive economic impact of Canada's arts industry.

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I remember April 29 of last year so well.  The Reform Party 
brought a motion before the House to initiate a national victims 
bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals supported the motion. We had one committee meeting 
where some victims rights representatives and myself were 
listened to, but then nothing happened. How pathetic it is that 
the Liberal government can give so much hope to so many victims 
and deliberately forget they even exist after one meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the right to know the status of the offender, the 
write to give written or oral victim impact statements and the 
right to know if plea bargaining is taking place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to see why the general public has lost faith in this 
institution.  They see false promises and ignorance of the plight 
of victims from a government that puts more emphasis on getting 
re-elected than protecting its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My message to victims is this:  I will not forget you.  The 
Reform Party will not forget you.  Some day a Reform government 
will legislate your national victims bill of rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming—Cochrane, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when our government took office, mining investment in 
Canada was in decline.  Since then our government's work with the 
mining industry to reduce regulatory overlap and duplication, 
implement innovative changes to our tax system and promote 
environmentally friendly mining practices is resulting in 
concrete benefits for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example in 1996, 20 new mines were opened or re-opened, 
creating 1,790 new jobs.  In 1997 it is expected that 31 mines 
will open, generating over 6,000 direct and indirect jobs.  By 
1998, 32 new mines are expected to open. All in all, Natural 
Resources Canada predicts that over the next five years the 
mining industry will create 15,000 direct jobs and 15,000 
indirect jobs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be a part of this government's efforts to assist 
the mining industry in creating these much needed jobs. I look 
forward to continuing our work together.

the contribution the mining sector has on the Canadian economy.

the provincial premiers are doing a good job under the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let me give you an example of a phoney consultation. I am 
alluding to a referendum question to choose a country, in which 
reference was made to a bill on the future of Quebec and to an agreement 
signed on June 12. However, a poll conducted during the referendum 
campaign showed that only 43% of Quebeckers knew which agreement was 
referred to, only 10% knew which bill was referred to, while 43% 
believed that Quebec could only become a sovereign nation after signing 
a partnership agreement. This is an example of a phoney and fraudulent 
consultation, and it will not happen again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, fortunately 
Quebeckers have much more judgement than the minister.  They 
understood what was at stake, even if he did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other provinces have been so efficient at consulting their 
citizens about the Calgary declaration that certain of them have 
had to cancel consultation days.  In Calgary itself, the people 
questioned during a CBC broadcast said they had never heard of the 
Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So how can the minister talk about consulting the people of 
Quebec when the very folks who signed the Calgary declaration are 
not even able to carry out consultations properly? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, consultations are being held and they are going well, and 
that is precisely what is annoying the Bloc Quebecois. 
They would dearly love to see the consultations fail, but the

</I></B></P><P align=left>But I repeat that the last referendum question was deceptive. 
Try asking the question clearly “Do you want to abandon Canada and

that that will automatically mean the end of your movement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people are starting to call for amendments to the Calgary 
declaration:  First Nations, francophones in Ontario and in 
Newfoundland, and even their new ally, the Reform Party, is jumping 
on the bandwagon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is therefore as follows:  What exactly does the 
minister want to consult the people of Quebec about, when support 
for the Calgary declaration is eroding daily?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> No, 
Mr. Speaker, it is not eroding. However, if ever the separatists 
were to put a clear question to the people, they would see that the 
majority of Quebeckers want to remain in Canada and want nothing to 
do with their proposal, and that is where the erosion would be.

you called my colleague from West Kootenay—Okanagan out of

security.  I, as Speaker of the House, am responsible for

From what I could make out in the preamble, he was talking about 
the security of the House.  I ruled that to be out of order. 
From my understanding, that is where it was going.  I have to make 
these decisions on pretty short notice.  I stand by my decision.

.[Text] 
<Question No. 16—<B>Mr. John Cummins:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the 1995 fishing season on the west coast: (a) 
did all sport fishing lodges provide catch data directly to 
Fisheries and Oceans as required by the Fisheries Act, (b) which 
lodges refuse to directly provide the catch information, (c) 
which lodges were charged for refusal to directly provide catch 
information, (d) which charges were dropped or stayed and why and 
(e) did the Minister of Fisheries or any member of his staff meet 
with any officials or representatives of those lodges charged 
prior to the dropping or staying of charges? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
(a) All sport fishing charter operators, which includes sport 
fishing lodges, except the two indicated in part (b) below, 
supplied the requested catch information to Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans, DFO, either directly or through the Sports 
Fish Institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) There were two sport fish charter operations which did not 
provide the requested information to DFO either directly or 
through the Sports Fish Institute. They were: Mr. George Ardley, 
owner/operator of River Lodge, Rivers Inlet, B.C.; Oak Bay Marina 
Ltd. which operates various sport fishing enterprises including 
the King Salmon Lodge and the M.V. Marabell in the Rivers Inlet 
area, B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Both sport fishing charter operations indicated above were 
subsequently charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) The charges filed against Oak Bay Marina Ltd. were stayed. 
These charges were for failure to provide DFO with information 
requested by a fishery officer pursuant to section 61(4) of the 
Fisheries Act, thereby committing an offence contrary to section 
78(a) of the Fisheries Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice stayed the proceedings on the grounds 
that evidence had come to the attention of the crown counsel 
handling the case, after the charges were laid and before the 
trial, that provided the company with a clear defence of 
officially induced error to the charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, DFO had arranged that fishing lodges could provide 
catch records to the Sport Fishing Institute of British Columbia. 
This arrangement was made to allow lodges to provide the 
information to DFO if they preferred not to do so directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, due to an administrative oversight in Oak Bay Marina 
Ltd., two of their lodges were not informed of the arrangement 
and they consequently refused to provide the data to fishery 
officers. Furthermore, local fishery officers had not been 
informed by DFO management about the arrangements which had been 
put in place. In crown counsel's opinion the confusion provided a 
defence of officially induced error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After weighing all factors, Department of Justice officials in 
Vancouver determined that it would not be appropriate to take up 
needless court time in the circumstances. The circumstances were 
discussed with Department of Fisheries and Oceans officials who 
agreed with the course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) Yes, on unrelated issues.

the Fisheries Act: (a) on what dates were verbal requests made

response; (b) on what dates were verbal requests made from the 
Fisheries charter vessel Francis M and what was the response; (c)

Marabell and was the deadline met by the lodge; (f) following the 
expiry of the deadline what was the date of the second 
boarding of the M.V. Marabell by Fisheries Officers and what was 
the response form the lodge; (g) what was the date of the first 
boarding of the King Salmon Resort by Fisheries Officers to 
request catch data and what was the response: (h) what was the 
date of the issue of a letter to the King Salmon Resort 
requesting catch data and what 
was the response; (i) what was the deadline contained in the

<Question No. 27—<B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the Agriculture and Agri-food Canada “At Work in 
Rural Commununities” resource kit, (a) what was the breakdown 
of the exact cost of production and distribution; and (b) what 
categories of people received a copy of the kit? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada, Lib.):</B> 
The resource kit, called Canada— At Work in Rural Communities 
is a package of information about federal programs and services, 
designed to help all members of Parliament and federal public 
servants to better serve the information needs of rural 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians in small communities and rural areas do not have the 
same access to information as Canadians in urban centres.  The 
kit is one part of a pan-government communications effort, 
developed under the leadership of the rural secretariat in 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The kit represents the work of 14 federal departments and 
agencies, and includes more than 100 fact sheets with program 
details, contact numbers and Internet addresses.  The fact sheets 
are organized according to the government's priorities for rural 
development: partnerships with rural communities, rural youth, 
access to information and capital, and improving the business 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two versions of the kit.  One is a permanent binder, 
sent to members of Parliament and senators, which can be updated. 
The other is a cheaper Cerlox version, distributed to well over 
1,300 frontline federal offices across Canada where rural 
Canadians go for government information.  That includes Community 
Futures offices, Canada Business Service centres, Human Resource 
Centres of Canada and other locations where the federal 
government comes into direct contact with rural Canadians.  An 
Internet version is available on Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada's web site, and an electronic version, by end of the 
season, will have travelled to 155 rural fairs across the country 
as part of the 1997 rural exhibits program, which some 10 million 
Canadians attend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Total costs to develop, design and produce the kit in binder, 
Cerlox, Internet and CD ROM versions were approximately $200,000. 
The main contractor was Innovacom Marketing and Communication of 
Hull, Quebec.  It competed with two other design companies and 
won the contract to create the rural “look”, used on the resource 
kit, the rural Government of Canada kiosk and supporting 
materials.  The company also provided advice as to materials and 
suppliers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Distribution costs totalled about $5,800. 
<Question No. 28—<B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to permits issued by 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, (a) how many were 
issued for each of the years from 1993 to 1997 (to date); (b) 
what constitutes a “compelling reason” for issuing such a permit; 
(c) what is the most often cited reason for issuing such a 
permit for each of the years 1993 to 1997 (to date); (<I>d</I>) does 
the Minister personally review every case where a ministerial 
permit has been issued; (e) who, other than the Minister, has 
authority to issue such a permit; (<I>f</I>) what is the nature and 
extent of background checks on those individuals who receive 
permits; (g) how many ministerial permits have beem renewed at 
their expiry date since 1993; (h) for what average period of 
time have these renewals been extended; and (i) how many 
individuals who have received such permits have been living in 
Canada longer than ten years? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> 
a) The number of permits issued for each year from 1993 to 1996 
is as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year>Number<BR> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1993>10,069<BR> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1994>7,263<BR> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1995>5,482<BR> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1996>4,007 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of permits issued in 1997 will be reported to 
Parliament by the minister as required by subsection 37(7) of the 
Immigration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>b) All cases must meet this condition.  The reasons that compel 
the department to issue permits vary.  Often the presence of the 
permit recipient is required to help workers in Canada produce 
goods and services, e.g. to deliver goods to a manufacturer or to 
provide training.  Hastening or allowing family reunification in 
special circumstances, e.g. pregnancy of an immigrating spouse, 
while continuing processing applications for immigrant visas or 
landing is another typical reason.  They are issued for 
humanitarian and compassionate reasons in order to allow 
individuals who would otherwise be inadmissible to enter Canada. 
The department does not issue permits unless the risk to Canadian 
society of the recipient's presence in Canada is minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>c) The most often cited prohibiting section of the Immigration 
Act for permits issued in each year from 1993 to 1996 is A 
19(2)(d).  This section describes people who “cannot or do not 
fulfil or comply with any of the conditions or requirements” of 
immigration legislation or any orders or directions lawfully made 
or given under the legislation.  It is a very broad class of 
inadmissibility.  Permit holders in this class are not 
inadmissible for any of the other reasons specified in section 19 
of the Immigration Act, e.g. medical, criminal or security 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>d) No, the minister does not personally review each case of 
permit issuance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>e) The minister has delegated authority to issue permits to the 
positions listed in Instrument I-1 attached.  In cases of medical 
or serious criminal inadmissibility there are restrictions on the 
delegation of authority.  These restrictions ensure permit 
issuance is monitored by CIC's headquarters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>f) If the permit recipient applied for permanent residence, the 
nature and extent of background checks are identical to those for 
immigrant applicants, i.e., medical, security and criminality. 
If permit recipients are seeking temporary entry and are 
inadmissible for criminal acts, police records are checked.  If 
permit recipients are seeking temporary entry and are 
inadmissible for medical reasons, they will have undergone a 
medical examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>g) 16,699 permits for 11,433 persons have expired and been 
renewed since January 1, 1993.  Of these permits only 3,781 were 
still valid on October 28, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>h) The average period of renewals since January 1, 1993 has been 
72 weeks or 506 days.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am in receipt of a notice of motion under 
Standing Order 52 for an emergency debate from the hon. member 
for West Kootenay—Okanagan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise once again in accordance with Standing Orders 
52(1) and 52(2) to seek leave for an emergency debate on the 
question of the post office situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made this application last Thursday.  You ruled at that time 
that it was a relatively new strike and it was not in your 
opinion an emergency at that point in time but that perhaps later 
it would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strike has now been going on for a week.  There does not 
seem to be any guarantee, certainly, or even any realistic 
likelihood that it is coming to an end.  Therefore I think it is 
appropriate to request your consideration again, not so we can 
talk specifically about back to work legislation but so we can 
get all the issues on the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hearing conflictions about how much the strike is costing 
business.  We are hearing conflictions about how much 
unemployment it is causing.  We are even hearing conflictions 
from various ministers on their position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like all members of the House to put their concerns on 
the floor and discuss them rationally to see what solutions we 
can come to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member rightly points out that 
he has already asked for an emergency debate on this topic.  He 
was kind enough to send me a second letter with his reasons for 
asking for an emergency debate at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still of the view at this time that it does not meet the 
requirements for an emergency debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
For my guidance so that I do not waste the time of the House or 
yourself, could you tell me what would constitute an emergency 
for this purpose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member will put forth 
another motion at some other time and at that time I will decide 
if it constitutes reason for an emergency debate.

</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words on a couple of 
the motions I have presented under Group No. 1 before the House 
at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion we are dealing with asks to establish a panel 
of experts to review the conflict of interest procedures 
established by the board of directors.  We are talking about the 
board of directors of the new investment fund that will be 
established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe it is very important that there be an independent 
panel of experts which will help to set up a court of conflict 
for the boards.  The reason is that we want to make sure the 
board is as independent as possible from the government.  It 
seems wise to have an independent panel of experts.  It makes it 
more independent from the government.  It is fairer, more 
transparent and something that should be done.  I hope the 
government across the way would be willing to consider it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee a number of amendments were moved.  On many of the 
amendments in committee the four opposition parties were in 
agreement but the government did not accept them.  It has now had 
a chance to think about another whole series of amendments.  I 
hope this time around it will be a bit more receptive to some of 
the wise ideas coming from the opposition parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment I am moving in Group No. 1 is Motion No. 
24. This will establish a new reporting requirement by the chief 
actuary in terms of how he or she reviews the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the actuary only focuses on costs.  In the future the 
actuary should focus as well on forecasting the income of 
seniors.  That has not been done.  What will be the income of 
seniors in 20 years or 30 years?  That is a very important aspect 
of the bill before us today.  Those are the kinds of things I 
believe should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the idea of a pay as you go plan, but a number of 
things in the new Canada pension plan bill are not fair and not 
progressive.  There have to be a number of changes to make the 
plan more progressive.  It is important to say that at the 
beginning of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part the Canada pension plan cannot be amended 
without the support of two-thirds of provinces representing 
two-thirds of the people of the country in addition to the 
federal Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the provinces were negotiating with the government a while 
back, the federal government obtained the support of eight of the 
ten provinces.  The two provinces not in support of the 
amendments being made to the Canada pension plan are the 
provinces of Saskatchewan and British Columbia, both of which 
have NDP governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Saskatchewan and want to and do reflect, on behalf 
of my party, a number of concerns of those two governments about 
the amendments moved at committee stage and again here at report 
stage. 
Now we are finding that there is going to be a rapid escalation 
in the premiums facing workers and employers of this country.  In 
fact over the next three years after this bill takes effect on 
January 1 there will be an increase in premiums of some 73%. That 
is a rapid escalation in premiums that will be very difficult to 
meet by a number of people.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is particularly going to be difficult for the self-employed 
and more and more people are self-employed.  The self-employed 
have to pay both sides of the premiums, the employer and employee 
premiums.  Instead of being the current 5.3% or 5.4%, in six 
years they are going to have to pay 9.9% of their earnings in 
terms of CPP benefits.  That is going to be very difficult for 
the self-employed and very difficult indeed in terms of many 
workers who are receiving wages at the lower end of the scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also very concerned that the whole thing is not 
progressive enough, that the basic yearly exemption of $3,500 is 
no longer going to be indexed.  From 1966 on, that exemption was 
always indexed so that when the cost of living went up, the basic 
exemption also went up, giving a bit of a break to low income 
people. That is going to be eliminated and it is going to be a 
hardship on a great number of people across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the maximum on which one has to pay 
contributions is going to be $35,800 per year.  We are suggesting 
that that should be increased as well so that people who are 
making more money, such as members of Parliament, senators, the 
Minister of Finance or many of the wealthier people in this 
country can pay a greater share of those CPP benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again that was a suggestion made by two of the governments 
during the round of negotiations on changes to the Canada pension 
plan.  It is another area which I believe we should look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contributions are going up and they are going up in a very 
regressive way.  That regressive way is also going to hit 
generationally as younger people, many of whom are not in the 
workforce yet, are going to be paying more and more in order to 
pay the CPP to people who are retired or who are going to retire 
in the next five or ten years.  That is also very unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the side of the benefits, on the side of the recipients we 
are also seeing very regressive changes under the amendments to 
the Canada pension plan.  The benefits are going to drop. They 
are going to drop in particular for low income people, the 
majority of whom of course are women in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also going to see a drop in the survivor's benefits. With 
respect to the survivor's and death benefits, once again most of 
those recipients are women because women live longer than men. 
There are more widows than widowers.  It is going to discriminate 
against women in this country.  That of course is a concern to us 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the concerns we have about the changes that 
are being made to the Canada pension plan.  We strongly believe 
in a public pension system in this country.  We do not believe as 
the Reform Party is suggesting that we should privatize the whole 
thing or abolish the existing Canada pension plan or the public 
pension plan and move to a super RRSP plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do that, what do we do with the so-called unfunded 
liability of $600 million that is going to increase to over $1 
billion within a few short years?  How do we do that? How do we 
cover that?  Those are questions that have not been answered 
appropriately in terms of getting rid of the Canada pension plan, 
in terms of a radical solution for the problem that is facing us 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that should be pointed out is that the Canada 
pension plan is not strictly a pension plan.  In fact it is 
misnamed.  It should really be the Canada pension and insurance 
plan.  A lot of the money, about one-third of it, is paid out for 
insurance benefits.  It is somewhere around that amount. When we 
are looking at insurance benefits in terms of CPP disability, 
which by the way will be harder to get under the amendments, 
survivor's benefits, death benefits and all of these other 
benefits are really insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to privatize the Canada pension plan, what happens to 
the insurance side of it?  Those questions have not been

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think those are amendments that should be seriously 
considered at all by the Parliament of Canada.  The important 
thing is to make sure that this country has a very strong public 
pension plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP in its first 30 years has been a great social program in 
terms of helping to redistribute some income in Canada.  If we 
look at the statistics we find that the number of seniors who are 
living in poverty is a lot lower today than it was in 1966 when 
the Canada pension plan was first formed.  Any regressive change 
in the CPP in terms of who has to pay the premiums and who will 
get the benefits is something which is not going in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my party I have recommended a whole series of 
amendments, two of them in this particular group, which will help 
improve the Canada pension plan to make it more transparent, to 
make it more accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent group that would advise on the code of conduct is 
something the government can certainly live with.  It is not 
going to detract in any way, shape or form from the Canada 
pension plan to have an independent group to advise on how to set 
up the code of conduct and look at conflict of interest rules for 
the board of directors of this new investment fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new investment fund is going to be a big fund.  It will 
eventually be over $100 billion, perhaps the largest investment 
fund or largest pension fund in this country in a few short 
years.  It is important that there be very stringent, very 
transparent conflict of interest rules.  Some of the people who 
will be investing in that fund will be involved in other 
investment organizations.  It is very important that they be at 
arm's length from any kind of conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the reasons why I am moving these amendments. 
I hope the government will be receptive to some of these 
amendments.  I am reminded that the government across the way had 
the vote of only 38% of the people so the majority is actually on 
this side.  Therefore, the government should take some of our 
advice very seriously.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion I moved that is currently under study concerns the mandate 
of the auditor of the investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative Party are very concerned 
about the problems this issue raises, because the Canada pension 
plan investment board will have huge responsibilities and power. 
It will oversee the billions of dollars invested by Canadian 
employers and employees.  It will be playing with the financial 
future of thousands and thousands of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transparency and accountability are therefore of the utmost 
importance if we want to ensure this sizeable fund is well managed. 
This is why we wanted to clarify the provisions of clause 42 
of Bill C-2. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We first start our amendments to clause 42 by extending the 
auditor's term from one year as it presently stands in the bill 
to five years.  The one year term set out in Bill C-2 is too 
short a term to allow for continuity.  With such an important 
fund it does not make sense to allow the possibility to change 
auditors every year.  It does not make for sound administrative 
practices.  We want to make sure the funds will be properly 
managed and allowing the auditor to have a five year term will 
help in achieving that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment we would make on clause 42 is to stipulate 
that removing the auditor can only be done with just cause.  As 
it stands now, clause 42 says that the auditor of the board may 
be removed at any time by the board of directors.  This is 
clearly insufficient. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision clearly needs clarification because, as it stands 
now, it would allow the auditor of the board to be removed at any time, 
without just cause and without anyone having to account to anyone as to 
the reasons for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such vagueness, such discretion invites abuse of power on the part 
of the board of directors, and that cannot be permitted. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we propose is that the board of directors may remove the 
auditor at any time.  However they must do so with cause and 
those causes must be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our amendments, disclosure provisions start in subsection 
1.1. It stipulates that if the board decides to remove the 
auditor it must notify the appropriate provincial minister of 
each of the participating provinces of that removal.  The board 
must also provide the provincial ministers with a reason for that 
removal.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note here that the provinces are an important 
and integral part of the Canada pension plan.  Yet under the 
current bill they need not be made aware of such an important 
issue as the reason to remove the auditor or even the removal 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that under clause 43 provinces are informed of the 
resignation or removal of the auditor.  However this is only when 
the auditor herself objects to her removal or has to resign 
because of differences with the board. The provinces are 
therefore made aware of a done deed and they have no power to 
change anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we went one step further in our amendments.  In 
subsection 1.2 of our amendments we indicate that the auditor may 
not be removed unless at least two-thirds of the provinces 
representing two-thirds of the population agree in writing to 
that removal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that my colleagues understand and acknowledge that 
corporate auditors such as will be the auditor for the CPP board 
are there to protect shareholders, not the board of directors. 
The same principle ought to be applied to the Canada pension plan 
investment board.  Furthermore, the protection of shareholders is 
a recognized principle in Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendments reflect this widely used principle such as is 
found in section 344 of the Insurance Companies Act which 
requires shareholders to be told the reasons for the auditor's 
dismissal and to vote on that dismissal. In our case, the 
provinces stand in as proxies for the shareholders with the 
standard two-thirds rule replacing the shareholders meeting. 
Similar rules are part of the Bank Act of Canada, the Canada 
Business Corporations Act and the Trust Companies Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In subsection 1.2 I explained the process to be used in case an 
auditor is removed by the board. Subsection 1.3 explains the 
process to occur when an auditor resigns.  In this case our 
amendment would require that the auditor notify not only the 
board of directors of a resignation, but also must notify the 
minister and the appropriate minister of each of the 
participating provinces.  Notably the auditor would also be 
required to provide the reasons for the resignation and the 
auditor must make those reasons available to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is again common practice in a corporate world and those 
principles should be applied to the Canada pension plan 
investment board. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure full disclosure of the circumstances of the removal or 
resignation of an auditor, we provided for the requirement for any new 
auditor to obtain a written statement from the outgoing auditor. This 
statement would state the circumstances and reasons of the resignation 
or removal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note here that something is missing in French 
version of subsection (1.4), as compared to the English version. On the 
third line, we should read “d'avoir demandé et obtenu” instead of just 
“d'avoir obtenu”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would reflect the English wording “has requested and 
received”. 
This is an omission that has an effect on subsections (1.5) and (1.6). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now getting back to the relevance of subsection (1.4), as I 
explained earlier, there are practices in the corporate world that 
should be applied to the operation and management of the Canada pension 
plan investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of transparency and accountability. We want to 
ensure that the funds entrusted to the investment board will be managed 
properly and that reputable administrative practices are used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By providing that the incoming auditor must ask the other auditor 
why he or she resigned or was removed, we are echoing a provision of 
section 345 of the Insurance Companies Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so important that the new auditor comply with this 
requirement that he or she cannot accept this appointment without first 
having received the written statement of the circumstances and reasons 
behind the other auditor's resignation or removal.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clause (1.5), we make an exception to clause (1.4). If the new 
auditor did indeed request a written statement from the former auditor, 
but that the latter did not provide a reply within 15 days, the new 
auditor may nevertheless accept his appointment as auditor. This would 
avoid having too long a period without an audit being conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clause (1.6), we reiterate that an appointment as auditor is 
void if clause (1.4) has not been complied with. For example, if a 
person accepts an appointment as auditor without having requested a 
written statement from the former auditor, the appointment will be void. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, this explains the amendments provided in Motion No. 3 
now before the House. 
As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, these clarifications to 
clause 42 of Bill C-2 have to do with the mandate of the auditor of the 
investment board. Our amendments help ensure the board's transparency 
and limit the powers of the board of directors, for the benefit of 
Canadians as shareholders of the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members to support the motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the name of my riding is quite appropriate today since I 
have a bad cold.  That is another story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today begins a very gripping debate on proposed amendments to 
Bill C-2.  Those Canadians who watch the proceedings of this 
House will probably want to be reminded that Bill C-2 deals with 
the proposed changes by the government to the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This stage of the proceedings is called report stage where the 
bill is reported to the House.  Amendments are proposed to the 
bill for the House to vote on.  Then the bill goes into third 
reading or final debate stage before it is voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are amendments now that we are talking about today to the 
CPP bill.  There are six groups of amendments and we are now 
discussing Group No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 1 has six different amendments in it.  I assume they 
are all grouped together because they deal with accountability. 
Under this bill there is a big fund of money set up and it is 
managed by people who will be talked about later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of amendments talks about how the fund managers need 
to report and account for their actions.  There were six 
amendments put forward to deal with this.  These were not the 
only amendments to deal with the way the fund managers operate 
and are accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were quite a number of amendments, as the previous speaker 
mentioned, put forward at the committee stage.  All those were 
voted down by the Liberal majority even though, as has been said, 
the opposition was, in a rare show of good sense, unanimous in 
supporting the amendments which would have made the account and 
its management a great deal more open and transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that they have in their hot little hands a large 
chunk of our retirement security, one would think that the more 
we can do to make this thing open and accountable and 
transparent, we would be eager, willing and prepared to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there does seem to be some reluctance on the part 
of some members from the government to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk briefly about the six amendments that have been put 
forward because I support all but one of them, just so the public 
knows what the opposition and the government are proposing to 
make this fund a little more accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion is the one that has been spoken about by my 
colleague from the NDP.  Essentially what that does is say that 
the cabinet can set up a panel of experts to review the conflict 
of interest procedures which the directors, the board that 
manages this fund, put into place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense the cabinet appoints the fund managers and this 
amendment says the cabinet can appoint some experts to breath 
down the necks of the fund managers.  In a way it is political 
appointees looking over the shoulder of other political 
appointees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we could wish there were a bit more arm's length 
arrangement to all this.  However, it is a step in the right 
direction.  At least somebody, even if a political appointee, is 
going to look over the shoulders of these board managers and it 
seems to me that gives us at least another kind of avenue of 
comfort to know that somebody has some review mechanism or review 
responsibility for these conflict of interest procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly do not want these conflict of interest procedures 
to be like the cabinet conflict of interest procedures we heard 
much about but have never seen.  There seems to be this sort of 
talk about conflict of interest procedures but nobody sees them, 
nobody really seems to be able to make sure they are followed. 
It would be very useful, at least in this case, to move in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we do support that amendment by the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next amendment is one by my colleague from the PC party. We 
have just heard about this, so I will not go on at any length. 
Instead of an auditor being appointed every year, year by year, 
it gives the auditor a term of five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two important things here.  One is of course that the 
auditor has some staying power in this whole scheme of things. 
There is no revolving door of auditors where someone comes in 
cold.  This is a huge fund.  It manages literally billions of 
dollars and it does take some knowledge and expertise to do a 
proper audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So rather than having a possible revolving door of auditors, 
there is somebody who has a grip on the thing and some stability 
and some tenure and who can look after it. As the proposer of the 
amendment mentioned, if the auditor were not doing their job, 
they could certainly be booted out the door before five years, 
but there would be some good reason to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing to mention is that this five year term, 
generally speaking, would outlive a government, so to speak.  We 
would not have quite so much of the auditing of the thing tied to 
whomever is in power at a particular time.  I think this is an 
excellent amendment and should be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third amendment is by the government.  I do not know if the 
government intends to speak to it. It is a good amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act presently provides that a special examination of the 
operations of the board may be carried out at least once every 
six years.  In other words, there may be no special examination 
at all.  This amendment changes “may” to “shall” so there has 
to be a special examination at least once every six years. Again, 
it is a step in the right direction. This is our retirement at 
stake.  To mandate a special examination on top of some of the 
other accountability measures surely would not be amiss.  So we 
support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also bringing in what I call the amendment 
from the hon. member from Prince George—Bulkley Valley because 
that member of the Reform Party challenged the finance minister 
in question period on the fact that the auditor general was not 
the entity or the person with the audit responsibility for this 
huge fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems strange to us that Parliament appoints an auditor 
general to oversee the operations of government but somehow this 
huge fund of billions of dollars had its own auditor whom the 
board, appointed by the cabinet, chose.  We feel very strongly 
that the auditor general should have every ability and every bit 
of information necessary to conduct his own audit of this fund, 
and this amendment would allow that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We commend the government on this amendment.  In fact, it is the 
very first time it has agreed to such a measure, because in 
committee it turned all these kinds of measures down. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, now that the auditor general has had a word with it, the 
government has recognized that it cannot have an auditor general 
of a country and have an aspect of the operations of government, 
particularly such a large aspect, not explicitly subject to his 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the motion I have introduced, it would require 
that the schedule of rates charged under the CPP, the 
contribution levels, not be changed except after reasonable 
public hearings.  Presently the act says it can be changed by 
cabinet.  We say no.  If people are going to have to pay more 
bucks they should at least get to say something about it.  We say 
there would have to be public hearings before changes are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have said a few passionate words about Motion 
No. 24, but unfortunately I do not have time.  However, the 
motion has been ably spoken to by the NDP member and I will leave 
it at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these are good amendments and I hope they will be 
supported by the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak at the report 
stage of Bill C-2, which creates Canada pension plan investment 
board and which carries out an in-depth reform of the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important, I think, to begin with a brief overview of 
the key elements which led up to the drafting of this bill. The 
first point I would like to speak to is that the Canada pension 
plan had got pretty well out of date and no longer really met the 
needs.  It was headed toward an incredible deficit.  It was 
absolutely vital for a decision to be taken in order to remedy the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am rather proud that they turned to Quebec in order to see 
what had been done with the Quebec pension plan.  An equivalent 
pension plan was created in 1964, in the early sixties, during the 
term of Prime Minister Pearson whose view of federalism allowed 
Quebeckers the leeway to create institutions specific to them if 
they so wished. They did so in the area of pensions with the 
creation of the Quebec pension plan which, moreover, has always 
performed better than the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the decision was made to manage pension 
funds and other funds, but particularly the pension funds, by 
creating the Caisse de dépôt et placement.  Some 30 years later, 
along comes the federal government with the decision to create a 
similar body so as to have a satisfactory yield from the 
investments made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill to create the Canada pension plan investment board 
is, therefore, a sort of practical and concrete acknowledgement of 
the efforts that have been made in Quebec.  There might be a lesson 
to be learned here by the present government on the leeway that 
should be given to Quebec on the issue of social programs, and 
perhaps in another three, four or five years, before Quebec becomes 
sovereign, we will have been able to make a contribution to the 
implementation of other still more satisfying programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, at report stage, we need to look particularly at a 
number of amendments made by various parties.  We have to see 
whether they would improve the act.  I refer particularly to Motion 
No. 5, the one tabled by the government, which says that, when the 
auditor general needs to make a special audit, the government is 
committed to a special audit every six years.  I think this is an 
outcome of the work done in committee. 
It is an amendment proposed by one of the opposition parties.  It 
was not accepted at first reading, but the government agreed to dig 
a little deeper.  Today we have this motion, which, like Motion No. 
21, will ensure better distribution of information.  Thus these 
motions may be interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true of the NDP motion on conflict of interest. 
I think, with the size of the amounts managed by the Canada pension 
plan investment board and by the whole new Canada pension plan, it 
is clear that conflicts of interest must be prevented and that 
everything will be done legally and appear to be done legally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives have also tabled an amendment.  It aims at 
ensuring increased autonomy for the auditor general. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look in greater detail; we must analyze it properly to 
ensure it is not already included in other provisions of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first group of amendments therefore contains a series of 
clauses intended to improve the bill, according to how you look at 
them.  This leads us to the realization that the bill will achieve 
a certain consensus across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Reform Party has a whole other view, that 
of privatizing the entire pension plan. 
I think this view is not in tune with our values of social justice. 
In this regard, I think that the Reform Party should listen to the 
public some more to make sure its position is the right one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the Canada pension plan covers 
some 12,000 people in Quebec.  The others are covered by the 
pension plan of Quebec, which has already carried out a 
consultation similar to that being done by the Government of 
Canada.  The two plans have certain identical elements.  This is 
relevant, because it makes it possible to transfer the plans of 
people who have worked in Ontario or another anglophone province to 
Quebec, should they move there.  To a certain extent, this is 
automatic, which is useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also allows members of the Canadian armed forces and the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police to be covered under the Canada pension plan. 
This is a practice that has caused problems in the past. It shows that, 
as far as Quebeckers are concerned, the main pension plan is the Quebec 
pension plan. It is the plan under which almost everyone is covered. For 
the 12,000 individuals involved, it may be important, but on the whole, 
Quebeckers are much more interested in the Quebec pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to bring to the attention of the House the fact 
that these amendments to the Canada pension plan come within the scope 
of a more comprehensive reform of the retirement income system, which 
includes the Canada pension plan, or the Quebec pension plan in Quebec, 
and old age security and guaranteed income supplement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, the Bloc Quebecois has very serious concerns about 
what the existing pension plan will be replaced with. Just as people 
currently covered by this plan, who are already receiving benefits under 
the plan, are assured that existing conditions will be maintained, so 
will those currently receiving what is commonly known as old age 
pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the plan to be established, on which broad consultation 
should be conducted, starting in 1998, it will be important that both 
young people and those in their forties have an opportunity to select a 
pension plan with full knowledge of the facts and that a plan that does 
not provide for intergenerational balance, which is one of the 
objectives of the pension plan currently being considered, not be 
imposed on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an element that can be found in Bill C-2, the Canada 
pension plan bill, and this principle is also included in the Quebec 
pension plan reform. Efforts are made to create a better 
intergenerational balance, by increasing premiums now so that everyone 
can contribute as much as possible toward what they will be getting out 
of the system later. This way, there is no surprise and younger 
generations will not have to pay disproportionately for retirees who 
contributed less in the past, percentage-wise. This applies to baby 
boomers in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are interesting adjustments in this regard in the bill. There 
are the amendments that we find in the first group. 
These are interesting features that will make it possible to 
improve the legislation, after the stages we have seen so far, that 
is, consultation in all provinces, recommendations resulting from 
this consultation, and the work in committee, where we heard from 
groups who came to make representations along the lines of what is 
contained in a number of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that it is important not only that the Canada pension 
plan be more effective than in the past, that it match the 
effectiveness of the Quebec pension plan, but that there also be an 
appearance of fairness, and amendments such as that of the NDP, for 
instance, to ensure better management of conflict of interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is important and interesting because the system 
introduced will be in place for many years.  There has been no 
reform of the Canada pension plan since it was first introduced. 
We are therefore looking at a system that will have to work for 10, 
20 or 30 years.  We must make sure that the bill will be the best 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will give it the necessary attention, 
because opposition parties have taken a constructive approach so as 
to ensure it is the best bill possible.  This is what we want to 
continue to do with the suggestions made today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to pay attention to the votable motions 
among the group of amendments so that, in 10, 15, or 20 years, the 
system is successful and so that people can be as proud in Canada, 
whatever it looks like then, of the results achieved as we are of 
the Quebec pension plan.  In any event, compared to the CPP, the 
QPP has done well, and the federal government has recognized this, 
judging by what we see in the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that we 
restate again today at report stage of Bill C-2, which is 
amendments to the Canada pension plan, that Canadians from all 
walks of life want assurances that the CPP will really be there 
when they need it and when they retire.  They want assurances 
that it will never be taken away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these are legitimate aspirations that everyone from all 
sides of the House shares.  What we are doing is of course making 
sure that the financial sustainability will never again be at 
risk, that in fact the CPP funds will be invested in the same way 
as the private pension plans and that Canadians start to receive 
regular statements of their pension and earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically on the motions in Group No. 1, Motion No. 1 in 
particular talks about the conflict of interest procedures.  I 
think it is important to note that the board's conflict of 
interest procedures will be made public and that will be subject 
to scrutiny not only of experts, but also the public at large. 
The conflict of interest provisions contained in the legislation 
are widely regarded by experts to be quite stringent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a point of clarification.  The first speaker as 
we kicked off the debate today at report stage made a point that 
the investment board was not independent.  I want to state again 
that that is not true.  It is an arm's length board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will be working for the best interests of the plan 
members.  In fact the whole basis of establishing this board is 
to ensure that it is an arm's length board and that there is 
accountability built into that board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the comment about how women were being treated 
unfairly.  It is important that we make reference to the gender 
analysis that was put forward that showed that in fact women 
would receive $2.56 of benefits for every dollar of contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 talks about appointing the auditor for a five-year 
term.  I think it is also important that we make the point that 
it is standard corporate practice to appoint an auditor for one 
year, but nothing is preventing the board from reappointing that 
auditor for subsequent terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of resignation or removal of the board's auditor, 
the act already requires that a statement explaining the reasons 
for the resignation or removal be sent to the finance minister 
and the finance ministers of participating provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a reason for the resignation or removal by the 
board and that provides the accountability and the transparency. 
Again, I want to reiterate that the board is an arm's length 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make reference now to the two proposed amendments that 
the government has put forward, the first of which will in fact 
clarify that the auditor general will have access to all the 
information that he considers necessary to conduct his overall 
audits of the CPP.  On the basis of this change, the auditor 
general has indicated that he is satisfied with the audit 
provisions of Bill C-2 and has written to the finance committee 
chair to this effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment will require that the CPP investment board 
be subject to special examination at least once every six years. 
Bill C-2 currently provides for special examinations but it does 
not specify the fact of minimum frequency.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to restate that these amendments are a result of the 
committee work and the contributions that the various members of 
the committee have made in the discussion on Bill C-2.  The fact 
that we are moving to put a timeframe on the special examination 
once every six years is a slight change from the original motion 
that was put forward in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That change is there to coincide with the review that is to take 
place every three years. The auditor general would have to 
perform a special examination on the second triennial review so 
if there were any challenges to the plan, the Minister of Finance 
would be able to address them at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some additional information about the board and its 
accountability since there has been a fair amount of discussion 
in this first part of the debate on Group No. 1 on the 
accountability to Parliament and to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation makes the investment board fully accountable to 
Parliament and to the Canadian public.  Experts in pension fund 
governance have praised the accountability provisions of Bill C-2 
for being extremely rigorous.  The Ministers of Finance and Human 
Resources Development will be required to prepare an annual 
report on the CPP which will be tabled in Parliament and also 
sent to the provincial finance ministers.  The report will 
include the audited financial statements of the CPP investment 
board as well as the report of the auditor general in those 
statements in his overall audit of the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment we have made clarifies a provision that was 
included in the bill already.  It merely clarifies for the House 
that the auditor general would have had access to any and all 
information that would be required to complete his audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have responded to the issues that a number of members of this 
House have made with respect to the auditor general's access to 
information by bringing forward these two amendments.  These 
amendments also address the request for the auditor general to 
conduct these special examinations over a period of time.  We 
have indicated that every six years would be suitable since at 
the second review of the plan the finance minister would be able 
to address any issues of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will keep Canadians well informed of its investment 
activities. It is important for us to tell Canadians that the 
board will be managing this large pool of money in a very 
transparent fashion.  Canadians will be fully aware of this.  The 
board will make Canadians well aware of its investment activities 
by making its investment policy standards and procedures public, 
releasing quarterly financial statements, publishing annual 
reports and the board's members will be holding regular meetings 
in each province to allow for public discussion and input with 
respect to their work as members of the investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment briefly on the last motion which is related to 
Motion No. 23.  It requires that any changes to contribution 
rates resulting from the three yearly reviews by the federal and 
provincial governments be subject to public consultation by the 
finance committee.  The finance minister has stated over and over 
again that any major changes to the Canada pension plan in the 
future will be subject to consultation with Canadians and that 
all changes to contributions require the consent of two-thirds of 
the provinces and two-thirds of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any changes large enough to require legislation would always be 
referred to an appropriate committee of the House for review as a 
matter of course.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore there really is no need for this proposed motion.  The 
process is already in place.  It is a standard process and one 
that the Minister of Finance is on record as stating he asked 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the motions which were put forward in the first 
grouping, I want to say that certainly every member of this House 
is committed to ensuring there is financial sustainability in the 
Canada pension plan.  The changes to Bill C-2 are responding to 
the public consultations which took place over a period of time. 
Canadians had an opportunity for input and to talk about what 
they would like to do and would like to see happen with respect 
to the Canada pension plan.  The message was overwhelmingly that 
they wanted to have the Canada pension plan sustainable, safe and 
in place for them in retirement.  The changes in the amendments 
being put forward in Bill C-2 speak to those concerns of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the speedy passage of this bill so we can 
continue to do our work in ensuring that we reflect the 
priorities of Canadians as we move forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the parliamentary secretary has thoroughly covered the report 
stage motions in Group No. 1.  I would like to add a couple of 
notes for the benefit of all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the chief actuary in his 15th report, his last 
report, let it be known that the Canada pension plan would not be 
sustainable past the year 2015 unless certain changes were made. 
That is one of the reasons we are here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of that report and as a result of the prescribed 
reviews of the Canada pension plan, discussion documents were 
prepared.  Extensive cross Canada consultations were held with 
all vested interests, with seniors, women, labour, corporations 
and everyone who wanted to appear before the panel, who sought 
input into changes or options that could be made with regard to 
the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be assured that these changes which have come 
before the House on Bill C-2 are as a result of exhaustive 
consultation with Canadians across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By law any change to the Canada pension plan requires the 
approval of at least two-thirds of the provinces representing not 
less than two-thirds of the population of the country.  All of 
the proposed changes which are coming forward in Bill C-2 have 
received the requisite support from the provinces.  Canadians 
should be assured that this is clearly as a result of extensive 
consultation and has the full support of the majority of the 
provinces of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to assure all members, particularly today's 
seniors who are current beneficiaries of the CPP and any other 
Canadians who receive other benefits such as disability benefits, 
that their current benefits will not be affected by the changes 
being considered by the House under Bill C-2.  It bears repeating 
that seniors should be assured that their current benefits under 
the Canada pension plan will not be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary dealt with many of these points.  I 
will simply move on and repeat that the benefits as a result of 
these changes under the CPP will continue to be secure.  They 
will continue to be guaranteed.  They will continue to be indexed 
so that all Canadians can enjoy the benefits of the Canada 
pension plan for generations to come.  That is the reason we are 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, with regard to the Canada pension plan investment 
board, members should know that one of the features of the 
current plan is that funds accumulated by the plan have been 
invested in provincial bonds at federal rates.  To ensure that 
Canadians get the lowest possible rates of premium to pay into 
the plan, one of the big changes being proposed is the creation 
of the Canada pension plan investment board, a board selected in 
consultation with the provinces.  Its members are experts in 
investment. The board will ensure that the funds received by the 
Canada pension plan will be invested as wisely as possible to 
earn the optimal return for the benefit of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be assured that the changes being made here

to the needs of all Canadians that the Canada pension plan system 
will be there for generations to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased as a member of the New Democratic 
Party to participate in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand in this House in support of two motions that the NDP 
have put forward to improve Bill C-2. I refer specifically to 
Motion No. 1 in Group No. 1.  This motion will replace with an 
amendment where the government may set out an independent panel 
of experts to review publicly disclosed and externally 
enforceable conflict of interest rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we propose these changes?  An independent panel of 
experts should help set up a code of conduct for the board of 
directors.  I know the Liberals are very concerned about having 
codes of conduct because whenever that phrase is used, the 
Liberals seem to get caught breaking all the rules of the code of 
conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am absolutely petrified, apprehensive and not confident in 
what the Liberals are saying.  They are telling this House and 
the people of Canada that Canadians can be assured that the 
Liberals are undertaking a program that will benefit them. Let me 
talk for a few minutes about how Canadians are so sure of the 
Liberal record when it comes to social safety programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members and other Canadians may recall members of Parliament who 
preceded us in this Chamber, members in high regard, members like 
Major James Coldwell, a CCF member of Parliament from Regina. 
Many years ago members will recall the names of J.S. Woodsworth, 
Stanley Knowles and Tommy Douglas.  What these four CCF and NDP 
members of Parliament had in common was that they did not rest 
assured with assurances from Liberal governments previous to this 
one that they were going to support the benefits of Canadians in 
their later years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, these individuals, Woodsworth, Coldwell, 
Douglas and Stanley Knowles, fought tooth and nail for all of 
their political careers stretching some 35 years in a certain 
member's experience, fighting for pensions for Canadians.  And 
who opposed those pensions?  It was the Liberal Party, Liberal 
governments in the past and before that Conservative governments. 
If it was not for these four individuals and many other 
like-minded Canadians, we would not have a pension program in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the Liberals opposite stand in their place and say 
rest assured Canadians, we are going to look after you, I think 
Canadians should be doubly aware and doubly concerned about 
something rotten in the state of Canada with respect to this 
pension plan.  The record is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to talk about in respect of these amendments is why 
does the government not support an independent panel of experts 
being created to outline a code of conduct for the board of 
directors?  Is it because it is going to appoint the wealthy 
friends of the Minister of Finance?  Is it going to appoint 
people like Conrad Black, a good friend of the prime minister of 
this country?  They golf together, ride horses together and do 
all sorts of things together.  What they do have in common with 
respect to all of Canada is that they tend to put the screws to 
those on the lower income scale.  That is unacceptable in this 
day and age in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the Liberals not supporting such an amendment for a code 
of conduct?  I think people should ask that question.  When 
Liberals give them assurances that they are protecting their 
interests, I do not think those assurances are sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The true test of progress in our society somebody once said is 
not whether we add to the abundance to those who have much, but 
whether we provide enough for those who have too little.  With 
respect to this test of progress on this bill and these 
amendments that the government is opposing, the Government of 
Canada is falling far short of passing this test of progress.  It 
is not providing enough for those who do have little.  What it is 
doing is making sure that those who have abundant incomes and 
assets are going to maintain and roll those assets at an 
accelerated scale at the expense of those who have very little.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment the NDP is putting forward is Motion No. 
24. We are suggesting that there be a requirement for the chief 
actuary to forecast income from public benefits of future 
retirees relative to the earnings of those who are working. Why 
the change? Because we have an actuary who has been instructed by 
the Minister of Finance, and some people refer to him as the 
Scrooge of Canada and others have more unflattering names, but we 
will not get into those because we do not want to get into name 
calling at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not allow the actuary and some of these Canada pension plan 
employees to provide some analysis of the costs of the plan and 
the benefits to seniors and older Canadians who will qualify for 
this pension?  Why can they not share information publicly which 
would outline what retirees will receive 15 and 20 years down the 
road?  It has projected what we are going to be paying, it has 
projected what it is going to cost, but it will not tell 
Canadians the truth about how much they will receive for paying 
for all these benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the government to reconsider.  If it really believes 
what it says that it is going to assure Canadians that it has the 
confidence of all of the provinces, then it will undertake to 
support these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add when the member opposite stood in the House and said 
that he had the support of two-thirds of the provinces, that 
eight of the ten are supporting Bill C-2 unamended, how many are 
from the CCF-NDP form of government?  Not one.  Who did the NDP 
and the CCF fight tooth and nail, year after year, decade after 
decade to obtain pensions?  The NDP and the CCF fought the 
Liberals year after year, decade after decade for pensions on 
behalf of seniors. We were able to obtain the pension plan in the 
country after many decades of fighting and now they are asking 
why the NDP province of Saskatchewan, where I come from and 
represent, and the NDP province of British Columbia are not 
supporting the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be asking this question of themselves. They 
should be asking this question of the Liberal members of 
Parliament. When the Liberal members go back to their ridings 
constituents should ask them why the NDP provinces, the NDP who 
fought for pensions in this Parliament and this country are not 
supporting Bill C-2?  Why are they not embracing all these 
changes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Tell us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>   We will get into that later in the 
other amendments, but I think my time is running out.  We have 
all sorts of information that we want to share.  I am sure all 
members are open minded and very willing to listen to some of 
these suggestions and recommendations.  I certainly look forward 
to sharing them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
like my colleague from Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, I stand 
today and support Motions Nos. 1 and 24 in Group No. 1 on behalf 
of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from Atlantic Canada I have a difficult time 
understanding why the government would not want to support Motion 
No. 1.  We in Cape Breton have been very well aware of government 
patronage over the years.  I have to say that when I hear the 
government talk about priding itself on openness and 
accountability, this is a surefire way to ensure that 
accountability and openness.  We have seen years of patronage. 
This is like allowing the mouse to mind the cheese. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really important is that this will ensure a balance 
between the private and public aspects of the so-called changes 
to the CPP which are going to benefit all Canadians.  I must say 
there is a large number of seniors in my riding of Bras d'Or and 
they are not as confident that these changes are going to benefit 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 24, it is quite simple. It is asking 
the chief actuary to do the job the government has not been able 
to do or has refused to do.  It is the right of Canadians to be 
told what the fund is going to cost them and what benefits they 
will receive or what benefits they will lose. 
As I said, Mr. Speaker, my comments were going to be brief and 
hopefully we will get an opportunity at a later date for some of 
the other what I see as really good amendments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK207">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-2 be amended by deleting Clause 37. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to explain to members of this 
House why it is imperative to delete clause 37 of Bill C-2, which reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>37. The Board and its subsidiaries shall invest their assets 
in such a way that tax would not be payable by them under 
subsection 206(2) of the <I>Income Tax Act</I> if Part XI of that Act 
applied to them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to this clause, the Canada pension plan investment board 
should act as if it were governed by the provisions of the Income Tax 
Act dealing with the foreign content of pension plan portfolios. This 
means that the new board would not be allowed to invest more than 20% of 
its assets outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we believe the board should have the power to make 
investments that will best protect the interests of the plan's 
beneficiaries, clause 37 must be struck from the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the government should increase and even eliminate the 
limit put on foreign investments, instead of extending it to other types 
of investments. 
We must make sure the board is free to choose the investments likely to 
provide the best return, regardless of any political consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, maintaining restrictions on foreign content could trigger 
major problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, limiting investments abroad could prevent the board from 
building a portfolio that is sufficiently diversified to reduce 
financial risks. We all know that this issue is an important one and 
that it is time to restore Canadians' confidence in a pension plan that 
was once their pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this constraint also has the effect of reducing the 
competitiveness of Canadian businesses. 
Knowing that there is a large and secure capital base on which they can 
rely, they have less motive to be effective and efficient than if they 
were in direct competition with foreign companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, and this is certainly an important concern, it prevents 
Canadians from receiving a fair return on their pension savings: their 
money is tied up in a stock market that represents only 3% of the 
capital in the global market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quoted in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, Professor James Pesando from the 
University of Toronto summarizes and illustrates better than I can the 
concerns that were raised. He said, and I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“You have heard that expression `don't put all your eggs in one 
basket'.  Just imagine that the CPP fund in the extreme case was 
invested only in Canadian stocks and bonds and then in 2005 
Quebec secedes.  That would be devastating in terms of its impact 
on share prices and bond markets in Canada”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Pesando continued: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<“Think about what would happen if 50% of those funds were 
invested offshore.  Not only would they continue to do well, but 
the drop in the Canadian—would mean the returns would be 
magnified”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not complicated: Bill C-2's provisions setting out the rules 
on the portfolio's foreign content deprive Canadians of over $700 
million annually. By eliminating clause 37, that is by eliminating these 
rules, the market value of the Canada pension plan could increase by 20 
to 25%. This is no small amount. I would even say it is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should stop limiting potential investments by 
millions of Canadians and should act to eliminate this outdated and 
archaic requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in fact that same government that is saying to these same 
taxpayers that they should be more responsible in financing their 
retirement. I am saying that the government should act more 
consistently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the electoral campaign last spring, the Progressive 
Conservative Party clearly stated that it wanted changes to the rules 
governing registered retirement savings plans in order to gradually 
eliminate restrictions on foreign investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its main argument at that time also applies very well to the issue 
of the Canada pension plan today: Canadians have the right to seek the 
best possible return from the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve this, it is essential that the investment board be 
allowed to make its investments in the best interests of the Canada 
pension plan's beneficiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I urge my colleagues in this House to vote in favour of 
this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this amendment may be one of the single most important 
amendments which have come forward.  I believe nearly every 
witness I heard at committee commented on the management and 
investment of our retirement fund.  They said that this 20% rule 
should be changed, that it should be lifted.  This amendment, of 
course, would do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, pension funds in Canada are limited with respect to 
freedom of investment.  Only one-fifth or 20% can be invested 
offshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this in context, the global capital pool is very large 
and Canadian investments comprise only 3% of it.  In other words, 
Canadians are expected, indeed forced, to put almost all of their 
investments upon which their retirement security depends into a 
very small capital pool.  This does not give us the best return 
and the best security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member who just spoke indicated, it substantially limits 
the kind of return we can hope to achieve.  It does not maximize 
the investment return which we can hope to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly important for poorer Canadians.  People who 
have money, who have companies registered offshore, who have 
family trusts and all of those good things can diversify their 
assets to the point where this rule does not substantially hurt 
them.  However, for lower income Canadians who have almost all of 
their retirement savings invested by these mandatory payments 
into the Canada pension plan, this restriction and the 
consequential limitation of the investment return they hope to 
receive means a great deal. 
If we want to provide particularly low-income Canadians with a 
secure portion of retirement that they can count on, we simply 
have to get rid of this 20% foreign investment rule.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this is not just something that a couple of 
opposition parties are talking about, although certainly if we 
think so, that should be persuasive.  We are joined by almost 
every single witness that appeared before the committee, 
including actuaries, accountants, pension fund managers, 
economists, analysts of all kinds, some of the most respected 
thinkers in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that it was the finance minister's name on here as the 
mover of this amendment.  That would indicate that we were going 
to get this matter taken care of.  Since it was an opposition 
member who had the wit and the courage to put this forward, I 
would certainly hope that all members of the House would support 
this amendment.  If they do not support any other one, I would 
say this is the one to support, particularly for the benefit of 
the most vulnerable members of our society who need the best 
return we can possibly give them on their pension and retirement 
investment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we can situate this amendment 
within a context in which the Canada pension plan has, in the past, 
not had a very high yield when reinvesting the money paid into it. 
The reason for this is certainly that the cost-effectiveness of the 
plan was not really an objective, unlike Quebec's Caisse de dépôt 
et placement, which was intended to increase the yield on its 
investments as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, then, in reading the proposed amendment, we see there 
is a continuity with this, in the desire for the investment board 
to try to solve this problem of profitability of the plan's 
investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, however, important to carry out a fairly detailed 
analysis, because the section of the act they wish to do away with 
says that the funds invested by the investment board must be 
handled differently than that invested in registered retirement 
savings plans.  What is not said is that the 20% rule cannot help 
but be changed, but this will be done by considering all of the tax 
implications, for the RRSPs as well, and perhaps even other 
implications there may be within the Canadian federal taxation 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the question we should be asking today is whether this is 
the right time to be changing the rules of the game in this bill, 
when no similar change will be made to RRSPs.  In my opinion, 
parliamentarians should look at this with a concern for 
co-ordinated and logical taxation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investment board will surely permit a better return on 
investment, because it has been given the criteria for economic 
performance.  In terms of investment objectives, types of 
investment, the only remaining constraint concerns the 20% maximum 
during the time the tax legislation in question applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we see that within this no undue pressure is being applied 
to investment choices if, suddenly, tomorrow or in the coming years 
the board could invest as it likes outside Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if this option is not available through RRSPs, we 
will end up with a double standard.  The government will no longer 
be behaving like an employer and a lawmaker, but as an investor and 
a lawmaker and will not be giving private pension plans parity and 
the chance to the same investments.  I think that at that point we 
could run the risk of making this sort of amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I think it would be better, in the context of the pre-budget 
consultations currently underway for the next budget, to take a 
look at the relevance of giving everyone equal opportunity. 
As the bill now stands, the day the tax system is changed, this 
amendment will apply to RRSPs, as it will to the Canada pension 
plan investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would, in my view, be more ethical 
and would avoid putting the government in a difficult situation 
vis-à-vis the representations that might be made to it in the 
amendments to come regarding RRSP rules.  When the door is 
opened, it must be opened for everybody, so that the change will 
affect everyone equally, so that the government and private 
investors who must now contend with the 20% rule in every other 
sector will start off on an equal footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, for these various reasons, we do not think it advisable to 
make this amendment today.  It will be necessary to verify whether 
the change will be made for all investment programs affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Canada pension plan investment board is the 
cornerstone of this bill.  A major effort is already under way to 
obtain a better return on the money invested by the public in the 
CPP.  Investments will be carefully monitored and special studies 
to evaluate effectiveness will also be possible.  I think that now 
is not the time to remove the equality that will exist among the 
various investment vehicles.  This change would be more appropriate 
in the context of a fiscal debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to say a few words on Motion No. 2. I want 
to say a few words because I am a bit puzzled with respect to my 
colleagues who are moving this and supporting this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premise that the Reform Party and the Conservative Party put 
forward with respect to this issue on Canada pension plan 
amendments is they want Canadian taxpayers to give tax deductions 
to individuals and businesses that make CPP contributions, give 
tax breaks in Canada, yet they want the money invested outside 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the rationale for this.  Maybe they have not 
heard of the Hang Seng or Tokyo or some of the other foreign 
markets that seem to be in a little turmoil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me if tax breaks are going to be given in Canada for 
deductions with respect to pension plans, then maybe the money 
should be invested in Canada to support the businesses that are 
hiring people and building our country.  I do not understand 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Reform and the Conservatives talk about back to the 
future.  They are winding the clock back to 1897, 100 years back 
to the future when it was archaic.  I think it is outrageous what 
they are proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just clarify this one more time.  The Conservative Party 
is the party of Brian Mulroney and Grant Devine and the harem 
that is now in jail.  We have the Reform Party which is the party 
of Grant Devine and Brian Mulroney.  They want to support tax 
expenditures in this country to invest outside our country for 
their friends.  Who are their friends?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Call them the reverse party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  We know who their friends are.  Their 
friends are people like Conrad Black.  My colleague across the 
floor from the Liberal Party says that the Reform Party should be 
called the reverse party.  That is probably a suggestion others 
have as well.  Others suggest that maybe it is the reformatories, 
we do not know.  There are many things people use to refer to 
these individuals and their parties because they keep wanting to 
reform and change the way Canadians govern themselves, the way we 
have built our country, the way we have encouraged small business 
to build up this country from the grassroots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are like ostriches with their heads in the sand who 
say that they are close to the grassroots.  The problem is they 
are buried in the sand and do not understand what grassroots is 
all about. If you ask anybody in this country if we should give 
tax deductions to Canadians to invest outside our country they 
will say “I don't think so”.  If we are going to give tax 
deductions, we would rather give them to Canadians to build our 
economy, to reinvest in our communities, to reinvest in our small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am puzzled as to why the Reformers are proposing this.  The 
only conclusion is they are very supportive of these individuals 
who have lots of money.  My advice to them is that if they want 
to invest outside of Canada, they should take their own money out 
of their own pockets, out of their own farms and businesses if 
they have them and go and invest in Fukuoka, Japan or in 
Kumamoto, Japan or in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia or go and invest in 
Indonesia.  There are some good gold stocks in Indonesia they 
could probably invest in.  I do not happen to have any because I 
do not do that sort of thing.  I have problems enough, as most 
Canadians do, investing in things they know, never mind in 
countries they have never heard of before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look at this proposal by the reformatories and defeat 
it as quickly as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to add a couple of points with regard to this report stage 
motion which deals with restriction on foreign investment. 
Currently investments are restricted to 20% foreign content. That 
rule applies to other pension plans.  It is the same rule that 
applies to personal RRSPs.  As the previous speaker said, these 
are all instruments or vehicles under which Canadians get tax 
consideration for having made those investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rhetorical question to ask is should the Canada pension plan 
investment fund have different rules or latitude from that 
extended to other investors providing for their retirement 
through registered pension plans or RRSPs. I have some concerns 
that the differential may lead to some adverse consequences and 
some challenges simply because the rules are not consistently 
applied in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the borrowing requirements of Canada has to be 
taken into account in view of the fact that the Government of 
Canada is not borrowing anymore.  Although the deficit is not 
totally eliminated at this time, the non-cash charges mean the 
government is in a position where it is not a player in the 
market.  It does not have an appetite for new capital at this 
time other than for debt that is maturing and has to be rolled 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some dynamics that occur in the marketplace. Although 
Reform has indicated Canada is only 3% of capital markets, it is 
still a substantial marketplace in which there is broad latitude 
to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear to me that nobody in this House can support this 
motion.  I will check it.  Motion No. 2 basically states that 
clause 37 be deleted.  Clause 37 is the clause that states that 
the investment shall be subject to the same rules that are 
applied to RRSPs.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to me that if the clause is deleted so that the 20% 
rule does not apply, in the absence of anything else, that means 
there would be unrestricted foreign investment.  I do not know 
how anybody in this House could leave this bill in the shape 
where the investors of the funds of Canadians, the Canada pension 
plan, could invest anywhere they wanted, totally outside of 
Canada.  I will check that.  If that is the fact, I doubt there 
is anybody in this House who can support Motion No. 2. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have just 
a few words to say in response to what the hon. member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre was saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made some references to Reform and some of them were a little 
unkind.  I want him to know that as a fellow hon. member I 
respect him anyway.  I hope he learns to clean up his thinking. 
That will then clean up his speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a few words about this whole general 
concept.  There is this anti anything outside Canada bias by some 
people.  Yet we find, for example, the Liberal government at a 
snap of a finger will lend $1.5 billion to China to finance a 
nuclear reactor, a country which has not signed on to any nuclear 
non-proliferation agreement, a country which does not comply with 
environmental standards, a country which we presume will maybe 
some time pay back this $1.5 billion by goods it produces or 
whatever.  We hope that is true.  The government is thinking it 
can do that with taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to say we do not want to do that, that we are 
going to do everything inside Canada only, I think we will 
entirely loose our trade.  Very frankly one of our strongest 
trading partners is also one of our strongest economic partners, 
the United States.  If we are able to invest some of our 
retirement money in the United States, it has to be at least as 
secure as the money invested in Canada in most instances. It 
seems to me rather arbitrary to say that we should not do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect to this that is very important.  There 
is not a gift or a payment by other taxpayers when someone puts 
money into an RRSP.  The same thing is true when we invest in the 
Canada pension plan fund.  The fact is if some of that money is 
invested from outside the country, it comes back with a return. 
According to the rules on both Canada pension and RRSP that money 
is then taxable on receipt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why on earth would we say we do not want any American money in 
Canada?  If we can take $100 and have it bring back another $100 
because it has been invested there for a number of years at a 
good interest rate, it brings $100 into this country from an 
international market that was not here before.  It is now going 
to be taxed at regular tax rates.  So it not only adds to the 
wealth of the country but it also produces tax revenue for the 
government at the time of retirement, as all RRSPs do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the NDP has some really cute statements.  I like 
that one about Reform getting at the grassroots.  He had it wrong 
about the sand part and the head. We do want to listen to the 
people.  We want to do what is best for them.  He is cute in that 
regard, but I really think he should start thinking a little more 
globally, a little more laterally, think a little more beyond a 
very narrow focus that the NDP seems to be stuck in.  That has 
kept it at the low level of public support it has enjoyed over 
the last 50 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just want to make a couple of 
points on this motion and get some facts on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian pension funds and individuals saving through RRSPs can 
invest up to 20% of their assets abroad.  It is a statement 
and a fact that I think most Canadians are aware of. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be said that this 20% is a significant amount of 
international diversification and additional international 
exposure can also be gained by investing in Canadian companies 
with international operations.  However, the 20% foreign property 
rule also ensures that a significant portion of tax assisted 
savings is invested in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also point out the fact that in recent days 
international markets have not performed well.  Present rules are 
intended to provide a sort of balance for Canadian investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to mention studies by experts like Mr. 
Slater who stated that Canada's capital markets could absorb the 
increase in the CPP fund.  The fact is that our capital market is 
quite healthy.  It does provide substantial rates of return.  Let 
us also remember that the changes to C-2 are increasing the rates 
of return to the Canada pension plan.  So we are all moving in 
the same direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out a statement that was made by the hon. 
member from the Reform Party who said that it was important to 
listen to the people because they are connected to the 
grassroots.  I am sure every member of this House takes the 
opportunity of listening to constituents and trying to reflect 
their concerns here in this House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that Canadians have indicated 
through public consultations that they want the CPP fund to be 
invested like other pension funds.  Today in Canada pension funds 
are allowed to invest up to 20% of their assets in foreign 
securities.  The CPP will follow the same limitation.  It does 
allow for diversification to enhance returns but it also ensures 
that CPP funds are invested predominantly in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was stated earlier, the intent of the government is to ensure 
the financial stability of this plan.  It is crucial that the 
changes that we have been making to the CPP provide for that 
financial sustainability.  With this particular motion we would 
be treating the Canada pension plan in isolation.  Making changes 
to the Canada pension plan or if we did make changes to other tax 
assisted programs, it would not be fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that the CPP fund will follow the same 
limitations.  If the foreign property rule were to change at some 
point in the future then we would see the Canada pension plan 
reflect that change.  Therefore, if in the future the 20% foreign 
property rule were eliminated, although no one is saying it will 
be eliminated and we are not advocating its elimination, then the 
Canada pension plan fund, as requested by Canadians through prior 
consultations, would be treated like other pension plans in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What C-2 does is treat the Canada pension plan like other 
pension plans throughout this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is important to make those points.  Other members 
have made similar points.  I would certainly encourage members of 
this House not to support Motion No. 2 for the reasons stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question?

</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be done by requiring that such regulations be made 
with a view to ensuring that the plan's investment advisers are 
subject to the prudent person rule.  To take effect, any 
regulation that is not passed with a view to those objectives 
would have to be approved by two-thirds of the participating 
provinces with two-thirds of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 provides the government with the ability to set through 
regulations the kinds of investments the board may make.  This 
may preclude the board from making investments that are in the 
best interests of the beneficiaries, for example, through limits 
on foreign investments or the government could choose to simply 
list certain sectors at the expense of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that this plan operates in the best interest 
of the beneficiaries free from any political, economic and social 
objectives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
comment on what our colleague from the Conservative Party has just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we know that with this bill, workers and companies will have 
to contribute more to a fund so that when people go on retirement, they 
will receive an amount that may not be very high but that will 
nevertheless be essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know also that if we do not act now, it will not be long before 
the Canada pension plan can no longer meet its obligations. 
That is why, I repeat, the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But 
also, when money is taken from employers and employees, it is also taken 
from the economy in which they are living, and these are considerable 
amounts that workers or employers will not be able to recycle in the 
economic system through the purchase of goods and services. It is 
therefore essential that the money that will be taken and given to an 
agency responsible for reinvesting it be invested in a way that allows 
these communities to continue to rely on the economic activity they 
require to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if I heard correctly, the motion that has just been 
presented would allow and would require the investment board to reinvest 
without taking into consideration the social aspects or the economic 
impacts in the community. I believe that in fact this agency should have 
a social conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention in this respect the case of Quebec and its 
Caisse de dépôt et placement which has in fact allowed the Government of 
Quebec to ensure greater economic returns for Quebec in keeping with the 
requirements of Quebec society. It seems to me that the federal 
government would be well advised to consider what is being done in 
Quebec in this area and to do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is in fact my interpretation of what it wants to do with the 
bill we are considering. It seems to me that any amendment that would 
not limit the board's ability to make investments through which 
Canadians can obtain a better return not only when they retire but also 
now when they are contributing is a step in the right direction. 
Any amendment that would go against that objective would be a step in 
the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is also important to note that for an employer or an 
employee who will see next year an increase in his or her contributions 
to the Canada pension plan, this will have an impact in terms of 
competitiveness. I was pleased when the Minister of Human Resources 
Development announced a reduction in employment insurance contributions. 
I consider that this also is a step in the right direction, because it 
will allow in fact to maintain payroll taxes and other deductions at an 
acceptable level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Minister of Human Resources Development did not bother 
unfortunately to consider the retroactive effect of an increase in 
contributions for the current year, and this will definitely have an 
impact on the personal disposable income of each worker and on the 
production and operating costs of every business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In economic terms, this has a significant adverse effect. And in 
the future, as the contribution rate slowly increases, it will be 
important to reassure our business community, our businesses and their 
employees that adjustments to employment insurance premiums or other 
measures will indeed counterbalance the drain on corporate or personal 
finances caused by contributions to the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter of economic balance. We cannot dip into a lake 
indefinitely and hope it will keep filling up by itself. It will need 
water sooner or later. He who draws water out of a lake has to ensure 
that a soothing rain falls on the area, other wise it will dry up. 
This is a simple principle, and the example was an obvious one, but that 
is reality. Businesses and employees cannot keep on paying indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one point, the economic balance will be destroyed and this will 
have repercussions on our society, as it will slow the economy down, 
with fewer businesses employing fewer people, who will produce fewer 
goods that fewer consumers will be able to buy. That is not what Bill 
C-2 seeks to do. However, it would be important that the government side 
give the business community and our workers some indication that it is 
aware of this and will take appropriate measures to protect the sound 
balance I just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, allow me to say that, in Quebec, we are 35 years ahead 
on this pension plan issue. 
We have a pension plan in Quebec. Quebec's experience was a good 
experience, and I only hope that our Canadian friends make the most of 
it.

would like to speak against the amendment which basically targets 
the investments of the board on a high return on international 
markets and possibly domestic markets, but there is no 
consciousness of Canadian here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our responsibility is to invest our pensions for future 
generations.  It is a social cycle where the youth provide a 
means for the elderly, the underprivileged and the disabled.  It 
is a human cycle.  That is our purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have this huge fund for investment purposes we should be 
consciously aware of Canadian content and Canadian needs.  At 
sometime in the future, beside the investment requirement, our 
targets could be set on the highest rate of return on investment 
and disregard the environmental needs or the economic needs of a 
region of Canada.  Instead it could be sent offshore into an 
Asian region where the return could be 20%.  It could be a nice, 
juicy return.  The money could be invested in another region 
which promises a higher return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a chance to invest it in an underprivileged region. 
It would give a certain workforce in the region more wages in 
their pockets to contribute to the investment fund.  It is a 
cycle.  The more we work, the more the investment fund will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of Canadians being Canadian is what is being tested 
by the amendment. 
We have to think of the Canadian picture and the Canadian future.

the investment board will do that.  If it is restricted to 
investing only in higher returns, our Canadian concept and our 
Canadian vision will be dimmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak against the amendment and encourage other members to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if any Canadians watching the debate were wondering 
about the necessity of the amendment, they had only to listen to 
the Bloc Quebecois and the NDP to be scared right out of their 
socks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment would make it necessary for the board and for 
cabinet, in making regulations respecting how the board invests, 
to be guided simply and solely by what is in the best interest of 
contributors and beneficiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is our retirement we are playing with here.  What words do 
we hear from the socialists?  We have to invest 
“strategically”.  We have to have a “social conscience”.  I 
can just see the socialists getting into government, licking 
their chops over having these billions of dollars to do their 
wonderful social engineering experiments with.  It would be our 
pensions they would be playing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not have an amendment which prevents a future cabinet 
from indulging in that kind of nonsense, this kind of doctrinaire 
driven investment, our pension security goes right out the 
window.  We would have all those with noble intentions to save 
the country or to save this or that industry, having our money to 
play with.  It is bad enough that we are paying so much in taxes 
for social engineers to dispose of, to waste and to fritter away 
as they have for years and years.  Now they want to use our 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope Canadians watching this debate run, not walk, to their 
faxes, phones and e-mail machines to say:  “For God's sake, 
members of Parliament, include this amendment and make sure that 
whatever you do with our pension funds you are guided simply and 
solely by what is in our best interest and what will get us the 
best return, secure future pensions, and keep the mitts of social 
engineers and economic central planners off our pension plans”.

because, frankly, I was rather surprised by the remarks of the 
Reform Party member before me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He accuses the other parties in the House of not responsibly 
studying this bill and yet, in committee, the model proposed by the 
Reform Party was shown systematically to not necessarily be 
sufficient for all Canadians and really had no future here.

stage aimed at ensuring that action the governor in council may 
decide to take regarding the management of the investment board be 
in keeping with the mandate of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to acknowledge that this is an interesting 
amendment.  I do not think the Reform Party said it either, but I 
find it a bit surprising, at the stage we have reached in 
considering the bill and the contribution made by all the parties. 
I think there has to be some sort of balance in the way return is 
made on investment in the Canada pension plan, like the Quebec 
pension plan.  Under the bill the investment board would be 
mandated to ensure profitability only.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A limit has been set so that there will be no more than 20% of 
foreign investments. An earlier demonstration has explained very 
well why these things are being put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can also be understood on the other hand that the present 
draft amendment is not aimed at changing the basis of the bill, but 
at improving it, as the person moving it sees it.   I believe this 
point of view can be shared, by saying that, yes, the investment 
board will be given a clear mandate, in other words to seek the 
best possible economic return. 
At the same time, however, we want to make sure that the proposed 
amendment, when the government brings in regulations on this, will 
be in keeping with the mandate of the investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this 
way there is an attempt to avoid excesses, and perhaps a sudden 
need by the Canadian government to exceed the mandate of the 
investment board.  This can go both ways.  It could be a decision 
by the government to have the capital invested in projects not 
directly linked with the clear mandate of the investment board, but 
it could go the other way as well.  If we want to respect the 
statutory scheme, if we wish to ensure that its logic is respected 
as the bottom line, this amendment must be considered in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would we not end up in a sort of a dead-end situation, an 
unacceptable impasse, if the government could adopt regulations 
which would run counter to the objectives of the investment board? 
I think that, within its general mandate of good government acting 
in the best interests of society, the government will always have 
the opportunity to take decisions which strike it being best for 
the future of its people, but that expanded power must not 
necessarily be via regulatory channels.  It may be a good thing to 
retain this right, having it operate via measures which require 
legislation, in order to ensure that things are not done in a sort 
of underhanded way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, the amendment on the table is worthy of 
consideration and of being judged on its worth.  It must be looked 
at within the general objective of the statutory scheme. That 
objective is to ensure that the investment board can maximize its 
outcome and do so with a government which respects that mandate. 
This is the spirit in which we will support this amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-2 reflects what Canadians 
have said throughout the consultation process.  In fact the 
motion would eliminate the restrictions that apply to other 
pension plans in Canada, essentially specific restrictions that 
are part of the fed-prov agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulations which are part of Bill C-2 require applying the 
appropriate provisions and regulations of the Pension Benefits 
Standards Act to the new CPP investment board, regulations that 
in fact state things like the fund could not hold more than 30% 
of voting shares of a company or that it could not invest more 
than 10% in the security of a single company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As joint stewards of the plan and as a result of the fed-prov 
negotiations and agreements, Bill C-2 will specify the 
arrangements under which provinces will have access to portions 
of the new CPP funds the board allocates to bonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the investment the fund makes requires that domestic 
equity be passive and that it be reviewed after three years. 
Provinces will have a guarantee of access to a portion of the new 
funds and thereafter, after three years, their access will 
reflect a percentage of provincial and municipal bonds held by 
pension funds in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said and despite the restrictions, the chief actuary 
still says the fund will receive a 3.8 per cent real rate of 
return, which is a good rate of return and one that reflects the 
priorities and the best interest of Canadians.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a legislative committee of this House be instructed to 
prepare and bring in a bill, in accordance with Standing Order 
68(4)(<I>b</I>), to prevent the reference to and designation of any 
Canadian or group of Canadians in a hyphenated form, based on 
race, religion, colour or place of origin. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Surrey Central 
and on behalf of the silent majority in Canada I am pleased to 
introduce my private member's Motion No. 24 calling for the 
introduction of legislation which would prevent the reference and 
designation of any Canadian or group of Canadians in a hyphenated 
form based on race, religion, colour or place of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many reasons and experiences personally in my life which 
have compelled me to introduce Motion No. 24 concerning 
hyphenated Canadians, but let me first clear the air. This motion 
is non-partisan and is put forward with the best interests in 
mind for the people and the future of our beloved country of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a country of immigrants.  I respect the diversity of 
Canada and its cultural mosaic.  Our diversity is our asset, not 
a liability.  We do not oppose the multicultural fact of Canada 
but taxpayer funded official multiculturalism as a Government of 
Canada objective, that is the commercialization of 
multiculturalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to review our 25 year old expensive and divisive 
multicultural policy.  It needs not only a tune-up but an 
overhaul.  Let us not look 25 years backward.  There is no use 
crying over spilt milk. Let us look beyond our noses.  Let us 
look to the future and believe in the reality and changing 
dynamics of Canada.  Emphasis should be on enhancing the equality 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people view themselves as Canadians, yet the government has 
been collecting information about their ancestral origins and 
referring to them accordingly.  The census is becoming more and 
more precarious. In the 1991 census Stats Canada asked the 
question “to which ethnic or cultural group did your ancestors 
belong?”  It listed 15 ethnic or cultural groups as choices but 
not Canadian as a group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current ministry of multiculturalism has three goals: 
fostering Canadian identity and belonging, assisting with 
integration,  and creating social justice by eliminating the 
barriers to equality.  None of these goals can be achieved under 
the present federal multiculturalism policy by encouraging 
hyphenation of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hyphenation of Canadians weakens and dilutes the Canadian 
identity and belonging.  Hyphenation inhibits integration and 
rather assists segregation of our population. Hyphenation of 
Canadians fosters barriers to equality rather than eliminating 
those barriers.  Hyphenation does more harm than good. In fact, 
we see that the government is going in a completely opposite 
direction, 180° from the objective we want to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than uniting Canada and sustaining our multicultural 
reality, we are going completely in the opposite direction on 
this.  The current policy is promoting diversity at the expense 
of unity and equality.  As parliamentarians it is our obligation 
to ensure our laws and policies achieve the desired outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many differences among all of us.  Two individuals are 
different unless they are identical twins or perhaps if they are 
cloned. 
A person could be, for example, a woman and at the same time a 
mother. She could be fat, short, with a particular ethnicity, 
language, colour, religion, et cetera.  That is okay. We respect 
that.

Canada as my home.  This is the future of my children and my 
family. This is where our hopes and opportunities are and I am 
proud of that, like everyone else.  Canada has been generous to 
me and my family.  I and my family are proud to hold a Canadian 
passport. Like everyone else, I am proud to be a Canadian.  But 
the hyphen still interferes with my pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government encourages new Canadians to be called something 
like Indo Canadians, Chinese Canadians, Italian Canadians, not 
just Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day on TV the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism 
and the Status of Women said she is proud to be a 
Trinidad Canadian.  She is a Canadian government minister. When 
will she call herself a proud Canadian?  When will she call a 
Canadian a Canadian?  When will she have a Canada first attitude? 
Those are the questions many Canadians are asking. But just as 
in our question period in the House, they do not get answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to define Canadian culture for the 21st century. 
During this century we have seen enough evidence in many African 
and Middle Eastern countries of the consequences of dividing 
populations based on ethnicity, race, religion or tribe. It is 
never too late. We can still learn lessons to keep us united and 
strong, rather than divided and segregated, particularly at a 
time when we are working hard to heal fractious wounds and to 
keep Canada united. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hyphenation and multicultural policies promote too much 
diversity at the expense of unity and equality. Reminding us of 
our different origins is less useful in building a unified 
country than emphasizing the things we have in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have too many differences based on race, religion, culture, 
ethnicity, et cetera, but we have only one common similarity, we 
are all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The children in our schools have differences, but we call them 
students.  The men and women in the army have differences, but we 
call them soldiers.  Citizens in our country have differences, 
but why should we not call ourselves Canadians?  In fact, the 
definition of multiculturalism should be a single society united 
by shared laws, values, future aspirations and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let individuals and groups have full freedom to promote their 
own culture, their own religions, heritage, et cetera.  If the 
truth be told, current multiculturalism is actually 
multifacialism.  Hyphenation brands us like commodities, but we 
are all equal human beings.  It creates different tiers of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there some Canadians who are more Canadian than others? 
Every Canadian has the right to be 100% Canadian and not a 
sub-Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How foolish it sounds when someone says even Canadians voted for 
Chinese Canadians or Indo Canadians or Italian Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's practices and policies unnecessarily fuel 
division, frictions, jealousies and prevent and discourage 
integration of various communities and, in fact, are a precursor 
to discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians continue to search with increasing urgency for ways to 
cross lines of colour, culture and religion. 
Yet the more we criss-cross these lines which establish our 
identity, the more it becomes evident that the very lines that 
define us also confine us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do? Surrendering a hyphen is one thing.  That tiny 
little splash of ink called a hyphen unites words but acts as a 
wedge to distance words and keep them apart.  The best way to 
draw a line is simply to withdraw that line.  Sooner or later we 
have to get rid of the stigma of hyphenated Canadianism, 
otherwise our children, our grandchildren and their grandchildren 
will continue to be identified with prefixes like Indo, Chinese, 
Italian, French, English and even Trinidad when they are 
described as Canadians.  Canadians in other countries are not 
called Canado Indian. They are not called Canado Chinese, Canado 
French or Canado Italian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about true origins in history?  Many may be Aryan before 
being Chinese or Indian.  Should we call them Aryan Chinese 
Canadians?  How about those with mixed ethnicity like 
Ukranian Polish French Italian Canadian?  What should we call 
them? It is possible in our country to have brothers and sisters 
in one family who could have been born in Trinidad, India and 
Canada, but they would still be a family of Canadians.  It is as 
simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of the Canadian bill of rights and the charter of 
rights and freedoms is to uphold every individual as equal before 
and under the law and free from discrimination.  We should 
sensitize Canadians to each other and stress not the differences 
that divide us but the similarities that unite us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hyphenation and promotion of cultural diversity by government 
encourages ethnic differences that lead immigrants to adopt a 
psychology of separation from mainstream culture.  It isolates 
ethnic racial groups in distinct enclaves by fostering an inward 
focus mentality that drives a wedge between Canadian of different 
backgrounds. Let us not create multicultural tensions or invoke 
jealousies but foster an atmosphere of harmony and love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 24 has raised more than just a few eyebrows.  It has 
generated an outpouring of support from across Canada to my 
office.  From the feedback I have received I know I am not alone. 
There are many more Canadians across this great land who feel the 
same way.  One Canadian even sent me a five dollar bill to have a 
drink in his name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My office has received many telephone calls, letters and e-mail 
messages.  People have even stopped me on the street to tell me

the consensus from all sides of this House to address what I and 
many other Canadians believe to be a problem, including many 
members from various parties whom I talked to and including the 
lonely independent member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us work together, recognize the merit of motion 24.  This is 
what the silent Canadian majority want.  Motion 24, if 
implemented by the government, will certainly bridge the gap.  It

everyone's responsibility to find solutions, but it is important 
that the government lead the way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, may I say from the outset that 
although I consider this motion misguided, I am absolutely sure 
that its impetus was my colleague's sincere love for Canada and 
his desire to ensure that Canada remains whole and united. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that I want you to know, Mr. Speaker, that my basic 
objection to this motion, since there is no official policy about 
calling oneself a hyphenated Canadian, is there is no law that 
designates that one must do that.  The wording of this motion 
seeks to prevent freedom of speech.  It seeks to prevent the 
freedom of a person to define themselves in any way that they 
choose. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share my colleague's opinion regarding respect, but I urge him 
to take a closer look at Canada.  Our country is not 
one-dimensional.  Our collective identity is complex, as are the 
individuals that make it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our geography is one of the most diverse there is, our history 
is a mosaic of events that shaped our country, and our population 
is made up of representatives of every culture in the world.  These 
factors enrich our identity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we deny the diversity of our landscape?  Do we deny the many 
events that mark our progress in national maturity?   Should we 
deny the reality of our geography, of our regions?  Should we 
deny the reality of cultural diversity?  Of course not.  Even my 
colleague agrees with me on this.  He freely admits that he is 
not opposed to multiculturalism.  This certainly indicates good 
sense because we are a multicultural country whether we like it 
or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes it all the more difficult to understand the motion we 
are debating today.  I can only believe that my colleague does 
not fully understand Canada's multicultural policy or what 
changes it has wrought in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, had it not been for Canada's multicultural policy 
and its supporting program, federal government initiatives, it is 
questionable whether my colleague would be sitting in the House 
today as a member of Parliament exercising his right to debate 
the issue of multiculturalism.  This House reflects to an 
unprecedented degree the cultural diversity that is and has been 
for a long, long time a primary characteristic of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the figure.  Forty-one MPs in this House are first 
generation Canadians.  This is what the multiculturalism policy 
is about, about equality, about justice, about representation and 
about the right to define ourselves in any way we choose.  It is 
not about hyphenation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I referred to this motion as misguided.  That is at its 
best.  At its worst it is an affront to everything Canada stands 
for in the area of human rights.  I remind you, Mr. Speaker, next 
year Canada will be commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the 
United Nations' Declaration of Human Rights which was drafted by 
a Canadian. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague wanted to speak on behalf of all Canadians, as 
though we all shared his opinion about our individual identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, I do not think this is the case. 
Canadians in all communities are proud of their heritage and take 
advantage of the freedom available to them to express this pride. 
In my opinion, this is proof that Canada is a country that respects 
individual rights and freedom of expression.  One does not have to 
deny one's background to be welcome in Canada.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider myself completely Canadian, but I do not hesitate to 
admit that my origins are in Trinidad.  As a Canadian, I can take 
advantage of the freedoms that are allowed me to express my 
opinions and to present myself as the person that I am.  It is my 
right to say who I am.  I can say I am a woman, a doctor, a 
Catholic or a member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have the right, if I wish, to say that I was born in 
Trinidad because I am a complex being.  I am made up of many 
different things that make me who I am.  At any time in my own 
life and in my life cycle I may need to refer to the different 
aspects of my person, my character and the things that have made 
me to this day who I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's multiculturalism policy, born out of our sense of 
justice and fair play, encourages Canadians to acknowledge, 
understand, accept and respect the reality of our cultural 
diversity knowing that it will not be a means of discrimination. 
It will not prevent them from participating fully in every single 
aspect of Canadian economic, social, political and cultural life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in fact the ability of Canadians to refer to themselves 
according to the colour of their skin, their sexual orientation 
and their gender in whatever way they choose to feel secure that 
who they are in fact is respected or are respected by the people 
of this country.  We do not have to become one mass of people, 
one amorphous mass, one cloned group where we all have to be 
exactly like everyone else to be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does just the opposite.  This policy is there to assist all 
Canadians to become full participants in Canadian society with 
the dignity and self-confidence that comes from personal pride. I 
say that an element of personal pride for many people is their 
family heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask any Canadian of Scottish background how he or she feels on 
hearing a pipe band strike up—or should I have said Scottish 
Canadian before it is too late if my hon. colleague has his way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The multiculturalism policy is about identity, self-knowledge, 
personal pride and self-respect.  These are qualities that are 
important not only to every Canadian but to every individual 
human being.  Canadians who are confident about themselves and 
what they can do and offer to Canada are infinitely more valuable 
to our society than Canadians who must wipe the slate of their 
personal history completely clean in order to appeal to some 
artificial ideal of what it is to be a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perfect Canadian is one who I can say, I or my father or my 
grandmother chose to come to this country and make it my home.  I 
am proud of that.  I know who I am, I know what I can do and I am 
willing to contribute my share to keeping Canada the great 
country that it is without giving myself away and without having 
to give up who I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what multiculturalism policy is all about.  It ensures 
that Canadians can live their lives in respect without fear that 
anything that they are, their colour, their gender, their sexual 
orientation or their religion, will remove them from 
participating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's motion is obviously misguided.  However, it is 
also the thin end of the wedge.  I have to ask myself, once I and 
every other Canadian are forbidden to refer to ourselves 
according to our roots or our origins, what is the next step?  Do 
I tear up my birth certificate which shows that I was born in 
Trinidad?  Will I have to find some way to change the colour of 
my skin because it is certainly going to define me regardless of 
what I call myself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A long time ago, Sir John A. Macdonald tried to form a country 
that was distinct from our people to the south, the United 
States.  We have striven to have a country that is a melting pot 
and not an assimilated mass of people who are all seeking to be 
cloned and to be alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should neither of these views carry any weight, the House might 
want to consider a third view:  that this motion is a bad joke 
and in bad taste.  On those grounds alone it should be dismissed 
forthwith.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point 
of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Bourassa should 
know that this was not a point of order and that the only example of 
what I mentioned earlier is the Reform opposition day when they and the 
Liberals voted hand-in-hand to blame the government of Quebec, among 
others, for not having held consultations on the drivel called the 
Calgary declaration. If the member for Bourassa did not understand that 
yesterday, I am telling it to him now—he is in front of me—and I hope 
that now he will understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I read the motion carefully and I must tell 
you—and here I agree with the parliamentary secretary when she says 
that this motion is in bad taste and ill-considered—that no matter how 
hard I try to read it from left to right and from right to left, I have 
difficulty understanding it. 
I would like to read it for those who are listening: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a legislative committee of this House be instructed 
to prepare and bring in a bill in accordance with Standing 
Order 68(4)<I>b</I>), to prevent the reference to and designation of 
any Canadian or group of Canadians in a hyphenated form, based 
on race, religion, colour or place of origin. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read it several times, and I wonder what exactly he wants us to 
bring in a bill on? Will it be in the regulations made by this House or 
in the regulations made by a department? Will it be in the legislation, 
in the bills, in the acts? Is its purpose to make a law on private 
conversations between individuals and to prevent people from mentioning 
Canadians of Irish, Portuguese or Haitian origin, or even Quebeckers? 
Is its purpose to make laws on that? I do not know. Is it to forbid 
members in this House to use this language during debates. I do not 
know, the motion does not mention that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing certain however. I agree with the parliamentary 
secretary. Earlier, I started by making a joke, but I agree with what 
has just been said on the government side. I would like to add that 
there is in Quebec a Charter on Rights and Freedoms. In Canada, there is 
the Canadian Charter on Rights and Freedoms, the Constitution Act, 1982. 
Quebec has never ratified it. No premier has signed it, as the member 
for Bourassa would mention, I am sure. But there is section 15.(1) which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every individual is equal before and under the law and 
has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the 
law without discrimination and, in particular, without 
discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, 
colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms has an equivalent of this 
section. I believe that as far as protecting individuals is concerned, 
in Canada and in Quebec, we have the appropriate tools. I believe that 
we are even ahead of many countries when it comes to individual rights. 
I sincerely believe that this is a debate that we should not be having.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a pointless debate under the circumstances, given 
that there are already provisions that deal very efficiently with this 
issue. You will have gathered from what I said that I am opposed to this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with two comments. First, with his motion, the hon. 
member of the Reform Party managed to suggest that the concept of 
Canadian culture should be redefined. I think that he does not 
understand his motion all that well either, because that was not exactly 
his intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, on the government side, in interpreting the motion, they 
managed to say that they were in favour of a strong and united Canada. 
Again, both sides are showing great imagination. 
But they are not really addressing Motion M-24 before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, you will understand that I cannot be in 
favour of Motion M-24. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with mixed feelings of pleasure and great concern that I rise 
today in this House to speak about the motion presented by the 
member from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have an opportunity to share my views on such an 
important issue.  But at the same time, this motion proposing the 
creation of a House committee to draft a bill that would prevent 
any reference to the ethnic, cultural or religious origins of 
Canadians troubles me deeply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be fooled by the wording of this motion.  The Reform 
Party is out to destroy the multicultural policy that stands at 
the heart of our heritage and this comes as no surprise from a 
party that is promoting division and exclusion in its policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Reform Party presents his motion as an 
anti-discrimination measure that will ensure that all Canadians 
are considered equal in status.  He refers to the use of 
hyphenated identification of Canadians from various origins as a 
way to create categories of citizens who are not just Canadians 
or simply Canadian. He argues that no one should be treated 
differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member thinks that being different means being less 
important, it is really sad. Does it mean that we should all 
forget our diverse origins and become white Anglo-Saxon 
Protestant Canadians?  Does it mean that the only identity 
acceptable is the one of the majority?  Does being 
Chinese-Canadian, German-Canadian or Italian-Canadian mean being 
less Canadian?  No.  It means being ourselves and wanting to be 
accepted as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very principle of equality so often abused in Reform 
ideology is itself based on the idea that differences do exist. 
Being equal does not mean to be all the same.  Equality means 
respecting differences and ensuring these differences will not 
limit the freedom of opportunity of individuals.  This is what 
multiculturalism is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Multiculturalism is about recognition, acceptance and 
celebration of differences.  I am proud to say that this is the 
conception of equality promoted by the NDP.  Equality means 
equality of opportunities.  It means respecting and appreciating 
one's particular heritage, differences and characteristics.  It 
also means that the government has an active role in promoting 
the right to be different and to counter intolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the contrary, the Reform Party wants multiculturalism to be 
purged from any government programs.  The Reform Party thinks 
that the government should not participate in promoting 
multiculturalism because one's heritage is a private and personal 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically they say it is okay to be Indo-Canadian at home but 
let us avoid being multicultural in public.  Why?  Is it a shame 
to be different?  Does it mean that we should all hide our roots 
in order to live together?  Dangerous concepts and for many 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that difference is not welcome and must be hidden.  It 
also means that the government should not be active in promoting 
real equality of opportunities for minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think the government has no business promoting 
justice or fighting racism and intolerance?  Because 
multicultural policies are also about educating people on how 
enriching and powerful working together can be.  Why is the 
Reform Party so terrified of multiple identities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is normal for people to cherish their specific heritages. 
Removing descriptions does not mean removing differences.  The 
names we use to identify ourselves are ways of saying “Here I 
am.  This is the way I am and I want to be respected as such”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being Cree, Quebecois, Indo-Canadian or Jewish is a way to 
express our specific heritage, our roots and a certain sense of 
collective belonging to a group but it is not a rejection of our 
common Canadian identity. 
In fact it is just the reverse.  It is a strong statement 
strengthening the vibrant fabric of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's rejection of the very idea that people have specific 
identities beyond their Canadian citizenship is also simplistic 
nonsense on the eve of the 21st century.  When in the same day 
one can chat on the phone with someone from Rio de Janeiro, send 
an e-mail to a friend in Berlin, eat Jamaican patties while 
watching the news from Algeria or Afghanistan with a friend born 
in East Timor, multicultural we certainly are.  To be 
multicultural we must fully participate in and understand this 
constantly changing and thriving world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been recognized as a world leader in developing a 
policy that addresses today's multicultural world.  Let us not 
give away what we have accomplished.  Going back to what now 
seemed like stone age denials of different policies would be a 
major setback for this country.  Sadly, this Liberal government 
has done little to defend multiculturalism from the unfounded and 
misleading attack from such groups as the Reform Party.  Rather, 
multiculturalism programs have been whittled down bit by bit 
since the Liberals took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals really believe in promoting diversity and 
participation of all Canadians in public life as a way to 
consolidate our national unity, maybe they could explain why this 
government has been following the politics of division and 
exclusion promoted by the Reform Party.  Slashing social 
programs, cutting public education about multiculturalism and 
imposing burdens on newcomers like the infamous head tax, 
officially referred to as the right of landing fee, on permanent 
residency is not about inclusion.  That is about exclusion and 
marginalization of a growing number of Canadians of all origins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my New Democratic colleagues strongly believe that the 
state has an essential role in promoting a fair and just society. 
We think, as do the majority of Canadians, that multiculturalism 
policies are an important aspect of this role.  In times of 
economic harshness, intolerance is on the rise.  This should be a 
concern for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally think and history tends to confirm that in general 
when people can be open about and proud of their specific culture 
and ethnic origin, and when the state is willing to accommodate 
and promote diversity, there is harmony.  It is only when 
attempts are made to suppress differences that troubles are 
developing. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is possible, and even desirable, to live together in a 
spirit of co-operation and openness to one another. Only by recognizing 
our differences, not only our commons values, but also our distinct 
historical roots, can we build a Canada that respects our characteristic 
diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is by definition a country based on diversity: geographic 
diversity of course, but also the diversity of its people, cultures, 
languages and faiths. 
I think that, by emphasizing the role of the founding cultures—aboriginal, 
French and English—while at the same time promoting and 
cherishing the new multicultural reality of our country, we will learn 
to live together. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To recognize our differences, promote our common values and 
learn from each other and to enrich our cultural and social 
heritage is the way to a better future for Canada, not the 
politics of division and denial that we hear more and more from 
the other parties in this House.  I will always rise to promote 
and defend our shared values of tolerance and inclusiveness that 
have made Canada such a cherished place to live.

House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get into the very idea of what it means to be a Canadian. It 
was not too long ago that we had a debate in this House. The

something that we as a government did not agree with. 
There was also the issue of people being able to wear turbans in

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important in some ways to recognize the reality of 
this country which defines us as Canadians.  The strong pillars 
of that are tolerance, understanding, and being able to 
participate fully with one's different religious background, with 
one's different ethnic origin, with one's different place of 
birth and be truly Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not born in Canada.  I came to Canada in 1957 when I was 
10 years old.  Since 1957 I have lived in Canada.  First and 
foremost I am a Canadian.  But there is no denying that I was 
born in Hungary and I would not want to deny that.  My mother 
came here at the same time when she was 36 years old.  She died 
very recently. She was 76 years old.  She died as a Canadian. She 
was proud of being a Canadian, but she did not forget her 
homeland.  She did not forget where she came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases it is coming from other countries, coming from 
other cultures that we can bring the very best to this country 
that is called Canada, a country that is the best country in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member for Surrey Central there are countries where 
people try to hide their background.  They try to hide their 
ethnic heritage.  They deny it.  They do so because they are 
living in a totalitarian country.  They are living in a fascist 
country.  In those places great sanctions are taken against 
people who are not perceived to be the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the strong points of this country is we can be different. 
If we look at the demographics of Canada, what does it mean to be 
a Canadian?  We know the native people, our First Nations came to 
this country first.  We know that the French factor came to this 
country.  We know that the English factor came to this country. 
But we also know that we have had people come to this country 
from all over this planet.  They have brought to this country the 
strengths from around the world and together have built the very 
best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day we were debating the issue of land mines. There 
was an incredible consensus in this House that this was the right 
way to go.  When I took part in the debate I could not help but 
remember that in 1956-57 Lester B. Pearson invented peacekeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons this has happened is because in Canada we 
have the demographics.  It does not matter where the problem is, 
where the conflict is, there are Canadians with the background. 
They have relatives, friends, acquaintances and a familiarity 
with the place where the strife is taking place and they are 
hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the reasons we as Canadians are so good at 
peacekeeping.  We can broker differences.  We can recognize 
differences and try to build the best society that we can. To 
deny that reality is to say to the rest of the world that we have 
to hide our differences, we have to submerge our differences. 
Clearly that is not what Canada is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been disturbed over the years when people have tried to 
attack the whole concept of multiculturalism in Canada. 
The reality is that we are a multicultural country.  That is one 
of our very real strengths.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot agree with the motion.  It is misguided at best.  I 
certainly hope that we as a government and as members of the 
House of Commons work together to build on our tolerance and 
understanding so that we can continue to be a beacon of hope to a 
troubled world often torn by strife based on religious 
differences, ethnic background and various nationalities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address the motion.  I thank my 
colleague for raising the issue.  I did not think I would have 
the opportunity to speak today, but I am doing so because this is 
a subject that is dear to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before coming to parliament I was a teacher.  That experience 
taught me a lot about society and about people.  For almost 25 
years I observed the things that happened in my classroom.  I 
began to realize the classroom was a microcosm of society, a 
small society within a larger society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As teachers we were given direction from those above us who 
thought they knew better than teachers how to handle the affairs 
of the classroom.  From time to time we received directives 
telling us to make children more sensitive to students with 
certain characteristics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we tried to implement policies in the classroom to cause 
students to be more sensitive to other students with certain 
characteristics defined as ones we should be sensitive to, the 
result was very interesting.  It created a problem for me in the 
classroom.  I relate this story to the House because I think the 
same problem is being created within society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students began to resent each other when certain ones became 
specially identified.  I began to have tensions within my small 
classroom because of the policy.   I suggest the same thing is 
happening in Canada.  Students became jealous of each other 
because some were singled out as having a special sensitivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One student asked me  “Are we not all special?  Don't each one 
of us as individuals have certain characteristics that others 
should be sensitive to?”  I am sure you have certain 
characteristics, Mr. Speaker, that, if we were to become aware of 
them, we would all like to be sensitive to.  We would treat you 
very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The students taught me something about people.  Each person as 
individuals want to be respected because they are who they are. 
They do not want somebody from above telling them to be sensitive 
to people who have a certain characteristic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When are children in classrooms the happiest?  It is when we are 
sensitive to each and every one of them and do not divide them 
into groups or cause certain ones to be singled out as needing 
special attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are important because we are individuals.  We will run into 
trouble, and we already have, within the society when we begin to 
implement policies from above that cause resentments and 
jealousies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we single out certain characteristics, we have to ask about 
all other characteristics that define us.  We have a very wide 
variety of characteristics, not just our ethnic background, 
religion or whatever defines us or that we feel is important. 
We have all these things.  I do not think we should use those 
characteristics to set ourselves apart from others in society. 
There are many other characteristics we could use.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give an example.  Saskatchewan has problems that are 
compounding as time goes on because aboriginals have been given 
the right not to comply with certain laws.  Those with some 
aboriginal blood are now claiming the same right not to obey 
these laws.  As a result people are beginning to be concerned 
about their safety and the preservation of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we create differences we run into problems, as we already 
have.  We should not be creating particular differences and 
giving people special consideration in certain areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lived overseas in third world countries for almost five years. 
In my experience I was happiest, as the children in my classroom 
were happiest, when I was accepted for who I was and not because 
I was white, bald, of a certain religious persuasion or any other 
external characteristic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are important because we are people.  Each one of us has many 
wonderful qualities.  We are each special.  Government should not 
be trying to define or meddle in areas that can actually divide 
us.  That is counterproductive.  It could create the problem we 
are actually trying to solve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could apply the lessons I learned in the classroom to the 
situation of today.  We need to move toward equality. 
Multiculturalism is fine but government should not be involved in 
such things.  When it is involved the big policies it tries to 
impose on the country do not work.  One size does not fit all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should respect each other's background.  We have many 
wonderful things to contribute.  Let us as individuals contribute 
and not allow the government to become involved, as it will only 
make more of a mess than the one we have.  We need to move toward 
equality.  That will do more to solve the problems.

politics for 15 years to fight against people like Bloc Quebecois and 
Reform Party members. Why? Because they always talk about ethnic groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jacques Parizeau said that the referendum was lost because of the 
Jewish, Italian and Greek votes. Then, during the election campaign, the 
Reform Party was saying “Canadians should not elect another Prime 
Minister from Quebec”. Now, these people want to tell me what to do. 
They want to tell me what a Canadian is. I feel insulted and outraged by 
these extremists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that multiculturalism is an asset. What is 
multiculturalism? It means being different but equal. In my riding of 
Bourassa, 20% of the population is Italian and 5% is Haitian. Many 
Haitians have settled in my riding of Bourassa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a real asset to share with these people. The fact that I can 
speak Italian is something positive. <I>Mi fa molto piacere do parlo 
italiano, signor</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what being Canadian is all about. Being 
Canadian means to benefit from all these cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, being a Canadian is to allow people to grow while respecting 
their roots and traditions. All these cultures make me a better 
Canadian. This is what makes up the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see people constantly trying to define what a Canadian 
should be, using the highest possible common definition, saying that we 
are good or bad Quebeckers, I realize why the public is cynical toward 
politicians. Thank goodness the Liberal Party is in office with a 
majority. I would be concerned if we were stuck with the ethnic policies 
of the Reform Party or the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, instead of having a national vision like that of the Liberal 
Party of Canada, we constantly talk about regionalization, as do 
Reformers and Bloc members, no wonder there are problems.

<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that this evening 
parliamentarians of all parties have the opportunity to record 
their opinions in this House on the important subject of climate 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Climate change, the most serious environmental issue this 
century, has been much talked about by members during the last 
few months here in the House of Commons during question period, 
in the standing committee on environment, in the press and no 
doubt in homes and communities across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this issue, climate change, is of great concern to 
Canadians.  According to our most recent polling, 87% of 
Canadians believe it is likely, or somewhat likely, that climate 
change will have serious negative effects on both the environment 
and our economy within 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-two per cent of Canadians believe that the government 
should take necessary actions to curb greenhouse gas emissions, 
even if such actions could have negative impact on the economy 
and their lifestyles.  Seventy per cent of Canadians believe that 
individuals can play a part in doing something about climate 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The phenomenon of climate change is the most serious 
environmental threat of this century.  In a statement released by 
the international panel on climate change in 1995, over 2,000 
internationally renowned scientists from all across the world 
told us that human activity is having a discernible impact on the 
global climate.  Nevertheless, some skeptics still refute the 
science suggesting an enormous hoax has been perpetrated upon the 
global community and that we can carry on with business as usual 
or at least wait 20 to 40 years before taking preventative 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As responsible members of Parliament, as responsible government 
with the authority to act, we are compelled to respond to this 
environmental threat with at minimum the attitude of precaution. 
As a government we must show leadership by working with all 
Canadians, all governments, provincial, territorial and 
municipal, all industry and business leaders and our scientists 
in order to put in place both realistic and achievable targets 
for greenhouse gas emissions reductions and implementation plans 
which reflect the engagement of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that if we take up this challenge, as we 
must, we will not only correct a serious global environmental 
problem in the long term, but we will also experience some 
shorter term environmental and health benefits along the way. 
The measures we promote to tackle the climate change problem will 
also help to address smog, acid rain and lake water 
deterioration.  Smog accounts for an estimated 1,500 premature 
deaths in Ontario alone, to say nothing of the cost of 
hospitalization, asthma attacks and chronic bronchitis. 
Committing ourselves to reduce greenhouse gases will contribute 
to cleaner air and purer water.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to reflect upon why this issue is important to 
Canada.  A series of studies released this fall outline the 
impacts of climate change on the different regions of Canada, 
B.C. and the Yukon, the prairies, the Arctic, Ontario, Quebec and 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mackenzie Basin impact study of the north reveals that the 
north has already warmed at three times the global rate.  We now 
know that climate change will result in melting glaciers, ice 
caps and permafrost which will result in higher sea levels, more 
frequent forest fires and changes in migration patterns of 
wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mackenzie Basin impact study goes on to outline how in 
contrast to sea levels, lake and river water levels will actually 
drop.  This will affect freshwater sources and fish and wildlife 
habitat.  There will also be an impact on agriculture, forestry 
and fishery industries because of more frequent droughts and 
fires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, despite these serious threats, there are those who 
suggest that in a cold northern climate like Canada, climate 
change will be a benefit, this despite the fact that climate 
change would cause unprecedented upheavals in our environment, in 
our economy and in our lives.  Key sectors of our economy such as 
forestry, fisheries and agriculture will be affected in all areas 
of Canada.  Canada will not be a winner if the phenomenon of 
climate change continues unchecked, and this must be understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists predict that with present levels of greenhouse gases 
we will see more severe weather events like the B.C. snowstorm 
last December, hailstorms that hit Alberta in 1991, floods such 
as those that struck the Saguenay and Manitoba in the last two 
years and possibly more tornadoes and severe storms across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the insurance industry, there have been record 
losses in recent years, much higher than previously recorded.  In 
1996 alone extreme weather events resulted in losses of 
approximately $165 million.  This is the reality we face in 
Canada, a country which on a per capita basis consumes enormous 
amounts of energy, the second highest per capita rate worldwide, 
second only to our neighbour the United States. This means we 
contribute significantly on a per capita basis to the problem of 
climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to put this reality within the global 
context.  Our world population continues to grow at an 
unprecedented rate and all human beings are consumers of energy 
and contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.  Most of the 
population growth occurs in developing nations.  Most of these 
people live in poverty with no or little access to electricity. 
Poor people use every tree available for cooking and heating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing nations are among the largest smog ridden countries 
in the world.  The air is rank with wood, coal and charcoal smoke 
in combination with dirty fuel emissions from cars, trucks and 
buses. It is a real chemical soup with serious health and 
business costs, to say nothing of the environmental implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves if it is fair to tell developing nations 
that they cannot grow and develop because this would perforce 
increase their countries' emissions.  No.  Despite the reality of 
dirty air in many cities of the developing world and incredibly 
high populations, it is still the developed world that accounts 
for 58% of global carbon dioxide emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible to allow developing nations to grow with business 
as usual unchecked growth in greenhouse gas emissions? 
No, but it is possible for them to grow with an equivalent effort 
at reduction of greenhouse gases in relation to developed 
nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal offers many opportunities for a country like 
Canada, opportunities to share our technologies, our science, our 
expertise, opportunities to invest in developing world growth in 
a green and environmentally friendly fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has some of the world's best environmental technologies, 
some of which must be used more in Canada but which are very 
attractive to developing nations as well.  For example, we have 
some of the best technologies to assist in the clean burning of 
coal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1975, the government has spent $10 million annually on 
coal research and development, 40% of which has gone to clean 
coal research and development.  Environment Canada has 
participated in this program and the program is expected to 
continue for the next three to five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said earlier, the science is sound and compelling and 
that is why, when the Canadian government goes to Kyoto next 
week, it goes in search of realistic, meaningful, achievable and 
equitable targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make it clear that all countries in the world must 
participate in reducing emissions globally.  The agreement will 
also underscore the need for flexibility mechanisms which will 
allow all nations to make significant domestic reductions and 
earn credit for reductions achieved internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing this because it is right for the world and because 
it is right for Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Kyoto is not an end in itself.  I do not wish to downplay 
the importance of the Kyoto meeting.  It will be a real challenge 
to reach an agreement acceptable to everyone, to developing 
countries more concerned with feeding their growing populations, as 
well as to small, insular countries that run the danger of sinking 
under rising ocean levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real work will begin, however, when we come back from 
Kyoto, for it is then that we will have to decide how we are going 
to achieve the targets on which we have agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my colleague, the Minister of Natural Resources, Ralph 
Goodale, and I met with our provincial and territorial counterparts 
in Regina two weeks ago, we agreed to formulate this plan together. 
The federal government alone cannot reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was after consultation with provincial, territorial and 
municipal governments and with industry and environmental groups 
that we formulated Canada's proposal for the Kyoto meeting.  We 
will take the same approach in working out the plan for meeting our 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the plan we come up with to be consistent with the 
environmental, economic and social aspirations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, it will not be easy.  Everyone will have to take part: 
governments, industry, environmental groups, communities and each

generate electricity, changes in the way we get around, changes 
in how we heat our homes and changes in the way our industries 
use energy.  These changes will be significant, but I have faith 
in the willingness of Canadians to make the necessary changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would have thought a decade or more ago that Canadians would 
spend the time required to separate their garbage, rinse tins and 
jars and carry different loads of garbage out on garbage day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, curbside recycling is so much a part of our lives, not 
many of us think about it any more.  We just do it.  Many, 
without access to the program, are actually taking their 
recyclable garbage to another area of town that has the program 
so that they can contribute to the recycling effort.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking action to reduce emissions can be as simple and 
inexpensive as changing or cleaning filters in your furnace and 
having it serviced once a year, driving more slowly and keeping 
your vehicle's tires fully inflated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians across the country are already doing what they can to 
reduce emissions. They are helping to reduce the number of cars 
on the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people at the Toronto Region Carpool initiative have worked 
with large employers in three areas of Toronto not well served by 
public transit to organize car pools for employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is in Edmonton.  The EcoCity Society is building 
greenways from abandoned rail corridors for cycling, walking and 
in-line skating creating a green link between inner city 
communities and downtown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the Cambie Corridor Consortium in Vancouver provides ride 
matching services and oversees preferred parking for vans and 
car pools, transit pass discounts, and showers for those who walk 
and cycle to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Whitehorse, Yukon a 10 kilometre trail will provide residents 
with a safe and direct route for cycling and walking in the 
summer, snowshoeing and skiing in the winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are making it easy for drivers to have their emissions 
tested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizens in Fredericton and Saint John, New Brunswick competed 
in the Emissions Impossible contest to see which community could 
have the greatest number of cars tested for emissions.  One 
participant even had the problem fixed and brought his car back 
the same day to pass the test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Edmonton a campaign called SMOG FREE, Save Money On Gas From 
Reduced Exhaust Emissions, provided drivers with free emissions 
tests and a coupon good for $10 off on any emissions reducing 
work of more than $50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are helping homeowners make their homes more energy 
efficient, saving them money and reducing emissions at the same 
time.  Green home visits in Cornwall, Ontario have saved 
homeowners anywhere from $300 to $10,000 on their heating bills. 
In St. Catharines, Ontario home visits have helped to reduce 
carbon dioxide emissions by 369,000 kilograms per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 20 Per Cent Club is a group of more than 30 Canadian 
municipalities who have committed themselves to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2005.  One of the members of 
the club, Toronto, has just been recognized by the United Nations 
as the most successful city in the world at reducing emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business too is participating in the effort to reduce emissions 
because it is good for the environment and because it is good for 
the bottom line.  Between 1990 and 1994 Chrysler Canada decreased 
total energy use by 5% at its largest Canadian operation at the 
same time as production increased by almost 50%. Over the same 
period Falconbridge reduced its overall energy consumption by 
just over 6% by modifying compressed air systems in several parts 
of its operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this week Petro-Canada announced a joint venture with Iogen 
to develop Canadian technology to produce ethanol, an alternative 
fuel, from straw, waste wood and other byproducts of agriculture 
and forestry.  Producing ethanol from biomass in this way reduces 
carbon dioxide emissions by more than 90% compared with the 
production and use of gasoline.  Petro-Canada is committed to 
exploring the commercial potential of this process because it 
believes that harnessing our powers of innovation is the way to 
reduce emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government too is committed to reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.  Besides several other significant budget measures 
taken by the federal government in the last few years, I was very 
proud earlier this week to announce that my department will be 
purchasing 100% green power for its Alberta facilities from 
Calgary's ENMAX.  This is the first ever institutional green 
power purchase in Canada. By choosing to power our facilities 
from wind power supplied by Vision Quest, Environment Canada will 
be reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2,000 tonnes annually, 
enough electricity to power about 250 homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may not sound like much but that is how we will reduce 
emissions, step by step, with each step leading to the next step.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite everyone's voluntary efforts, we are far from achieving 
the goal of stabilization of greenhouse gases at 1990 levels and 
we know we must reduce our emissions well below stabilization as 
the years go on.  We must redouble our efforts, work together to 
select and focus on implementing those measures which will have 
the greatest cost benefit for the environment and for the 
socioeconomic well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will develop an implementation plan in 
collaboration with all our partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Climate change poses a real challenge for Canada, but as with 
any real challenge real opportunities exist. As an international 
leader in energy research and development, Canada's private 
sector will be well placed to take advantage of an increased 
global demand for renewable resource expertise and clean energy 
efficient technology. Canadian companies such as Ballard and GFI 
are already taking advantage of this global opportunity with 
support from the federal government such as Technology 
Partnerships Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our children and grandchildren deserve a future free of 
environmental and economic uncertainty. There will be costs 
associated with reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, but the 
cost of inaction will be much higher and more profound. Together 
with the spirit and determination which shaped our country, 
Canadians can meet the challenge of climate change. In so doing 
we can demonstrate the international leadership for which this 
country is renowned.  Our children and our grandchildren deserve 
no less.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to participate in this take note debate on global 
warming.  Our aim is to hold the government accountable for its 
approach to the development of Canada's position on this issue in 
preparation for the third conference of the parties to the UN 
framework convention on climate change to be held December 1 to 
10 in Kyoto, Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has previously indicated in the House that Canada 
is committed to signing a medium term, legally binding agreement 
for reducing CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2010. 
However with only a few days left until Kyoto, the minister has 
yet to lay before the House in a definitive way the science on 
which Canada's position is based. The science, she said tonight, 
is sound and compelling and then she failed to present any of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has yet to lay before the House a definitive 
statement of the economic, sectoral, regional and taxpayer 
impacts of pursuing its CO2 emissions reduction targets. The 
minister cited public opinion polls, but opinion polls conducted 
in the absence of the presentation and knowledge of any of the 
impacts would certainly change the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has yet to satisfy the House that the government 
has a workable agreement with the provinces or with anyone else 
for achieving its targets and paying the bills.  In the absence 
of such a plan, the minister was relegated to listing anecdotes 
of emissions controls which however laudable do not even scratch 
the surface of the emissions controls required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that surely the time for a take note debate is long 
overdue. Given the government's ineptitude in approaching this 
issue, it is time for an accountability debate and that is what 
we intend to present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to confine my remarks tonight to three aspects of 
the issue: the science of global warming; the public interest in 
global warming, in particular the taxpayer interest; and an 
alternative to the approach the government is taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, particularly the official opposition critic for 
the environment, the hon. member for Nanaimo—Alberni, and the 
official opposition critic for natural resources, the hon. member 
for Athabasca, and other colleagues will be analysing the 
government's approach and position in greater detail from their 
perspectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start with global warming from a scientific 
perspective and present some of the information which I frankly 
had expected to hear from the minister tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that most of us as MPs should attempt to do this, to 
outline our layman's understanding of what science is saying on 
an important public issue, even at the risk of exposing ourselves 
to correction by experts. 
By doing so, we acknowledge that science has a major contribution 
to make to the issue at hand. By outlining however imperfectly 
our understanding of what science is saying, we can learn and 
improve our application of science to public policy. So let me 
try my hand at describing the greenhouse effect and global 
warming from a scientific perspective. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1855"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Science tells us first of all that the greenhouse effect is a 
natural phenomenon vital to the existence and preservation of 
life on this planet.  This phenomenon is described in many 
scientific textbooks and in the introduction to most policy 
discussions on global warming.  I will go through a few of these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They usually begin by reminding us that interstellar space is a 
cold place.  Its average temperature is -250°C. The average 
temperature of the earth on the other hand is 15°C, a difference 
of 265 degrees.  The difference is explained by the impact of the 
sun's radiation as a source of global warmth and the effect of 
greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour which 
occur naturally in our atmosphere have the following properties: 
they are transparent to short wavelength radiations such as 
sunlight, but they are opaque to longer wavelength radiations 
such as the infrared radiation emitted by the earth.  These gases 
therefore let sunlight through to warm the earth, but trap the 
infrared radiation from the earth and warm the planet by about 
20°C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us therefore pause, especially those of us who live in a 
northern climate, to express thanks for the greenhouse effect 
because without it, the average surface temperature of the earth 
would be -5°C and of course it would be uninhabitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the greenhouse effect itself that is the current cause 
of consternation and the subject of international conferences 
like Rio de Janeiro and Kyoto.  The cause of consternation, the 
subject of this take note debate, is the so-called enhanced 
greenhouse effect, the greenhouse effect enhanced by human 
activity, in particular the burning of fossil fuels and the 
probability of so-called global warming as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1896 it was the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius who put 
forward the hypothesis that the addition of greenhouse gases from 
human activity would trap more infrared radiation and 
consequently lead to an increase in atmospheric temperatures. 
Today it is not disputed that man's activities over the past two 
centuries, in particular the burning of hydrocarbons and the 
destruction of forests, have led to an increase of between 
one-quarter and one-third of atmospheric CO2. Similar increases 
of other greenhouse gases have occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of the industrial revolution we have 
therefore increased the equivalent CO2, the increase in all 
greenhouse gases by approximately 50%.  That said, the hypothesis 
that global temperatures are in fact increasing over the long 
haul is still and should be still the subject of scientific 
debate.  The hypothesis that increases in CO2 emissions are the 
principal contributors to global warming is also and should also 
still be the subject of scientific debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific literature on global warming includes evidence 
and argument for and against both of these hypotheses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, climatologists observe that global temperatures in 
the 1960s and 1970s were cooler than in the 1950s.  If you go 
back and look at their literature, particularly the popular 
literature of that period, the global warming theory lost ground 
during those years to the ice age theory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Books such as <I>Ice</I> by Sir Fred Hoyle, an eminent scientist, 
<I>The Cooling</I> by Lowell Ponte, <I>The Genesis Strategy</I> by 
Stephen Schneider, all purporting to be based on solid science, 
argued that global temperatures were falling, not rising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 however—and I am talking mainly about the North 
American context; you can follow a line of development in Europe 
and other parts of the world—the global warming theory regained 
attention from testimony before the U.S. Senate energy 
subcommittee of the commerce committee by James Hansen, head of 
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hansen said:  “I have a high degree of confidence that the 
current climate is related to enhanced greenhouse effects. Global 
warming is now sufficiently large that we can ascribe with a high 
degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship to the 
greenhouse effect”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the UN published its scientific assessment of climate 
change, authored by a scientific panel.  It is commonly referred 
to as the IPCC report.  This was a scientific report, prepared 
and reviewed by scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its findings, however, were challenged even at the time by other 
scientists, leading the influential scientific journal 
<I>Nature</I> to say in an editorial at the time that IPCC's 
failure to discuss dissenting opinions, perhaps even to dismiss 
them, was a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN subsequently convened the conference on the environment 
and development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.  This led signatories, 
including Canada, to agree to limit CO2 emissions to 1990 levels 
by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, according to Environment Canada, a greenhouse gas 
inventory prepared a year after put Canada's emissions at 461 
million tonnes of carbon dioxide, for the year 1999, 3.7 million 
tonnes of methane and approximately 92,000 tonnes of nitrous 
oxide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, under a business as usual scenario, it was believed 
that by the year 2000 Canadian emissions of carbon dioxide would 
grow by between 11% and 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these measurements were going on, scientists like Patrick 
Michaels, a climatologist at the University of Virginia, in both 
scientific articles and in popular books like <I>Sound and 
Fury</I> challenged the validity of the global climate models. 
These are the computer models on which much of the global warming 
theory is based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO scientist Allyn Clarke, testifying before the parliamentary 
committee on the environment on November 6, 1997, said: “I don't 
believe that our current crop of climate models are particularly 
good at predicting the future.  I can explain away each new 
climatic index as being within the range of natural 
variability”.  He is a Canadian scientist, working for the 
Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John Christy, professor of atmospheric science at the Global 
Hydrology and Climate Centre at the University of Alabama, argues 
that global temperature data collected from satellites, which is 
more modern than the data collected from earth based 
meteorological stations, do not support the theory of global 
warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1991 study by Friis-Christiansen and Lassen and similar 
studies found a correlation between solar cycle length and global 
temperatures, suggesting that fluctuations in solar radiation 
levels, not greenhouse gas emissions, were the controlling factor 
in climate changes over the last 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this brings me to the following observation on the 
government's approach to global warming from a scientific 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An underlying weakness of the government's approach is its 
inability to sort out good science from bad, real science from 
pseudo-science and basic science from science as applied by those 
with vested interests in its application on either side of the 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, this is a special case—and this is something I have 
noticed since I came to this Parliament—of the government's 
general lack of ability and mechanisms to bring science to bear 
objectively and effectively on any issue of national importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the importance of science to every aspect of our 
national life, this is not a science oriented government.  There 
are very few science stories in the clipping service subscribed 
to the by government.  There are never any science illustrations, 
contemporary ones or anecdotes, in the speeches of the prime 
minister or senior ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows how to put on cocktail receptions for Nobel 
laureates but does not know how to tap into their wisdom and 
apply it to national policy issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate this further, when the minister was asked in the 
House the other day by the member from Kelowna which particular 
scientists and which particular studies she had used to form the 
basis of Canada's position at the Kyoto conference, she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, there are thousands of respected scientists 
throughout the world who are telling us that this is an issue we 
have to be concerned about.  There are all kinds of science in 
support of the international community's signing an agreement in 
Kyoto, Japan. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was all that was said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She then jumped from this totally vague reference to thousands 
of scientists and all kinds of science to quoting particular 
references from various interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a completely unacceptable and, I suggest, a completely 
unscientific answer to a perfectly legitimate question on 
relevant science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is therefore sceptical about the alleged 
science behind the government's position, and for three 
particular reasons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are aware that one of the unfortunate byproducts of 
government policy demanding results oriented science is to create 
a market for biased science designed to serve political and 
bureaucratic interests rather than a market for free and 
independent science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the U.S. this trend is most aptly illustrated by a quote from 
Dr. Stephen Schneider, a global warming protagonist and adviser to 
U.S. Vice-President Al Gore.  In an interview given by Dr. 
Schneider to <I>Discover</I> magazine on October 1989 he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, we are ethically bound to the scientific 
method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth 
and nothing but—which means we must include all the doubts, 
caveats, ifs, and buts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we are not just scientists, but human beings 
as well.  And like most people we'd like to see the world a 
better place, which in this context translates into our working 
to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climatic change. To 
do that we have to get some broad based support, to capture the 
public's imagination.  That, of course, entails getting loads of 
media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make 
simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any 
doubts we might have.  This `double ethical bind' that we 
frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any formula. 
Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being 
effective and being honest. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before accepting the government's position on global warming, as 
based on legitimate science, Canadians want to be assured that it 
is not based on, to quote Dr. Schneider, scary scenarios made 
simple and dramatic with little mention of doubts, simply in 
order to capture public imagination and support and, I might also 
say, research funds from gullible governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, with respect to the record of this government in 
bringing science to bear on public policy, the official 
opposition is well aware that this House has been misled in this 
area before.  I refer particularly to the record of this 
government and the previous government in bringing science to 
bear on the sustaining of the fisheries, particularly the 
Atlantic fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again this House was assured that the goal of the 
government was the sustainable development of the fisheries, a 
goal which balances economic and environmental interests, the 
same type of thing only in a different context as what we are 
talking about tonight.  Time and time again we were assured that 
science was guiding the government's pursuit of sustainability. 
All hon. members have heard that said at one time or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now in more recent days we read stories of fishery scientists 
who say their science was ignored or, worse yet, twisted to serve 
political and bureaucratic ends, for example, to justify opening 
a depleted cod fishery for a short time just before a federal 
election.  I wonder what scientific study led to that conclusion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most damning of all, we have the auditor general's recent report 
saying that in reality there is no clearly stated policy for 
sustainable fisheries in theory or in practice.  Excuse us, 
therefore, if we are sceptical of the claims of a government that 
now claims it can harness science to public policy to save the 
planet from CO2 emissions when it obviously could not harness 
science to public policy to save a fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we are particularly sceptical about the capacity of 
governments to harness science to public policy at high level 
conferences like Rio or Kyoto because of what I call the Meech 
Lake effect or the law of Meech.  I am heading into new 
scientific ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law of Meech is based on observations made at the high level 
constitutional conference held at Meech Lake in 1987.  This was 
conducted with politicians, not monkeys, because it was found that 
the technicians were less likely to develop a personal attraction 
to the politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that conference 11 first ministers were locked up for three 
days to come up with a constitutional agreement while over 200 
media persons waited outside for a dramatic pronouncement.  The 
agreement reached at that meeting under those kinds of 
circumstances was so out of tune with the needs of the country 
and the thinking of the public, so devoid of common sense, that 
it was eventually discredited and rejected.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the law of Meech, therefore, the capacity of 
politicians in high conference with each other to deceive 
themselves is directly proportionate to four things:  the number 
of politicians involved, the rank of the politicians, the length 
of the time they are together isolated from ordinary people, and 
the number of journalists, media persons, waiting outside the 
door panting for a story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that this Meech Lake effect was in full operation at 
the Rio summit in 1992 where over 100 world leaders met in 
isolation from their publics for almost a week with almost 9,000 
media people panting for an instant, simplistic solution to a 
complex problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see increasing evidence of the Meech Lake effect coming into 
play again as the Government of Canada rushes down the road to 
Kyoto.  Can we offer any constructive advice on how better to 
harness science to the development of public policy on global 
warming or on anything else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time will not permit me here to elaborate on an alternative 
science policy to the federal government.  I think we should have 
a debate like that some time in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to make one observation.  This Parliament, indeed this 
government, has no effective mechanism for bringing science 
effectively to bear on big issues like global warming without 
having that advice filtered or amplified by the departments and 
interest groups with a strong vested interest in the content and 
the direction of the advice we receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In retrospect, it was probably a mistake to do away with the 
science council of Canada and the office of the chief science 
adviser to Canada.  We should re-examine whether such 
institutions are in fact required.  If they are, and I suspect 
they are, we should take particular care to ensure that their 
terms of reference enable them to provide that basic, objective, 
unfettered, scientific advice which this Parliament and this 
government so obviously need to deal with an issue like global 
warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn from science to consideration of the issue of 
global warming from the public interest perspective.  This 
Parliament has a responsibility to determine what policy, what 
position on global warming is in the Canadian public interest, 
and the public interest is rarely, if ever, synonymous with a 
single interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of choosing between the protection of the 
environment or the growth and development of the economy, but the 
best balance between the two, the course of action that 
reconciles the two at lowest cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of choosing between the federal interest in 
this matter or the provincial interest but finding the position 
and the policy that activates and co-ordinates both federal and 
provincial responsibilities in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of choosing between the interests of the coal 
and the oil producing provinces and the interests of the other 
provinces, but the position and policy that balances and 
reconciles the best interests of both producing and consuming 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw this neglected in the minister's presentation. Above all, 
since we are the Canadian Parliament and it is the position of 
the Canadian government we are seeking to devise, it is the 
interests of Canada and Canadians in all these matters that we 
must keep paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk for a minute about balancing environmental and 
economic interests.  Let me first of all say categorically that 
Reform is committed to the protection of the Canadian and global 
environment. We do not believe that this country or any other 
country can be indifferent to the real and potential 
environmental damage that can arise from the combustion of 
hydrocarbons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our party was founded, its statement of principles included 
the following statement: “We believe that Canada's identity and 
vision for the future should be rooted in and inspired by a fresh 
appreciation of our land and the supreme importance to our 
well-being of exploring, developing, renewing and conserving our 
natural resources and physical environment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand from the laws of conservation of energy and mass 
that the total weight of materials taken into an economy from 
nature must ultimately equal the total weight of the waste 
discharged plus any materials recycled.  It is a great 
fundamental principle, economic in one dimension and ecological 
in another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means the only way to reduce the pollution burden on 
ecosystems in this country in absolute terms is either to reduce 
our economic activity or to dramatically improve our recycling 
capability.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nations like ours, indeed all nations of the world, should begin 
to give as much attention to the measurement and disposition of 
the gross national pollution as we do to the gross national 
product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are convinced the real standard of living of our country and 
other countries of the world cannot be measured by GNP per capita 
alone as it often is.  Real standard of living equals GNP per 
capita minus gross national pollution per capita.  That equation 
should guide both our economic and environmental policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give a more human dimension to this point, I frequently visit 
schools, particularly when I am on the road.  I try to visit an 
educational institution at least once a day.  When I do that I 
try not to give long speeches like this one.  I try to get young 
people themselves to talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often ask them what kind of country they want to live in.  I 
have been impressed over the last 10 years by the fact that over 
40% of the answers I receive are expressed in environmental 
terms.  I want to live in a Canada where there is clean air, 
where there is clean water, where there are forests, where there 
is unpolluted land, and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas our grandfathers may have defined Canada as a 
partnership between the English and the French and our generation 
may wish to define it as a partnership between equal citizens and 
provinces, I suspect our grandchildren may well insist the most 
primary definition of Canada should be as a partnership between 
its people and the land, between its people and its ecosystem. 
That would not surprise me at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it not be said that this side is indifferent to the 
protection of the environment and questions the adequacy of the 
government's approach to global warming from that perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as we believe and I think most members in the House believe 
that major proposals for industrial projects require an 
environmental impact assessment, we believe major proposals for 
environmental protection require an economic impact assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not seen that from the government with respect to CO2 
emission reductions.  How can we find the right balance between 
economic and environmental impacts and effects if we do not have 
them in the same degree of specificity on the table at the same 
time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is apparently prepared to commit itself 
to significant reductions in GNP over the next one or two decades 
to stabilize CO2 emissions at 1990 levels.  If some industrial 
concern came before parliament or one of its committees with an 
industrial proposal that would increase our GDP by 1% to 3% over 
the next 20 years, we would insist that it provide us with a 
detailed assessment of the environmental impacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the government coming to us with an environmental policy 
proposal that could require a significant reduction in GDP.  The 
government fails to provide an economic impact assessment.  It 
fails to provide sectoral impact assessments.  It fails to 
provide regional impact assessments.  It fails to provide a tax 
impact assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the impact assessment from the Department of Finance or 
the Department of Human Resources on the number of jobs that will 
be lost as a result of a GDP reduction required to hit the 
proposed Kyoto targets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the assessment of the impact on loss of revenue to the 
government and the increase in the deficit?  We are not arguing 
at this point whether it is right or wrong.  We are saying where 
is the assessment of the impact so we can make a judgment on 
whether it is worth the cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the economic impact assessment that supports the job 
creation and economic activity are associated with new 
technologies and exporting to which the minister referred? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the assessment that indicates the value of that 
activity would come even remotely close to compensating for the 
job loss and curtailment of economic activity required to reduce 
CO2 emissions to 1990 levels? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the assessment from the transportation minister?  That 
minister has been silent on the contraction of that sector which 
will result from the measures required to reduce CO2 emissions to 
1990 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the assessment from the natural resources minister on 
the contraction of the energy sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the assessment of the trade minister on the trade 
impacts?   Why has this not run through the entire government if 
the government is serious about the matter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the assessments of the so-called regional development 
ministers on the impacts on the west, Ontario, Quebec, the 
Atlantic region and the north? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of these impact assessments from the government, 
we have no choice but to rely on impact assessments prepared by 
the interests that would be directly affected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members may consider the assessments biased, but they 
are more substantive than anything the government has produced. 
They are so sobering in their content that even if they were 
discounted by 50% by 75%, they could hardly be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize for taking so much time, but I am doing what I had 
expected the minister to lay before the House.  For example, the 
Business Council on National Issues attempted to illustrate the 
nature and the magnitude of the measures needed to reduce 
Canadian CO2 emissions to 1990 levels.  According to their 
calculations reductions to 1990 levels—and this is the stated 
Canadian position for Kyoto—would require the equivalent of one 
of the following measures:  a shutdown of 40% of Canada's 
agricultural, petrochemical, industrial processing, metal 
production and other industries utilizing hydrocarbon processing 
or combustion in the production process; or a shutdown of the 
entire upstream oil and gas exploration industry; or a shutdown 
of all agriculture and the heating of 25% of Canadian homes; or 
the removal of 50% of all Canadian passenger vehicles from the 
highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members think those measures are bad, take a look at the aim 
to reduce CO2 emission to 1990 levels minus 5%, which is the 
Japanese position.  That would require the equivalent of one of 
the following measures:  the removal of 85% of all Canadian 
passenger vehicles; or the removal of 75% of commercial 
transportation vehicles, that is trucks, and the elimination of 
all air, railway and marine transportation; or the elimination of 
the heating of all commercial buildings and virtually all homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they are doing here is simply illustrating the magnitude of 
what is involved with even a so-called small percentage reduction 
in GDP over this time period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Prime Minister is striving to compete with the nations of 
the world to see who is the greatest leader.  If the aim is to 
reduce CO2 emissions to 1990 levels, minus 15%, which is the EEC 
position, that would require the equivalent of one of the 
following measures: the removal of all Canadian passenger 
vehicles and 80% of all commercial vehicles, that is just about 
all of Canada's motor vehicles being off the road; or a shutdown 
of all hydrocarbon fuel generation and all air, railway and 
marine transportation; or a shutdown of all Canadian industries 
which utilize hydrocarbon processing or combustion in the 
production process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is only one set of analyses, the economic impact analysis 
by an interest group.  Even if it is discounted by 75%, the 
magnitudes are far bigger than we have ever heard said by the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to another model developed by the Government of Canada, 
the DRI McGraw Hill analysis has been done on various regional 
impacts of stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels.  We are talking 
about regional impacts, not gross economic impacts.  This 
analysis demonstrates the effect of stabilization of greenhouse 
gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 as compared to 
business as usual projections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its conclusion is that all regions suffer considerable declines 
through to the year 2010.  The biggest impacts occur in the 
fossil fuel dependent provinces, with Alberta suffering 
increasingly negative impacts through 2020.  Negative impacts are 
suffered by all regions, with the negative impacts in Ontario 
almost equalling those in the western provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An analysis done by Charles River Associates in the U.S. has 
been used to look at the trade impacts.  We expected the trade 
minister to bring this analysis to the House.  It has not come 
and we are only a few days from Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This study shows Canada to be the worst affected among the G-7 
countries.  This trend continues to the year 2030.  The DRI model 
has also been used to analyse the export performance of various 
sectors under emission constraints compared to a business as 
usual scenario.  Not surprisingly, the biggest decline is in the 
energy sector, particularly coal.  Also significant is the impact 
in energy intensive sectors such as iron and steel, chemicals, 
mining, and pulp and paper.  Many of these sectors will lose 
market share to competitors in developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now seeing, belatedly, various industrial and economic 
interests throughout the country beginning to come forward to the 
natural resources committee, the environment committee and 
individual members of Parliament, presenting their own 
assessments of the possible impact of various CO2 emission 
control levels on their industry, on their companies and on their 
unions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see estimates of job losses including—and I will just give 
two that I am familiar with—up to 10,000 to 12,000 jobs lost to 
the coal industry alone, 2,500 to 3,500 direct jobs in the coal 
industry in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia, and direct and 
indirect oil and gas job losses as high as 56,000 including 
spinoff effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These interests will concentrate on one side of the story.  We 
know that.  Perhaps some of them will exaggerate the impacts.  We 
know that.  However, our task is to try to get all major impacts 
on the table to assess them as objectively as we can and to 
define the proper balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another interest I want to touch on.  What is most 
disturbing of all to us is that the one interest most likely to 
be dramatically affected by whatever positions we take at Kyoto 
does not even seem to have entered into the equation or the 
calculation of the government's position.  I refer to that long 
suffering, oft forgotten interest, the interest of the Canadian 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the UN framework convention on climate change was agreed to 
in 1992 with the aim of limiting CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by 
the year 2000, there was much talk at that time among the 
governments and trading blocs involved about meeting this target 
through the imposition of a tax on fossil fuels.  That was the 
most frequently mentioned mechanism for paying for the targets 
that were agreed to in Rio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The precise form of this tax was not specified but most 
economists talk about a carbon tax, which would mean that at some 
point in the chain from producer to consumer a levy, probably 
paid to the government of the state in which the sale took place, 
is imposed on the sale of fossil fuels.  The size of the tax 
would be proportionate to the carbon content of the fuel, with 
coal having the highest carbon content and methane having the 
lowest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that Liberals have an instinct.  It must be bred 
into them.  We do not know where it comes from.  This would 
perhaps be a good subject for a scientific study.  They have an 
instinct to try to solve every problem ultimately by increasing 
taxes.  That is how the finance minister effectively tackled the 
deficit.  Most of it was through an increase in tax revenues.  It 
is the solution they put forward for fixing the Canada pension 
plan, a 73% hike in payroll tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suspicion is that at the end of the day, after all the fuzzy 
talk, the approach the government will take to endeavour to pay 
for whatever it commits to in Kyoto will be a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the federal government to come clean, although it 
is pretty late in the day, on how will it pay for its targeted 
reductions in CO2 emissions.  Will it be carbon taxes, energy 
taxes, fuel taxes, greenhouse taxes, direct taxes or indirect 
taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy industry analysts have estimated that if the bulk of the 
cost of meeting the target of CO2 levels is borne through fuel 
taxes, this could result in a price increase at the pumps of 10¢, 
20¢ or 30¢ a litre, depending on which assumptions we use. If the 
government has ruled out a carbon tax, as the Prime Minister has 
said, if it has ruled out a fuel tax, what other taxes does it 
have in mind? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a moral and fiscal obligation to come 
clean on the subject with the public, and it has singularly 
failed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have looked at the environmental impacts, the economic 
impacts, the sectoral impacts and the taxpayer impacts.  Let me 
look at one more combination of interests, the balancing of the 
federal and provincial interest in this matter.  We are, after 
all, a federal state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a federal system like Canada, the development of any position 
on environmental protection, particularly one that has 
significant ramifications for the economy, must be a co-operative 
effort between federal and provincial governments.  Under our 
constitution responsibility for environmental protection is a 
shared responsibility.  Both federal and provincial governments 
have responsibilities in the area of economic development as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have previously stated, we do not believe the federal 
government, even at this late date, has clearly stated what 
interest it intends to advance and protect in developing its 
negotiating position for Kyoto, or how it intends to implement 
and pay for its commitments.  This makes it extremely difficult 
for the provinces to know where they stand or even to be able to 
agree to the commitments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do know, from the meeting of federal, provincial and 
territorial energy environment ministers on November 12, 1997 in 
Regina, that the provincial ministers are prepared to agree to 
the following:  one, reliance on joint implementation and 
technology transfers as ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
globally; two, continued scientific research on such subjects as 
reforestation, alternate energy sources, technology transfers and 
research into climatic change itself; three, expansion and 
promotion of the volunteer challenge registration program, which 
we support; and four, the expansion of innovative approaches, 
such as emissions trading, which of course would require major 
changes in all of Canada's regulatory legislation which we have 
not seen any evidence of at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What strikes the objective outside observer is that this hastily 
prepared short list barely scratches the surface of what would be 
required to meet the stated target of reducing aggregate 
greenhouse gas emissions in Canada back to 1990 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again there is a gaping hole in the Regina statement as to how 
any such effort is to be financed.  Even the overall target 
referred to in the November 12 statement was put in doubt just 
eight days later—this is how permanent these commitments 
are—when the Prime Minister implied to Premiers Tobin and Klein 
that in his misguided desire to look better than the Americans on 
this issue, perhaps a new target should be adopted by lowering 
GHG emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2007.  That was eight 
days after the firm commitment was made in Regina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament must therefore conclude that the federal government 
has not even scratched the surface in identifying and reconciling 
federal and provincial interests in implementing and paying for an 
action plan for reducing CO2 emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This task, which should have been accomplished prior to Kyoto, 
apparently will be tackled, from what the minister said tonight, 
after Kyoto.  It is a classic case of getting the cart before the 
horse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repeatedly in the House the minister, in an obvious effort to 
divert attention from the poverty of the government's approach 
and position, has asked what is Reform's position.  It may be 
that the minister is subconsciously anticipating the day when 
Reform is the government.  However, as of this hour we are the 
official opposition, the Liberals form the government, and our 
task is to hold the government accountable for the failures and 
weaknesses of its positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have the resources to do the work of the Department of 
the Environment with its 4,000-plus employees and its budget of 
over $575 million.  However, what we do have to offer is an 
alternative process for ascertaining and reconciling the 
legitimate interests—the environmental interest, the health 
interest, the business and commercial interest, the provincial 
interest, the consumer interest, the worker interest, the 
taxpayer interest—which must be reconciled if the government is 
to have a credible position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has put the cart before the horse.  It goes to 
international conferences where it is subject to all the 
pressures of the Meech Lake effect and it agrees in advance to 
certain targets and standards.  It has, in effect, agreed to sign 
a treaty at Kyoto even before that treaty has been negotiated, 
having made commitments and having held the press conferences, 
which seem to be the most important part of this exercise.  It 
then will proceed to negotiate with the people who will be 
directly affected by those commitments, the private sector and 
the provinces while, as I have mentioned, ignoring certain 
interests, in particular the taxpayers' interests, altogether. It 
is a classic case of putting the cart before the horse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our alternative process is simply this.  Number one, get the 
Canadian position first by negotiating with our key players. 
Define a Canadian position on CO2 emissions that is particular to 
this country; a big, cold, northern, exporting country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number two, having secured some agreement in principle on 
appropriate CO2 emission levels for this country, then secure 
agreement on implementation and who pays.  I do not think someone 
is serious on this issue until they address the issue of who 
pays. It is always the last thing to be considered in this House. 
It ought to be the first.  It is because it was the last thing in 
this House to be considered that we ended up with the deficits we 
did and a $600 billion debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number three, having reached that position at home, that is the 
Canadian position which should be taken to Kyoto to be negotiated 
in good faith with the other players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number four, if an agreement is reached that is close to or 
better than the Canadian position, then sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number five, if no such agreement is reached, do not sign.  It 
is better to be honest and say we cannot meet commitments beyond 
our capability than to sign simply for the purposes of temporary 
favourable press clippings, only to fail to keep our commitments, 
which is exactly the case that happened in Rio.

that of the government, a scientifically sound position, a 
position in the Canadian public interest and a position capable 
of implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one final word for the Prime Minister.  I cannot for the 
life of me understand where the Prime Minister is coming from on 
this issue.  In his desire to be seen as a good green fellow at 
international environmental gatherings, he seems to have 
forgotten where he lives and whom he represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister needs to be reminded that he is not the Prime 
Minister of a unitary state.  He is the Prime Minister of a 
federation where joint action on the environment requires 
federal-provincial agreement prior to making international 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister needs to be reminded that he is not the Prime 
Minister of Fiji where they can survive without much extra 
energy.  He is the Prime Minister of Canada, a northern country, 
with one of the coldest climates in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He needs to be reminded that 24 Sussex Drive is not on the 
Equator.  It is at 45° north latitude in Ottawa, which the 
diplomatic corps assures me is the coldest capital in the world 
next to Ulan Bator in Mongolia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He needs to be reminded that he is not the Prime Minister of 
Belgium, a small country that can be driven across in a few 
hours.  He is the Prime Minister of the second largest country in 
the world, a northern exporting country of immense distances that 
has an energy requirement for transportation, an energy 
requirement for heating just for survival, an energy requirement 
for manufacturing and processing that is particular to this 
country and requires a particularized approach to CO2 emission 
limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Prime Minister needs to be reminded that he 
is the Prime Minister of Canada, in all its dimensions, federal, 
ecological, and economic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he forgets that, as he and his government appear to have 
done, the road to Kyoto will be a road to failure, not the road 
to a better world and a better tomorrow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak on a matter of utmost importance: global 
warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, millions of tons of carbon dioxide are being released 
into the atmosphere. North America alone is responsible for more than 
25% of these emissions that are having an unprecedented effect on our 
atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How should we react to this major challenge? That is the question 
we must ask ourselves, the purpose of the debate we are having tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But first of all, let us take a brief look at history. Society took 
a long time to realize basic things concerning the environment. 
For some time already, scientific experts around the world have been 
noticing that, over the past century, the globe has been warming up 
faster than before. Many research teams have looked into this serious 
problem to seek out its causes. One after the other, these teams have 
released their troubling findings, that human activity is responsible 
for global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their findings were immediately challenged by numerous sceptics, 
and from what I could see this evening, the leader of the official 
opposition is one of them. However, many sceptics, not counting the 
leader of the official opposition, were shocked to learn that humans 
could have such a major effect on the atmosphere. For the longest time, 
like the environmentalists, these scientific experts were doomed to be 
a voice crying in the wilderness. 
But since the mid-1980s, a growing number of people have started to 
realize how serious this environmental problem is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having recovered from the effects of the 1982 economic crisis, 
society is realizing how extensive and diverse environmental problems 
are. The ensuing expansion of the debate was beneficial to us all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment quickly became a major concern for the whole of 
society. Public opinion developed an awareness and began to support 
experts and political leaders for greater protection of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After facing the numerous challenges relating to the protection of 
our water, air, forests and soil, we turned to issues of a more global 
nature, such as greenhouse gases. At the international level, these 
issues require the implementation of global and co-ordinated measures by 
all the nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This led to the signature in Helsinki, in 1984, of the first 
international protocol to reduce transborder emissions responsible for 
acid rain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years later, in 1987, Montreal hosted an international 
meeting that led to the signing of what was called the Montreal 
protocol, the purpose of which is to reduce the production of gases 
harmful to the ozone layer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years later, in 1992, over 150 nations got together in Rio for 
the earth summit. This meeting led to the signing of a UN framework 
agreement to limit concentrations of greenhouse gases. At this 
unprecedented summit, developed countries set as a common goal to 
stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at the 1990 level by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, five years later, we are faced with the same potential 
disasters. Why? 
Because several countries, including Canada, did not manage to reach 
their objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government, which has been in office since 1993, 
seemingly put more effort into using doublespeak regarding the 
environment than in applying concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous examples. On April 24, the Liberal government 
came up with an advertisement highlighting their achievements, in which 
it claimed to have been a leader on the international scene, by helping 
reduce the causes of climate change in the world. However, nothing could 
be further from the truth. Canada's performance regarding greenhouse gas 
levels is one of the worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, compared to other OECD members, Canada did poorly in terms 
of reducing greenhouse gases, in spite of Quebec's good performance, 
which should not go unnoticed. 
It should be remembered that in Quebec, there is an average of nine tons 
of carbon dioxide emissions per capita, whereas the Canadian average is 
18 tons, while in Alberta, it reaches the unacceptable level of 56 tons 
per capita. Quebec is in a position to meet the objectives set in Rio. 
However, for the whole of Canada, observers expect that instead there 
will be an increase of 13% in emissions by the year 2000. Quite a 
performance for a government that likes to brag about its leadership in 
this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government's failure to act in this issue 
extends beyond that. Of all the G-7 countries, Canada will be the last 
one to present its negotiating position at the Kyoto summit. That is 
some leadership when hiding one's own position seems to be the 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are still waiting for this so-called final position, we 
have to rely on the only public position that was endorsed by the 
Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Natural Resources, the 
so-called Regina agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that meeting, the environment and natural resources ministers 
from all ten provinces were invited by the federal government to discuss 
the objectives for greenhouse gas emission reductions. The rest of 
Canada managed to agree on only one thing: to delay for ten years the 
environmental commitments made by Canada at Rio. No reduction objective 
was discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That meeting is an unfortunate setback for the environmental cause 
in Canada. That meeting showed the ministers giving in to the demands of 
the oil lobby.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Having recorded one of the worse increases in emissions among 
the OECD countries, after being the last G-7 country to submit a 
negotiating position for Kyoto, with what is called the Regina 
agreement, the Liberal government is assured of presenting one of 
the lowest reduction objectives among the industrialized countries 
in attendance at Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet at the international conference at Berlin in 1995, the 
attending countries clearly agreed that stabilizing emissions would 
not be sufficient to eradicate the negative effects of global 
warming caused by human activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inevitable that what we do not do today, we will have to 
do tomorrow. 
Not taking action today means saddling future generations with an 
even heavier burden. In deciding to restrict itself to a sensible 
stabilization of emissions until the year 2010, the Canadian 
government is choosing inaction as its action plan for meeting one 
of the most important challenges facing the planet, contrary to its 
promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government got itself elected in 1993 by promising to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% before the year 2005. 
Today, it is putting its 1992 commitments off for ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their government publication, the Liberals tell the public 
that it is time for action to reduce greenhouse gases.  Yet, when 
they sit down together at Regina, they decide instead to put their 
promises off for another ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Minister of Natural Resources, seemingly totally 
unconcerned by any contradiction, has taken the Liberal derision 
further still. 
He said a bargaining position like Regina's would enable Canada to 
build bridges and promote consensus in Kyoto.  Since when does the 
individual with the weakest position at the bargaining table 
promote consensus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand from this statement that it is the firm 
intention of the Liberals to go to Kyoto to build international 
consensus around immobility?  This would seem to be the 
government's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the same day that the Liberal government and all the 
provinces but Quebec reached an agreement in Regina, the Minister 
of Finance was making a speech at the University of Toronto.  In it 
he said that the economic growth we are aiming at is a reflection 
of the quality of life Canadians deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians' quality of life is really of interest to the 
Minister of Finance, perhaps he should have a look at the major 
studies done by the Department of Environment on the impact on 
Canada of the rapid warming of the climate.  The most significant 
of these studies indicates that we should expect higher mortality 
and more disease if we do not act quickly to stop climate changes. 
More specifically, the study provides that the heatwaves caused by 
global warming will raise the rates of death and disease 
particularly among young people, old people, the chronically ill 
and those whose health is fragile.  In short, the consequences of 
failing to act now could be disastrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With only a few days before the start of international 
negotiations in Kyoto, all speakers in this House should drop their 
arguments and work together to find a constructive solution to this 
major problem of humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our era has been marked by frenetic, even aggressive 
development.  Now it is time to be cautious, self disciplined and 
mindful of nature.  This is the message sent in 1986 by the United 
Nations commission on the environment and development chaired Prime 
Minister Gro Brundtland of Norway.  The work of this commission 
gave rise to what we now call sustainable development.  Growth and 
the environment are not mutually exclusive, rather they should be 
used together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that the extension of respect for 
individuals lies in respect for their surroundings.  We have to 
protect the environment of this planet out of respect for what our 
forefathers bequeathed us and a sense of responsibility toward 
future generations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part, the Bloc Quebecois, through its environment 
critic, the member for Rosemont, has been calling for serious 
commitments from Ottawa for several weeks now.  Throughout the 
debate, we have stressed the importance of this issue for the 
environment and the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that the federal government must make serious formal 
commitments at the Kyoto conference with respect to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.  Only serious objectives to significantly 
reduce carbon dioxide emissions would confirm its desire to tackle 
this major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the provinces, particularly the worst polluters, 
must also undertake to do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be clear and concrete objectives in order to avoid 
backsliding.  We must do better than the Americans' timid 
objective.  We must aim even higher than Japan's objective, which 
is to reduce by 5% from 1990 levels by the year 2012. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ratification by all provinces of the Kyoto convention is vital 
in attaining the objectives set.  The Rio agreement, it will be 
remembered, was ratified only by Quebec and British Columbia.  All 
provinces must make efforts consistent with their situation.  It is 
a question of equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, while the Bloc Quebecois is interested in the 
objectives, it is even more interested in seeing them met. 
This is why an independent compliance committee composed of experts 
and private citizens should be created to ensure that, within 
Canada, the federal government and the provinces follow up on the 
commitments made in Kyoto through periodic public reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to stress the major role governments 
play in protecting the environment.  As parliamentarians, we must 
set an example and be attentive to the possible impact of our 
actions on the future.  Global warming is a major problem, and the 
long term impact on society may be devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have a collective responsibility to protect our 
environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me 
say how very pleased I am this evening to have the opportunity to 
participate in this very important debate in the run up to the 
Kyoto conference next month. I have to say in all honesty so far 
I feel a little like Alice in Wonderland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all we were treated to some comments by the environment 
minister who I must say made a reasonably solid case.  In fact I 
would say she made quite a convincing case for why we desperately 
need leadership from the Government of Canada to tackle the 
problems associated with climate change. It is the very 
environment minister who apparently has attempted but failed to 
persuade her colleagues of the critical importance of this 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It leaves one somewhat worried. Once again we see an example of 
where the more progressive elements within the Liberal 
caucus—and I am certainly prepared to acknowledge that the 
environment minister falls within that category—are nevertheless 
overshadowed and prevailed upon by the regressive elements in the 
Liberal caucus. What we get instead is a total absence of 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a situation where at this point in time we are coming up 
to Kyoto with absolutely no clear indication from the Government 
of Canada of where it stands and what it intends to do on behalf 
of the Canadian people who have elected them to office and who 
have been looking to them for leadership.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we heard the Reform leader again very effectively in his 
usual eloquent way damning the government for its record in 
regard to climate change.  I want to quote directly and I hope I 
got the exact words.  It seemed to me to be an absolutely classic 
statement by the Reform leader when he said that we have had a 
government “panting for a simplistic solution for a complex 
problem”. I have to say that I have never heard a better 
description of how the Reform Party of Canada conducts itself day 
in and day out in this House and outside of this Parliament in 
regard to practically every single issue of public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then heard the Reform leader once again make the case that 
who pays for this should be the single most important question. 
He went on, as he does so often, to define the public interest as 
being absolutely identical and equal to the concept of the 
taxpayers' interests.  That vision of Canada is a bankrupt vision 
that is causing a lot of Canadians to lose heart these days about 
the amount of influence that the Reform Party has on the current 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think most Canadians see the issue of the public interest in a 
much broader way.  They understand that it has something to do 
with citizenship, with community and with our sense of pride as a 
nation.  To define the public interest in the narrowest possible 
terms as having exclusively to do with taxpayers' interests is an 
abdication of leadership it seems to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally we heard the Reform leader offer up his astounding 
statement about how in his view one had to recognize that there 
was, I guess, a pretty even balance between the international 
consensus that exists around the globe today among highly 
respected scientists, among independent peer review scientific 
evidence and the so-called scientific evidence that is offered up 
by the high paid lobbyists on behalf of the narrowest of economic 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To equate those two and say that they have to be balanced and 
they leave us not really knowing for sure whether the scientific 
evidence is sound is again, I think, an act of deception.  It is 
the opposite of the kind of leadership that Canadians are looking 
to their parliamentarians to provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on from there and travelling through this world of 
wonderland we then heard the Bloc leader.  The Bloc leader in his 
comments tonight and the presentations that his colleagues have 
made in recent weeks have taken a more progressive view than the 
other two parties.  It is certainly a more enlightened view with 
respect to the whole issue of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we heard tonight was that in the process of the Bloc leader 
applauding the record of his own provincial government, the 
Government of Quebec, in regard to the reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions, he really advanced one of the most convincing 
cases that I could ever hope to hear for why we need a strong 
federal government from coast to coast to coast in this country 
to provide leadership on this kind of issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc leader knows perfectly well that we live in an 
immensely diverse country, that we have very different regional 
economies, that the energy base and the economic base from one 
province to another differ greatly.  I know he understands that 
given the fact the province of Quebec is blessed with a very 
generous amount of hydro energy, its economic base and its energy 
source are very different from those of provinces that depend 
upon a more carbon based energy source.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he understands I am sure, and what I think increasingly 
Canadians are coming to understand, is how barren the notion is 
that somehow we should be able to lay on a uniform formula across 
the country and say every provincial government and the people of 
every province should expect to make the exact same contribution 
based on the exact same formula for greenhouse gas emission 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not reality.  We need to be clear that people sometimes 
try to make fun of the fact that European nations have come 
forward with the most progressive proposals for greenhouse gas 
reduction and that we understand the so called European bubble 
effect that allows for some flexibility across the European 
nations on which countries are going to be able reduce their 
greenhouse gas emissions most and in which particular way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a phenomenon which also needs to be understood in the 
Canadian context.  This is precisely why we desperately need 
leadership from the federal government.  There are many different 
ways in which different parts of the country can and should be 
expected to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.  No uniform 
formula laid across the nation is going to do it.  The impacts 
are going to be different.  The measures are going to be 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely the tragedy about the complete failure of the 
federal government to date to provide any real leadership in 
working with the provincial governments partners to achieve an 
overall strategy and to begin to address Canada's responsibility 
to meet its commitments made in Rio in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answers to questions which I have raised, which others have 
raised, my colleagues in the NDP caucus and others in other 
caucuses as well, again and again we have heard members on the 
government side and a number of different ministers say do not 
talk to us, go and talk to the provinces.  They do not seem 
willing to just sign on at the eleventh hour as we are on our way 
out of town to Kyoto.  No wonder they are not able to just sign 
on. There has been absolutely no leadership from the government 
in any meaningful way for the past four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in the habit of rushing to the defence of the 
Conservative caucus.  I thought this debate around greenhouse gas 
emissions reached an all time level absurdity when I heard I 
believe the finance minister or some minister on the front 
benches of the government rip into the Conservative leader who 
was pushing for progress on this, saying it was really your fault 
because he was the energy minister in Rio in 1992 and you came 
back to Canada and you completely failed to implement a 
comprehensive strategy that would move us in the direction of 
meeting our commitments made in Rio in 1992.  Think about the 
absurdity of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I profess no expertise in what went on before I came to this 
Parliament, but it is my understanding that such measures did 
begin to get under way in 1992 and into early 1993.  One is hard 
pressed to find that the current Liberal government has done much 
of anything every since.

leader has said that at least you get some points for honesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to see honesty in this debate.  Canadians want to 
see integrity in this debate.  What they want to see is a federal 
government that is willing to tell the truth to Canadians. Yes, 
we have a lot of work to do to catch up.  No, we have not made 
any significant progress whatsoever in the direction of meeting 
our commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk in terms of meeting our commitments in Rio in 1992. What 
we need to be very clear about is that in 1992 nations around the 
world began to face up to the fact that it was going to take a 
global effort to begin to address what is a growing crisis with 
respect to climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of weeks before the government goes to the 
international conference in Kyoto to represent the interests of 
Canadians.  We do not have a clue what the position of the 
Government of Canada will be on our behalf.  It is absolutely 
humiliating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the Prime Minister of Canada must have felt some sense of 
embarrassment that before leaving Canada, the Prime Minister of 
Japan joined the chorus of concerned Canadians in pleading for 
the Prime Minister of Canada to finally make his position known 
with respect to the upcoming conference in Kyoto.  I am sure that 
is not what the Prime Minister had in mind when he invited the 
Prime Minister of Japan to participate in the APEC conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that it is darn well time that the Prime 
Minister started to understand that the very government which is 
responsible to provide leadership on this issue is far behind the 
Canadian public, and that is an embarrassment.  It certainly 
gives a very different notion of this government's idea of what 
leadership is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the position of the Canadian government is a sort of 
half-hearted commitment that we will do a little better than the 
United States at Kyoto.  The government argues that the reason 
for not being more specific about it is because it needs some 
flexibility at Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the record of this government on climate change and its 
failure to provide any meaningful leadership on greenhouse gas 
emission reductions, Canadians generally are nervous that the 
kind of flexibility which the Government of Canada wants is 
flexibility that will allow it to drop below whatever commitment 
the U.S. makes with respect to climate change.  Why else would we 
have the government arguing that it needs flexibility instead of 
setting its sights higher and talking about developing the kind 
of strategy which is necessary to ensure that we achieve those 
targets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely critical that the Government of Canada go to 
Kyoto and stake out a strong position.  If we continue to ignore 
the signs and the damaging effects of a changing climate, then we 
have acted extremely irresponsibly with respect to future 
generations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the hysteria of the Reform Party on this issue, the 
science is clear.  Yes, of course there are some scientists who 
will say they are not completely convinced by the evidence they 
see that the problem is of the magnitude that the overwhelming 
consensus of scientists have assessed it to be.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard scientist after scientist after scientist provide 
evidence that I think has to be taken seriously.  As I say, there 
is an international consensus that this is a problem that we have 
a responsibility to face up to as a family of nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what is the most accurate prediction, but when one 
hears large numbers of respected scientific bodies predicting, 
for example, that by the year 2100 the average global temperature 
will increase by 3.5° Celsius, we know that we have a very 
serious problem on our hands and that the full impact of changes 
that will result from those kinds of climate changes, those kinds 
of temperature increases, would be absolutely devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be more frequent and severe hurricanes and storms, 
widespread drought in some areas.  In other areas there would be 
flooding, the extinction of many plant and animal species, 
widespread coastal flooding and erosion and even the 
disappearance of low-lying islands.  We are talking about islands 
of human beings that could literally disappear into the ocean if 
we do not face up to this problem and take some leadership. 
There would be massive economic losses in forestry, agriculture 
and fisheries for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot of arguments in this House in recent weeks, 
particularly from Reform but also from the regressive wing of the 
Liberal Party that seems to prevail in this debate, that we need 
to know the costs associated with meeting our commitments at Rio 
and any commitments that we make at Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that I absolutely agree with that.  Of course we need 
to know the cost.  What I think a lot of Canadians find 
objectionable and what my colleagues and I find absolutely 
profoundly ignorant is the viewpoint that keeps getting put 
forward again and again that somehow there are no real costs 
associated with not doing anything about dealing with the 
impending crisis in climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake about it, there are significant costs.  There 
are economic costs, environmental costs and health costs 
associated with the do-nothing approach that this Liberal 
government has taken to date with respect to climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What scientists, doctors, economists, environmentalists all 
understand and what the government and my colleagues on the far 
right steadfastly refuse to understand is that doing something to 
reduce greenhouse gases, to taking up this challenge of dealing 
with the crisis of climate change can actually be a powerful job 
creator.  The economy can and should benefit from addressing this 
problem if it is addressed responsibly, if it is addressed 
comprehensively and if it is addressed in an innovative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preventing global warming means investing in people and in 
businesses who are developing clean technologies.  It means 
investing in new technologies like solar and wind power that 
create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canada needs is a comprehensive plan that includes building 
retrofits, that includes electricity reform, that includes more 
fuel efficient vehicles, greater access to public transit and 
greater industrial innovation, all of which can be powerful job 
creators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give one example.  The climate action network and the 
Sierra Club have developed a rational energy program, a program 
that calculates measures to reduce greenhouse gases and create 
jobs. 
Their proposal, which has been analysed by respected economists, 
would indicate that over a five year period the measures that 
they have proposed are capable of creating over 500,000 jobs, 
over half a million jobs.

energy conservation reasons, it is also important to do in a 
country that continues to have close to a million and a half

invention to know what to do.  But the tragedy is that this 
government has virtually gutted some of the programs that had us 
on the right course with respect to a bigger commitment to public 
transit for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other jobs created through supporting research and 
development that are capable of greater energy efficiency and 
renewable energy sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are additional economic benefits to reducing the effects 
of global warming.  Direct savings in energy costs are a direct 
benefit. For those who insist on talking only about the costs 
associated with our tackling this problem, it is time to look at 
what some of the real benefits can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the growth of energy efficient and renewable energy 
technologies and the avoidance of environmental damage and health 
costs associated with pollutants such as sulphur dioxide that 
accompany greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard earlier this week scientific evidence and some of it 
coming directly from the environment department about how 
worrisome it is to see the increasing health problems associated 
with greenhouse gas emissions and how much more severe that 
problem is going to be if we do not very quickly get on with 
addressing it in an urgent way. The fact is that our global 
environment simply cannot absorb our ever increasing pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time here in Canada and even more desperately in 
developing countries like China and India, people need jobs so 
that they can feed their families and they can achieve a decent 
standard of living.  The people and the businesses that can 
develop clean and efficient technologies, that can take up this 
challenge will address those two fundamental needs, the need for 
jobs and the need to ensure a clean environment for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already see evidence that innovative businesses that can 
accomplish this twin objective are going to be in great demand 
around the world. 
They will be the employers of the future who can provide 
competitive and exciting jobs and opportunities for our young 
people. Surely we need no reminder that this must be a very high 
priority since we live in a country where some 25% of our young 
people are unemployed and their first experience with a job is no 
job at all.

counts.  We can win in respect to jobs and we can win in respect 
to a cleaner environment.  If we get on with it, we can lay the 
cornerstone for a new dynamic and a cleaner economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is on that basis that my colleagues and I embraced a policy 
to commit to the reduction of greenhouse gases by 20% from 1990 
levels by the year 2005. Some will say that surely that goal is 
no longer realistic.  It certainly is true that this government 
has provided so little leadership and there has been so little 
progress in getting on with the kind of comprehensive measures 
that are needed that it does seem very difficult to imagine how 
we can attain those objectives.  I have heard no argument as to 
why we should not get on urgently with beginning to tackle the 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case government members need a reminder, these targets were 
not pulled out of thin air.  These targets could not be described 
as totally irresponsible and irrational.  We remind the Liberal 
members that in their own red book in the 1993 election, they 
stated very clearly that that goal was attainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the finance minister in his bid for the leadership of 
the Liberal Party said that we could do better than those 
reduction levels. The Liberals came to office in 1993 and the 
previous environment minister committed herself to those levels. 
She did so in writing.  Surely it cannot be said that these are 
completely irresponsible, irrational targets to put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that this government is going to Kyoto virtually 
empty handed without being able to demonstrate any progress 
toward these objectives because it has failed to put in place the 
kind of comprehensive strategies that are needed to ensure we 
make progress toward those objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As important as it is for us to go to Kyoto and enter into an 
agreement to achieve some reasonable progressive levels of 
greenhouse gas emissions reductions, the real work begins when 
the delegation returns from Kyoto.  We must ensure that we put in 
place the kind of plan of action that was not put in place after 
Rio.  We need a plan that can get us on a path both to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and to enhance our economy and our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say that surely this is all just a pipe dream, that 
it is not realistic, that it is just a lot of talk, that we do 
not really have at hand the concrete measures that are needed. 
That is simply not true.  We talked briefly about Germany.  The 
German government has actually implemented 109 different measures 
to tackle the problem of climate change. 
That means making a real commitment that goes far beyond the kind 
of token measures that the Government of Canada holds up and says 
“No, no, we are doing something”.  It means going far beyond 
the voluntary programs and putting in place solid regulatory 
regimes and putting in place the kind of incentive programs that 
will produce real results.

commitment to social housing for example, at a time when there is 
a job to be done here that would help us move in the direction of 
greater energy efficiency.

the Prime Minister, to the Minister of the Environment and to the

begin to understand and tell Canadians the truth, that we can 
only win, it can be a win-win scenario for Canadians in terms of 
both jobs and the environment if we get on with the task.  Let me 
say that the failure to do so is a failure to protect the 
interests, the health and the livelihood of future generations of 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
participate in this debate with a great deal of anticipation 
given the importance of this issue and the personal interest I 
have in it and the interest my caucus has also taken in this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can certainly report to the House that our critic for the 
environment, the hon. member for Fundy—Royal who is only 33 
years old and one of the newest members but one that we are very 
proud of, has worked extremely hard in helping us develop this 
position.  He is not alone.  He is going to join a number of 
members of this place and other houses in all political parties 
who over the years have cared a great deal about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to single out tonight the fact that we do have in the 
House of Commons the past Minister of the Environment, the member 
for Davenport, who has served in that portfolio in the past.  I 
want to use this opportunity tonight to tell members that when I 
had the privilege of being the head of Canada's delegation in 
Rio, he accompanied the delegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity of doing some events with him and he was 
well remembered. I remember this distinctly because I thought 
gee, one day I may retire from the department.  He was well 
remembered by his colleagues.  He has maintained an interest in 
this issue, a sincere and real interest.  He is here tonight. He 
is one of those who has made a lasting contribution to this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the member for Lac-Saint-Louis was the minister of 
environment in the province of Quebec and the parliamentary 
secretary for environment.  I had the added pleasure of working 
with him on a few key issues, cross-border issues.  He was one of 
the most appreciated, well remembered ministers of environment 
ever in the province of Quebec.  And so what, he is on the wrong 
side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people have taken a keen interest in this issue.  I 
do want to take a second to thank the leader of the NDP for her 
remarks in regard to Rio, in regard to the record. It is in fact 
a rare occurrence in this House when a member is able and 
gracious enough to correct the record in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that a past 
member from the riding of Rosedale if I remember correctly was 
also part of the Canadian delegation.  He himself was very 
involved in the leadership and in the way the delegation was 
conducted.  He would have some intimate knowledge of what 
happened in Rio. 
And so, Mr. Speaker, on that lighter note I want to offer some of 
our views on this very important issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT79"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT79"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2030

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to direct my remarks as to how this whole 
issue of environment and sustainable development relates to 
Canada and to the future of our country by saying as succinctly 
but as clearly as I can how important an issue it is for Canada 
more than any other country in the world.  There are a few 
reasons for this.  First is because we have this great land mass. 
We have the second biggest country in the world in terms of land 
mass.  We have three oceans that surround us.  We have a very 
fragile northern environment. For this reason alone this issue of 
climate change and global warming will have more impact on us by 
virtue of the geography than any other country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another reason that is even more compelling, the 
economic reason.  I stress here of all the developed countries in 
the world, not developing, Canada is the country that depends the 
most on its natural resources, in other words on its environment, 
to earn its way. That is of all the developed countries.  We can 
easily understand why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of what our economy is made of.  What is it?  It is the 
forestry sector with pulp and paper and softwood lumber. The 
mining industry was in town today lobbying on some of its 
concerns. The mining industry is very prominent in this country. 
Of course fishing on both coasts, even in the north, is very 
important.  Think of the time and energy that we put into those 
issues, as my own caucus has put into fishing issues in this 
country. Then we can go on with energy, whether it is 
hydroelectric energy or hydrocarbons, and of course agriculture. 
The list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat, of all the developed countries in the world 
Canada is the country that depends the most on its environment to 
earn its way.   We live off our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us, this issue is not just one of trying to determine 
whether we want a pristine landscape or the Rockies or whether we 
enjoy the sight of the ocean.  Actually our livelihood depends on 
how we will manage this environment and there is actually more to 
it than that, the future of our own children.  Their standard of 
living will depend on how we manage this environment today.  For 
that reason alone this is an extremely important issue for 
Canada.  I would venture to say that this issue, all things being 
relative, is more important to Canada, whether it is global 
warming or other environment issues, than to any other developed 
country in the world that I know of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another twist to this.  If it is true we have this big 
land mass, that we depend on our environment to earn our way, let 
me add this other element that will really bring home how 
important environment issues are going to be for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also now one of the countries in the world most dependent 
on trade. Because of the success of the 1988 free trade 
agreement, because of the success of NAFTA, because of the role 
we have played in furthering the interest in the WTO, Canada is, 
with Germany, the developed country that depends the most on 
trade to maintain its standard of living.  I think it is probably 
close now to 40% of our gross domestic product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, for those who may be surprised by that statistic, 
maybe we need to remind them that how could it be otherwise.  How 
could we otherwise explain that a country of 30 million people 
only, if we put it in the context of the G-7, could have such a 
high standard of living if it were not for the fact that we sell 
abroad?  Trade for us is important, so important that the jobs 
that have been created in Canada in the last few years have been 
created because of an increase in trade, in particular, trade 
with the United States since the signing of the 1988 free trade 
agreement.  Had it not been for the trade agreement and the jobs 
that ensued in the last few years Canada would have been in a 
recession and we would not have had any jobs created. That is how 
significant it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me finally try to tie this together.  Our land mass is very 
vulnerable. We live off our environment.  We are dependent on 
trade. 
This also means that of all the countries in the world on this 
issue we are very vulnerable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If ever there were to be a movement for green protectionism in the 
world, and there are signs of that, of sanctions leveraged 
against countries that are not perceived as respecting 
environmental standards, Canada would suffer, 
immediately and immeasurably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to some of the comments of our colleague, the 
leader of the Reform Party, who based all his arguments on 
science.  In all honesty and sincerity I would have to add this 
to the colleagues of the Reform Party.  They would be wise to pay 
attention to the fact that in the international marketplace 
science may not have a lot to do with decisions taken by certain 
countries that perceive Canada as not living up to environmental 
standards.  If they come to the conclusion, right or wrong, that 
we are not respecting environmental standards and they decide to 
act against us, we will be in big trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not take my word for it.  Ask those in the pulp and paper 
industry.  Ask those companies that try to sell paper abroad what 
they went through in the early 1990s.  I will forever remember as 
minister of environment the industry's asking me to bring in 
tougher environmental regulations which cost the industry between 
$3 billion and $5 billion in adjustment.  This was at a low time 
in the cycle while it was coming out of a recession. Why was it 
asking for the regulations?  It was getting hammered in the 
marketplace by its European competitors that were accusing it of 
not living up to the environmental standards that they were 
supposedly imposing on themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be under no illusion here.  It is great to talk about the 
science, which I do want to talk about, but there is more to it 
than that.  Let us look at this issue in terms of our 
self-interest as Canadians.  We need to understand that we have 
an opportunity for some enlightened self-interest.  The 
enlightened self-interest of Canada is to be ahead of the game in 
the area of the environment.  We should be ahead of the game 
whether in terms of sustainable development, the pulp and paper 
industry or global warming, energy or sulphur dioxide emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are not ahead of the game, if we are not doing as well or 
better than the highest standards of our competitors in this 
area, we are vulnerable to sanctions and we will be the first to 
suffer.  We will suffer environmentally, from a standard of 
living perspective and also from an economic perspective.  That 
is the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some good news for those listening who may be scared of 
these issues.  As many Canadians, they may see these issues as 
insurmountable problems.  There is reason to feel that way at the 
outset.  When we are confronted with this problem of global 
warming it is complicated and technically difficult to 
understand.  We hear of scenarios of countries being gobbled up 
by the sea with rising sea levels, terrible catastrophes if we do 
not deal with the problem.  The same is true for a number of 
environmental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share this good news with those Canadians listening 
tonight.  When we were confronted with similar problems, when we 
faced them head on based on good science, good common sense, 
strong political will and clear leadership, we were able to make 
real progress in dealing with some equally difficult issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say it was only under Progressive Conservative 
governments but I cannot, although I am very proud of the role we 
played.  I am extremely proud of the role former prime minister 
Brian Mulroney played on the world stage.  He was known and he 
has a clear record as one Canadian prime minister who made this 
one of his top issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have other examples of success stories for everyone in the 
area of the environment.  One of them is the Montreal protocol of 
1987.  If memory serves me correctly, the member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis attended that conference as minister of 
environment for the province of Quebec in 1987.  He is saying 
yes, and that may explain why it was partially successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 we were faced with the issue of ozone depletion.  Let me 
point out to the leader of the Reform Party who went on ad 
nauseam about science that what he said tonight about science are 
things we heard only a few years ago about ozone depleting 
substances. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as 1985 we heard exactly the same thing coming from the 
naysayers who denied that there was any problem at all.  Now we 
are stuck.  Future generations of Canadians are stuck with a 
problem that is still going to be around in 50 years from now. 
Why?  Because there are a number of people who did not want to 
admit that there was a problem until they had the absolute, 
total truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  The smoking gun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  The smoking gun, the member for 
Davenport says as an example. I remember that.  They wanted the 
smoking gun.  They discovered the smoking gun in 1985 and now 
there is a number of people who think it was too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, the Montreal protocol was signed and there are very 
real examples of progress to follow with regard to what it has 
been able to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, one of the things done in the Montreal protocol 
was the recognition for the first time that developing countries 
and developed countries needed to be treated differently.  There 
was a very lucid view brought to the signing of that agreement in 
1987 to the effect that if we imposed on developing countries the 
same standards we were going to ask of developed countries, they 
would never live up to them, it would never happen; that it was 
wiser and better to actually impose and ask them to adopt a 
different schedule that was slower, but at least allow them to 
meet the targets.  That is what was done, and done successfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I remember about the Montreal protocol that was 
successful was the commitment to develop substitutes to ozone 
depleting substances like CFCs, thus the development in Canada in 
particular of HCFCs which, by the way, let us be very clear, are 
not pollution free products.  In fact, there are no pollution 
free products.  They do not exist.  But they were a substitute 
that was a lot less damaging than CFCs.  Real progress was marked 
and we were able to move from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the Montreal protocol on, we were able to make some real 
progress and today this is an issue that I think is well 
understood.  The science is well established.  It happened maybe 
a little too late.  It did happen too late, actually, for people 
who continued to be the naysayers, but here is an example where 
Canada, I am proud to say, played a very real role in bringing 
about an environmental agreement that worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true in the second example about sulphur dioxide 
emissions.  Do you remember, Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, 
what sulphur dioxide emissions are about?  I know the member for 
Davenport and also the member for Lac-Saint-Louis know what I am 
talking about.  I am talking about acid rain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Acid rain was probably the number one issue, one of the number 
one irritants between Canada and the United States in the 1980s. 
It was one of the top issues between the previous Conservative 
government and the Government of the United States from 1984 to 
1990.  I remember what was said in industry, much as the leader 
of the Reform Party said tonight, when confronted with the 
importance of our cleaning up our own house first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who were there will remember that Canada could only make a 
case to its southern neighbour if it started by cleaning up its 
own act.  So we had to make a commitment to reduce sulphur 
dioxide emissions at home, which we did in the signing of an 
agreement, if I remember correctly either in 1986 or 1987, 
committing us to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by 20%. Low and 
behold, if we went back and saw the record and the reaction of 
industry at the time, which I am sure was sincere, it said it 
could not be done, that this would kill jobs, that it would kill 
the economy.  Guess what.  It had exactly the reverse effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I want to be cautious.  My memory may not be exactly 
correct on this, but it was Inco in the region of Val D'Or in 
northern Quebec.  Through this commitment it was forced, coerced, 
into reviewing its production processes and by doing that not 
only did it reduce sulphur dioxide emissions, but it was able to 
reduce the cost of producing its product.  That is one of the 
consequences, one of the very positive consequences that emerged 
from that initiative.  Yet it was not described as that from the 
beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what we heard was very similar to what the leader of 
the Reform Party said tonight, the sky is falling, from the 
reverse side of the coin.  There is a real example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we went on from there to sign an agreement, the clean air 
agreement of 1990, with the American government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2045"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of acid rain is not solved, far from it.  We should 
debate that another day because there are issues on the horizon 
with regard to that agreement.  We certainly met our objective at 
the time.  We made progress since then.  We were proud of what we 
were able to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this language is not unparliamentary but it needs to be 
said because much like the leader of the Reform Party tonight, 
the American president at the time, Mr. Reagan, also said there 
was no acid rain problem.  Some members may remember because it 
was reported—I do not know whether it was true—that apparently 
the American president, Mr. Reagan, said that acid rain was 
caused by “duck shit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Natural Resources has said that though it may 
not be the best parliamentary language, he can live with it. 
Being at the cabinet table I will take his word for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that not remind us of how some political leaders can get 
embroiled in their own rhetoric and ignore the science or the 
basics?  Yet we had to persevere.  Yes, we did and we were able 
to come to an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak on the science aspect.  Let me be very clear 
that I am not a scientist.  In fact, when I was minister of the 
environment it was one of the most challenging areas for me to 
deal with.  Believe me, ministers who have been there know how 
tough a department it is.  It is a department that is on the 
cutting edge of science, of law and of public administration.  It 
is very challenging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are lucky in Canada because we have within the Department of 
the Environment some of the best scientists in the world.  We 
certainly have the best public servants in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a second to attest tonight that when we were in Rio, 
Canada's delegation was the best served delegation in the world 
with regard to its public servants.  Whether it was the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, CIDA, natural resources, energy at 
the time or the Department of the Environment, they represented 
the absolute best, no question asked, of public servants in the 
world.  It is still true today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When as a layman in the department I had to rely on them for 
science, I found them to be rigorous and honest in their 
assessment.  I also found it was very useful for me to have no 
knowledge of science, because by the time they explained it to me 
and I could figure it out I could explain it to anyone else. That 
was a real advantage for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On science, just to reassure Canadians, there is no one who 
takes it lightly.  We have in excess of 150 countries involved in 
the agreement signed in Rio.  Does anyone think for a second that 
all these countries got involved in it, not caring what the 
consequences would be and what it would lead to?  Of course not. 
I do not take it for granted that they were all right because 
they were all there, but I can report how the science was 
developed.  Again Canada was intimately involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a conference here in 1988 on the changing atmosphere 
in Canada.  From that conference emerged the commitment to put 
together an international panel on climate change, known as the 
IPCC, which then produced a report and followed it up with 
others.  The latest was in 1966 at the Geneva conference that 
resulted in the declaration calling for commitments to control 
emissions in a post-2000 era to be legally binding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conference also endorsed the IPCC climate change 1995 report 
which concluded that the balance of evidence—and the words here 
are carefully chosen—marks a “discernible human influence on 
the global climate”, which has a destabilizing impact on the 
globe's ecosystem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no one who ever pretended for a single second that the 
science in this regard was ironclad and absolute.  Rarely is the 
science on anything ironclad and absolute.  To pretend or imply 
that is the case is to deliberately mislead.  That should never 
be allowed to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that, I can certainly reassure Canadians we are working 
on very solid science that has been verified. 
I hear members of the Reform Party laughing.

other scientists we heard from recently who are still arguing 
that cigarette smoke is good for your health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could use exactly the same line, because there will always be 
a scientist somewhere who will say that smoking does not harm 
your health at all.  They are out there.  If he wants to line up 
with them as a member of the flat earth society, fine, but it 
speaks to those who continue to dwell in this paranoia.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the process that 
has failed and that preceded this conference on climate changes in 
Kyoto.  This in my opinion is where we find the greatest difference 
in approach between the current government and the Rio conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is well aware, she is present this evening, she 
was also in Rio at the earth summit, as was the current Minister of 
Finance. 
What I want to point out this evening is that in the months and 
years prior to the earth summit in Rio, the government of the day 
made a commitment to involve the main actors, the principal 
decision makers in the delegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did something fairly rare, we involved the provincial 
governments, environmental groups and the business community from 
the outset.  We opened wide the doors to permit access to all 
government officials.  We even involved municipal governments.  The 
minister will recall that the mayor of Montreal attended the earth 
summit in Rio along with other big city mayors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this approach we wanted to reflect the very nature of our 
federation in the decisions made in Rio.  There were four essential 
elements. 
There was what was termed Agenda 21, which was the basic document, 
the overall framework, making commitments on a number of subjects. 
There was also a proposal for a convention on climate changes, the 
topic this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a second convention proposed on protecting 
biodiversity.  The fourth document discussed at Rio was an 
agreement on forest management, which we wanted to see made into a 
convention, but there were objections by the developing countries 
when it came down to doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to ensure that Canada could exercise its full 
authority at Rio and use its influence to the maximum, we 
acknowledged right from the very start the importance of involving 
all stakeholders.  This was a wise decision for us, and I am very 
proud of that decision because it is an example of how Canadian 
federalism must operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much so, that we also decided, within that context, to have 
an open delegation, which is to say that ordinary citizens had 
access to public servants.  They could influence decisions, whether 
the department was Natural Resources, Energy, or Environment.  As 
well, these people were directly accountable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every morning at Rio, there was a meeting of the Canadian 
delegation.  Some mornings we were close to 200 people, with 
everyone taking part and being informed of the decisions of the day 
and the way we would be proceeding.  For us, and for Canada, this 
was an extraordinary experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are told—and I take this opportunity to clarify 
this—when somebody tells us that we made commitments at Rio and 
did not know what we were doing, that is false. The attitude of 
all countries in attendance at Rio in making commitments was “We 
don't know exactly how we will stabilize levels, but we are 
committed to taking precise steps in order to reach an assessment 
of the actions to be taken”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But to claim that in Rio we deliberately signed an agreement 
not knowing what we were doing, or misleading people into thinking 
we were going to do something when we did not know what, is false. 
It is completely false to make this kind of insinuation.  The 
members who were there know that it was a very open process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech a few minutes ago the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois illustrated just how open it was when he told us that 
only two governments in Canada ratified the agreement on climatic 
change.  In fact, it was three governments, because the government 
of which I was a member ratified it.  We were the first government 
in the world, among those who signed the Rio agreement, to do so. 
This Parliament was the first Parliament to ratify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were followed by the Government of British Columbia and the 
Government of Quebec. 
The Bloc Quebecois leader himself pointed this out.  I am sorry to 
turn his argument against him and I do not do so out of malice, but 
let us admit that it is hard to resist reminding Bloc members that 
this is one of the very successes of our federalism.  Here we have 
the proof, and he himself admitted that the approach we took in Rio 
made it possible for the Government of Quebec to participate fully 
in the decision, actually formally ratifying the treaty on climatic 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they remind us that only Quebec and British Columbia did 
so.  Surely there must be provincial governments in Canada that are 
less federalist than Quebec is now. This, for us, is a 
demonstration of what federalism can be when this kind of issue is 
tackled the way it must be tackled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry today to have to say the opposite.  For some reason 
I do not understand, and I really do not understand, I wonder why 
the provincial governments were not involved from the start.  I do 
not know why.  They should have been though.  The same applies to 
the private sector and environmental groups.  However, that is not 
what we feel.  In any case, if we are to believe the reaction of 
the people involved, this should not be the case.  I do not know 
about the environmental groups.  But the provincial governments 
were not involved from the start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only conclude this evening that, basically, the Liberals 
have reverted quickly to their usual style.  They do not tend to 
involve the provinces.  It does not come naturally to them. 
This is why we find ourselves in the rather awkward situation of 
having a federal-provincial conference a few days before the 
conference, with the Minister of the Environment and the Minister 
of Natural Resources in attendance.  I acknowledge their good 
faith, but we have to admit they got no help from their cabinet 
colleagues.  My sympathy.  It must be tough in cabinet.  I can see 
them around the table.  They raise their hands, and the Prime 
Minister gives them each a turn.  The Minister of the Environment 
probably said “Mr. Prime Minister, Kyoto is coming up”.  And the 
Prime Minister replied “Next item on the agenda.  We will get to 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am exaggerating a bit, but this cannot be far from reality. 
Otherwise, how do we explain that we are on the eve of an 
international conference with monumental consequences for Canada 
and we are so ill prepared.  It is a disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this is disastrous, not only disastrous politically, but 
also because it raises the following question: how are we going to 
implement the decisions taken at Kyoto, if the provincial 
governments are not fully involved in the debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the federal government were to come back to Canada 
with a commitment to a 20% reduction within ten years, if no 
provincial government is involved, nothing will happen, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very serious.  This government must, unfortunately, be 
told that the fault lies, in this connection at least, with the 
fact that there is a lot of catching up to do if we are to prove to 
Canadians that they are capable of making this federation move in 
the direction of real progress, so that an issue like climatic 
change can be successful. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we now look ahead to this conference and its results, it is 
very difficult for other parties in the House of Commons, given 
the lack of preparation, to give a commitment, to give a good 
sense of what Canada's commitment should be.  I am being very 
honest tonight as we try to assess ourselves.  We have been as 
honest and forthright as we can in trying to estimate what 
Canada's position should be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the lack of work done around this, it is going to be very 
difficult for anyone to put forward a position.  I thought the 
leader of the NDP was quite courageous tonight. She expressed the 
view that her party would support a 20% reduction in 1990 levels 
by the year 2005.  That is very ambitious.  I would beg to 
disagree with the leader of the NDP on that.  I would think given 
the circumstances and what we know, that is beyond what is 
reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party has shied away.  He is still 
arguing that there is a world plot against Canada. The skies 
probably let them figure that out, a world plot working against 
us.  Apart from that fact, he would probably defend that 
cigarette smoking is good for your health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also says that the government cannot make the difference 
between good and bad science.  One of the arguments he gave for 
that is that apparently there are very few science stories in the 
clipping service of the government.  Now there is a good 
scientific measurement.  There is a real test of absolute rigour. 
I hope no one from any other country is listening.  This is 
embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to congratulate him on developing the Meech Lake effect 
because the Meech Lake effect extends all the way into the Reform 
caucus.  Everyone will remember Meech Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party has made a career of arguing 
against the distinct society clause but he may not have picked 
this up.  The government has said a few times that the unique 
character clause means exactly the same thing as the distinct 
society clause and now he is in favour of the unique character 
clause.  I guess that is new science also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess we will leave him alone with the grand plot to unthrow 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to add in regard to the position that we in this party, 
in this caucus, will support the position that Canada should 
strive to stabilize its 1990 greenhouse gas emissions by the year 
2010 as was agreed to by the provincial governments, except for 
one provincial government, that of Quebec.  That is the position 
this government will bring into this conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We view this as being an interim position or a position that we 
take going into the conference that will be susceptible to change 
as Canada emerges from the Kyoto conference hopefully better 
enlightened about what the world community is ready to do and 
committed to develop a real action plan and not allow this issue 
again to go back to, not to put a pun on it, the back burner of 
the cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the things we would like to see this government speak to 
very clearly in regard to Canada's position are these few. First 
of all, much as we did in the case of sulphur dioxide emissions, 
which is a success story, that proves this can be done. We need 
to recognize that in Canada there has to be regional variances. 
The economy of Alberta is not the same as the economy of the 
province of Quebec.  We have to recognize these differences to 
allow each region of Canada to carry its fair share of the load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Canadian petroleum producers make the argument 
that part of the greenhouse gas emissions they produce, a good 
part of the increase is due to exports they send to the United 
States.  I think they make a very good case to the effect that 
the increase in economic activity happening in another country 
has had an effect on greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. In all 
fairness it should be recognized that they in that respect carry 
a heavier burden than other regions of Canada vis-à-vis the 
United States and there has to be some recognition of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the first principle we would like to see the government 
adopt as it goes to this conference and emerges with a position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second one has to do with joint implementation.  Here Canada 
should really lead the way.  Canada takes great pride in the role 
it plays in developing countries.  Here is a real opportunity for 
us to recognize that if we wanted to have the biggest bang for 
our buck in dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, if we wanted 
to have the most effect at the most rapid rate, we would 
certainly put the bulk of our resources in helping developing 
countries acquire basic technologies. 
We do not have to get the last version of the best high 
technology in the world, but basic technologies to help them 
diminish greenhouse gas emissions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing this we would help the cause in a way that would be 
measurable quite rapidly.  We would also help developing 
countries have a better environment within their own land mass 
and ecosystems.  We would also help them have more productive 
means of producing energy.  It makes sense all around.  It makes 
sense for us.  It makes sense for them.  This should be an issue 
on which Canada should lead in Kyoto on joint implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister will do that, that cabinet will press that 
and that the government will do it.  We will certainly back them 
up on this so that we can receive credits for the efforts that we 
were able to allow.  Again this will allow Canada to continue to 
play a lead role in the world in promoting these technologies 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third principle should be some flexibility also in the 
commitments we make. This is a little more complicated and it is 
new.  What we should strive for if we want an honest and lucid 
agreement is an agreement emerging from Kyoto that would allow 
some countries to have a different target and to vary that target 
given their own realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada in this respect is a very solid example.  Our land mass, 
our climate, the distances.  There are obvious reasons why we 
would produce more energy per capita than other countries in the 
world.  Given this reality, given the efforts that we are ready 
to put into this issue, there are good solid reasons why we could 
also have recognition of some differences and some variation in 
the commitments that different countries make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth principle is one I and my party are very interested 
in and which carries a great deal of potential.  That is the use 
of economic instruments.  Here we have to be clear. Economic 
instruments in the area of the environment embrace a broad range 
of tools, including carbon taxes to which we are opposed.  We are 
opposed to the use of carbon taxes.  Let me take a second to 
explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already use energy in our country for the purposes of 
taxation.  We hear our American neighbours talk about carbon 
taxes and they compare them to Canada and forget one essential 
element.  In the southern part of the United States and in most 
parts of the United States the gasoline at the pump is not used 
as a source of taxation.  In Canada it is. In this respect we 
could argue that we already have a carbon tax. Going that route 
from our perspective is certainly not the best idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there are many other instruments available to us, including 
tradable permits.  This is something rather difficult to 
understand for the public.  It was developed around the acid rain 
agreement on sulphur dioxide emissions.  Our American neighbours 
are using it.  I have heard that for the first time in the last 
few months these permits are actually being traded and profits 
are being made.  This seems to demonstrate at the outset that 
they will work.  I say seem to because it is very early in the 
area of tradable permits to determine whether they absolutely 
work, but they seem to carry a great deal of promise for reasons 
I believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are able to offer real economic incentives to deal with 
this issue, we will get results.  We live in a market based 
economy.  A market based economy works if it is directed toward 
incentives that allow and encourage people to be more efficient 
with the environment and with their greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tradable permits could very well and should be part of the 
initiatives that Canada embraces.  The American president in the 
statement on the American position has alluded to the fact that 
they are interested in such a system on a world basis.  We could 
certainly interpret from that that if he is interested in a 
tradable permit system on a world basis, geography being what it 
is, we happen to be neighbours and it would involve us. Certainly 
any initiative that goes beyond the United States will have a 
continental impact and we would be natural partners in 
implementing such a system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the minister to do that.  I encourage both 
ministers.  But I encourage you to start doing the homework 
because the government failed in doing its homework around this. 
You failed in doing the homework around this, Mr. Speaker.  Not 
you personally, Mr. Speaker.  I know you have been nodding 
incessantly since I have been talking, positively, and I thank 
you for that. 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Natural Resources should not assume 
that any movement of your head has the same significance for him 
as it would have for me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the government that on this issue it has 
certainly failed any reasonable test of following up on work that 
had been left behind.  There was a commitment that the 
environment and finance departments would produce a working paper 
on this.  The paper that was produced was quite weak. The 
introduction described the paper in very clear language, that the 
mandate was very narrow, and the work was quite weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be encouraged since others have taken up 
the cause.  The environmental commission in Montreal which was 
struck as a result of NAFTA has done some excellent work in this 
area.  That commission would be able to help all countries, 
especially the three NAFTA countries, to develop a tradable 
permit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, the government should get some recognition for the 
management of our carbon sink.  For those who are unfamiliar with 
a carbon sink, it is an ecosystem that is able to absorb carbon 
dioxide, our forests being an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best known carbon sink in the world is the Amazon forest, 
which we would feel very strongly about because we do not live in 
the Amazon.  There are people all over the world who would be 
very shocked at the idea that the Amazon forest would be cut 
down.  This would naturally preoccupy us since the Amazon 
represents the most important carbon sink in the world, although 
the oceans are also carbon sinks. Carbon sinks absorb carbon 
dioxide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's land mass contains 10% of the world's forests.  We have 
a responsibility in the management of our forests in terms of 
softwood lumber and other issues today and tomorrow for our 
children's sake, and for those who work in the industry. Canada 
has come a long way in the last few years in the way it manages 
its forests.  There is a lot of enlightened self-interest 
involved here also. Although I understand it will be difficult 
for us to get recognition for that, we should get some 
recognition for the carbon sinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have spoken about measures to get more economy out of the 
use of energy.  Efforts in that area will be spoken of.  Our 
environment critic, the member for Fundy—Royal, will speak on 
this issue.  He will detail some of the work we have done.  As 
someone said earlier, in the end this is not a partisan issue and 
I agree.  We wish the delegation well in Kyoto.  We did well in 
Rio.  We will do everything in our power to help advance this 
debate for the sake of doing what is right not only for our 
economy today but for future generations of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and

Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this special debate on 
climate change.  I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few 
words and to hear what other members of the House have to say as 
well.  I hope our overall discussion this evening will be useful, 
constructive and realistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is really another step among many, another phase in 
the ongoing public dialogue on the issue of climate change in 
which many Canadians have been thoughtfully engaged for a long 
time. Scientists, environmental experts, non-governmental 
organizations, think tanks, business leaders, industrial 
organizations, municipalities, federal, provincial and 
territorial officials, government ministers at all levels, 
individual citizens and consumers have all been advancing ideas 
and debating possible solutions. Our government has been 
participating throughout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many different and sometimes conflicting points of view have 
been put forward but despite the intensity of feelings on various 
sides, for the most part all of those participating in the public 
debate have tried to be reasoned and helpful.  I hope that spirit 
can prevail in this House as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need histrionics and hyperbole.  We do not need the 
verbal excesses and abuses which too often prevail in Parliament. 
What we do need is careful thought, common sense, a sense of 
common purpose and the will to pull together in a real and 
serious way to address what most of the world has identified as a 
genuine problem demanding an effective global solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The climate change challenge is especially perplexing for Canada 
because of some of the unique and, ironically, some of the most 
desirable features of our country, features like the sheer size 
of our land mass, the long distances and the tough topography 
over which we must transport our people and goods, the extremes 
of our weather conditions from 40° below to more than 40° above, 
our resource based, energy intensive and export oriented economy, 
an economy which is growing faster than the rest of the 
industrialized world, our record setting exports and our growth 
in population, the second highest growth rate among all developed 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of these Canadian characteristics contributes more to our 
national total of greenhouse gas emissions which in turn 
contributes to that discernible negative impact upon the climate 
which can be attributed to human conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In coming to grips with greenhouse gases and climate change, we 
in Canada have a difficult circle to square but that does not 
mean that we can ignore or deny the problem.  We cannot shrink 
from the challenge or shirk the responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the Leader of the Opposition tonight spend a good deal 
of his time condemning the national and international science 
upon which the concern about global warming is based.  The only 
logical extension of his reasoning is that Canada should go to 
Kyoto to prevent any agreement from being reached or, if one is 
reached, Canada according to him should opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may or may not agree with the science, but does he seriously 
contend that Canada can simply stand aside?  Ours is a more open 
society, a more open economy than most others in the world.  We 
are more dependent upon world trade and global economics than 
almost any other industrialized country.  Forty per cent of our 
gross domestic product is derived from exports.  Eighty per cent 
of our trade is with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is global momentum toward an outcome in Kyoto, an 
agreement including the United States.  In the face of that 
thrust, Mr. Speaker, with the greatest of respect, we do not have 
the luxury of simply holding up our hand and hollering “whoa”. 
We cannot say “Stop the world, I want to get off”.  What we 
need to do is to try our best to be constructively influential, 
to achieve the best possible result in Kyoto in concert with the 
rest of the world, a result that works for Canada and one that 
works for the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that the provinces and territories have 
adopted a constructive attitude in common cause to achieve that 
kind of outcome.  They have been very much involved with the 
Government of Canada in consultations over the last many months, 
not the least of which was the joint meeting of federal, 
provincial and territorial energy and environment ministers in 
Regina last month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and territories have acknowledged that Canada 
needs to be part of a realistic global agreement on climate 
change.  They have agreed that based upon the current 
understanding of Canadian circumstances and the current 
understanding of the state of international negotiations, it is 
reasonable to seek to reduce aggregate greenhouse gas emissions 
in Canada back to 1990 levels by approximately the year 2010. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and territories also agreed that it is desirable 
to do better than that if at all possible.  They have emphasized 
the need for flexibility, flexibility to take into account the 
inevitable give and take, the ebb and flow that is inherent in 
international negotiations and flexibility in terms of 
implementation techniques and methodologies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and territories also agreed on a collaborative and 
inclusive approach on implementation.  We need to make a solid, 
comprehensive team Canada effort.  We must all strive to be part 
of the solution.  We must all work very closely together as 
partners.  That is the provincial attitude overall and it is 
helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great many in the private sector, in business and industry 
have also worked very hard to be helpful and constructive.  They 
have not buried their heads in the sand.  They have not tried to 
deny reality.  They have offered useful ideas and advice and they 
have started to take concrete actions within their own sectors, 
organizations and companies to reduce emission levels and move 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector, the provinces and territories, a broad range 
of other stakeholders, indeed all Canadians have been invited to 
work closely with us to build together a sound and sensible 
implementation plan for the Kyoto agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has repeatedly reaffirmed that we are not 
interested in a carbon tax.  We are not interested in seeing any 
province or region or sector bearing a disproportionate burden. 
However, we are keenly interested in greater energy efficiency 
for vehicles, homes, buildings and industrial processes.  We are 
interested in the greater and more cost effective applications of 
renewable and alternative energy sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this week a groundbreaking agreement between Petro-Canada 
and Iogen Corporation will help us to move in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are interested in the implementation of co-generation 
projects and their integration into power grids.  We are 
interested in the very substantial acceleration of science and 
technology, commercialization and transfer, projects like the 
Ballard fuel cell, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are interested in the use of joint implementation schemes 
with other nations.  We are interested in the creation of credits 
and the trading of credits to recognize our relatively cleaner 
and lower carbon exports and our advanced technology.  We are 
interested in the broadening, deepening and strengthening of the 
self-initiated measures launched and pursued by business and 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These and perhaps other measures are likely to be part of the 
overall package.  Through extensive and exhaustive consultations, 
both within Canada and abroad, we have built a platform for the 
kind of meaningful partnerships that we will need in spades after 
Kyoto to deliver on our commitments.  We have positioned our 
country to build bridges of consensus internationally to 
facilitate an agreement when the end game of the global 
negotiations beings in earnest about 10 days from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a deal that works.  We want a deal that makes sense both 
environmentally and economically.  We want a deal that transforms

for technological sophistication and for trade.  We want a deal 
that is right for Canada and a deal that is right for the world.

a week from now to make a real difference for Canada and the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to the minister and would like 
to draw his attention to a program in 3,000 Toronto households. 
That program is called Green Saver.  It shows people how to 
improve home comfort, save on bills and reduce household energy 
consumption.  The green saver program works with clients and 
shows some improvement in terms of their individual homes.  It 
shows the impact on climate change and emissions.  They have 
documented the progress that individuals have been able to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the minister if individuals and communities with 
some assistance, acting on their own, can reduce greenhouse 
emissions, what is the federal government taking into the 
international forum to show how the federal government itself has 
been putting its house in order?  In other words, how can we show 
some of the efficiencies that we have done in our federal 
buildings and what can we take to that forum for discussion?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:</B>   Mr. Speaker, on the basic 
questions of can Canadians as individuals make a difference, I 
think the answer to that is profoundly, yes.  Indeed, when we 
hear some of the debate we may get the impression that the big 
enemy or the bad culprit is the upstream oil and gas industry in 
the country.  In fact, on the production side with respect to oil 
and gas, that sector would account for roughly 15% or 16% of 
emissions overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest part of the challenge here is not on the production 
side of the equation, it is on the use and the application side 
of the equation.  It is obviously necessary, important and 
possible for all players, whether they are in business or 
industry or in their own private residences, in community groups 
and organizations to participate and to make a very large 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referred to one very useful example. There are 
literally thousands of examples across the country where 
Canadians as individuals may be well ahead of their political 
process in grappling with the issue and developing innovative 
ideas that can truly make a contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important for us, as we have already begun to do, 
to make a complete inventory of all of those initiatives, to 
determine to what extent those initiatives can move forward and 
be successful on their own foundation without any kind of 
stimulation or encouragement and where, in the appropriate 
circumstances, would there need to be some kind of incentive that 
might come through the government sector or through a 
collaborative effort among organizations in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we will need a mix of instruments, some of them 
voluntary, some brought about by incentives and other forms of 
encouragement so that all Canadians can be actively engaged in 
building solutions. I think those individuals to whom the member 
just referred who are already active in this field in the city of 
Toronto deserve a great deal of praise and commendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In appropriate circumstances, yes, I believe there is a role for 
government incentives to encourage further and greater progress 
in that direction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the minister stated very properly that we should try not 
to be too partisan when discussing this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what he thinks of the stridently anti-intellectual 
comments of the leader of the fifth party when he was ridiculing 
other people's take on science.  I suspect the only physics that 
man ever took was Ex-lax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that I 
should comment on the biological theories of either party in the 
opposition.  I think they are perfectly capable of demonstrating 
their abilities in one way or the other in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, partisanship aside, the only point I would like to make 
is that this issue is real and it is serious.  It demands real 
and serious attention.  I hope that all members of the House, 
members of the other place and all Canadians will address it in 
that spirit so that we can at Kyoto and beyond Kyoto arrive at 
results that are good for our country and good in terms of our 
responsibility in the global community. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think the importance of this debate is being shown by the people 
who are addressing it tonight.  Two ministers, the leaders of all 
the opposition parties, shows the significance of the debate to 
the House and to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have to ask why we are having this debate when we are 
10 days away from Kyoto?  This should have happened a year and a 
half ago. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT91"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT91"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2130

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is asking for comments and advice from Canadians 
and from the other parties.  It is too late.  It is 10 days from 
Kyoto, and we are still waiting for the government's position. 
This is not the way to go to an international event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address some of the issues that have not been 
touched on so far.  I suppose if we had to pick a date 1990 would 
be as good as any.  I thought the minister was on the right line 
about a month ago when she said there had to be a formula to 
address Canada's particular conditions.  She withdrew her 
comments within a day.  Obviously some people in her caucus got 
to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a different country.  It has a smaller population and 
wide expanse.  It is a cold country.  If we compare the Europeans 
we do not try to lump Scandinavia in with Spain.  Yet, with 
Canada's expanse, we are trying to that.  That is incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be a formula to address a country's unique 
perspective, whether it be Australia, Canada or whatever.  It 
needs to be addressed so that 1990 can be picked as a date, 
wherever one is in the spectrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Canada has done a pretty good job in many areas. 
Other countries, particularly the European bloc, are at the 
beginning.  Why would we have one country up here on level of 
attainment compared to one below it?  There needs to be a 
balancing.  What I am suggesting is a level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That formula has not been addressed by the government.  I do not 
believe it will be addressed at Kyoto.  I think the President of 
the U.S. will address it because he wants to level the playing 
field.  I think that is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is that 35 of the 165-odd countries 35 will be 
asked to sign on.  This is a global problem which requires a 
global solution.  All the countries in the world going to the 
conference need to be part of the solution.  We cannot have 
Canada, for example, signing on to a particular agreement when 
Mexico, China and India, which will be major contributors to 
greenhouse gases in the future, are not being asked to sign on 
the dotted line.  Perhaps it should not be to the same degree as 
Canada but at least they should be asked to make a commitment. 
That commitment to my knowledge is not being asked for.  There 
has to be some agreement that gets all of us into the arena 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We keep hearing that Canada's problems are huge.  We need to 
bring into perspective that Canada is responsible for 2% of 
global emissions compared with the U.S. at 25% and China at about 
20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear the minister and the government say that Canadians 
have been consulted, that the provinces have been consulted.  The 
provinces were consulted in the last couple of months.  To my 
knowledge there has not been a broad cross-Canada forum for 
Canadians to address the issue; for Canadians to say yes, they 
believe there is a problem or no, they do not; or for Canadians 
to say the degree they would like to address it and to indicate 
some solutions.  Whatever the issues they should be bring them 
forward but a forum does not exist and did not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to Kyoto.  The government will come back with the 
solution, ram it down our throats and say “This is it, Canada; 
like or leave it”.  That is backward.  It is top down government 
instead from the bottom up.  The consensus of the players, the 
Canadian people, the provinces and the industry should be taken 
to Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was not consultation other than the last month, and I have 
to question that.  What happened two weeks ago in Regina?  The 
Minister of Natural Resources just commented on what a good deal 
that was.  However, to my knowledge only eight days later the 
Prime Minister was stating a different target.  The year 2010 was 
arrived at by the provinces; 2010 was the year the Prime Minister 
quoted to Premier Tobin and Premier Klein.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the commitment?  If this was a consensus or commitment 
as a result of the provinces and the Government of Canada working 
together, it did not last for eight days.  There is a huge 
credibility gap between the Prime Minister, who is taking the 
commitment to Kyoto, and the provinces that will have to 
implement it down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the economic analysis?  We can take various scenarios. 
We can take the emissions down to 2005, 2007, 2010 or 2015 and 
work out the different scenarios.  How do we get to them? How 
will we get the standards whether they be fuel taxes or voluntary 
commitments?  However we get there Canadians need to know the 
numbers.  We have yet to see an economic analysis from the 
government of the different alternatives, the different costs and 
who will pay them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has dropped the ball.  It is going to Kyoto 10 
days from now with a stance Canadians have yet to hear. That is 
not the way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully in the next couple of days we will hear it and we will 
be able to get on side.  I fear that the government will sign on 
to something in Japan, bring it back to Canada, and be forced to 
push it down the throats of Canadians.  I fear it will be a 
position we may not agree with.  I hope this can be avoided in 
the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would ask the hon. member for Nanaimo—Alberni the following 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has he not brought to the attention of his leader the 
statement made by the intergovernmental panel on climate change 
“Greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to increase and 
the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on 
global climate?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement was made by more than 2,000 experts worldiwide. 
participating in the drafting and reviewing of the 
intergovernmental panel report on climate change.  Why has the 
hon. member not brought this statement to the attention of his 
leader? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am delighted the hon. 
member for Davenport raised the panel on climate change made up 
of 2,500 renowned scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to listen to the government, we would get the 
impression that these 2,500 scientists were all using the same 
song sheet but they are not.  There is a vast difference of 
opinion in the climate change report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some sentences were politically written in the front summary by 
analysts for Vice-President Gore which do not reflect the inside 
of the report.  If we pick selective sentences from that summary, 
they can be exceedingly misleading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have a couple of questions for my hon. colleague.  I find a 
couple of points to be a bit confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that this was a global problem which 
required a global solution.  I do not understand.  Some of his 
remarks, and definitely those of his leader, actually refuted 
science and questioned whether the science actually existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would they recognize on the one hand that the science is 
questionable and then on the other hand come forward and say it 
is a global problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find rather confusing. Reform is all over the map on this 
issue.

would advocate taxing something that is not a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am surprised that we

Conservative Party who was in Rio and got us into this glue pot 
in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the member should hold on to the coattails of his

should listen to the Reform Party because the Reform Party is 
questioning the science.

on the bandwagon”.  This is not the time to jump on the 
bandwagon.  This is the time to question the science.

is from the east coast.  He knows what happened to the cod 
fishery.  The science that we were promised was okay in the late 
seventies, was okay in the early eighties and was okay in the 
mid-eighties.  We some the decimation of the cod fishery because 
the scientists were not allowed to put forward straight science. 
It was political science, and that is what we are listening to 
here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to briefly make a few comments on speeches that have 
been made so far.  I congratulate the Minister of the Environment 
for her thoughtful intervention, for her emphasizing the 
importance of harnessing innovation, and for bringing to the 
attention of members of the House the situation in the Mackenzie 
basin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Natural Resources made an intervention 
indicating to us what is the composition of the package that 
Canada will bring to Kyoto.  Evidently, when it comes to dealing 
with distant deadlines, it is quite understandable that 
governments would want to make their position known when it is 
very close to the deadline of the event.  Therefore it is not a 
question of Canada going empty handed to Kyoto.  It is just doing 
its homework very thoroughly.  The speech of the Minister of 
Natural Resources is an indication that the package will be a 
thoughtful and fairly comprehensive one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 45 minutes we were treated to the unique review of the issue 
by the Leader of the Official Opposition.  It was unique for its 
sequence of asinine statements, the like of which we have not 
heard in the House for a long time.  He trotted out all the 
cliches that have been heard over the last 10 years on the issue. 
Having mentioned a couple of U.S. scientists who have doubts 
about the question of whether or not there is a climate change in 
place or in action evolving on the face of the planet, he 
concluded that actually we had to be sceptical, that we could not 
accept the science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I just indicated to the Member for Nanaimo—Alberni, some 
2,500 scientists, worldwide experts, participated in drafting and 
reviewing the second report of the intergovernmental panel on 
climate change of December 1995. Their conclusion in two lines is 
simply that the greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to 
increase and the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human 
influence on global climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To prove that the Leader of the Official Opposition did not do 
his homework properly, he made the capital mistake of quoting a 
witness who appeared before the Standing Committee on Environment 
and Sustainable Development, Dr. Allyn Clarke, and did not quote 
his conclusion.  He chose to quote the opening remarks but failed 
to tell the House that the very same person concluded on that 
occasion that climate change must be taken seriously.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, but he also asked the committee to pay attention 
to the work done by oceanographers and sought support for their 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidently the basis of information and research on the part of 
the people who are advising the leader of the Reform Party is 
very thin, if not very shaky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he ran out of arguments about the question of the 
scientific validity of this issue, what did he do?  He invoked 
the spectre of taxes, which is always done when arguments run 
out, when short of convincing themes.  Then the flag of possible 
potential taxes is waved.  This is totally absurd in this 
political debate tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party just said a 
few moments ago, we have plenty of carbon taxes already imposed 
on gasoline at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to deal with gladiators who are ignorant 
and we have too many in this House of Commons.  Speakers after 
the leaders of the various parties have only 10 minutes to deal 
with uninformed, ignorant and distorted information as was done 
tonight, unfortunately, by the leader of the Reform Party, thus 
contributing really nothing to the substance, to the search for 
answers on this extremely complex issue that is engaging the 
minds of scientists, of politicians of course, of decision makers 
and of governments around the world. Enough said about the 
pathetic performance by the leader of the Reform Party.  What a 
shame I must say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is posing to us a number of interesting conclusions. 
Let me put the first one. The conclusion that one inevitably 
comes to when analysing this issue is that here there is, in a 
very rare moment, a rather unique convergence of economic and 
environmental goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy can only benefit from energy efficiency.  The 
economy can only benefit from energy innovation and the economy 
can only benefit from prolonging the life of the reserves we have 
in our country through more careful consumption now and in the 
near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This convergence is unique.  It is good business to apply energy 
efficiency and innovation and it is also good environmental 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this issue offers us a unique opportunity to switch, 
gradually of course, from the use of oil to the use of natural 
gas with which we are abundantly endowed and which is an ideal 
fuel for its high calorific value because it is also clean.  It 
is efficient in use and available in large quantities, 
particularly in our western provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, this issue is indicating the urgent need for us to 
examine tax expenditures, fiscal and taxation measures, either 
direct or indirect, subsidies, you name it, which presently are 
offered to the petroleum, the oil sands and the coal industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask ourselves do these particular measures make sense 
when we are trying to move in a direction whereby we want to 
discourage, gradually, the use of these fossil fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, this issue offers us a unique opportunity to examine and 
change our transport policies.  Our transport policies are in 
urgent need of being redesigned because we have to link them to 
the aim of reducing greenhouse gases, to their reduction, 
wherever possible, particularly with respect to the potential 
offered in this country which is far from being achieved, namely 
public transit.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, this brings to our attention, in a frustrating manner 
actually, the issue which can be witnessed by anyone who watches 
landfill sites which are emitting greenhouse gases, the burning 
away of waste gases, mostly methane, instead of being utilized 
for district heating purposes, as it is done in many other 
jurisdictions, particularly the highly populated jurisdictions of 
Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, this issue brings to our attention with crystal clear 
evidence the necessity of giving momentum to and paying much more 
attention to renewable sources of energy.  They were recognized 
in the last two budgets but we are far from having given them the 
favourable tax treatment which is presently being given to the 
non-renewable sources of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the unique model comes to our attention when we are looking 
for answers to this particular issue, the unique model offered by 
the Toronto Atmospheric Fund whereby the municipality has adopted 
a number of energy efficiency and innovation measures in the 
public and private sectors which have now made Toronto the leader 
in this respect in the reduction of greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, let me indicate that this issues also reminds us of 
the poverty issue in developing countries and of the necessity to 
improve, accelerate and strengthen the efforts of the developed 
countries in reducing poverty in order to come to grips with this 
very complex and far reaching issue.

item which I hope the government will pay close attention to.  It 
was the proposal put forward by the leader of the fifth party 
concerning tradable emission permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind him and the government that when one sets up a system 
of tradable permits of a limited stock, and as the leader of the 
fifth party says, they are starting to trade at a profit, the end 
result is they end up in fewer and fewer hands. Competition in 
the economy is therefore reduced and the ends are not necessarily 
achieved.  Something which is a permit to pollute basically takes 
on a tremendously large value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government, before it goes down that road, to consult 
with municipalities across this country that are desperately 
trying to get out of exactly that same system. That is precisely 
what has happened.  Competition has disappeared.  More and more 
of the resource has been concentrated in fewer and fewer hands 
and nobody benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the member for Davenport, he and I had the privilege during 
the 34th Parliament of working on a series of reports on our 
planet.  They were all put together at the end of that Parliament 
by the committee in a compendium that I would recommend highly, 
particularly to the members of the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to some of the comments made in that report 
about the situation the globe faces.  I want to quote from the 
president of the World Watch Institute: “On the environmental 
front the situation could hardly be worse.  Every major indicator 
shows a deterioration in natural systems. Forests are shrinking, 
deserts are expanding and crop lands are losing top soil.  The 
stratospheric ozone layer continues to thin.  Greenhouse gases 
are accumulating.  The number of plant and animal species is 
diminishing.  Air pollution has reached health threatening levels 
in hundreds of cities and damage from acid rain can be seen on 
every continent”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maurice Strong said: “If we continue our present course, life 
as we know it will not survive the 21st century.  Indeed, our 
grandchildren, even in this blessed nation, will be experiencing 
a very severely deteriorated quality of life if we continue on 
our present course.  The course we are on is like a cancer, 
headed for terminality.  We simply cannot survive the pathway”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member for Davenport would care to comment on 
whether he feels the situation on the globe has changed in the 
now nearly six years since our last report on global climate 
change was produced in that committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>    Madam Speaker, the short answer is 
yes.  We have noticed in a variety of ways the deterioration of 
natural systems. That is the reason why we have at the present 
time a world commission on forest and sustainable development. 
That is why we have disputes in fisheries on the east coast and 
on the west coast. That is why there is the emerging issue of 
water in many populated countries. That is why we are engaged 
tonight in this issue which is part of an overall deterioration. 
This is why in the 1980s we had to deal with the question of the 
ozone layer and the damage to it which, as the leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party said, has been one of the success 
stories so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is deterioration and we cannot hide our heads in the sand, 
as the Reform Party seems to be inclined to do. We have to look 
at the issue and boldly make certain difficult decisions that 
have to do with the long term.  Governments must make decisions 
relating to the long term. Evidently it is not an easy matter. 
This will be the test of openness and the farsightedness of this 
government in coming to grips with this, probably one of the most 
difficult long term issues.

five-minute speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Does the hon. member have 
the unanimous consent of the House to divide his speaking time with 
his colleague from Portneuf? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today 
to speak on this important subject of climatic change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With only a few days left until Kyoto, it was high time for a 
debate in the House of Commons on this issue, which is of such 
vital importance for the quality of life of future generations. 
It is about this conference, which is vital to our future, that I 
want to speak to you today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday, Environment Canada released the troubling results 
of a study that took six years and cost over $80 million.  This 
study revealed that we must expect a higher mortality rate and an 
increase in the number of diseases if something is not done right 
away to slow down global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This study also pointed out that certain species, whether 
vegetable or animal, will actually be threatened with extinction. 
According to the same source, the average temperature in Canada 
will increase by 3 to 6 degrees Celsius for the eastern and western 
extremities of Canada, and by 4 to 6 degrees Celsius for the 
central part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anticipated effects for Canada as a whole are disastrous. 
Scientists predict an increase in the frequency and intensity of 
storms, serious consequences for health, economic sectors, 
forestry, agriculture and fishing, and a significant impact on 
human health in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These serious phenomena are caused by the increase in 
greenhouse gas emissions.  These gases prevent the sun's heat from 
returning into space and cause a gradual rise in temperatures.  The 
large scale use of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and, to a lesser 
extent, natural gas produces these gases that cause the greenhouse 
effect responsible for global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week, delegates from over 150 countries will begin 10 
days of negotiations in Kyoto, Japan. 
Representatives of Canada and of Quebec will have to reach 
agreement with other nations at the conference on an international 
reduction objective.  The Bloc Quebecois was the first political 
party in Ottawa to take a clear stand on the need to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chrétien government has known since the Berlin conference, in 
1995, that it would have to make a commitment at this conference, yet it 
did not take the necessary steps to prepare Canada for this important 
world summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, Canada is the only country among the seven most 
industrialized countries that has not made its position public in 
preparation for the negotiations. This is unacceptable, since Canada is 
the second largest producer of carbon dioxide per capita in the world 
after the U.S. In fact, we share this responsibility with all 
industrialized countries, which produce 80% of all greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is waving the spectre of taxes hikes and fuel 
price increases to get us to do less than the U.S. Still facing a 
credibility problem, strangely enough, it is painting an even bleaker 
picture than the petroleum lobby in the United States with its 
statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such short-sighted vision does not serve the interests of anyone in 
Canada. What is at stake, in terms of our environment and our economy, 
is so important that it requires vigorous action on this issue. That is 
why the Bloc Quebecois believes that the federal government must 
formally make strong greenhouse gas reduction commitments at the Kyoto 
conference scheduled for next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must acknowledge the fact that its current 
greenhouse gas reduction strategy has failed and act accordingly. 
Only by setting meaningful goals promoting a significant reduction of 
carbon dioxide emissions will the government confirm its willingness to 
address this serious problem. The provinces, particularly major 
polluters, must also pledge to do more in this area. The Canadian 
position must go further than the variable rate formula proposed by the 
Japanese. According to this formula, and given its size, population and 
climate, Canada should achieve reductions of 2.3% by the year 2010. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, this objective is far from that of the European Union, 
which we should try to reach, to the extent possible, but it does take 
the Canadian reality into account. This is the Bloc Quebecois' position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the Liberal government do, just days before the deadline? 
Cabinet ministers are very divided on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will say once again that global warming is a major 
issue for my generation. Young Quebeckers want to live in a prosperous 
and environmentally responsible society, something to be achieved 
through sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Madam

parties in the House and I think you would find consent from all 
sides to send the pages home if it has not already been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
a comment to which the member can respond.  We touched several 
times on the topic of tradable credits tonight.  The member for 
Sherbrooke mentioned that in his speech.  He said that tradable 
credits are new and are just starting to be traded, even though 
they were traded as long ago as 1990 in the United States at a 
time when he was Minister of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something missing from the equation in our business 
cycle, that is, the costs of polluting.  Often we do not try to 
put a number on that.  This is the problem with industrial 
structure. We do not have a cost of pollution.  The notion of 
tradable credits allows us to recognize there is a cost to 
pollution which requires companies to buy these credits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some interesting things have happened recently in the United 
States.  These credits are now traded on the Chicago Board of 
Trade.  Environmental groups like Greenpeace are buying them. 
They are removing these credits which limits the ability of these 
companies to pollute.  The object of the exercise is to give 
companies an incentive not to pollute by developing new 
technologies to reduce their emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member think about that kind of concept?

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Madam Speaker, as we have always said, the 
important thing is to invest in renewable technologies. This is what is 
important and what must be reflected in the Canadian position. We must 
have an energy policy that will allow us not only to reach our 
environmental goals, but also to maintain a degree of economic growth. 
I truly believe that this can be achieved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B>  Madam Speaker, we have 
a big problem.  When I say we, I am not talking about the Ottawa 
area, Quebec City or Vancouver, but about the planet itself.  We 
have a big problem because, since the onset of industrialization, 
we have been burning more of all sorts of things.  We have been 
burning oil, wood, coal, and alcohol.  We have been burning all 
sorts of things and this gives off carbon dioxide, a very simple 
gas but one with the incredible property of holding heat around the 
planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we trace 1,000 years of history with respect to carbon 
dioxide?  We have only to look at ice samples trapped in glaciers 
for this period of time to see that historically the planet has had 
approximately—and here I am referring to a chart—280 parts per 
million of carbon dioxide. 
This keeps us very comfortable on our planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With industrialization, we have doubled the number of parts 
per million.  This means that the planet is turning into a Thermos 
bottle and that the rays of sun that enter the atmosphere are not 
leaving at the same rate they used to.  We are going to get fried 
if we are not careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have much time left to take action?  I would say we 
should have done something about twenty years ago to avoid the 
worst.  Already we should be getting ready for important climate 
changes in 20, 30 or 40 years.  We are perhaps already experiencing 
these climate changes, which create hurricanes, flooding, or very 
disturbing seasonal variations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that Quebec and Canada on their own cannot 
change the equation significantly.  Our contribution is important, 
but it is not the only one. 
Canada as a whole emits 2% of these greenhouse gases, which means 
that the rest of the planet—and we can think particularly of the 
industrialized countries such as the United States—emits the other 
98%.  That is why Kyoto is so important.  That is why there must be 
an international agreement between all countries, in order to 
reduce these emissions, which are creating a sort of Thermos bottle 
effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not be easy.  I would even venture to say that it is 
very late in this planet's time line, but it is very important.  I 
would urge all those who are listening at home and understand what 
I have to say, not to hesitate to contact their MPs and to ask them 
to ensure that Canada does everything within its power to reduce 
greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are considerable variations within Canada.  Quebec 
produces around 9 tonnes of gas per inhabitant.  That is a lot. 
This means that, by using electricity produced by a thermal plant, 
gasoline in my car, and a variety of other products, including 
clothing containing plastics, I am causing nine tonnes of CO2 or 
related gases to be produced.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Alberta, however, with the industries being what they are, 
the figure is 56 tonnes per person.  That is six times more than 
the figure for Quebec.  From sea to sea, people must become aware 
and we must lower our production of greenhouse gas.  We must set 
the example so that other countries will follow and we can avoid 
the worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst occurs when there is no more snow on ski hills in 
Quebec.  The worst occurs when the prairies can no longer produce 
wheat.  The worst occurs when we are invaded by all sorts of 
insects and diseases carried along by the increased temperatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you do not need convincing, Madam Speaker, but I hope 
our viewers tonight will understand the importance of this debate.

<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, over the next 
century global temperatures are predicted to undergo change 
greater than any seen in the past 10,000 years.  This will create 
a chain reaction, impairing the Earth's hydrology, geochemistry 
and botany.  As a result, planetary aquatic and terrestrial life 
forms will be stressed, economic, industrial and commercial 
activities will be challenged, and socio-political relationships 
will be strained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with concerted substantive action today we will see a 
doubling of CO2 in the next century.  Even with stabilization by 
2010 it will still take a significant timeframe to rid the 
atmosphere of the greenhouse gases to the point where the current 
rise in global temperatures is restored to a level decreed in the 
UN framework convention on climate change 1992.  It stated that 
such a level should allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to 
climate change to ensure that food production is not threatened 
and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Roger Street, one of the editors of Environment Canada's recent 
“Canada Country Study” said that climate is a key defining 
variable for Canada, it defines our social and economic 
well-being.  Natural processes are inextricably linked and when 
one fundamental piece, like climate, is so dramatically altered, 
no other natural process is immune. With that fact in mind and to 
paraphrase Mr. Street, our social and economic well-being will be 
altered as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear that our institutions, political, economic and social, 
have not kept pace to adequately respond to the changes we have 
created in our natural environment.  Our ability to mitigate 
harmful human interference and adapt to negative impacts of 
climate change is seriously hampered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural laws are immutable.  There is nothing we can do as 
legislators in this place, pass laws, make policy and act on 
these, that could ever supersede nature.  When we attempt to do 
so, we put at risk the health and well-being of all of the 
Earth's community, including ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must learn our lesson from climate change.  We must legislate 
and govern as if the Earth mattered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we cannot fool nature, we must accept that action be 
realistic and effective in actually dealing with the issue of 
global climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eyes of the world will be on Kyoto next week as 
representatives from the planet's governments convene to 
negotiate an agreement.  There are many proposals for reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions.  We should acknowledge the effort put 
forward by the nations of the world in recognizing the 
seriousness of the problem and their willingness to propose 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is concern however that some of the solutions have 
loopholes attached, loopholes which would exclude HFCs, PFCs and 
SF6, which are rapidly growing and could contribute at least 5% 
more to greenhouse gas emissions. Other loopholes would inflate 
the baseline year emissions thus making it appear easier for 
countries to achieve stabilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever legally binding agreement is negotiated at Kyoto, it 
must be clear, express and provide targets and criteria to repair 
damage to natural systems.  Not paper reductions but real 
reductions that can be measured by nature's account balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important than Kyoto however is what we do after in Canada. 
Climate change is a global issue, but the dialogue and action 
begins at home.  We have a duty.  The duty is to engage 
Canadians. 
The solutions to address climate change exist.  They exist in our 
homes, communities, office towers, shop floors, classrooms and 
labs and they exist here in this place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public and private sectors and individual Canadians and 
their communities must all make a fair contribution to solving a 
problem of climate change.  We must build on the exemplary work 
of the Canada Country Study.  It is the first ever national 
assessment of the social, biological and economic impact of 
climate change, which includes regional studies, sectoral 
analysis and reports on cost cutting issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada brought together experts from government, 
industry, academia and non government organizations to complete 
this study.  The Canada Country Study tells us that impacts will 
range in both degree and variability, depending on the region of 
the country and the economic sector.  Make no mistake, all parts 
of Canada, all Canadians will be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, utilities, energy 
extraction and production and industrial and commercial 
residential sources vary from region to region depending on 
predominant economic activities.  Any realistic post-Kyoto 
implementation strategy should include a range of mitigation 
measures reflecting the diversity of Canada's regions and 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy efficiency is crucial to the reduction of greenhouse 
gases.  Energy efficiency and conservation initiatives 
implemented by Natural Resources Canada from 1990 to 1995 
resulted in energy savings of approximately $4 billion a year to 
the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector must be encouraged to increase energy 
efficiencies.  A number of initiatives currently exist and must 
be expanded.  For example, insurance companies are starting to 
offer energy savings insurance policies to commercial and 
municipal operations to provide their lenders with security for 
the repayment of energy saving building retrofits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Engaging Canadians individually and in their communities is 
central to achieving greenhouse gas reductions.  The Ontario 
Green Communities program is a community success story.  Green 
communities are community based, non-profit, multi-partner 
environmental organizations.  They achieve results by mobilizing 
community co-operation and providing practical services and 
advice.  The mission of green communities is to build sustainable 
communities by conserving resources, preventing pollution and 
protecting and enhancing natural ecological processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year with the support of Environment Canada, the Green 
Communities Association launched a national initiative to promote 
the establishment of new community based networks across Canada 
to build national partnerships and establish a national alliance. 
A significant component of their activities is the residential 
retrofit program which will help engage Canadians in the 
reduction of greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another success story is the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities 20% Club.  Members of the 20% Club bring national 
objectives on climate change together with local voluntary 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government plays a pivotal leadership role in 
engaging Canadians, communities, industry, along with the public 
sector in the national effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Environment Canada's community based programs involve Canadians 
at the community level.  Their support of the Green Communities 
Association means Canadians can increase awareness of climate 
change and contribute to the betterment of the natural 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada's Canada Country Study involved hundreds of 
Canadians in the assessment of socioeconomic impacts of climate 
change.  The shift to energy efficiency can be accelerated by 
fiscal policies that support and encourage residential and 
commercial retrofit, the development of renewable and alternative 
energy and increased usage of natural gas. These policies can be 
financed by shifting funds away from fiscal initiatives that 
encourage perverse ecological subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy efficiency activities are job creators.  The shift to 
this sector would encourage technological innovations to flourish 
in environmental industries that will increase trading 
opportunities for Canadian firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This a win-win agenda.  It is an agenda that engages all 
Canadians in the very important national effort to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.

Canada we do not have an investment within our own domestic 
efforts.  I will come back to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the tradable permits.  That is a major discussion 
at the international table.  We cannot hide from that.  It is 
being discussed by all the nations of the world.  Tradable 
permits are putting a carbon value.  However, it is a negative 
value, but it is going to be a polluter pays.  It is a short term 
measure until we clean up our lifestyle.  It is an instrument to 
get us on the right track.  We are at a crossroads here.  The 
journey started in Rio.  We have not done anything yet, but Kyoto 
is going to be a crossroads on which way we are going to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about sinks, it is a carbon reservoir. As the hon. 
member from the Conservative Party mentioned, the whole equator 
and rain forest is a major sink but we also have the Boreal 
forest which is a major sink.  Internationally what they are 
recognizing as sinks are manageable forests, not wild forests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is speaking on behalf of our bogs and muskegs in the back 
woods of our country which are not manageable?  It is beyond 
imagination to manage the northern Churchill area because it is 
beyond manageable or economic effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other aspect is how many greenhouse gases are in this 
negotiation?  Three as presently in the agreement or a total of 
six?  There are six gases that should be discussed, not just 
three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, this is the international draft.  It is 
happening.  It is at the international table.  We never heard 
about it.  The CBC or CTV, the national media outlets that we 
depend upon, do not even have an outlet in Japan. 
They do not even have a correspondent in Japan to let us know 
what the negotiations have been in Tokyo, Bonn or anywhere else 
in the world.  The media plays an important part.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Domestically, I call on the government to talk about a national 
atmospheric fund, a major revolving fund in this country, as a 
challenge of consciousness.  We spend about $600 million as a tax 
incentive for the oil sands industry.  Why could we not put $600 
million on a revolving fund to lever atmospheric positive 
measures for good energy use, a good livelihood, good perceptions 
by the media, good initiatives given by municipalities, large or 
small and maybe the automobile industry?  Maybe some day we will 
have a Canadian automobile, one we can truly call our own which 
will be environmentally friendly.  Let us challenge ourselves. 
Let us challenge our intellectual and engineering communities. 
Let the industries put their minds and money toward this as well, 
not just take the profits and run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should revisit the incentives and the tax breaks that 
we give to major industries and make sure they are put in an 
appropriate place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of preserving our forests, there are forests in the 
province of Manitoba.  When a forest fire makes a major break, it 
is left to burn because there is no commercial forest there. 
There is no dollar value on the northern boreal forests.  Why not 
put the forest fire out, giving employment to the people who live 
up there and preserving the sink?  It is releasing carbon as it 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transitional funding is a major issue.  It has to be addressed 
through Human Resources Development or the industry.  There will 
be transitions in training for the workforce of the future. There 
is going to be transitional funding for industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment raised the issue of the coal 
industry.  There is not going to be a total eradication of the 
coal industry immediately, which is the conclusion that everyone 
jumps to.  It may be a slow generational process by the next 
generation of workers to look at a different industry.  It is not 
wholehearted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at the international negotiations like a bubble.  The 
European Community, which is a huge trading block of common 
currency, has now described itself as a bubble.  Japan pointed 
out that France does not have to cut its emissions for the next 
15 years because they will be getting credits from other nations 
within the European Community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a bubble in itself.  Alberta and Saskatchewan and the 
coal industries in Nova Scotia should not be afraid because we 
have to address this as a nation, not by regions.  We have to do 
it as a collective effort for humankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. leader of the opposition mentioned a very precious 
species in his perspective is the taxpayer.  I think all species 
should be considered, not just the human species, but all living 
species.  The humans of this world also live on the living beings 
of this earth.  There are living beings in the oceans and in the 
air, truly the gift of mother earth.  That is what we are taking 
care of and that is what the future of generations to come will 
depend upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to call it the term of greed, which in my language 
is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's note:  Member spoke in Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are greedy, when we want something so much, that is 
sinful.  In that perspective I would like to call on the 
conscience of all the people of Canada, the people who are 
listening out there to be aware of the issue of climate change. 
There are disruptions.  We just had a temperature of plus 10 
degrees Celsius in downtown Saskatoon the other day.  That is a 
major disruption. We will never know what the full effects will 
be on the economy, or on our health as scientists are telling us. 
We just have to look at it and take on the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figure of 20% by the year 2005 was an achievable goal a few 
years ago.  Now we have increased 13%.  I call on all Canadians 
to take on the leadership, go to Kyoto and when we come back the 
race will be on.  It started in Rio.  It does not start next 
month.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate my colleague from Churchill River for 
some extremely insightful and timely remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to request unanimous consent to split both my time 
and question period with the member for Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have the consent of the House to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Thank you for the consent.  I happen to 
think this is a good speech but I am sure you did not want to 
hear it twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity to speak about this important topic 
and would like to congratulate all parties for the co-operative 
effort that resulted in this debate being possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the consequences of atmospheric change, I hold the 
opinion, and I will preface this by admitting freely that I have 
absolutely no scientific background, but I hold a rather 
simplistic view that non-sustainable practices are going to catch 
up with us in a number of significant areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone is waiting for indisputable empirical confirmation of 
the problem, I would suggest that they will be waiting a long 
time because nature does not speak through science.  She speaks 
through symbols and signals, like climate change, like increased 
acidity in water systems, depleted resources, the extinction of 
species and any number of other signs directly linked to 
environmental degradation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has shown signs of enlightenment specifically 
in two of the three <I>r's</I>, reduce and recycle.  It has 
effectively reduced its credibility on this issue to zero and its 
stated position so far has contained 95% recycled material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to supporting research and simple observation, we 
can also see confirmation of the problem from the corporate 
sector.  The insurance industry, a sector that survives with the 
successful calculation in management of risk is all over this 
issue like a cheap suit.  The very real threat of claims 
involving too much water, too little water or water at the wrong 
times of year have set this industry on its ear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I readily admit that I could not tell the difference 
between CO2 and CO1, I do know that money does not talk, it 
swears.  I need no further proof that we have an impending 
problem.  I also believe that this is just the tip of the melting 
iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My greatest fear is that this argument, which is not unlike the 
one that plagued progress on smoking legislation, will delay 
action at the expense of future generations.  I feel we have a 
moral obligation to address these issues in a responsible, 
logical, timely and co-operative manner.  The clock is ticking 
and the earth is warming and we are not going to get too many 
chances at successful intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important is not our position going in to Kyoto.  It is 
the nature of the agreement coming out.  Simply reducing the 
argument to green versus growth may be strategically sound but it 
shows a fundamental lack of knowledge on the issues involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly growth strategies and the pursuit of wealth do nothing 
to help the environment.  I am not saying growth is bad.  What I 
am saying is that unless we discover life on another planet, in 
the long term it is a dead end street.  It is in the long term 
interest, the environmental interest, economic interest and 
social interest of all Canadians that we lead the world in the 
adjustment to this new economy.  We certainly need to strike a 
balance between short and long term interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge we collectively face as politicians is this. 
Addressing these issues is going to involve leadership.  It is 
going to involve increased levels of co-operation.  It is going 
to involve making decisions with the goal of improving the human 
condition for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being asked to take a certain amount of risk to effect 
change in a world in which we will have no direct share.  The 
potential Kyoto agreement is an excellent start and will serve to 
jump start an upward spiral of net economic gain through the 
adoption of sustainable practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it becomes clear that our country and indeed our 
planet is faced with a number of environmental problems that are 
paralyzing policy makers by both the severity of their 
implications and by the complexity of the measures necessary to 
solve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not unlike the mythical Medusa.  If we stare at this 
problem, it is paralyzing in its scope. Perseus managed to slay 
this demon by using a shield to reflect the image.  I would like 
to suggest that we let our shield be the ingenuity, creativity 
and co-operative spirit of the Canadian people, of Canadian 
industries and I dare say Canadian politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave members with this final thought.  If not Canada, 
who?  And if not now, when?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise tonight to speak on this very important issue 
affecting all Canadians and indeed all people in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a snowy night in Ottawa global warming may not seem to be an 
issue of concern but I can assure you it is and members in this 
House know that it is. We know that almost 90% of Canadians 
believe that climate change is already occurring or will occur in 
the very near future.  So this is indeed of great concern to all 
of us as Canadians and to all of us in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists are noting subtle yet significant changes in our 
environment and the effect of this over time could seriously 
damage our forests, our agriculture and our fresh water supply. 
It could also lead to the extinction of species, including polar 
bears, musk ox and caribou.  Moreover it is no secret that a 
warming climate caused by greenhouse gases will lead to more 
illness and death in the next century unless steps are taken now. 
All of this I find most worrisome, as do all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that nine of the earth's warmest years since 
1861 occurred after 1980.  Each year the burning of fossil fuels 
introduces 22 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere.  While Canada may not be the largest polluter 
overall, we are the ninth largest.  We have the second highest 
rate of greenhouse gas emissions per person.  Since 1990 these 
emissions have increased by 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The science of climate change is sound and it is compelling. 
Although we do not know everything, what we do know is more than 
enough to warrant responsible cost effective investment to 
address the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The global climate is warming at a more rapid rate. This is due 
in large measure to a dramatic increase in the volume of 
greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere.  The issue of global 
climate change is very important in the upcoming conference in 
Kyoto, Japan.  Representatives from around the world will meet to 
put in place a plan to deal with that change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs to and will push for new meaningful, realistic and 
equitable legally binding targets to limit greenhouse gas 
emissions.  This will be done by developing Canada's position on 
climatic change with partners from all across Canada, provincial 
governments, municipal governments, industry and non-governmental 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position must be, and must be perceived to be, fair among 
all regions, provinces and industries.  We will endorse emission 
targets that can be realistically achieved on a step by step 
basis.  We must do this because Canada must be part of the 
international solution.  To do otherwise would be untenable and 
irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians must be engaged in this debate.  Canadians need to 
understand the science of climate change, the resources and the 
measures which have been taken to date and what actions they can 
take to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. 
Overcoming this problem will not be possible without the efforts 
and support of all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will continue to look after the 
interests of all Canadians.  It will lead us into the new 
millennium with vision and foresight. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge of climate change does not have to be a crisis. We 
must take this opportunity to make Canada a more efficient and 
innovative nation.  If we meet this challenge, and we will and we 
must, it will ensure the continued health of our planet.  If we 
fail to meet it, our children and our grandchildren will pay an 
enormous price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to work very hard to ensure that this will not happen. 
All Canadians need to work hard on this issue. We owe it to the 
generations that follow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thought I might share a little story about the nature 
of environmental destruction, environmental problems and ask the 
member to respond.  It is really just a way of getting this 
little story on the record. I remember reading this about 20 
years ago.  It was trying to illustrate the nature of 
environmental problems.  They are often geometric or exponential 
in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The story goes that you have to imagine a lily pond which is 
being covered by lily pads at a certain rate over the course of 
28 days. 
It starts with one lily pad on the first day, two lily pads on 
the second day, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, et cetera.  The thing to 
remember in the covering of this pond with lily pads is that if 
this is a progression of pollution or environmental degradation, 
on the 27th day there is still half the lily pond uncovered. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT105"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2240

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy to believe on the 27th day or on the 26th day or 
on the 25th day that the people who are saying there is a problem 
are wrong, because they can look out over half of the lily pond 
and say “These people are Chicken Little.  These people say that 
the sky is falling.  These people are exaggerating.  They want us 
to take unnecessary measures”.  If they listen to that kind of 
advice in this story, when sitting on a lily pad on the 27th day 
they are saying there is no problem and on the next day boom, the 
entire pond is covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to consider whether or not this story is not 
constructive in some way.  We do not know with respect to 
greenhouse gas emissions whether we are on the 27th day or the 
26th or the 25th, but we are close.  We are somewhere in the 
twenties and it is incumbent upon us to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member opposite for that wonderful story.  I am not sure where it 
was going or where it was leading but it was wonderful 
nevertheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that Canadians, men and women of good faith 
ensure that we do what we must for the environment.  I think that 
is important and certainly that is the position of this 
government.  We will continue to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, Canada 
has always been regarded as a world leader and a driving force on 
critical issues which threaten the preservation of our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative years were characterized by action 
and leadership.  In contrast this government is long on 
improvising and short on planning and implementation when it 
comes to protecting the environment and reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.  This is just as true for the last four years as it 
has been for the last four weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kyoto conference on climate change is less than one week 
away.  This government is flying by the seat of its pants and has 
said nothing about its position for Kyoto.  What it fails to 
recognize is that any target is irrelevant when there is no plan 
in place to achieve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In absence of an implementation strategy, set targets amount to 
nothing more than good intentions.  To be effective, our position 
must be informed by science, enhanced by government and anchored 
in society's will.  Only when society is fully engaged will our 
policies and strategies succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of climate change is real and it is complex.  It is a 
fact that there is a discernible human influence on global 
climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the world's scientists do not know the exact 
consequences.  However it is a disservice to misrepresent to 
Canadians that the science is divided as some of my colleagues in 
this House have tried to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I actually understand why the Reform Party does not understand 
the science beyond this and it does not believe in global 
warming.  I think it is because it still lives in the ice age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a northern and a marine nation we must be resolute in 
addressing this very serious problem.  Global warming from a 
Canadian perspective is indeed a national problem.  It challenges 
the environment of the town of Charlottetown, P.E.I.  For the 
Reform members who actually represent some seats in western 
Canada, it also threatens the Fraser River delta in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's made in the U.S.A. approach is not leadership. 
The science and technology that addresses climate change is 
evolving.  A target a decade or more away is likely to become 
irrelevant as the science continues to evolve. However the PC 
party will accept reaching 1990 levels by the year 2010 as an 
interim target as long as an implementation strategy accompanies 
this target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment stated in this Chamber on 
October 22, 1997 in referring to the earth summit in Rio, 
“Frankly with respect when we made our commitment in Rio in 1992 
we really were not aware of what we had to do to achieve our 
target”. 
The environment minister should heed her own advice. Without an 
implementation strategy we will not build on the global efforts 
of the past five years in Rio, Berlin and Geneva.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been so focused on trying to arrive at a 
target that it has forgotten to develop an implementation 
strategy for home.  It has been conspicuously quiet on its 
negotiating strategy in relation to economic instruments and in 
clarifying what is not on the Kyoto table.  In no way should a 
Kyoto position include potential trade sanctions for any 
non-compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the auditor general has stated, the government has a vast 
implementation gap when addressing environmental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some hon. members across the way like to raise the record of the 
previous Conservative government to deflect attention away from 
their actions or lack thereof over the last four years on perhaps 
any subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My next comments may not be focused on the members in the House 
today, but they may be addressed to some of the individuals in 
the front row such as the finance minister, the defence minister, 
the fisheries minister and so on.  The fisheries minister blamed 
us for the problems with respect to the salmon treaty when we 
were able to negotiate a deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals want to compare records, our party is up to the 
challenge, especially with respect to the environment. Perhaps 
hon. members across they way forget that it was our party and our 
leader who developed the 1992 green plan.  It was our government 
that brought in the Canadian Environmental Protection Act to 
control toxins.  This government has failed to pass one piece of 
significant environmental legislation.  Our party was responsible 
for the Montreal protocol which committed over 24 nations to the 
reduction of ozone depleting gases.  Today over 150 countries 
have ratified this protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the finance minister is trying to get in on the act.  He 
claims that when the Liberals came into government—we heard his 
tirade the other day—nothing had been done on the environment. I 
remind the finance minister that we signed an air quality accord 
with the U.S. to control air pollution.  Under our government and 
our leader we announced further measures for acid rain control. 
Under our leader Canada was the first country to ratify the UN 
conventions on biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions.  Under 
our leader we introduced a national protocol on packaging to 
reduce waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's record cannot even begin to match what was 
accomplished for the environment when our party and our leader 
were in government.  For this government the environment has not 
been a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the greenhouse gas debate the government has not fully 
engaged the public at large, NGOs, municipalities and for that 
matter the provinces.  While the minister has claimed she has 
been in dialogue with the provinces, the fact remains this 
government has not come forth with initiatives or economic 
instruments that will enable citizens, municipalities or even the 
provinces to implement any accord derived from Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party realizes that Kyoto is not a 
conclusion but rather a small yet significant step forward in our 
collective political, social, economic and industrial adaptation 
to meet the challenge of climate change.  Our party's focus is on 
developing a strategy that will enable us to meet our 
obligations.  We have also focused on the mechanisms our 
government must present to the world community to be developed 
with both the industrialized and developing nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A global problem like climate change requires global solutions. 
The debate on reducing emissions must move away from the focus on 
who will lose as opposed to how we get the job done with as many 
win-win solutions as possible.  An international solution must 
include commitments to develop international emissions trading 
systems, a joint implementation strategy and an acknowledgement 
of Canada's potential to be a carbon sink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Engagement of developing countries may be the most critical 
issue that challenges our ability to address global warming. Even 
if the industrialized nations are able to achieve significant 
reductions, the current rate of emissions growth in the 
developing world will still pose a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our made in Canada solution must be market driven, incentive 
based and focused on developing new technologies.  New taxes are 
not part of a constructive solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The natural resource minister has said that progress toward a 
target can be made in setting energy efficiency standards, 
promoting technological advances and educating consumers on 
energy savings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is right, yet the government has lacked the 
initiative to implement a regime that supports these very 
comments.  If the minister truly believes this is the case, why 
do we only allocate $20 million annually to promote investment in 
both energy efficiency and renewable energy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without adequate funding for research and development and energy 
efficiency, and without incentives for early action for industry, 
Canada will continue to lag behind competing nations in this 
field which is full of vast opportunities for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implementation gap must be closed on public education as 
well.  Most Canadians are unaware the everyday choices they made 
on an individual level can make a real difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government has taken office the number of energy 
efficient R-2000 homes being built in Canada has fallen by 55%. 
Governments have a responsibility to enhance and level the 
playing field for the development and adoption of renewable 
sources of energy.  Equitable tax incentives must be introduced 
for wind, solar and expanded hydro supply of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A modern transportation policy must be developed for the 21st 
century.  Challenging the automotive industry to develop more 
energy efficient vehicles is a component.  The transportation 
sector is responsible for over one-third of carbon dioxide 
emissions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we must move away from using carbon intensive 
fuels, such as moving from coal to natural gas wherever possible. 
This no regrets philosophy is the cornerstone of developing a 
workable solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that environmental decisions made by governments 
which will affect us greatly into the 21st century must be 
informed by science.  These decisions, in turn, must be enhanced 
by government, which has the responsibility to enhance the 
collective will and to provide leadership.  Only when policies 
and strategies are anchored in society's will can they succeed.

June 1994  “If our voices our strong, the speed of progress will 
be swift”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
having only 10 minutes to comment is a very limited time on such 
a major issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the hon. member asking a question 
or making a comment on this speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Then he does not have 10 minutes; he 
has five.  He has less than that, in fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the hon. 
member his perception of something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A premature view is evident among countries.  The United States 
says that if China or other developing countries do not sign the 
agreement, the United States will not sign.  The Regina agreement 
indicated that if the United States did not sign, Canada should 
not sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about a made in Canada solution.  With Canada 
emitting 2% of total global emissions, does he believe that 
Canada could take the lead?  Or, should Canada hold back and 
follow other nations?  Should we be a role model for developing 
nations, as a developed country, or should we wait until 
everybody complies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question.  He raises a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is possible that the result in Kyoto could be no deal.  Just 
because there is no deal, does that mean we should continue our 
inaction on this issue?  I say no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make an effort to engage the developing countries 
because China and India are the second and fifth largest emitters 
of carbon dioxide in the world.  At a minimum we have to try to 
engage the developing nations.  I believe we can work in a very 
constructive fashion to bring in a phased in program for  the 
developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day whatever position is reached in Kyoto, or 
perhaps not, the challenge before us from a Canadian perspective 
is to show a leadership role and to develop a very distinct 
implementation strategy for the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
address this very important issue on the minds of all Canadians 
and of the entire globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak on several fronts from my experience as an environmental 
biologist.  I have experience from an academic point of view and 
from a practitioner's point of view in the fields of community 
forestry, community based aquaculture and a number of other 
community based industries striving for sustainable development 
in rural communities in my home province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basis of the experience I am bringing to this debate is my 
own personal experience working in the field of science, working 
in the field of sustainable development, and working in a 
province which I think is very nobly showing great leadership in 
moving ahead in the field of sustainable development and 
contributing to the solutions to global warming and the problem 
of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the province of Newfoundland and Labrador where we 
have on our doorsteps one of the most vast offshore energy 
resources in the world.  The Hibernia field and the Jeanne d'Arc 
Basin are producing and have the potential to produce significant 
energy resources that will be used by global trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am very pleased to contribute to the discussion on 
Canada's role in increasing energy efficiency, Canada's role in 
increasing responsible consumption, and Canada's role in 
providing global leadership on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have in our province one of the cleanest sources of 
renewable energy found in the Lower Churchill Falls project. 
Hydroelectricity will be for North America one of our great 
advantages in terms of producing sustainable successful results 
in reducing our carbon levels so that we achieve the greenhouse 
gas reduction targets that we have set out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak as a scientist with a laboratory in the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  As has been raised during the course 
of this debate, I have been witness to the destruction of the 
northern cod stocks.  While others in the House speak from third 
hand information, I was in northern Newfoundland during the time 
of the cod crisis and experienced first hand the consequences of 
inaction and the consequences of not listening to science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very strongly that we have to listen to the scientists on 
this issue.  I note that my colleagues opposite are now publicly 
saying that we should strictly be basing fisheries management 
decisions on science and science alone; that administrators 
should be exempt from the process of setting total allowable 
catches, exempt from determining the total biomass availability; 
and that science and science alone should be the guiding 
consequence.  Hon. members of the Reform Party are saying now 
that the issue of global warming and climate change is in their 
backyard that scientists are quacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an absolute outrage.  When it is not in their backyard 
science should be the guiding factor, but when it potentially is 
in their backyard scientists are quacks.  I think that is 
reprehensible.  Quite frankly inaction, not listening to 
scientists, is what got us in trouble in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we as parliamentarians have the responsibility to 
listen to the advice available to us. To do nothing is 
irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While members opposite have found the new luxury of promoting 
their own environmental agenda and their own environmental 
performance of the past, it was the Conservative government of 
the day that refused to act on the science in 1990.  It refused 
to embrace the challenges of fisheries management.  Instead of 
listening to science in 1990 it began the process of listening to 
the major fish corporations. 
It said enterprise allocations, regardless of the science, 
quoting the then minister, the Hon. Bernard Valcourt and 
others—it is very important that this be noted on the 
record—“the economic consequences are far, far too great”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now in Atlantic Canada we are experiencing the economic 
consequences of not acting appropriately and not acting in a 
timely fashion.  While others may laud their fisheries management 
practices in terms of the west coast in putting together the 
Pacific Fisheries Treaty, I suggest on the Atlantic coast we have 
been witness in a very real and tangible way to the consequences 
of the inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural 
Resources, I say that we are dedicated and committed to action on 
this issue in a way which is responsible, which meets the needs 
of Canadians.  That is action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that in Newfoundland and Labrador, 
while we are participating in the energy industry, we are also 
participating in the solutions.  That is what Canadians expect of 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out some other examples of actions which 
are providing solutions.  For example, Alcan Smelter and 
Chemicals Ltd. is replacing its older facilities with new plants 
built with the latest technology.  Carbon dioxide emissions will 
be reduced at this facility by more than 350,000 tonnes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples across the country where we can employ energy 
efficiency, where we can employ better technologies and where we 
can respond to the science that we know exists today rather than 
burying our heads in the sand like ostriches and trying to 
pretend the problem does not exist.  What we have to do is act. 
That is exactly what we intend to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to participate in this 
debate.  I know that it causes quite a high degree of debate 
between members as to who is responsible and who is not. However, 
I think that clearly we are all responsible as parliamentarians 
to participate in the solutions, to participate in developing 
answers rather than just simply saying “it is he or she who did 
not act in the past”.  What we have to do is recognize that this 
is the time and the place to act.  Let us start doing it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just 
want to make a comment and question the hon. member across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am on the standing committee of environment and sustainable 
development.  Over the last while we have had numerous scientists 
come to us as witnesses.  One of the people who came to us was a 
scientist from Newfoundland, an oceanographer.  He had quite a 
different view of what was going on.  He studies the oceans and 
he did not think that there was quite the reaction occuring in 
the world that others did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One question I tried to ask most of the scientists who came to 
us was with today's technology and computerization and the 
methods we have of measuring things, if you had five or ten more 
years of accurate data added on to the data you already have, 
would this help narrow down the projections that scientists are 
coming up with?  Would you be able to be more accurate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in 
response to the comments and the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I cannot respond to the comment about the 
oceanographer because there was no specific information provided. 
I will suggest that new, more, better information is always 
important.  That is one of the reasons why Canada is a world 
leader in providing satellite technology and providing 
environmental monitoring.  Always as a country, as a globe we 
should be striving to provide better information on the 
environment. 
Canada is successfully developing a world class industry in that 
regard, providing services to countries around the globe and that 
is actually providing jobs for Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT109"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I say that the challenge of global warming is 
significant and of a huge magnitude.  However, the opportunities 
for Canadians to embrace the problem and seek solutions and to 
actively engage in the solution provides us with unique 
opportunities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Natural Resources would answer a question.  I know he was 
talking some time earlier about the fisheries and the role of 
science, et cetera. 
In his role of parliamentary secretary and given his proximity to 
the government's plan on how to deal with greenhouse gas 
emissions, I wonder if he could tell me whether there is any plan 
on the part of the government to reinvest substantially in rail 
transportation in this country and re-regulate the transportation 
industry in the country to favour rail transportation over other 
modes of transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has seemed to me for a long time and, in fact, my maiden 
speech in the House was to some degree about one thing we could 
do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would be to create a 
transportation regime in the country that would move more freight 
and people by train.  Instead, we have had 10 to 15 years of 
deregulation that has put more and more trucks on the highways. 
There are trucks on the highways that look like trains, for God's 
sake.  There is less and less safety, more and more emissions and 
still there is no end to this madness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary, is there a plan? Does the 
government intend to use this opportunity that the climate 
changes presents it with to reverse the madness of the last 10 or 
15 years by which we have deregulated in such a way to favour 
trucks over rail and have in fact created what I consider to be 
not only an environmental crisis, but a public safety crisis in 
terms of our highways and our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>   Mr. Speaker, there is more than a plan. 
There is action.  One thing the government realizes is that 
transportation is actually a major producer of greenhouse gases. 
It is one of the major, major producers of greenhouse gases. That 
is why the government has dedicated itself to increasing energy 
efficiency, not just in the transportation sector, but as well in 
the heating of buildings and other things.  Energy efficiency is 
exactly where this country should be going and where we are 
taking it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I promote very strongly that federal buildings and government 
vehicles right across the government increase their energy 
efficiency by using different types of energy sources.  As well, 
we are always actively engaged in the debate regarding 
transportation policy and creating greater efficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one object of the Canada Transportation Act, which I 
will happily engage in debate about.  It is providing economic 
efficiencies and also creating an opportunity for greater 
efficiencies in terms of the transportation routes.  Instead of 
duplicating loads, companies are now providing better services 
more cheaply, but most importantly, with reduced use of fuel. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate, particularly after sitting 
here all evening and listening to the debate and being very 
annoyed at the gross distortion of the Reform Party position on 
this issue and the undignified and unwarranted personal attacks 
on members of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party certainly has never put forward a position that 
we should not do anything.  That could not be further from the 
truth.  Certainly we believe that all prudent measures to reduce 
emissions and pollution should be done that can be effectively 
done without committing economic suicide, which is what this 
government is bound and determined to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We neither want to commit economic suicide nor be isolated in 
the world by implementing a program that has no real plan, no 
global plan for implementation, forcing other countries around 
the world to participate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be truly tragic to end up in a situation like 
that.  For the life of me, I cannot understand how intelligent 
people can totally ignore any of the conflicting science on this 
issue.  There is hard data written on pieces of paper collected 
by scientists that without any doubt prove that the global 
climate has not warmed since 1940.  The data is there and is 
indisputable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are scientists who participated in the IPCC, 2,500 is the 
number talked about, who say that their scientific data was 
misinterpreted and misrepresented for political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How intelligent people can discount all those things and engage 
in psychological terrorism and coercing Canadians into taking 
some action that is going to be extremely costly and harmful to 
the Canadian economy is beyond me.  Quite frankly, I think it is 
unethical and dishonest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be a broad public debate and discussion in this 
country.  We must bring ordinary Canadians into the discussion 
because after listening to this issue in the House, in committee 
and in the media, it becomes very obvious that the people who are 
going to pay the price are going to be the ordinary taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have engaged industry in the dialogue.  Industry has 
presented a strong position.  I think the government has listened 
to industry to a great degree in talks about tradable credits and 
the voluntary challenge program and a lot of these other things 
that will likely work for industry.  However, industry is only 
one-third of the problem.  Another third is the transportation 
sector and the other third is people themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly while some interests have been addressed, some 
certainly have not been.  This shroud of secrecy over the Liberal 
government's position gives cause for great concern and fear in 
the general Canadian public and not unwarranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member for Ottawa West—Nepean tonight quote Maurice 
Strong as a world authority on this issue.  Maurice Strong, for 
those who do not know, was the chairman in Rio who stood up and 
said that the only salvation of the globe was the total 
dismantling of the industrial society.  It was the Liberal 
responsibility to achieve that.  If that does not strike fear 
into the hearts of Canadians, I do not know what will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This refusal to develop a dialogue and a position and to simply 
announce one-upmanship against the Americans indicates to me that 
the greatest interest here is not in the interest of Canada, it 
is in the interest of grooming someone to be a greener leader or 
the world's boy scout who is going to save the world faster than 
the next leader.  I do not think that really serves us well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian reality is that we are a huge country and a cold 
country with a very sparsely and disperse population and with 
great dependence on the resource industries.  Based on that, it 
is important that we get this whole issue into perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada only produces 2% of the world's greenhouse gases.  China 
and India are huge contributors to the problem and they are not 
even part of this discussion.  In fact, it is ludicrous that we 
would take leading action to solve the problem without engaging 
some of these other countries.  If we, tomorrow morning, were to 
achieve the commitment that the government talks about, the 
achievement of 1990 levels by the year 2010, without engaging 
India, China and some of the other countries, it would take a 
mere 25 days for that benefit that Canada produced to be used up 
by the third world. 
Only 25 days and we would not have accomplished anything except 
to destroy our economic base in this country.  I think it would 
be quite foolish to do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, what we are mostly lacking in this debate is a 
public debate engaging all Canadians in the issue.  That has not 
happened and it is not likely to happen now until after Kyoto, 
until the government has signed a binding legal agreement that 
leaves it little flexibility if Canadians do not buy into this 
scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think we hear emotions in the House tonight on this issue, 
wait until the government starts to implement this program and 
passes the cost of this program on to ordinary Canadians.  We 
should think back to last winter when there was a large increase 
in the price of propane. For senior citizens in my riding on 
fixed income, the price of their heating fuel doubled and caused 
them great hardship.  They could not afford to buy groceries. 
People called me from reserves in northern Alberta. They could 
not afford to buy heating fuel for their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the outrage in Toronto last summer when there was only a 
temporary spike in the price of gasoline.  There were calls for 
investigation and government action immediately and it was 
nothing compared to what this government is proposing, I am 
afraid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be well aware of the fact that they are now 
paying over 60% of their income in one form of tax or another. 
Real take home income has been shrinking in this country for a 
long time thanks to ever increasing taxes.  I do not really think 
there is a mood out there for further increases to the degree 
this government is proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we take a balanced approach, a careful 
approach, a cautious approach.  We have never disputed and we do 
not dispute that Canada's environmental situation is in serious 
trouble.  It is in serious trouble all around the world from a 
number of sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Conservatives talk about the wonderful things 
they had achieved.  The member for Davenport, in spite of that 
wonderful achievement on cleaning up pulp mills, 
introduced a debate in the House about how this government has in 
fact exempted pulp mills and they continue to pour dioxins and 
furans into Canada's water system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a potential Chernobyl in the suburbs of Toronto with a 
nuclear power plant and we have an ever growing stockpile of 
nuclear waste around the world that nobody has figured out what 
to do with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our environment is in serious trouble, but that does not mean we 
need to do the kinds of things this government is proposing to do 
to solve the problem. Prudent action is in order. Responsible 
action is in order and our party supports doing that.  We just 
urge caution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would urge my colleagues across the floor, and particularly their 
leader, to take heed from a significant group of taxpayers in 
western Canada, the physicians from out west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the physicians' statement on climate change 
from the Alberta Medical Association, the British Columbia 
Paediatric Society, the UBC department of paediatrics, the Yukon 
Medical Association, the faculty of medicine at UBC and the 
Family Physicians of Canada, the Alberta chapter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first two signatories to this climate change are Dr. David 
Bates, professor emeritus from the University of British 
Columbia, and Dr. Tee Guidotti, professor and director of the 
occupational health program, faculty of medicine, at the 
University of Alberta.  These people are not in agreement with 
members opposite and I implore them, if they will not listen to 
the scientists, at least listen to the physicians out west.

<A HREF="#LINKT112"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What these people are saying is that as physicians they fear 
that global climate change carries with it significant health, 
environmental, economic and social risks and that preventive 
steps are justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say that all human health is ultimately dependent on the 
health of the biosphere.  Scientists believe that climate change 
will have major irreversible effects on the environment with 
secondary consequences for human health and well-being that could 
occur within a matter of decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These impacts include increased mortality and illness due to 
heat stress, worsened air pollution, increased incidence of 
vector borne infectious disease, expanding populations of pest 
species, and impaired food production and nutrition.  Extreme 
weather events such as floods, droughts and wind storms could 
endanger lives and create environmental refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As physicians they believe in the wisdom of preventive measures, 
and therefore they urge prompt and effective action to reduce 
emissions of greenhouse gases. Canada has one of the highest per 
capita emission rates of greenhouse gases in the world.  It has 
become urgent that Canada provide scientific, technical, economic 
and diplomatic leadership in the worldwide effort to 
significantly reduce greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want members in the official opposition know that this 
erudite body, some of whose members even voted for them, in 
separate resolutions and the CMA and the CPHA are calling on the 
federal government to reaffirm at the Kyoto convention on climate 
change in December its position of achieving 20% reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Speaker to implore the official opposition to 
actually include a few more stakeholders in its consultations. 
The physicians of western Canada are watching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure where the 
question was but certainly that erudite body the hon. member 
referred to is entitled to its opinion, as are all other 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem has been that all Canadians have not been engaged in 
this debate.  They have not had a chance to express their fears 
and their opinions.  Based on an implementation plan that the 
government would put forward, the group the member talks about 
could probably pay double what it is paying now for car gasoline 
without creating serious hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is also a very large group of middle income to 
lower income Canadians who would suffer huge hardship when this

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote Dr. Bert Bolin, chairman of the IPCC: “This 
thorough and completely open process has guaranteed that the 
summaries of a wide ownership in no way can be described as the 
work of a select few.  The process provides justification for the 
description of substantial scientific consensus”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member's whole set-up about IPCC is the work of 
the oil and gas lobby that has been parroting this thing in 
the States and here for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Speaker, pure greenhouse gas.  I 
said in my presentation that I was not speaking on behalf of the 
energy industry or any particular industry.  I think it has done 
an excellent job of representing itself and I think to a great 
degree it has protected its interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said was there were scientists who were part of those 
2,500 scientists who were most upset because their scientific 
evidence was distorted and misrepresented.  I think that is a 
valid position for them to take.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall of 1987 as minister of the environment of Quebec I 
was a member of the Canadian delegation of the United Nations 
when Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland presented the now famous report 
of the World Commission on Environment and Development, “Our 
Common Future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lead speaker after Mrs. Brundtland was the President of the 
Maldive Islands, Mahmood Abdul Gayoom.  He described the natural 
beauty of his island state of many hundreds of islands in the 
Indian Ocean south of India as ecological jewels on a cushion of 
blue.  He told us about the tidal waves that had started to visit 
his islands.  He explained that the water surrounding the islands 
had always been steady and calm until the eighties when they were 
visited for the first time by giant tidal waves.  The first time 
the waves caused significant damage.  The second time they were 
more fierce and damage was correspondingly severe, and the third 
time they caused havoc which included considerable destruction 
and, sadly, human injury and death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Way back then, 10 years ago, President Gayoom addressed us, the 
rich industrialized world, in this way: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists tell us that in the next century the seas could rise 
drastically, maybe between 1 and 3 meters.  If it was 
something in between, my island-state would disappear under the 
sea completely.  We have no plants and no factories that spew 
carbon gases into the atmosphere, yet our innocent people must 
pay the price of your activities, and your negligence.  Is this 
right, is this fair? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask is it right and fair?  Is it acceptable to Canadians who 
believe so strongly in equity and justice?  Is it right, fair and 
acceptable that we should be the second ranking world champions 
per capita of carbon emissions, a close second to the greenhouse 
champions the United States? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that some continue to pretend that climatic change and 
the huge global threat posed by the increase in greenhouse gases are 
just a myth spread by environmentalists and tree huggers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was listening to the leader of the official opposition earlier 
and after many years of environmental work, I wondered if the hon. 
member and I live on the same planet. The hon. member should talk to 
people from the Maldives, from Barbados, from the Marshall Islands, or 
from 40 small island states, who live in constant fear that sea levels 
will continue to rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, the leader of the opposition speaks like the dinosaur he 
is. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how many people from Burundi and Mali and Benin he has 
spoken to about the visibly encroaching desert in Africa. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very limited time at my disposal does not allow me to mention 
in detail the countless examples which clearly demonstrate that the 
impact of greenhouse gases is not only real but has already begun to 
cause dramatic climatic changes in many parts of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned earlier, the UN intergovernmental panel on climatic 
change includes some 2,000 of the greatest scientific experts on 
climate, whose work and findings are systematically analyzed and 
reviewed by their peers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an impressive number of examples that show how the 
greenhouse effect has intensified over the last 25 years, because of the 
spectacular acceleration of the industrialization process and the 
increase in the use of energy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me cite only the example of Antarctica where in January 1995 
a vast section the size of Prince Edward Island broke off from 
the Larsen-Shelf.  Two months later a 60-kilometre long fissure 
appeared along the northern part of the same Larsen-Shelf, 
Scientific measurements show that the mean temperature in the 
Arctic peninsula has risen by nearly 20 degrees Fahrenheit over 
the last 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the book <I>The Heat is On</I> by Ross Gelbspan, the author 
quotes Argentinian scientist Dr. Rodolfo del Valle as follows: 
“Recently we have seen rocks poke through the surface of the ice 
that had been buried under 600 metres of ice for 20,000 years”. 
Sadly in spite of repeated commitments by industrialized 
countries of the north which have the means, both technological 
and financial, to stabilize and reduce excessive greenhouse 
emissions, the evidence shows a very different and a very sad 
tale.  Emissions are not stabilized, let alone reduced, compared 
to 1990 totals. On the contrary, they have increased 
substantially.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada in spite of categorical commitments by successive 
governments, our greenhouse gases have actually risen by 8% over 
1990 results.  In fact the UN climate change secretariat has 
reported that among developed nations the U.S., Japan and Canada 
were responsible for 85% of the increase in greenhouse gases 
between 1990 and 1995. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, we are a rich and influential nation, a member of the G-7, a 
country whose natural resources are among the most abundant in the 
world, a country of knowledge and first-class technological 
achievements. We can and must do better. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If over the last five years India, a country far less favoured 
financially and technologically than our own, can invest some 
$600 million Canadian in solar energy as well as make significant 
investments in waste recovery energy, in wind energy, in biomass 
energy and in district energy, surely we can do substantially 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we must do first of all is rebalance the economic and 
fiscal incentive and subsidy program which over the years and 
even today heavily favours the fossil fuel and nuclear 
industries.  Unless we change our ways and direction toward 
energy efficiency and renewable energies, unless we have the 
courage and determination to redirect our subsidies and fiscal 
incentives toward environmentally clean energies, we will 
continue to move from conference to conference to conference, not 
only spinning wheels but losing ground in the global battle to 
stabilize and reduce greenhouse emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 20 years we have spent literally billions of 
dollars in subsidies and tax incentives to the fossil fuel and 
nuclear industries.  In the oil and gas industry alone, according 
to figures from Natural Resources Canada for the year 1993, the 
value of tax deductions totalled a staggering $6.247 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a determined co-ordinated program backed by adequate 
financial incentives, we can stabilize at 1990 levels by 2005 and 
reduce our emissions substantially by 2010, some reliable experts 
believe by as much as 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not scratched the surface of what is possible and 
available: waste recovery energy, district energy, wind energy, 
solar energy, biomass energy, better public transportation and 
clean transportation fuels such as cellulose ethanol and of 
course energy efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is a determination that turned the acid rain 
situation around in the eighties, when Canada took a bold 
leadership position including tight timelines and substantial 
reduction targets of 50% involving the federal government and 
seven of the affected provinces. Rather than worrying about lack 
of action by the United States, we took a bold lead and the U.S. 
eventually followed by amending its Clean Air Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must continue its role as an international environmental 
leader regardless of the timid and pussyfooting positions of the 
U.S.  Canada must continue to set an international example, for 
only when rich nations like our own set a convincing example will 
we in turn convince less favoured countries of the developing 
world to follow our lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For besides being good for our environment and our health, clean 
energies are immensely beneficial to the economy, creating 
investments, creating wealth through advanced technologies and 
creating jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will describe one last example.  Denmark now depending on coal 
for 50% of its energy has established a bold program to replace 
its total coal energy by wind power by 2030.  Danish and German 
wind power turbines now provide energy not only in Europe but in 
Africa, Asia, North America and South America, to communities 
large and small.  Why should these turbines not be Canadian? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed climate change solutions, very far from being an economic 
burden, on the contrary are a sustainable economic opportunity. 
Let us be bold rather than timid.  Let us lead rather than 
follow. Let us bet squarely on energies of the 21st century, 
renewable energies, clean energies.  Let us bet on a clean and 
sustainable future for our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish I had a couple of hours for a one on one debate 
with the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis. Since that is not 
possible I would like to address some of the misrepresentations, 
or perhaps I should say the omissions in his presentation wherein 
he was so selective about his choice of science and scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would commend him to Frederick Selz, president emeritus of 
Rockefeller University, chairman of the George C. Marshall 
Institute and a member of the IPCC who said, “I have never 
witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer review process 
than the events that led to the IPCC report”.  Of course he was 
referring to the 1966 report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He and a group of fellow scientists went through line by line 
the original version of the IPCC report before it was butchered 
for political purposes.  I would like to quote a few select lines 
from the report.  Now these are not quoted in context and I am 
open to attack because of that.  However, these are actual quotes 
from the report:  “None of the studies cited has shown clear 
evidence that we can attribute changes to the specific cause of 
increases in greenhouse gases”. That is a direct contradiction 
to the paragraph which appeared in the summary, which has been 
quoted by hon. members opposite at great length today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report continued:  “No study to date has positively 
attributed all or part of observed climate change to 
anthropogenic causes”.  The report continued: “Any claims of 
positive detection of significant climate change are likely to 
remain controversial until uncertainties in the total variability 
of the climate system are reduced”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not give anybody great credit or anybody great 
discredit.  What it does do is establish the fact which our 
leader mentioned earlier in the evening that there is not 
universal acclaim within the scientific community for the theory 
of human induced global warming.  It is a theory.  It is an 
interesting theory.  I find it very interesting, but I do not 
swallow it holus-bolus.  I want to see more evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting 
that the member quoted Frederick Seitz. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to refer to the book entitled “The Heat is On”. 
The quote is from an article in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>. Frederick 
Selz is a director of the Marshall institute.  He castigated 
another scientist, Santer, for allegedly excising references to 
scientific uncertainty.  He wrote:  “I have never witnessed a 
more disturbing corruption of the peer review process than the 
events which led to this IPCC report”, which is the quote the 
hon. member cited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several months later Seitz conceded the reports of his own 
Marshall institute which consistently denied that any threat to 
the global climate were not based on science but merely 
“represent opinion”. So much for Selz.  It was purely an 
opinion.  He admits himself that it did not represent scientific 
fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member would care to read “The Heat is On”, all 
the references are there to the Marshall institute, to Selz, to 
Bolin, to the IPCC, to Michaels, Balling, Idso, Frederick Singer 
and Dr. Lindzen, who are all paid consultants of the trillion 
dollar oil and gas lobby, who would want us to believe that the 
world is not changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would want us to believe, as tobacco scientists used to 
that tobacco does not cause cancer. They would want us to believe 
that the fish are not disappearing off the shores of 
Newfoundland.  They would want us to wait until the world is a 
desert, until the seas have risen and the islands have gone. Then 
the Reform Party could do something but it will not be here any 
more, thank goodness.

minutes with my colleague, the hon. member for Laurentides.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, the scientific community generally 
agrees that the phenomenal amounts of pollutants released into the 
atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution are making 
the earth's temperature rise at an unprecedented rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific commission mandated by governments world-wide 
demonstrated that the planet was warming and this was most likely due to 
carbon dioxide emissions and other gasses produced by burning fossil 
fuels as well as the destruction of forests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists are sending a warning about the consequences of global 
warming, one of which could be the rising of the sea level by nearly one 
metre. 
In Quebec, the St. Lawrence River would be the hardest hit, as its flow 
would be substantially reduced. Other examples could include more 
droughts—more land will turn into desert—, more hurricanes, the 
spread of famine and disease, vanishing forests and animal species 
becoming extinct. Without being alarmists, these researchers foresee 
disastrous consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to scientific forecasts, temperatures could rise by 
anywhere from 2 to 6 degrees Celsius in Quebec over the next century, 
which is the most dramatic climate change since the end of the last ice 
age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment corroborates these statements 
with her statement that this climate change might impact upon our 
natural resources, including forests, water, fisheries, agriculture 
and a number of other sectors.  Yet this government is suffering 
from an unprecedented inertia when it comes to the positions taken 
at the earth summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1992 earth summit, the world governments agreed to 
bring their greenhouse gas emissions back down to 1990 levels by 
the year 2000.  Yet only a rare few have made an effort to keep 
that promise.  The Liberal government is, in fact, living proof of 
this, with its inertia and its slowness in taking a position in 
preparation for the Kyoto conference which is about to start.  The 
Bloc Quebecois is asking the government to shoulder its 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With her lack of leadership at the Regina meeting, the 
Minister of the Environment, by signing the final communique, is in 
danger of jeopardizing Canada's environmental credibility in the 
eyes of the international community.  This agreement backs off from 
the commitments made at Rio and proves how easy it is to let 
oneself be intimidated by a sector of Canadian industry, the fossil 
fuel sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in this House has any doubt that the time has come to 
take preventive measures in light of the possibility of climate 
change. It is vital that the industrialized countries adopt very 
stringent objectives at Kyoto.  Quebec, through its Minister of the 
Environment, has dissociated itself from the Regina agreement and 
by taking a firm position has demonstrated that it was possible in 
America to attain the objectives set for the year 2000.  As for the 
federal government, however, it has demonstrated nothing except the 
weakness of its position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is vital that the objectives be higher than those of the 
United States and even Japan and that the objectives set at the 
Kyoto conference be ratified by all provinces of Canada.  Let us 
not forget that only Quebec and British Columbia ratified the Rio 
agreement in 1992.  A province such as Alberta, which produces more 
than a quarter of the greenhouse gases, cannot remain recalcitrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greenhouse gases are a threat to humanity.  Canada, excluding 
Quebec, came up with no project in response to the commitments made 
at the Rio summit.  In fact, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane 
and others increased by 13% this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the position of the Quebec government, environmental 
groups and all the countries participating in the Kyoto conference, 
but we still do not know the position of the federal Minister of 
the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it too late for the government to do its homework? 
We cannot accept mere wishful thinking.  Too many young people are 
expecting us to preserve their planet.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
inexplicable about-face of this government in the greenhouse gas 
issue is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of greenhouse gases is not a new one.  When I was 
environment critic, I rose on several occasions in the House to 
warn the Liberal government about the dangers of greenhouse gases. 
But apparently the minister back then and the one we have now seem 
to have been chronically deaf because nothing has been done.  On 
the contrary, things are going from bad to worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the Minister of the Environment, in 
case she has forgotten, that the Kyoto conference in Japan takes 
place from December 1 to 12, five days from now, and that Canada is 
still the only G-7 country with no specific position on the 
greenhouse gas issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in case the minister has forgotten this as well, 
the purpose of the conference is to review the situation of 
greenhouse gas emissions with respect to what was agreed in Rio in 
1992, in addition to adopting new objectives for the reduction of 
greenhouse gases, accompanied by short term, 2005, and medium term, 
2010, legal controls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Rio summit in 1992, 154 countries, including Canada, 
signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, thereby 
undertaking to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at their 1990 
level by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, Canada was considered a leader and a hero in this 
area, but today it is a real zero on that score. Even Canada's 
ambassador for the environment, John Fraser, expressed harsh criticism, 
and rightly so, against the government and its policies on greenhouse 
gases, which he described as lacking in commitment and leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Canada's performance is disastrous. By the year 2000, 
Canada will have increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 13%. How can 
this be when the Liberal government committed in Rio to stabilize its 
emissions during this decade and then to reduce them gradually? What we 
see is the exact opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Department of the Environment does not seem to realize is 
that greenhouse gases destroy not only our environment, but also our 
economy and our social fabric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should stop catering to cabinet and to the Alberta oil 
lobby, she should finally get her act together and adopt a responsible, 
firm and clear position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being penny-wise and pound-foolish to help oil companies save money 
by not taking drastic steps to eliminate greenhouse gases will 
undoubtedly cost us dearly in the future. The minister should consider 
the tremendous economic losses that thousands of companies would suffer 
because of climate change, not to mention all the health and 
environmental costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the minister should consider the economic benefits of 
more energy-efficient technologies. In relation to this, there is in my 
riding a very innovative and imaginative organization called CEVEQ, 
which specializes in assessing the compatibility of electric vehicles 
marketed with government standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a concrete example of where the federal government should 
be investing our taxes in order to reduce greenhouse gases. But 
obviously, the Liberal government prefers and considers it better to bow 
to the wishes of the oil companies that are polluting and endangering 
the lives of the people in Quebec and in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are still waiting for a clear position from the Minister 
of the Environment, the other countries have already announced their 
position on greenhouse gases for the Kyoto summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the Minister of the Environment to read the Bloc 
Quebecois' position on reducing greenhouse gases. Contrary to the 
government opposite, the Bloc Quebecois takes the issue of greenhouse 
gases very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Minister of the Environment, out of respect for 
Quebeckers, for Canadians and for the young people who will be building 
tomorrow's world, to assume her responsibilities immediately in the area 
of greenhouse gases, in order to ensure for future generations the 
quality of life and the prosperity they have a right to expect.

I would just like to ask a question and perhaps seek support for 
a position a fellow member raised earlier.  Members on the 
government side did not answer him.  I ask the member for 
Laurentides to speak on the perspective of a national 
transportation strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rail transportation is a low emitter.  A big issue for 
transportation is public freight and people who travel from one 
end of the country to the other.  Our country was built on rail. 
Bullet trains are used elsewhere in the world.  These trains 
could be used from Quebec City to Toronto.  Maybe a Bombardier, 
using Canadian technology, could build an electric train that 
could travel at 300 kilometres per hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of support would we get from the Bloc concerning a 
national transportation strategy to look at low emission 
transportation? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, naturally, for us in Quebec and in 
the Bloc Quebecois, rail transportation is a non-polluting alternative 
and, as such, should be used more. Except that we note that this 
government is dismantling any rail transportation system we may have 
had. So, there is one side of the issue that does not sound right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred earlier to the electric car as being another mode of 
transportation. We cannot rely on ethanol to save our environment. We 
have a technology, the electric car, that is currently under 
development. The mayor in my riding has been driving around in an 
electric car for more than two years, and it is very efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of investing haphazardly, the government should invest in 
areas where there are opportunities, and have a vision for a change. 
These investments will require time and research, but at least the end 
result will be products that will be useful, while preventing pollution 
in our country and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, yes, with respect to rail transportation, the government will 
have to invest in that area instead of dismantling the existing system. 
Perhaps an analysis should also be made to ensure that this system can 
be developed across the country and in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this 
important debate on greenhouse gases and climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one who believes that greenhouse gases are a threat to our 
planet.  The balance of probabilities indicates that we should be 
taking action.  The risk of inaction is just too great.  We 
really cannot put this problem off into the future.  We have to 
deal with it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions for me are how we improve our environmental 
performance with respect to greenhouse gases, at what pace we 
proceed, and how we implement these policies without negatively 
impacting our industries and our competitive position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing greenhouse gases is a very complex global issue.  It 
involves matters of public policy.  It involves matters of 
scientific and technical research.  It is a very politically 
charged issue as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with most issues of public policy we would generally ask the 
following questions.  If we make a public policy change who loses 
and who wins?  Are there winners and losers?  Is it a win-win or 
is it a lose-lose situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the question of climate change and greenhouse 
gases we clearly cannot measure all the benefits.  Nor should we 
try.  We cannot really deal adequately with the benefits of a 
climate that is more stable, that minimizes the frequency and the 
severity of natural disasters, and that avoids the severe impacts 
on agriculture and other negative consequences of dislocation 
which climate change can cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the benefits of addressing climate change but 
there are other benefits as well.  One that has been brought to 
the attention of our natural resource committee relates to 
insurance costs.  Insurance premiums that cover natural disasters 
are getting to be totally out of hand and quite unaffordable. 
If we do not deal with greenhouse gases insurance premiums will 
become astronomically high and force our businesses and taxpayers 
generally to deal with a very difficult problem.

<A HREF="#LINKT119"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are benefits such as that but some have argued there are 
other benefits.  If we deal with climate change we will create a 
large movement in technology development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument which has been repeated in the House goes something 
like this.  If we set aggressive targets for greenhouse gases new 
technologies will help us reach our goals.  The argument 
continues with the thought that as these technologies develop in 
Canada new industries and new export possibilities will be 
created.  We will be able to sell and license these environmental 
technologies abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have oversimplified the argument but basically that is the 
essence of it.  I hope it comes true.  I am sure a lot of this 
will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also ask ourselves what happens if these technologies 
do not materialize What happens if they do not meet the test of 
being commercially viable?  We need to contemplate these 
possibilities as we negotiate greenhouse gas emissions.  We need 
to have a fallback position.  We should only bet on those 
technologies that are proven today and have been demonstrated to 
have commercial viability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we can do a better job of removing obstacles 
and creating the right policy and tax environment, favouring the 
development and commercialization of environmental technologies. 
The agreements we reach in Kyoto must be achievable.  We know 
from the Rio experience that targets must be realistic and 
achievable.  To do this in Canada we need to do a few things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we need to agree on realistic targets.  Second, we need 
to obtain the commitment of all stakeholders, and that includes 
all Canadians, to achieve these goals.  Third, we need to provide 
and refine economic instruments to create the right incentives 
and the right market signals to industry to improve our 
greenhouse gas reduction performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic instruments referred to are generally classified in 
two broad areas, non-tax instruments and tax instruments.  In the 
area of non-tax instruments we have heard a lot about tradable 
permits for emissions trading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is a complex issue it boils down to a very simple 
scenario if we assume we have a certain jurisdiction, 
oversimplify it and make it hypothetical.  There are two plants, 
two factories, and to reach certain greenhouse gas targets those 
plants together are allowed, say, 1,000 units of emissions.  One 
plant is allocated 500 units and the other plant another 500 
units of emissions.  One plant is able to achieve the target, in 
fact exceed it and perhaps reduce it to 300 units of emissions. 
The other plant is having difficulty with achieving the 500 units 
and will be over by 200 units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is that the plant that will be over buys the 
surplus capacity the other plant will not utilize to meet the 
reduction targets.  There is a consideration.  One plant pays the 
other to buy its unused emissions target.  This places a market 
value or opportunity cost on the cost of not being able to comply 
with the emissions targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has some interesting possibilities.  Although it is not a 
long term solution it provides some phasing of the problem.  It 
allows companies and other creators of greenhouse gases some 
opportunities to step up to the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have much experience with tradable permits.  The 
United States has some.  We really do not have a lot of 
experience to draw on.  It is something we should be looking at 
and seriously considering.  Whether we could apply emissions 
trading on a global context is more of a challenge.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure it is workable in the short run, but it is 
something that perhaps is a target to look at.  I mention that as 
one non-tax instrument.  There are others.  There are voluntary 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure over the last number of years that voluntary 
measures, unfortunately, have really done the job.  I say 
unfortunately because I know there are many companies that have 
worked very hard at improving their environmental performance 
with greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think, for example, of the industry that I came from, the 
forest industry, the pulp and paper industry.  If we look at the 
greenhouse gas emissions in 1995 for the Canadian pulp and paper 
industry, they have been reduced by 20% from 1990.  That is at a 
time when the production increased by a similar amount, 20%. 
Those were through voluntary measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can look at my own riding of Etobicoke North where I have 
Bayer, the pharmaceutical company, BASF Canada and Parker Amchem, 
large chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturers which have really 
put a great effort into voluntary measures and have achieved some 
significant reductions in their emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that voluntary measures will be part of the 
solution because there are some sectors and some companies that 
are working very hard to reduce their emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at other non-tax instruments, there are concepts like 
user charges for water supply, disposal charges or deposit refund 
schemes.  There is a myriad of non-tax instruments that could be 
embellished and expanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at tax instruments, we could look at accelerating 
depreciation allowances for environmental investments, for 
example, waste heat recovery.  We waste a lot of heat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other tax instruments, but to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions in Canada, we must recognize some 
important facts.  Twenty-seven per cent of greenhouse gases 
originate in the transportation sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, if we adopt a policy of business as usual with respect 
to greenhouse gases, greenhouse gases will increase by 36.1% over 
1990 levels by the year 2020. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this debate pitched as an Alberta oil patch issue 
versus the rest of Canada.  In fact, that is not the case.  The 
greenhouse gas producers in the next number of years will be 
British Columbia, Ontario and other provinces like Quebec, the 
Atlantic region and Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reach our goal, all Canadians will have to contribute.  The 
end result will be worth it but it will involve a huge commitment 
by all Canadians.  I think the goal will be worth it.  I look 
forward to continuing discussion on this important topic. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate much of what the member says.  I agree with much of it 
but this concept of tradable emission permits or credits is an 
interesting theory until you start to really examine it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government member from Ottawa West—Nepean raised the 
concern that if they start down that road, it will very soon 
become much like the dairy quotas in Canada.  These permits 
become more and more expensive and fall into the hands of fewer 
and fewer corporations and companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that it quickly becomes unworkable or a real 
hindrance to free economic activity.  When you take the scenario 
even just a little further and start talking about the worker who 
has to commute into town to work every day and does not have 
access to public transit and has to use his automobile, does he 
then need to trade emission credits with the little old lady who 
just drives her car to church on Sunday? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just becomes in my view unmanageable.  How would the member 
see that system working? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the member opposite.  With emissions trading, the experience 
we have as I mentioned is quite limited.  When they get to the 
micro, micro level of individuals, clearly it is not workable, 
no.

<A HREF="#LINKT121"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it has some potential if you are looking at a transition 
phase where you have different regions or different contributors 
to greenhouse gases.  What it does is it puts a market price on 
the result of not meeting certain targets.  If those permits 
become concentrated in the hands of a few and the price goes up, 
the entity that is producing the greenhouse gas emissions faces a 
higher cost.  The economics start to move more toward taking the 
measures that will be necessary to meet their own target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The market pressures are reasonable.  It has some practical 
challenges to fully implement, certainly on a global basis, and 
even implementing it here in Canada, but it would provide some 
transitional relief and it is something we should try. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member makes an interesting point.  I would like to 
congratulate him by pointing out that we should not point fingers 
at regions of the country.  Very clearly, this is an issue for 
all Canadians and the solutions and the benefits of solving this 
problem are going to be realized by all Canadians.  Acceptable 
and workable solution strategies will have to very clearly 
recognize that particular point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the commercial viability of adjusting 
technologies and he touched very briefly in the area of 
cogeneration.  Does he see cogeneration as a commercially viable 
option? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not have a chance to deal at any length on cogeneration. 
In my view, it is an opportunity that we should look at, 
particularly right now in the context of Ontario where we have 
some nuclear capacity that is not in use and there are questions 
around reinvesting in that nuclear capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from my experience in the natural resource sector that 
there are huge opportunities to use cogeneration as a competitive 
tool to be more competitive with the United States and other 
jurisdictions.  It also has a huge environmental impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the forest industry, for example, you are using biomass, wood 
waste.  If you set up an electrical generating plant, you can 
fuel your own plant through wood waste biomass which really does 
not create very much of a problem in terms of greenhouse gases. 
Usually they build a capacity so there is some excess 
electricity.  You sell that to the grid, Ontario Hydro.  You are 
selling electricity at the margin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with electrical generation capacity and nuclear 
capacity is the huge capital cost of those plants and that 
translates, of course, into the cost of energy or electricity.  I 
think there is a unique opportunity in Ontario right now, instead 
of ramping up this nuclear capacity, to look at cogeneration as a 
reasonable alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As more cogeneration comes onstream, you are avoiding some of 
those huge capital investments.  You are getting electricity at a 
marginal cost and cheaper electricity for the plants that are 
producing it.  You are creating some competitive advantage for 
some of the companies that exist in Ontario now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
should note that it is now November 27, Thursday, and there are 
only nine days left between now and Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has once again withheld vital information and 
refused to be held accountable for the position going into Kyoto. 
Industrialists and environmentalists alike are puzzled by this 
government's lack of leadership, openness and lack of 
consultation as it crams together a last minute position for 
Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hardly believe, with Kyoto just a few days away, and one 
less now, that we are still in the dark about Canada's position. 
It is no wonder that public skepticism about government 
accountability is at an all time high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government reminds me somewhat of a disinterested student 
who rarely attends class and even when he is there, he never 
bothers to listen to what is being discussed until the night 
before the final exam when he begins to panic, wishing he had 
paid attention and desperately crams, trying to understand 
principles in the hope of scraping together a passing grade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has had years to formally consult the public, 
environmentalists, industrialists and their provincial and 
municipal counterparts. 
But no, they decided to sit on their legally binding protocol and 
do nothing.  From the onset, this process or lack thereof has 
been marred by the absence of leadership, a lack of meaningful 
dialogue and, most importantly, an infuriating lack of openness 
and consultation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's refusal to get together and develop workable 
targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions leads me to 
several conclusions.  It never took its responsibility seriously 
or the government shuns accountability and it has something to 
hide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Really, to present a position at an international forum without 
having reached consensus in the domestic arena is a recipe for 
conflict.  It is an affront to Canadians that the government was 
not confident enough to sell this agreement at home, but is 
willing to take a secret agreement to Kyoto for the rest of the 
world to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it would fare the government well to brush up on 
environmental diplomacy and maybe start relearning what it means 
to negotiate effective global agreements.  Strategies to deal 
with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions must be developed 
with input from representatives of all levels of government, 
while balancing public, environmental and industrial concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is hypocritical in its approach to environmental 
strategies.  Why even bother to entertain the concept of 
environmental harmonization if in reality there is no intention 
of using provincial consensus for the really big issues like 
signing international agreements? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government had ample opportunity in the last four years of 
governing to learn from the mistakes made by the Mulroney 
government when it signed a deal in Rio without even thinking 
through the method of implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those targets have come and gone with absolutely no progress 
being made and still the same mistakes are repeated.  Evidently, 
issues such as consensus and feedback are not priorities with 
this government.  If the government has not yet even hammered out 
realistic and achievable targets, I will presume that it has 
failed to work out an implementation strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tremendous responsibility associated with signing a legally 
binding protocol in an international forum necessitates an 
incredible amount of consultation, research and planning. If the 
government had done its homework, it would have been able to 
answer such crucial questions as how much the implementation of 
said targets will cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conference Board of Canada in its comparative review of the 
economic impact of greenhouse gas reductions on Canada estimates 
that reducing CO2 to 1990 levels will cost the average Canadian 
family of four between $2,000 and $3,200 each year and those 
estimates will be much higher in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment has already told Canadians that 
this agreement will cost them money.  However, Canadians still do 
not know what form these costs will take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past eight years J. Allen Coombs, now retired chief of 
International Energy Markets and Environmental Emissions of 
Natural Resources Canada, worked on the stabilization of 
emissions to 1990 levels, stating that it would be virtually 
impossible. Canadians deserved answers months and months ago. 
Now, as time runs out, Canadians are more concerned than ever 
that this government has refused to protect their pocketbooks 
from arbitrary and Liberal closed door decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Weeks ago President Bill Clinton put the American position out 
for all to see.  The American government is firm on the fact that 
it will not participate in an agreement unless developing 
countries sign on, but the Liberal government remains silent. 
Canadian provinces have agreed that Canada should not sign on 
unless the majority of countries responsible for greenhouse gas 
emissions sign on.  But the government's silence continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If developing countries that are responsible for 40% of the 
world's emissions are not participating, will the Canadian 
government still take part despite the lack of a level playing 
field? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the government that in the next 15 years it is 
estimated that developing countries will be responsible for 60% 
of the world's emissions.  Without the participation of the main 
players, global benefits of pollution reduction will not be 
achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve to know what means of pollution reduction have 
been studied, whether or not voluntary incentives will be 
utilized or if a tax increase is the only option this government 
will consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the government to consider voluntary industrial 
incentives and for it to encourage Canadian companies to make 
environmental modifications within their companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are desperate to know just what the government has 
considered, what it intends to present and what it is willing to 
sign and under what preconditions.

responsible energy development principles and maximize voluntary 
efforts within industry but chooses instead to do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government decided that the co-operation and support of 
Canadians upon entering a legally binding protocol is no longer 
an issue?  Has this government even got support from its own 
cabinet?  Over the last few months contradiction after 
contradiction has emerged from the government side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance on November 12 in a last minute effort to appear 
diplomatic, the Minister of the Environment met with her 
provincial counterparts and a provincial accord was reached 
targeting 1990 levels by the year 2010.  At first this seemed 
like a breakthrough until of course the Prime Minister hastily 
brushed it aside and made it clear he is more interested in 
beating out the American position and that he feels no obligation 
to stick to the provincial agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government refuses to co-operate with Canadians on all 
fronts.  It has refused to engage in an open and meaningful 
democratic dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the position to be tabled in Kyoto on December 1 
will be the product of closed backroom politics. Unfortunately 
Canadians will likely pay the price for this government's lack of 
democratic consultation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will preface my question by saying that I am in the back row over 
here and the hon. member is in the back row over there and we 
really did not have much to do with the Kyoto process.  So let us 
take that out of the loop. Let us pretend Kyoto is not going to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious as to what the hon. member thinks independent of 
that process.  I agree that the correlation between what happens 
there and the reduction of greenhouse gases is a subject of 
debate. So let us take that out of the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What course of action in very general terms does the hon. member 
think Canada should take just to handle the problem independent 
of the Kyoto process because I realize it is a bone of 
contention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have to keep in context 
the size of the problem.  Canada puts out 2% of the world's 
emissions.  Since 1990 that has grown only by 8%.  It was thought 
it would be 13% but it has been reduced. There have been programs 
implemented and voluntary moves by industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see municipal governments more involved to get 
down to the grassroots people and education of our young people. 
We only have to look at what we are doing with recycling.  The 
hon. member referred earlier to a couple of <I>r</I>s. What 
happened there?  Everybody in this country recycles because we 
trained our children.  If we start education with voluntary 
programs there is lots that can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing we are worried about and the thing we wish would have 
been put to rest a long time ago by this government is the fact 
that we do not have a $4 billion solution to a $1 million 
problem. We have to make sure the reaction we come up with to 
this problem is somewhere close to the problem that it is 
intended to solve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw 
the House's attention to the fact that while Canada emits 2% of 
the world's total greenhouse gases, we are also the ninth largest 
emitter and we are ranked second in our emissions per capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious problem and it is a serious problem for 
all Canadians to engage in.  I am very curious to understand 
where these $4 billion costs are coming from. The hon. member 
sits on the same committee that I do.  When we were sitting on 
that committee we received representation from a witness who told 
us that by a very modest investment of around $16 million from 
NRCan they were able to undertake energy efficiency and 
conservation initiatives that saved the Canadian economy $4 
billion in energy costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this is such a terrible thing and I do not think 
members of the House would agree that this was such a terrible 
thing to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many no regrets sorts of things we can do to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.  My hon. colleague who is a medical 
doctor spoke earlier in the House.  She talked about the severe 
medical problems that might befall Canadians if we do nothing on 
this file as the member opposite suggested because he was 
concerned about some mythological $4 billion cost.  I am not sure 
where that figure comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the cost would be to the health system let alone 
the cost of illness in one's family or losing a loved one.  Those 
are costs that cannot be quantified.  Does the hon. member not 
think it is a good idea to implement a no regret strategy for 
investing in energy efficiency where we can begin to increase 
that $4 billion saving? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, some of the ideas we have 
heard tonight from the government side of the House are the kinds 
of things we have been asking for during the past three or four 
months.  What are the types of programs we are going to have in 
place?  What are we going to do?  What is the government 
proposing to be done to meet these emissions reductions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any voluntary action that can be made to reduce emissions would 
be tremendous.  My comparison of spending $4 billion to solve a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
a member of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development and as the member of Parliament for Nepean—Carleton, 
I am very pleased to rise in the House to speak on the issue of 
climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear a lot about this issue these days with the United 
Nations framework convention on climate change in Kyoto, Japan 
that is approaching this December.  Much attention has been 
focused on the implications of climate change not just in Canada 
but certainly around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment ministers from around the globe will meet in Kyoto 
to try to deal with this issue and take steps toward a solution. 
The eyes of many in the international community are upon Canada 
as the conference in Kyoto approaches.  The world looks to Canada 
for leadership and it is leadership that we must and I believe 
will demonstrate at Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the Minister of the Environment have 
stated that they are committed to working together with partners 
across Canada including other governments, non-profit 
organizations and the business community to seek creative 
solutions to this problem.  I sincerely applaud their efforts and 
their commitment and I wish them Godspeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the United Nations earth summit in 1992 many countries 
including Canada promised to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions 
at 1990 levels by the year 2000.  Rather than contributing to a 
solution however our country and others have had a less than 
impressive record.  While Canada is not the largest polluter 
overall, we have the second highest rate of greenhouse gas 
emissions per person on the planet.  Canada along with Japan and 
the United States are responsible for the lion's share of 
greenhouse gas increases between 1990 and 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wherever you live in Canada, whether it is in Placentia Bay, 
Newfoundland, Nepean, Ontario, Brandon, Manitoba or Whitehorse, 
Yukon, you should be concerned about global warming. According to 
the “Canada Country Study: Climate Impacts and Adaptation” by 
the federal environment department, in my own province of Ontario 
average annual warming of 3°C to 8°C felt especially during the 
winter months can be anticipated by the latter part of the 21st 
century.  As this warming progresses, Ontarians could be 
subjected to increased frequencies of extreme weather events such 
as severe thunderstorms and tornadoes or even long summer 
droughts as a result of global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Liberals we are not going to try to evade our environmental 
responsibilities as the Reform Party is attempting to do with its 
faulty science theory.  We know what our responsibilities are to 
future generations of Canadians and we are going to face them 
head on.  This Liberal government is committed to endorsing 
emission targets that can be realistically achieved on a step by 
step basis.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe an effective strategy in the global response to 
climate change must involve all levels of government, federal, 
provincial, and I put special emphasis on municipal governments 
because they are without question the level of government that is 
closest to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make such change happen throughout the country, we must look 
to individual communities for ways to enhance energy 
conservation, reduce energy efficiencies and improve our 
environmental record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we as Canadians begin this process?  First, because it is 
obvious that human activity causes climate change, I believe 
simple and even small changes in our own behaviour can help 
alleviate this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember not so long ago the concept of recycling and how 
it was the furthest thing from our minds.  Yet the vast majority 
of Canadians now recycle newspapers, cans, glass and plastic 
products without giving it a second thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look to other aspects of our daily lives and rethink 
some of the ways we conduct our lives, do business and travel 
from destination to destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Addressing the issue of climate change means doing things 
smarter and in many cases saving money in the process.  We must 
remember that there are many benefits to a cleaner environment: 
improved air quality, better environmental health, increased 
efficiency and I would venture to say as well increased national 
competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the agents of the status quo, the Reform Party, paint a 
doom and gloom scenario about the aftermath of Kyoto, the reality 
of improving energy efficiency and reducing waste is much more 
positive.  One thing that is also evident in terms of Canada's 
response to Kyoto is that there is no one magic solution which we 
can rely upon to deal with the problem. In my view it will take a 
wide range of creative individual measures which are targeted to 
reduce our emissions in specific ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at one particular aspect of the problem, 
transportation.  It is estimated that the transport sector is 
responsible for almost 27% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 
Canada and that this number may grow even larger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue which I believe the government must address on a 
national basis is that of declining public transit ridership. 
This is an area where I feel some substantial progress on our 
emissions could be made in a relatively painless manner.  How do 
we do this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking as a former municipal representative and transit 
commissioner here in Ottawa, I believe we can and should use our 
tax system to get people out of their cars and into public 
transit.  Nine tonnes of pollutants a year are saved by just one 
busload of passengers.  That is why taking public transit is a 
key step in taking solid action on climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent study by the Victoria Transport Policy Institute called 
“Employer Provided Transit Passes—A Tax Exempt Benefit” 
argues very convincingly that making employer contributions to 
transit passes tax exempt would help to improve the cost 
competitiveness of public transit in relation to the private 
automobile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study notes that the average commuter who owns an automobile 
and receives free tax exempt parking at the worksite pays 
approximately the same to drive as to ride a bus. The value of 
free or subsidized parking to employees is calculated at 
approximately $1,772 in average pretax income for each employee. 
This includes $1,200 in direct costs and $512 in tax exemptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study also observes that while Revenue Canada ostensibly 
collects taxes on parking benefits, it also provides exemptions 
for which the majority of employees qualify. Therefore from a 
policy standpoint the existing tax rules favour the private 
automobile over public transit, inefficient over efficient travel 
modes, and the economically more advantaged auto driver over the 
economically more disadvantaged transit rider.  Surely this 
policy area needs re-examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not the only one who believes that this type of measure 
could yield some significant benefits. A number of my colleagues 
and several organizations have thrown their support behind the 
transit benefit tax exemption proposal, including the Canadian 
Urban Transit Association, the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities, the Transportation Association of Canada, our own 
House of Commons Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development and the National Round Table on the 
Environment and the Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, the federal government's response to this proposal has 
been cautious as one might expect.  Both the Department of 
Finance and Revenue Canada initially opposed the idea of tax 
exempt transit passes citing lost revenues and insignificant 
reductions in automobile transit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1995 letter to the Canadian Urban Transit Association the 
finance department estimated this initiative would cause lost 
revenue of $140 million or $2,550 for each new transit user. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, according to the Victoria Transport Policy Institute, 
experience in the United States where this type of tax break has 
been available for 10 years suggests that our federal government 
may be grossly overestimating potential lost revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial government analysis assumes that transit benefits 
would be available to 50% of all transit riding employees, but 
the American experience indicates that less than 10% of employers 
provide such subsidies.  However, where such benefits are 
available, reductions of auto commuting of 10% to 30% are 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on a request made at the environment committee the 
Department of Finance is currently reviewing the proposal and is 
taking a closer look at the benefits and logistics of this 
initiative.  I sincerely hope the department gives this more than 
a cursory examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us involved in this initiative realize that results 
cannot be expected overnight.  However, as coverage of transit 
tax exemption is gradually extended to more and more employees, 
the benefits in terms of reductions in traffic congestion, 
greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, road and parking 
costs, and traffic accidents can be significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, the benefits add up to an improved urban environment, 
lower costs and a better quality of life for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other areas such as district energy where the 
potential for energy efficiency cost savings and emission 
reductions are also significant.  Hopefully I will have the 
opportunity to address some of those subjects at a later date.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in his presentation the hon. member made reference to an 
average annual warming of 3° to 8°C.  He probably misspoke 
himself and meant 3° to 8°C by the year 2050.  Even that comes 
from a 12 year old computer model which has long since been 
discredited even by global warming enthusiasts.  A computer model 
can be made to give an infinite number of results.  The present 
global warming dogma now puts 3°C by about 2050 at the top end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I am wondering if the hon. member is familiar 
with the work of Drs. Christy and Spencer, a climatologist and an 
astrophysicist, who for the last 17 years have been measuring the 
temperature of the earth's atmosphere on a continuous basis with 
satellite based microwave sounding units.  These are real 
measurements, real science, not computer models.  They have 
discovered that for the last 17 years at least the warming trend 
we are supposed to be so afraid of appears to be on hold and that 
there has actually been a very slight cooling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is probably of no statistical significance.  Nevertheless, 
it flies in the face of the conventional wisdom which says we are 
well on the way to being fried off the surface of the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what?  Theorists who compose these computer models 
actually had the temerity to say that the results of these 
scientific measurements could not be right because they did not 
reflect the predictions made in the computer models. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member familiar with the program and could he 
comment on it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis certainly addressed some of the scientific 
issues, but it is clear that parts of the planet are cooling and 
parts are warming.  However on balance the warming effect is very 
clear.  The vast majority of the scientific community would 
certainly agree with that analysis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a general principle we as elected representatives have a 
responsibility to address issues with the best possible 
information we have available.  The government is certainly 
attempting to do that.  The initiatives that will flow from Kyoto 
will make a lot of sense not just from an environmental 
standpoint but from an economic standpoint in terms of reducing 
waste and enhancing our cost competitiveness.  We can expect a 
lot of very beneficial things coming out of Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to categorically reject the suggestion that somehow or 
other the science is not clear on this issue.  The debate this 
evening has pointed out the problem with the Reform Party's 
analysis.  Everyone in the House is virtually agreed but the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the average Canadian and how they would look upon 
this debate, the average Canadian would have to come to the 
conclusion that perhaps the other parties seem to have something 
and the Reform Party seems to be a bit off base on this issue. 
That is unfortunate.  In terms of the committee's work over the 
course of the last month or so the testimony has been very clear 
and rather conclusive. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if we repeat something loud enough and often enough 
eventually it becomes a excepted dogma or universal truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by referring to a polemic statement 
written a little more than two decades ago.  It indicated that it 
was cold fact global cooling presented humankind with the most 
important social, political and adaptive challenge we have had to 
deal with for 10,000 years, and that our stake in the decisions 
we make concerning it is of ultimate importance to the survival 
of ourselves, our children and our species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one merely substitutes the word warming for cooling, the 
statement could readily have been made by an exponent of the 
doomsday scenario of human induced climatic disaster today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cooling statement was made during a period when the media 
and the public were much more skeptical and generally better 
informed with respect to science than they are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this new ice age scare—and I am sure there are people in 
this room who remember it clearly—there was no expectation that 
humankind could favourably alter climatic events by, for example, 
firing up their automobiles full tilt and injecting more carbon 
dioxide into the atmosphere.  Proposed actions were not remedial 
but they were more rationally protective and adaptive.  The scare 
died out and in due course the dogma of global warming became 
fashionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second major difference between then and now is that 
informed debate about the merits of the cooling theory was 
possible.  We did not yet have an entire generation of adults who 
had passed through the educational system with virtually no 
exposure to any type of scientific training.  Today scholarly 
dissent is scorned.  Scientists including many eminent 
climatologists who dare to question the popular doctrine are 
branded as thoughtless, uncaring enemies of the public good or 
tools of vested interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members from Lac St. Louis and Davenport and the leader of 
the third party excelled themselves this evening in invective and 
ad hominem attacks on anyone who dared to disagree with the 
popular dogma.  That indicates a certain weakness in their 
arguments.  If you cannot win it with rationale arguments, you 
win it by shouting louder and calling the Leader of the 
Opposition names.  It always works.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific method of investigation has been almost casually 
rejected.  Solid empirical temperature data have actually be 
disputed, as I mentioned a few moments ago, on the basis of mere 
computer modelling.  The modellers have won the battle for public 
acceptance of their theories.  Such is the state of scholarship 
near the end of the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of computer generated temperature projections which 
reflect the preconceptions of the people making them, proponents 
of the theory of anthropogenic global warming are predicting 
natural disasters which would make much of this planet 
uninhabitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister who is technologically and scientifically 
challenged has yet to issue a news release predicting that the 
skies will turn to buttermilk, but I am expecting to hear 
something like that from her any day now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Climate is a cyclical phenomenon.  It always has been and always 
will be.  Let us consider, for example, the little ice age which 
afflicted the northern hemisphere from about 1350 to the early 
1880s.  At its coldest during the late 17th century many 
thousands of European peasants died from exposure to the cold or 
starved because of 
crop failures brought on by this terrible climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had since the end of the little ice age an average 
temperature rise of between half a degree and one degree 
centigrade.  That is in the last 150 years.  I submit that is 
normal, predictable and reasonable in a cyclical system.  It is a 
rebound toward but not yet up to long term averages. Temperature 
measurements 150 years ago were pretty spotty, but I accept the 
proposition that the world is slightly warmer now than it was 
then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also accept the absolutely solid data collected by Drs. 
Christy and Spencer.  They are not local data.  They are data for 
the whole planet.  These satellites are in different positions 
every second and the measurements are being taken constantly. The 
measurements have been checked wherever they were able to get a 
juxtaposition of one of their readings with a reading from a 
radiosonde instrument, and the checks are perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is true science.  First you come up with a theory.  Then 
you do the experiment.  Then you decide if the theory is correct. 
The global warmers have put it backward.  They came up with the 
theory, say that it is true, and then reject any experimental 
data which contradict their preconceptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about the cycles of climate.  I would like to mention a 
couple of them with which I have some personal familiarity. 
These things have been going on forever.  I have examined mining 
operations dating from early Islamic times in North Africa and on 
the Arabian peninsula.  That would be 950 AD or thereabouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very obviously, from the debris around these places, the people 
who ran the operations had abundant water and abundant timber. 
Now these areas are deserts.  They have been deep deserts for 
hundreds and hundreds of years.  It did not happen due to any 
human activity.  There were not large numbers of humans on earth 
in those days.  What they did as far as contributing emissions to 
the atmosphere was perhaps to build a few campfires.  Yet there 
were these drastic climatic changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Vikings came to southern Greenland they found a climate 
much similar to the climate in northern Scotland right now.

the old settlements, the old stone walls, are reappearing.  They 
are an archaeological treasure.

very large divergences of opinion within the body.

the Chinese are part of his conspiracy theory?

I guess I believe in conspiracy theories.

my question will be short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there are many countries around the globe that are 
going to be at Kyoto and signing on to some sort of climate 
change package and commitment.  I would ask the hon. member if 
the scientific evidence on which they have based their decisions 
to participate at Kyoto is all false. Are all world governments 
operating with incorrect or faulty scientific information. Is it 
only the Reform Party that has the straight facts on this one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, science is not determined 
by a show of hands.  I would answer the hon. member's question 
with an analogy.  If he can recall Copernicus and Galileo, they 
were thought to be out of their minds.  The whole scientific 
community, the whole bureaucratic community, the whole 
ecclesiastic community, said these people were mad because they 
believed that the earth was not the centre of the universe, that 
in fact the earth and the planets rotated around the sun.  They 
received much the same treatment that some of your eminent 
climatologists today are receiving from the herd when they speak 
out against a theory which they say, in their opinion, is not 
proven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a scientific scholar but I did work in a scientific 
discipline for 30 years and I am capable of reading and 
understanding a scientific paper.  Unfortunately the majority of 
the people who have entered into this debate are not and cannot. 
I hope that does not sound to egotistical. Maybe it does but 
it is an unfortunate truth.  Unless one studies and learns how 
can one stand up and say “my god, I am an expert, I know it 
all”?

includes the following municipalities: Saint-Pierre les Becquets, 
Deschaillons, Leclercville, Lotbinière, Sainte-Croix et Saint-Antoine de

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several mayors and representatives of these municipalities have 
contacted my office to express their fears about the alarming 
information that appears in the national media about the future of the 
St. Lawrence River. They wanted the Bloc Quebecois and its environment 
critic, the member for Rosemont, to continue their attacks on the 
Liberal government, which does not seem to be concerned about the future 
of the St. Lawrence, preferring to give in to the western oil lobby 
supported by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Prime Minister who is responsible for environmental 
issues in his government. The Minister of the Environment or the Reform 
Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the St. Lawrence, scientists agree that the 
greenhouse effect will seriously affect it. According to a study issued 
last month by Environment Canada, the St. Lawrence will suffer the brunt 
of the negative effects of any warming trend; its flow would be 
substantially reduced. This negative impact would mean the disappearance 
of the aquatic grass bed, a key element in the reproduction of some 100 
living species. This study indicated as well that the average 
temperature would rise by 4 degrees Celsius. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we can see how the government treats Quebec when it has 
to make a decision on a subject as important as the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had hoped that the future of the St. Lawrence, the river that led 
our country's pioneers to discover Quebec and Ontario, would wake up the 
Liberals. 
But, no.  They were put to sleep by Reform gases from western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance claims to be concerned by the greenhouse 
effect.  He said that the question should be managed by several 
departments.  He even had the gall to say that the issue is often talked 
about during cabinet meetings. 
That is the way the Minister of Finance 
usually speaks, although he sometimes forgets things in his fiscal 
analyses.  For example, he said that his government must invest to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but he did not mention any specific 
amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance tried to tell us that he would propose 
concrete solutions, when, at the same time, he continues to subsidize to 
the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars the development of oil and 
gas resources.  For example, he gave almost half a billion for the tar 
sands project. 
Here again we can see where the Liberal government stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitments of the Liberal government with respect to the 
environment are clearly inadequate.  If the Minister of the Environment 
wants to be taken seriously at the Kyoto summit, she should go back to 
the drawing board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, John Fraser, the Canadian environment ambassador, sent a 
pressing message to the Liberal government, asking it to review the 
position adopted in Regina in mid-November.  He said that regardless of 
what we have done in terms of reduction, we have not done enough. And he 
went on to say that we all know that we can do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These words came from one of the many and invaluable collaborators 
appointed in 1994 by the current Prime Minister, but the Liberals are 
ignoring one of their own. 
Canada should follow the example of Quebec, which is the only province, 
with British Columbia, to have ratified the United Nations Convention on 
Climate Changes signed in Rio in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is proud of what Quebec has done in recent years 
in this area and intends to continue to pressure the federal government 
so that it understands once and for all the high stakes involved, the 
quality of life of the people of Quebec and of Canada.

speak at great length on this topic and I am sure members would 
be glad to listen to me if the rules allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard this evening from the Reform Party, there are 
still those who believe that climate change is not occurring. 
They think we have nothing to worry about and we can go on living 
and consuming as we have done for decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true there is a debate about the nature of climate change 
but no informed person could possibly believe that human induced 
changes are not occurring at an ever increasing rate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The great forests of the earth are disappearing rapidly. Perhaps 
I should say that the great forest of the earth is disappearing 
rapidly.  Huge areas that were previously covered with vegetation 
are now regularly laid bare for agriculture. Some of them have 
become deserts.  Automobiles and factories with their emissions 
are still multiplying and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things, including the very existence of our cities, 
have already affected climate.  Some of the direct effects on the 
atmosphere of such changes are already well established.  It is 
not a matter of conjecture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carbon dioxide, CO2, has been increasing in the atmosphere for 
generations.  This is one of the greenhouse gases which traps 
heat in the atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increases in other greenhouse gases have become measurable in 
more recent times.  These include methane, nitrous oxide, carbon 
monoxide and tropospheric, that is to say near the ground, ozone. 
Increases in these and other greenhouse gases should cause global 
warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the selective science we have heard from the Reform 
Party, there is no scientific debate about the increases which I 
have mentioned.  The debate arises as to the long term nature, 
magnitude and rate of change.  The global system is so huge and 
complex that it is not easy to predict how the system will 
ultimately react to such changes and what its feedbacks will be, 
but the great weight of informed scientific opinion around the 
world is on the side of global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that we insignificant human beings have got to the 
point where we can measurably interfere with this huge global 
system of which we are a part.  I do not know which is more 
scary, the fact that we can significantly alter this global 
system in a situation where we can predict the effects or the 
fact that we can significantly alter this global system when we 
cannot predict the effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to believe that one of the results of the changes, like 
those I have mentioned, is global warming.  I believe that the 
warming, with its various and enormous side effects, has already 
begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this despite the fact that, with colleagues, I am in the 
process of publishing three papers on glaciers and a lake which, 
for particular reasons, failed to demonstrate measurable global 
warming.  I thank God that the changes we are looking at are not 
yet so large that they can be detected with the data and time 
periods that we happen to have available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the point of view of this debate, from the point of view of 
us as members of Parliament, does it matter whether we are sure 
about global warming?  If there is a chance of it, surely we 
should take reasonable steps to prevent it on simple 
precautionary grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes which we have measured are bad enough in themselves. 
Who wants to live in an atmosphere of increasing ground-level 
ozone or nitrous acid, even if the climate is not warming? 
Ground-level ozone affects our lungs.  It makes breathing 
difficult for those with lung problems.  It decreases athletic 
performance. It also has a significant impact on agricultural 
production.  Studies show that it already costs tens of millions 
of dollars a year in Ontario alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that a polluted atmosphere is an effective 
greenhouse atmosphere.  Who wants to live in a poisonous 
greenhouse, whether it be warm or cold? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greenhouse gases, including ground-level ozone and acid gases, 
can be reduced and air quality can be improved by tough emission 
standards for vehicles, factories and homes.  We can use 
gasolines with lower amounts of volatile organic compounds.  We 
can also reduce those gases by saving energy through recycling 
and other sensible measures mentioned by the Minister of the 
Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should never consume energy unnecessarily.  It is 
inefficient, uneconomical and unhealthy to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greenhouse gases and atmospheric pollution can also be decreased 
by reforestation and proper forest management, and by low till 
and other appropriate agricultural practices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned today, there is another well-known example 
of human interference with the only atmosphere that we have, and 
that is depletion of ozone in the stratosphere.  I have to say 
that we are in a very difficult position because of these human 
actions of trying to increase ozone in the stratosphere and 
decrease ozone near the earth's surface as a result of the 
complications we have produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ozone in the stratosphere shields us from ultraviolet 
radiation which causes skin cancer and other horrors.  The action 
in slowing and one day stopping the depletion of ozone, in which 
Canada played a key part, is often touted as an example of what 
nations can do to prevent the deterioration of our globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should remember that despite the unprecedented 
international action on ozone depletion, the ozone layer will not 
be restored for 50 years.  Until then, skin cancer rates and 
other effects will still be high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, we are dealing with a huge system:  our 
atmosphere.  By the time we can detect effects, it is often too 
late.  It is a bit like trying to turn a supertanker around, only 
more so.  I believe that the people of Canada want their 
government, their businesses, their unions, all their leaders to 
set an example in combating global change.  They know that in the 
long run the only development that is possible is sustainable 
development.

<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the 
member on his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the hon. member used to teach at a 
university.  Having had this experience, I am sure he is familiar 
with the peer review process.  It has come to my attention 
numerous times in this House and in other arenas within the 
parliamentary sphere that the so-called scientific experts that 
the Reform Party is continually using to quote to debunk climate 
change science are individuals who are often citing opinion as 
opposed to scientific fact and they are certainly going without 
peer review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my hon. colleague could comment on the peer review 
process and why it is so significant for scientific research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of the Environment for her comments and 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true.  I have listened carefully to the Reform Party.  I 
am very wary of people who depend on authority, who depend on the 
name of a scientist.  In general, we have to look at the 
literature, as the parliamentary secretary has said, weigh it up 
for what it is worth, where it came from, whether it was peer 
reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The peer review process is quite simple.  It is when a scientist 
submits an article to a journal.  That article is sent to a range 
of experts, not just experts who have one opinion, but to a range 
of experts, and then the paper is returned with comments and is 
either published or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned three papers of my own.  Two of those are refereed 
and will appear in international journals.  The other is not 
refereed.  I think it is important to distinguish between those 
two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to my own work, I have worked now for 30 years.  I 
have mainly worked on glaciers and on lake ice.  If I can give 
the example of one of the papers because I deliberately mentioned 
the fact that these recent papers of ours do not demonstrate 
global warming.  No doubt that in some other house people like 
the Reform members opposite will use those as examples of the 
fact that global warming is not occurring, but in the case we 
looked at, if I can give one example, we studied two glaciers for 
30 years.  At the end of that time, the glaciers were smaller, 
but in all honesty, with the methods that we were using and over 
the time period that we had, we could not demonstrate a trend. 
It is in fact a trend that we are talking about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite was talking about the fluctuations of 
climate. The climate of the globe continually fluctuates.  The 
discussion today is about whether since the industrial revolution 
human changes, and I mentioned the very well established increase 
in carbon dioxide which has now been measured since the middle of 
the last century, are systematically moving the climate in a 
particular direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If greenhouse warming is true, the climate is going to continue 
to get warmer and get colder in a natural way, but when it is 
getting warmer the warming will be reinforced by the artificial 
changes which are occurring, the greenhouse effect, and when it 
is getting cooler the cooling will be reduced by the artificial 
warming which is occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not debating whether the climate was going up and down a 
thousand years ago.  We are debating whether since the industrial 
revolution there have been changes which have significantly 
affected the way climate varies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not expect climate with the greenhouse effect to simply 
keep warming and warming and warming.  It is going up and down 
and the greenhouse effect would gradually steer it toward higher 
temperatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say one more thing if I might because the member 
opposite spent some time on this matter.  It is not just a matter 
of statistics and gathering figures and putting trend lines to 
them.  There is also the matter of physics.  I have mentioned the 
changes which have been measured, CO2, nitrous oxides, methane 
and so on.  It is true those gases have increased in the 
atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The physics of that is that interacting with radiation they will 
warm up the atmosphere.  We do not just have to depend on figures 
and trends.  We have to use the science which is available to us 
in this century to support our opinions.  That is in fact what 
the scientific community is doing at the present time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight 
to stress the importance of acting immediately on the issue of climate 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of the Kyoto conference, we have a responsibility toward 
our children and future generations to put forward a responsible 
strategy that will protect our environment while ensuring a viable 
economy for years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of our environment is logical for several reasons. 
The most obvious one is, of course, maintaining a sound environment for 
the future generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My honourable colleagues from other parties have pointed out the 
cost associated with the use of energy in a responsible way, 
but they never talked about the consequences of not developing an 
environmental strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you an example. Not long ago, I was sitting on the 
Standing Committee on Natural Resources when our colleagues from the 
Reform Party asked: “Why should we in Canada undertake environmental 
prevention procedures if the other countries do not to so?” To that I 
responded that I was proud to be a Canadian. Canada has often shown the 
way to other countries, which then followed suit. It is because of 
attitudes like the one displayed by the member of the Reform Party that 
we sometimes have problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised to hear tonight the speeches of Reform Party members 
on the environment and on respect for our planet. They show a total lack 
of respect for our planet. These speeches should not even be tolerated. 
It is all fine and well to talk about scientists and experts. 
It reminds me of when I was working in a mine where there were 250 
Diesel engines about which the experts said that they did not affect the 
miners' health. Why? Because the company was profitable. Without saying 
that they were bought, it is still because of experts such as these that 
I have a damned problem. Please excuse my language, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do these members want to tell us that our children's illnesses do 
not involve any cost, that entire communities are not penalized when 
fish no longer have an habitat and fish stocks disappear?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility toward Canadians, namely to create a 
context that will ensure a prosperous economy, while protecting our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach put forward by this government obviously does not 
work. Following the Rio summit, the government set up a strategy which 
called for voluntary participation in the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions. What happened? Greenhouse gas emissions did not diminish. 
They did not even remain at the same level. In fact, they have increased 
over the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one point, the government wanted to put a stop to pollution 
along the highways, right across the country. Now, when someone throws 
something out of his car window, it costs him $1,000. I can guarantee 
that the roadside is much cleaner than before. It is so because the 
government took concrete steps that led to this improvement. I can 
guarantee that people would not have acted voluntarily, if it had not 
stepped in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, if the government told people it is giving them an 
opportunity to have a clean environment along the roads, coffee drinkers 
would not throw their cups out of the window. With a fine of $100, or 
even $1,000 in certain provinces, people keep their cups in the car and 
wait to throw it in a garbage can. I just do not believe in voluntary 
participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are colleagues in this House who do not think that it is very 
serious that Canada has been acting irresponsible for the last five 
years. They talk of the costs involved if we adopt a responsible 
position. But we are already paying the price for failing to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the government has conducted a study on the impact of 
climate change. According to that study, in my region of the Atlantic, 
we will be especially vulnerable to a rise in the level of the sea. That 
will mean more floods, the loss of habitats for certain species of fish, 
changes in the landmass and a drop in the reproductive success rate of 
marine birds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs are very high when there are floods. When fish stocks 
disappear, communities suffer. When will the government stop 
playing the ostrich and take its head out of the sand? The time 
to act is now and not 15 years down the road, when we will no 
longer be able to save our environment. We must act and act now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Acting now does not mean that our economy will be the worse off. 
There are alternatives that can create jobs while protecting our 
environment. Through simple measures such as ensuring proper maintenance 
for their vehicles, Canadians can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 
three tonnes per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of using 250 trucks that pollute the environment, we could 
use three locomotives that could do the same work but create much less 
pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking with CN officials this week. I asked them how many 
trucks on the road three locomotives would replace. They told me they 
would replace 250 tractor trailers. In addition to these 250 exhaust 
stacks, there are also 4,500 tires. What will happen to these tires 
later on? Most likely they will be another source of pollution. 
Now, six locomotives would do the same job as 500 trucks on the road. 
So, we can take our 4,500 tires and call it 9,000. Picture this, I drove 
my car from Moncton, New Brunswick, to Sussex and that took me 50 
minutes. During this trip, I met no less than 120 trucks coming the 
other way, and that is not counting those that were going in the same 
direction as I was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strategies could be developed to make the burning of coal less 
polluting. I have information here about new technology that uses coal 
to dispose of hospital waste in the United States. This technology is 
not only good for the environment, it is less expensive. Using this 
technology could mean savings of up to $400,000 a year for a hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental protection can be good for everyone. Other strategies 
could create more well-paid jobs over time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Through research and development, we could develop skilled 
labour that acquired its expertise here and that could then go and 
work outside the country.  Denmark is a good example of a country 
that decided to invest in energy produced by windmills and that now 
exports its expertise throughout the world.  We are already behind 
Europe on these issues.  We must act now to remain competitive in 
the energy sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is recognized worldwide as one of the best countries to 
live in. We have this reputation, because we are the leaders in a 
number of areas.  We show the world that assuming our 
responsibilities means creating a better world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a week's time, leaders from all over will be gathering here 
in Ottawa for the signing of a treaty prohibiting anti-personnel 
mines.  Without the courage of the Canadians, this historic event 
could not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are courageous.  They want their government to act 
responsibly and fairly.  They want us to be brave now.  This 
means setting specific objectives that will guarantee slower 
climate change.  This means we must all do our part and use less 
polluting forms of energy. This common effort must focus on 
strategies that are based on new technologies and that create 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most vulnerable industries, we must look towards 
diversification of local economies.  In the Atlantic region, we 
have seen what happened when the disappearance of an industry was 
not anticipated.  Now we no longer have any fish and entire 
communities are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to avoid such a situation, the government must 
develop long term strategies to prevent the disappearance of 
certain industries.  We must not just do the responsible thing, we 
must do the humane thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has never benefited when its government has refused to 
be courageous and do the right thing.  Protecting our environment 
is not only the right thing to do, but it is also the strategy that 
will ensure that Canada will still be the best country in which to 
live in the next century.

make mention of the fact that the hour right now is 22 minutes 
after 1 o'clock in the morning. I mention that only to illustrate 
the fact that the government is squeezing this very vital debate 
into a time slot that makes it almost impossible for members to 
be able to take part.  This is a shame. When the debate started 
yesterday, we ended up with 10 days to Kyoto. We are now down to 
nine days to Kyoto and we still do not know what the government 
position is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain what the Reform position is. As far as 
environmental protection is concerned, Reform along with 
governments, industry and Canadians all recognize that action 
needs to be taken to protect our environment where there is a 
demonstrable need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports environmental policies on greenhouse 
gas emissions based on concrete scientific evidence. The federal 
government has failed to provide documents that have formed the 
basis of the government's position on global warming. We wonder 
where the leadership of the government is coming from and 
obviously the Prime Minister is the leader of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to <I>Hansard</I> of November 5 and a question 
from my colleague, the member for Edmonton North concerning Candu 
reactors being sold without any environmental review by the 
government to Turkey and China.  In part the Prime Minister 
answered: “We believe that exporting Candu reactors is very 
important for the Canadian economy.  It is extremely important 
for countries which will use the electricity generated by nuclear 
power to replace coal, which is causing a lot of climate 
problems”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the Prime Minister and the Liberal 
government why he would make this quantum leap, this connection, 
when he should have been answering a question about why the 
government is not doing any environmental review on the Candu 
reactor sales to Turkey and China, he turned it into a global

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit, as have all other Reform speakers, that this entire 
process we are involved in is one of watching lemmings run.  It 
is one of very questionable science.  I quote the consensus of 
2,500 scientists that these members have been referring to. It is 
pointed out that 11 chapters of this supposed 2,500 scientist 
document were written by only about 80 authors.  Most of the 
hundreds of contributors listed were simply experts who allowed 
their studies to be quoted without necessarily supporting the 
report's conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, they state that the earth's average temperatures have 
risen by a modest 0.3° to 0.6° in the 140 years since records 
began.  They point out that most of this warming occurred before 
1940 and was followed by decades of climate cooling from about 
1940 through to the 1960s at a time when greenhouse gas emissions 
actually increased. Many climatologists feared the world was 
headed for a mini ice age.  This was referred to by my Reform 
colleague earlier.  Even the UN panel's chairman, Bert Bolin, 
admits that the pre-1940 warming is probably a natural recovery 
from an earlier natural cooling.  Instead, of the 96 years of 
this century so far, 32 show a warming trend and 64 show a 
cooling trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the items I have yet to hear in this debate tonight is 
mention of other natural phenomena like El Nino. We can expect in 
my constituency where we had record levels of snow, cold and 
freezing weather last year that this year the temperatures are 
going to be moderated and we will be receiving less snow.  Why? 
Greenhouse gases, global warming?  No.  El Nino.  There are all 
sorts of impacts on our climate that are natural impacts.  There 
are impacts that we as human beings can and do create but we do 
not understand the relationship between them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at Kyoto.  The countries that are going to 
Kyoto are countries like Canada.  Notwithstanding all of the 
claims that we have the second highest per capita CO2 emissions, 
the fact is that Canada puts out 2% while the U.S. puts out 23%. 
China, Russia, India and Ukraine combined put out 27% and guess 
what?  They are not going to Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my leader demonstrated earlier, there is a very real 
possibility that we will create serious problems for our economy 
in trying to achieve these objectives and we will destroy parts 
of this economy. If we are going to destroy our economy why are 
we doing it without a knowledge and understanding of the 
background of where we are coming from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is Canada?  Canada has already achieved 80% of its goals 
in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Most of the growth in 
greenhouse gas emissions is expected to come from developing 
countries.  Countries such as China and India will be the world's 
largest emitters of greenhouse gases by the next century, yet 
developing countries do not have to participate in the 
reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The possibility of climate change is a global issue and must be 
addressed collectively.  Developing countries are responsible for 
40% of the world emissions.  I repeat that this is a global 
problem and developing countries are responsible for 40% of the 
emissions, so why will they not be there? What are we trying to 
do in terms of paring down our economy for what goal or what 
objectives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure in Kyoto that any commitments made are in 
Canada's interest and recognize Canada's unique circumstances. 
Any greenhouse gas emission targets must be realistic, achievable 
and based on sound scientific evidence.  Therein lies the problem 
with the agreement from Brazil.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem there was that the goals were not realistic.  They 
were not achievable.  As we have clearly demonstrated they were 
not based on sound scientific evidence.  A national consensus 
should be gained before international commitments are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very scary that the government has made the commitment to 
go to Kyoto to sign an agreement without even telling us its 
position.  Who are the negotiators and what is the position the 
negotiators will take?  We have no idea.  Who is going to be 
giving them direction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is at stake for people in my constituency of 
Kootenay—Columbia?  Elkford, Sparwood and Fernie are all 
communities that are completely based on the coal industry.  The 
south country, Cranbrook and as far away as Creston, are the 
bedrooms for many thousands of workers from the Elk Valley.  In 
Golden and Revelstoke, CP Rail workers will be affected because 
of the amount of coal that is shipped through there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  If these people do not have work they will 
be moving out, which means the regional districts will no longer 
be able to collect their revenues.  What will happen to municipal 
budgets?  What will happen to libraries, garbage collection, 
water and sewer, and for what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me so much of lemmings.  Mr. Speaker, you may be 
old enough—I know I am—to recall a movie put out by Walt 
Disney.  It showed lemmings, which is what speakers from the 
other parties reminded me of, all headed in one direction.  They 
all jumped off the cliff. That was not true either; that was a 
fabrication of the moviemaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, a UN panel report stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A prudent way to deal with climate change is through a portfolio 
of actions aimed at mitigation, adaptation and improvement of 
knowledge.  The appropriate portfolio will differ for each 
country.  The challenge is not to find the best policy today for 
the next 100 years, but to select a prudent strategy and to 
adjust it over time in light of new information. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg the government not to let the word Kyoto become a word for 
needless economic suicide.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a rather 
frightening array of opportunities that I have to address as a 
result of what the member opposite just said.  Once again he 
evokes the pseudo-science that the Reform seems to have such 
great comfort in.  He talks about El Nino which has to do with 
southern oscillation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>El Nino right now is the most intense and longest El Nino we 
have seen in almost 2000 years.  Many climate scientists are 
talking about the connection of El Nino and global warming. There 
are connections the member seems to ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about a cooling period, but he neglected to tell 
Canadians that this was a period where ozone depletion substances 
were gathering and acting as a cooling.  This is a very clear 
piece of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on about developing countries not participating in Kyoto 
in the reduction of greenhouse gases. Again he is misleading 
Canadians because developing countries have ratified the 
framework convention on climate change.  They are taking 
significant steps to reduce growth in greenhouse gas emissions. 
Brazil, India and Mexico, for example, have dramatically 
increased energy prices and have launched specific programs to 
improve energy efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite does not seem to believe in any of this.  I 
would like him to speak on behalf of his constituents and tell 
something to the people of the south island state.  I had the 
opportunity of meeting the president of Micronesia who implored 
me to make sure that Canada did something significant on the 
issue of climate change.  His country of Micronesia was shipping 
rice to nearby island states because its taro fields were being 
flooded.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member's constituents welcome these people into their 
homes when they find out that rising sea levels have completely 
drowned out south island? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, where the member and I have 
a difference of opinion is that I do not profess to have any idea 
of the source of El Nino.  I am rather surprised she has taken a 
quantum leap on—I have no idea—its actual source.  There may be 
a relationship but we simply do not know.  Until we know, to 
trash our economy and trash the communities I represent are not 
acceptable alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the developing countries taking significant steps, I 
ask where Canada started.  Canada is in a position of having done 
a tremendous amount of reduction of CO2 emissions from 1990 to 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not really understand if we are at a level of only 
contributing 2% of CO2 emissions.  We are not just talking about 
CO2 emissions.  We are talking about greenhouse gas emissions 
that are broader than CO2 emissions.  We are at a point of having 
things in a position where we can continue to improve but are 
only contributing 2%.  She says we must do something significant 
on climate change.  Let us assume, just for the sake of argument, 
that Canada is in a cost effective position to reduce its CO2 
emissions and greenhouse gas emissions by 10%.  This would be a 
quantum leap.  In the case of CO2 it would reduce worldwide CO2 
emissions by .2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we do not have the developing nations, Russia, China, 
Ukraine and India at Kyoto, nations which combined contribute 27% 
of the CO2 emissions, where are we going with this?  Once again 
the position of the Liberals is one of do good, feel good. 
<P><A NAME="LINK289"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to contribute something to the debate that at this 
point I have not heard mentioned.  I am referring to the 
scientific method. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repeatedly in the debate I have heard members of the Liberal 
Party refer to the science of global warming.  However, before we 
can even attempt to purport to have a scientific basis for a 
theory, the theory should have passed the scientific method which 
is a randomized, double blinded clinical trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, in the case of global warming we would need two 
solar systems.  We would have to give the power to someone to 
increase carbon dioxide levels on the earth in one of the solar 
systems.  The person would be blinded to knowing in which solar 
system he or she would be increasing carbon dioxide emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we would measure the temperature of the earth in the solar 
systems, determine if there was any change and report the 
findings.  The findings would show that nobody knew, neither the 
earth nor the contributor of the carbon dioxide, which one was 
being contributed or which one had or did not have an increase in 
temperature.  These would be the results.  We would see that 
either increased carbon dioxide caused the increase in 
temperature or did not, and to what degree.  I am not saying that 
carbon dioxide emissions do not increase temperatures of global 
climates.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot lay our economic policies on the back of so-called 
science when in fact there is no science.  There is hypothesis, 
there are suggestions to some observations and what effects may 
or may not be happening, but there really is no science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The carbon dioxide 
emissions of our country apparently contribute to approximately 2 
per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions.  Many of the major 
nations with industries which emit carbon dioxide will not 
be at the table in Kyoto.  What is the point of such a small 
player in the world, a minor contributor to global carbon dioxide 
emissions, taking a world leading stance in what should be done when 
we do not have any real science on which to base our position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real disturbing thing is what the Liberals are proposing. 
The hon. member from the Liberal Party who spoke prior to me made 
reference to a dramatic increase in energy prices in some other 
countries in an attempt to curb their carbon dioxide emissions. 
This concerns me deeply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we curb the economic growth of Canada?  Why would we 
suppress our economic activity?  Why would we increase the price 
of energy, the cost of heating our homes and putting gasoline in 
the vehicles of ordinary Canadians?  I would add that it could be 
a very substantial increase depending on what position the 
Liberals take in Kyoto which to this point they have been either 
unable or unwilling to reveal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be the point in harming families, increasing the 
costs of heating their homes and fueling their cars when it would 
have no demonstrable or significant impact on the amount of 
carbon dioxide emissions in the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would again refer to what the hon. member from 
the Liberal Party stated when she referred to the fact that 
Reform members of Parliament are raising concern with this issue. 
She referred to our position as pseudo science.  My point is it 
is all pseudo science to suggest that the world is heating or 
the world is cooling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last winter in my constituency of Saskatoon—Humboldt we had 
record cold temperatures.  For as long as they have kept records, 
it was never colder.  That in itself is no evidence that the 
world temperature is not increasing but on the other hand it 
would tend to suggest that maybe it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a real problem. Despite the fact that the impact our 
carbon dioxide emissions will have is insignificant we may try to be 
a world leader.  Despite the fact that this may not have a basis 
in science, that it may not be true, and despite the fact that 
our measures are really not going to have significant impact on 
the carbon dioxide emissions of the world, we are going to 
implement serious tax increases for Canadian families on their 
fuel consumption for heating their homes and fuel their 
automobiles.  This will hurt ordinary average Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the tax increases which ordinary average Canadians 
have been exposed to by this Liberal government, the previous 
Conservative government and the Liberal government before that, I 
implore the Liberals to use and exercise common sense when they 
go to Kyoto and not subject Canadian families to yet another tax 
increase with no basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to raise an issue with the hon. member.  He was 
discussing taxes in his speech.  Does the member realize that 
$600 million has been given to the oil sands industry?  If we 
took that money out and the industry decided to raise taxes, it 
would be a carbon tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge industry out there making profits and it will 
raise the pump prices during mid-winter when we need fuel in our 
backyards to keep our homes warm.  All of a sudden the petroleum 
industry raises prices without warning.  Nobody talks about that, 
but for the last two months all we have heard is this carbon tax 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They finally recognize that there is an environmental problem. 
Maybe some common sense person deep down in their ranks had 
written that there is environmental consciousness in the Reform 
ranks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been snagging their scientific facts from a satellite 
scientist way out in outer space.  That is where their policy 
seems to be.  Satellites have been measuring temperature in the 
atmosphere, but if you measure temperature on the outskirts of 
greenhouse gas levels of course it will be colder. Those gases 
are trapped inside the atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was young I thought the sky was immense and there was no 
end to it.  However, when we grow up and look at the facts, we 
know that we live within the realm of our globe, our planet and 
our atmosphere.  We live and breathe as a species, collectively. 
We are interconnected.  That is what we have to realize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member tell his children and grandchildren 
about his beliefs?  His children and grandchildren will be the 
voters of the future.  They will be the ones to decide who will 
lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not really know how to 
respond to that somewhat disjointed and incoherent speech by the 
hon. member, except to say that when I go home to my constituency 
what I will tell the people I represent is that I am opposed to 
increased taxes on fuel, increased taxes not only on fuel for 
their automobiles but on fuel for heating their homes.  I am also 
opposed to a carbon tax which would cripple the petroleum 
industry and kill employment in the region of the country which I 
represent. I would like to see taxes scaled back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I want to see this country do is impose a 30 cent 
or 40 cent tax on gasoline.  That would kill even more jobs in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already facing increases in Canada pension plan premiums 
which will take effect if the government manages to ram through 
its legislation.  Payroll taxes will increase.  The cost to 
employers will increase.  It will affect jobs.  It will affect 
wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here listening to a member of the New Democratic Party who 
is proposing more taxes for ordinary Canadians.
