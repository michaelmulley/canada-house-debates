am pleased to provide a petition to the House signed by a number 
of Canadians, including from my riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that police 
officers and firefighters are required to place their lives at 
risk on a daily basis as they execute their duties and that when 
one of them loses their life in the line of duty, the employment 
benefits often do not provide sufficient compensation to their 
families.

life in the line of duty and wishes to support, in a tangible 
way, the surviving families in their time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners therefore ask Parliament to establish a public 
safety officers compensation fund for the benefit of families of 
public safety officers killed in the line of duty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just want to let you 
know that Reform Party members today will be dividing their time 
during the allotted speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a week ago in the House I 
traced the series of events which led to this controversy over 
displaying the flag in the Chamber.  It is not my intent to 
rehearse those events again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argued, however, that the fundamental issue at stake was one 
of freedom of expression, including the right to display the 
flag, the right to sing the anthem and the right to freedom of 
speech by members of this Parliament.  The challenge to the Chair 
and to the House was to find the right balance between all three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker's ruling yesterday focused on what was required to 
maintain decorum in the House, which is fine.  The Speaker 
implied that the rules of the House did not give him the 
authority to recognize the displaying of the Canadian flag on the 
desks of members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House is designed to change the rules and 
simply give that authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like you, Mr. Speaker, we have taken into account rules, 
practices and precedents affecting this House, but our position 
on this issue also takes into account what we believe to be the 
wishes of the Canadian people to whom this House ultimately 
belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government spin doctors have been hard at work putting 
their interpretation on this matter, let me first say what this 
motion is not.  It is not a motion of censure of the Speaker or 
the way in which the Speaker handled this issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This caucus is composed of blunt plain speaking westerners who 
tend to say what we mean and mean what we say.  We prefer to 
argue and to agree and disagree out in the open and not behind 
closed doors.  But this penchant for plain speaking should not be 
interpreted as any disrespect for the House or for the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this motion is not intended as a putdown of any members 
of this House, including members of the Bloc Quebecois.  It is a 
simple positive affirmation of Canadian nationalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Bloc never tire of exhibiting their feelings 
of nationalism in words, symbols and actions and their efforts to 
separate Quebec from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, however, simply want to remind the Bloc that there is also 
such a thing as Canadian nationalism.  Some people wear their 
nationalism on their sleeves and its slogans are always on their 
lips.  Other people are less vocal and carry their feelings for 
their country deep in their hearts.  It would be a huge 
miscalculation on the part of the Bloc to believe that those 
feelings do not exist in the hearts of Canadians or that they can 
be ignored or insulted with impunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of Burke's famous quotation that just because a 
few grasshoppers under a leaf make the field ring with their 
importunate chirping whilst thousands of great cattle repose 
beneath the trees, chew the cud, and are silent, pray do not 
believe that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants of 
the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third point is that one member of this House chose to see in 
our simple request to put a Canadian flag on our desks an example 
of extreme nationalism like that which led to World War II.  How 
anyone could characterize our simple request in that fashion is 
beyond comprehension.  I choose to believe the member misspoke 
himself or was perhaps misquoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I address the remainder of my remarks to government members. One 
of the disturbing characteristics of this government is that it 
seems unable or unwilling to finish what it starts, a sign of a 
government and a party in decline.  For example, the government 
started to get the federal fiscal house in order but after 
eliminating the deficit, which is only the first step, it appears 
to be giving up on the other steps of reducing the debt, reducing 
the taxes and controlling the spending.  It cannot finish the job 
it started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see the same thing on this flag issue.  On February 26 it 
was a Liberal member, the member for Oshawa, who provided the 
Canadian flags for MPs' desks with a little note requesting us to 
wave them when a certain Bloc MP rose in question period.  It was 
Liberal members, not Reformers, who brought the large flag into 
that part of the House and draped it over their desks, the same 
one they displayed during the budget speech without rebuke from 
the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the government House leader responding to the Bloc's 
point of order who said: “For someone like myself who believes 
strongly in the unity of this country, flag waving is not a 
provocation but an act of pride”.  The unbiased observer sitting 
in the gallery on that day would have been convinced it was the 
Liberal MPs who were foremost in promoting the displaying of the 
flag and the singing of the anthem subject only to certain limits 
perhaps yet to be determined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that date what have we seen?  We have seen a weak-kneed 
government beating an unseemly retreat.  By this last weekend the 
government House leader, so bold on February 26, had resorted to 
proposing the whole issue be sent for burial in a committee. Only 
in a Liberal government of Canada would it be suggested that the 
simple issue of whether a Canadian flag could be flown on the 
desks of Canadian members of Parliament should be shunted off to 
endless review and discussion by experts in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been backpedalling on its affirmation of the 
right to display the flag and sing the anthem since the day this 
issue was raised.  If government members now fail to back this 
simple motion, their retreat will be complete.  It reminds me of 
the New Testament parable about the foolish builder of a tower 
who neglected to count the cost before he began and became the 
laughing stock of his community because he began to build and was 
unable to finish. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Likewise the public, observing this unseemly retreat of 
government members, is left shaking its head and saying “these 
Liberals began something on February 26 but were not able to 
finish”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's behaviour on this issue raises a more 
fundamental question.  That is how can the government be trusted 
to stand up for Canada on the big things if it will not stand up 
for Canada on the little things?  How can the government be 
trusted to stand up for Canada in its larger dealings with the 
separatists if it will not even stand up for the Canadian flag in 
the Canadian House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is supposed to be the watchdog of the Canadian 
national interest, particularly in its dealings with those who 
would lower the Canadian flag from every flagpole in Quebec. This 
flag incident, small in one sense but ominous and large in what 
it portends, is revealing that watchdog for what many fear it has 
become:  a tired and toothless old watchdog which would prefer to 
lie in the sun scratching itself rather than defending the 
interests of its masters, the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore challenge the government members opposite and the 
members of the NDP and Progressive Conservatives.  If such 
members really stand on guard for Canada, support the motion.  If 
such members join with the separatists in opposing the motion, 
they should explain to the House and to their constituents how 
they can possibly be trusted to stand on guard for the Canadian 
national interest in larger and more substantive matters. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the 
hon. member's remarks.  The hon. member for Calgary Southwest 
labelled the Liberal Party of Canada a party in decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to have a look at the most recent polls 
carried out in his end of the country, in Ontario, in Quebec, on 
the east coast, in northern Canada.  Pick any poll he wants to 
and he will soon see that the only party in decline is the party 
of Reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Buried in a committee,” said the member for Calgary 
Southwest.  Only a member of the Reform Party would draw a 
parallel between taking any kind of an issue brought forward by 
any member of this place to put it into a committee, a place 
where Canadians are represented by their member of Parliament at 
committee, a committee that is the master of its own destiny— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  The Reform Party can laugh all they want 
but it does not intimidate me.  I have been around a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take any issue brought forward by a member of Parliament, put it 
to a committee for reasonable discussion and debate by all 
members who want to attend, because a committee is not restricted 
to membership so any member of Parliament can attend any 
committee of this place, include public debate, and only the 
Reform Party draws a parallel between that kind of important 
debate and burial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Which way are you going to vote on this, 
Stan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  The member for Calgary Southwest said 
that the government opposite does not stand up for Canada on the 
little things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Who did not come to Montreal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  They are very selective in the 
circumstances that have led up to this particular debate.  I 
remind my constituents in Hamilton West that it is the party 
opposite that decided not to go to Montreal and fight with the 
rest of Canadians when the country was in danger of separation. 
The country pulled together. 
Canadians came from my riding, from the riding of everyone on 
this side of the House, but not from the Reform Party members' 
ridings.  They talk about the flag, the importance of the flag 
and the need for it on this table.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is by the same party opposite for which the critic for 
finance took the flag out of its spot on his desk and threw it in 
the direction of the Speaker's chair. The member for Medicine Hat 
took this flag and threw it in the direction of the Speaker.  He 
was asked afterward, “Why did you do such a thing?”  He said 
“Oh, it's no big deal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is questions and comments.  I have made my comments.  I am 
quite disgusted by the hon. member's motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have three points. 
The member mentioned polls, he mentioned committee and then he 
rambled on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On polls, we would just suggest that if the hon. member has this 
great faith in polls, he should put this issue to a poll.  He can 
ask Canadians whether the Canadian members of Parliament should 
be entitled to have a small flag on their desks in the Canadian 
House of Commons. They can obtain the results of that poll and 
table them in this Chamber.  That poll will show that the 
position of Reform on this issue is far closer to the thinking of 
the Canadian people than anything that is presently— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  The member raised our skepticism 
with respect to committees.  The member will perhaps remember 
that it was this party that raised the simple business of singing 
“O Canada” in the Chamber.  When we came here, it was not sung. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we were denied unanimous consent by the now 
government House leader.  Eventually, it was sent to committee 
and it never came back.  It came back later at our insistence. We 
brought it back on referendum day.  It went to committee to be 
buried and not to be advanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last point is why does the member avoid the main issue?  The 
main issue is what could possibly be wrong with Canadian members 
of Parliament simply displaying a small Canadian flag on their 
desks?  Has the hon. member consulted his own constituents on 
this issue?  I find it inconceivable that they would deny that 
simple request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is some confusion about the 
wording of the motion.  Unfortunately, the wording of the motion 
that was handed in by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday was 
incorrectly transcribed in the Order Paper for today, which is 
the document in effect that I read from when I put the motion to 
the House earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will re-read the motion, corrected to correspond with the way 
it was handed in yesterday, as it should have been.  I apologize 
to the hon. Leader of the Opposition for this oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House then, is as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House should recognize the Canadian flag as an 
acceptable symbol that may be displayed at any time on the desks 
of Members of Parliament in the House of Commons provided that 
only one flag be displayed on a member's desk at any given time, 
and that the said flag remain stationary for the purposes of 
decorum and be no larger than the standard recognized desk flag.

<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, you 
have just re-read the motion, therefore I will not do that.  In 
essence, this motion today by the official opposition is a 
necessary motion and I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I will explain why we need to debate it.  I will 
argue that Canadians support this motion.  I will argue that 
allowing members to put flags on their desks is a positive, 
beneficial change in this House of Commons.  Then I will argue 
that it is the members of this House who must give direction to 
the House and to the Speaker, which we will do during today's 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also argue that this is, first of all, the very best way 
to put this issue to rest once and for all.  I know other members 
think we should send it to committee, that that is the best way 
to look at it and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what happens in committee.  Our victims' bill of 
rights was sent to committee two years ago.  Where is it?  No one 
knows.  It is in committee. 
It reminds me of a little poem that talks about this a little 
bit.  It says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oh give me your pity!<BR>

this?  Or is it, which it is, a simple straightforward motion 
that we have before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is, if we would like to, and I do not want to force 
anyone in the House, but if we would like to, should we have the 
right to display a small desk flag during our speeches, during an 
important occasion?  Should we have that right?  Yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are not going to be any maybe votes tonight.  There are 
not going to be any qualified votes such as “I sort of support 
it”. It is going to be yes or no.  Tonight we will know whether 
Canadians through their representatives feel we should have that 
right.  I think our position is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that a small flag tastefully displayed is a freedom 
of expression issue, it is a patriotism issue at times but most 
of all it is the rights of members of Parliament to express 
themselves in that way if they so choose.  I think Canadians 
would be fully supportive of this motion.  I think it is 
straightforward.  There is nothing unusual about it.  It is just 
a straightforward motion and I think we will see tonight that 
this is a positive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said, to quote Winston Churchill:  “To improve is 
to change.  To be perfect is to change often”.  Do we need 
changes from time to time in the House of Commons?  Yesterday the 
Speaker said we have never done this before so we cannot do it. 
As has already been mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, 
when we came here the singing of the national anthem was 
considered almost preposterous, outrageous.  Imagine singing the 
national anthem in the House of Commons.  We now do that.  Some 
people said, you will know Mr. Speaker because I think you were 
involved in this, that the prayer had been here for a long time, 
we could not change the prayer.  The prayer was changed.  Life 
went on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came here we could not mention the word Senate in this 
place.  We had to talk about the other place and everybody 
listening on TV said what is he talking about?   It is the other 
place.  Now we routinely talk about the Senate, the problems in 
the Senate, what we would like to change in the Senate, 
individual senators, whether they are good or bad, and so on.  It 
is routinely done and it is a good change, a positive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about asking questions regarding Orders of the Day. 
When we came here if something was being debated in the House we 
could not ask a question about it.  The Speaker every day or 
often jump up and say  “I think that relates to the Orders of 
the Day so I am going to rule that out of order”. Everybody said 
that is what we are talking about, let's ask a question about it. 
Eventually we got the government to agree that it would be okay 
to change so we could ask questions about Orders of the Day.  Not 
a big deal, life went on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came here, it was contentious if we had laptop computers 
on our desks.  I do not know if it was a prop or what it was.  It 
was to me confusing sometimes but it is just a laptop computer. 
If we want to have it on our desk then let us do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We not only changed that rule to allow laptops we now have 
laptops at the clerk's table.  It is commonly done, it is a good 
idea, so let us deal with it and move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we started in 1993 or 1992, certainly before we came here, 
there was but one flag beside the Speaker's chair and the Speaker 
came in and said, all on his own, “I want two flags”.  He 
increased the flag population by 100% and he did it because he 
said he thinks we can change.  I do not think it is a bad idea. 
It looks good on TV to have a flag on either side.  It looks 
good, and I like it, it looks fine.  No committee was struck, no 
debate was entered into.  It was just done.  The Speaker decided 
and it was done.  Life goes on and I think the Speaker looks 
great when he stands there on TV with the flags on either side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ordinary members of Parliament are not accorded such luxury. 
When the camera comes around to them there is no sign of the 
Canadian flag.  I have a small pin on my lapel.  That is allowed 
but it cannot be seen on TV.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last couple of weeks we have seen many small flags on 
the desks.  They look just fine.  I think they give an idea that 
we are watching the Canadian Parliament as opposed to the U.S. 
Congress or something else.  They look fine and are tastefully 
displayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion talks about decorum, the proper use of flags. That is 
what this debate is about, should we have the right to have a 
flag on our desk if we want.  I have already gone through all the 
changes made over the past few years, most of them on Reform 
initiatives.  They have gone ahead.  This is another good 
initiative. I think if members limit themselves to the motion 
today, they will in all good faith vote yes tonight. The members 
must give direction to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Speaker in his ruling said flags are not allowed. 
However he said if the House would like to give direction on this 
issue and change that, it could do so. The best way to put this 
to rest once and for all is to have a vote on it and give that 
direction to the Speaker.  The Speaker asked for it yesterday. 
He said that if the rules are to be changed it will have to be 
done that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is the way to end the debate on it.  After today the 
decision will be made.  The House will give direction to the 
Speaker.  The Speaker as a servant of the House will be expected 
to follow that wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of this House, the Reform Party strongly believes 
that we should move ahead with this change.  Change is good.  As 
I mentioned earlier in my quote, to change often is even better. 
If we can have a positive change like this one, let us do it. Let 
us not send it off to committee to die the slow death of a 
thousand cuts.  Let us just get it over and done with and do it 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think this is the way to end a protracted debate.  It will be 
over before we know it.  Tonight when the votes are called the 
decision will be in and it will be over.  I only ask that all 
members think how they are going to respond to their constituents 
back home, how they are going to argue against it. Again they are 
not compelled to have a flag.  It can be there if they would like 
to have a flag on their desks, and some members would like that 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it is a positive, beneficial change which would allow 
that freedom of expression we cherish in this place and across 
the country.  Someone said earlier such freedoms could exist in 
the chamber of commerce but not in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To strengthen our proposal, I would like to move an amendment 
that would make it just a little stronger. I move: 
<A NAME="LINK26">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting the word “should”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That way the House can speak unequivocally on this issue and 
tonight it will give that unequivocal direction to the Speaker. 
We look forward to that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair takes the view that the 
amendment proposed by the hon. member affects the English version 
only and on that assumption I will put the motion to the House. 
The debate will be on the amendment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member from Hamilton has already spoken.  You 
will recall that the two members were dividing their time.  The 
hon. member has already addressed the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  For questions and comments there is a 
new slate for every speaker. The hon. chief opposition whip has 
made another speech.  While it may be splitting time, obviously 
if the parliamentary secretary rises, I am going to recognize 
him. The parliamentary secretary has the floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this motion is so full of 
holes that I will probably comment on every speech if you will 
recognize me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whip of the opposition party is suggesting that we on this 
side of the House have not consulted with our constituents on 
this matter.  In my hometown of Hamilton, radio station CHML's 
<I>Talk Line</I> with Roy Green had an open line show for two or 
three days on this issue.  He asked three questions:  Do you want 
them to have a flag on their desks?  Should they sing <I>O 
Canada</I> in the House of Commons?  If they do not, should they 
be thrown out of the House of Commons? After a couple of days and 
about 36 calls he said the response was unanimous for all three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked me if I had received any calls.  My constituency office 
in Hamilton received 62 calls before the radio show ended.  My 
constituents told me to just get on with the job I was elected to 
do.  That job is to put legislation through the House. It is not 
to get in line behind this opposition party which needs to bring 
forward these arguments about the flag because its members are 
not being heard much by the press.  They are the opposition. 
Their kissing cousins in the Tory party are getting all the press 
because its leader is thinking of becoming a Liberal.  They need 
all this attention.  That is why they have to create all this 
malarkey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Does the flag mean anything to you in 
your gut? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Yes, I say to the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did consult with my constituents.  After that radio show we 
received another 40 or 50 calls in the constituency office within 
about an hour and a half.  Again 70% told me to get on with the 
job which I was elected to do in the House and not to carry on 
with the nonsense in the motion which the Reform Party has put 
before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am forced to speak to it because that is the only business we 
can do today.  The only business we are allowed to do in the 
House today is the ridiculous motion which has been put forward 
by the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one last thing I want to address with the whip.  I 
heard him on television this morning and I heard him in the House 
of Commons today.  He talked about freedom of expression and its 
importance.  Freedom of expression is a necessity for the 
democracy of this country and the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member opposite not admit that freedom of 
expression has borders?  It has to have borders. Freedom of 
speech and freedom of expression mean that we can do such things 
as stand up in a crowded movie theatre and yell fire but that is 
against the law.  Freedom of expression means that we have to do 
it in a responsible fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite must understand that when we are 
talking about flags, and when we are talking about a decision 
made by the Speaker yesterday in the House, there are borders. 
Order has to be maintained and not the disorder which brought 
about this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the 
parliamentary secretary has taken such a calm, rational approach 
to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He may be the main man for the Liberals today, I do not know. He 
may have been asked to pose these insightful questions, I do not 
know.  But I hope he will not continue down this road of equating 
a small standard desk flag attached to the desk for decorum and 
tastefully displayed with crying fire in a crowded theatre. 
It is such a ridiculous thing to say.  I cannot believe he is 
trying to bring that kind of an argument into this debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to suggest that the radio program asked whether we 
should have to display the flag; whether we should have to sing 
<I>O Canada</I> or get kicked out of the House of Commons.  What 
kind of nonsense is this?  No one is suggesting that.  No one 
suggests that we have to have a flag on your desk.  No one 
suggests that we have to sing <I>O Canada</I>.  Every Wednesday 
those who like to sing it do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is not going to force someone to do anything.  It 
permits a freedom.  It is that balance between decorum which is 
why it is tastefully displayed on the desk and the freedom of 
expression.  That balance is what this motion talks to and it 
handles that balance very well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to participate in this debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we had the Speaker's ruling.  Today we have an 
opposition motion which among other things serves, in a way which 
is not totally wholesome, as a mechanism to appeal the Speaker's 
ruling.  This is something that has been disallowed for the last 
30 years in this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our flag is an important national symbol.  As I pronounce these 
words there are two flags beside Mr. Speaker.  There are two 
flags outside the door of the House of Commons.  Every MP can 
have one beside his or her desk; I do in my office just a few 
feet away from the door.  I usually wear one as a lapel pin. 
There is one on a flagpole in my yard at home. As well I have one 
in my office in my residence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question before us today is not whether or not Canadian 
members of Parliament are in favour of the Canadian flag.  I do 
not believe any of us on this side of the House need lectures 
from the official opposition on the Canadian flag and its value. 
It was a Liberal government that gave us the maple leaf flag in 
1965.  It was just three years ago that we introduced flag day, 
our national celebration of the maple leaf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was this government that encouraged Canadians to show their 
patriotism by distributing a million flags from coast to coast to 
coast.  Which party objected to that?  Which party told us not to 
fly the Canadian flag from coast to coast to coast the way the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage asked us to do?  It was the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 on that day in October many of us went to Montreal when 
our country was calling.  Our country was asking us to show our 
patriotism, real patriotism, not the kind of phoney stuff I have 
been hearing over recent days.  All federalist MPs except one 
group went to Montreal.  Two thousand of my constituents went 
with me to Montreal.  Canadians from all over the country went to 
Montreal.  We all stood there beside that great big flag of the 
Jaycees of Windsor to support the Canadian flag and Canadian 
unity.  Who was missing?  The Reform Party.  The Reform Party 
boycotted Canada when Canada came calling.  That is the reality. 
Everyone in this House knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the separatists have a different point of view. They 
want to separate from Canada.  I disagree with their point of 
view but at the very least they did not do as those people across 
the way and pretend that they were in favour of Canada today 
while making gestures that were the opposite only yesterday.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about respect for the rules and respect for the 
House.  What have we seen over recent days?  Challenges of this 
great institution, challenges of the Chair, challenges of 
everything we stand for.  Taking a Canadian flag, wrapping it 
around oneself and driving around Parliament Hill in an old 
jalopy in the name of patriotism is the kind of thing we have 
seen from hon. members opposite.  Is that patriotism?  No.  That 
is making a mockery of our institution.  We all know that is what 
it is.   We know what it stands for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about respect for the rules.  We had grown up 
people, so-called adults, wearing Mexican hats and dancing in 
front of the Chamber of this parliament.  In 1993 the then leader 
of the third party, today the Leader of the Opposition, snubbed 
the governor general on the opening of parliament.  That is what 
we had in the name of respect, in the name of democracy and in 
the name of our rules?  No, that is not patriotism. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often quoted in this House and elsewhere the words of a 
great Canadian, a person who did not have the word “reform” as part of 
his title but as part of his ideology, and this great Canadian was none 
other than Mr. Diefenbaker. He once told us there is no greater honour 
for a Canadian than that of serving the people of his or her country in 
the highest court of the land, the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the honour that rests on our shoulders. We must show 
respect for this institution by respecting its rules. We must not let 
parliamentarians throw flags at other members, as has been done in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days ago, I saw with my own eyes a member of this House take 
a flag off his desk, which, in itself, is against the rules, and throw 
it in the direction of the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was this done out of respect for the flag, for democracy and for 
Parliament? No, that is not patriotism either. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members across the way say today that they are sincere in 
their motion.  They produced a motion yesterday, added a word by 
hand to it and then produced an amendment today to remove the 
word they had pencilled in by hand to stop the House from 
amending the motion, if the House so wished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is a game for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  It is a game.  It is a cheap political 
trick from members opposite.  Canadians will know that is all it 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition, with a straight face, told us a 
few minutes ago that the matter could not be referred to 
committee because nothing would ever come of it, so he said.  His 
seatmate brought a motion to a committee concerning the singing 
of the national anthem and it is thanks to that motion we are 
actually doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the Leader of the Opposition have so little confidence 
in his own colleagues sitting on that committee, including the 
member who got a motion through committee in the last parliament 
concerning the singing of the national anthem?  Or, was it that 
deep down the Leader of the Opposition knew the truth was a 
little different?  I say this respectfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Get this in <I>Hansard</I>.  I had to 
ask to get him to come as a witness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  In the few minutes I have left, let me 
say that I believe all Canadians should know that on February 15, 
1995 we had the official ceremony on Parliament Hill to honour 
the Canadian flag.  It was the first Flag Day. 
Members from all parties came.  The leaders of the federalist 
parties were there.  One leader of a federalist political party 
was not there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  The present Leader of the Opposition 
did not even care enough to show up to honour the Canadian flag 
in front of the building.  This is duplicity at its best.  This 
is not sincerity but the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposite quoted Sir Winston Churchill a little 
earlier today.  He talked about how Sir Winston Churchill wanted 
change.  To this day in the British House of Commons there is no 
flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members across the way that if Sir Winston 
Churchill were here today he would look upon the Leader of the 
Opposition and say to himself what he once said in the British 
House, that the opposite to the truth had never been stated with 
greater accuracy.  He would no doubt want to say that about the 
speech of the Leader of the Opposition earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot support the motion.  It is wrong and it will always be 
wrong.  We must uphold the Speaker's ruling.  We must continue to 
express our confidence in the occupant of the chair.  We will do 
so because it is the right thing to do, notwithstanding the cheap 
tricks across the way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset of my brief comments I would like to ask a 
question of the people of Canada who are watching this debate 
today.  The governing party, the Liberal Party of Canada, would 
like this issue to go away because it feels it is frivolous and 
unnecessary.  I ask the people who are watching to be the judge 
and decide who is calmly putting forward the motion, who is 
trying to speak to it in a calm and collective manner, and who is 
putting forward some ridiculous arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member remarked that even the British parliament did 
not allow members of Parliament in the mother of parliaments to 
have small flags on their desks.  That is the best excuse he can 
come up with.  I remind the hon. member, in case he has missed 
the point, that to my knowledge the British parliament is not in 
an ongoing crisis mode about national unity, which we seem to be 
in this Chamber.  People are getting sick of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that this was a procedural game.  The father of 
all procedural games is condemning the official opposition for 
what he views as a procedural game.  He then has the audacity to 
call this a cheap political trick.  Is it a cheap political trick 
to want to display, at our own discretion, a small Canadian flag 
to show our patriotism when our country is in its hour of need? 
Is that a cheap political trick to the hon. member across the 
way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who spoke earlier talked about a radio station 
in Hamilton.  He said there were 36 calls, 50 calls, 60 calls. 
Surely the hon. House leader of the government knows how many 
faxes, phone calls, letters and e-mails came in to the 
government, the ministers, members of Parliament or the Speaker's 
office over the last couple of weeks.  I would ask him to reveal 
today just how much feedback is necessary from the Canadian 
people before we decide to change things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that we have to uphold the Speaker's ruling. The 
Speaker invited us yesterday to bring forward change if we 
desired reform.  If not us then who when it comes to making 
changes in here?  If not now then when? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to 
the hon. member.  He has just challenged me and I will offer him 
a challenge in a minute in response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first quote a distinguished member of the House who said 
on February 15, 1996 about the Canadian flag celebrations: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wish there were some substance to go along with the 
symbolism.  Setting aside a day for waving the flag, jumping up 
and down and singing stirring songs is a nice gesture.  It's also 
a good way to keep warm in mid-February, but Canadians would 
rather see some substance from this government, a national unity 
plan, real job creation, a balanced budget and much needed tax 
relief.

out across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a challenge for hon. members across the way.  I will 
propose a motion and I will seek unanimous consent from all 
members of the House, and in particular members of the Reform 
Party members.  If it is change they want there will be no games. 
I will ask for unanimous consent, for us all to agree, and I 
will make it very clear.  If they really want change and if they 
want the issue to be studied, I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting immediately before the 
words “this House” the words “the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs” to prepare a report by June 15.

talking about employment insurance, instead of talking about the 
problems being experienced by the unemployed who are going to miss 
out on benefits, instead of talking about economic development, 
instead of talking about the battle against AIDS, instead of 
talking about the major social problems confronting this country, 
what are we talking about?  The flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are questioning whether the Chair's ruling about whether or 
not we can stick little flags on our desks ought not to be 
overturned. Most edifying, this 1998 Reform version of the Canadian 
vision of development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who was it who broke the rules of the House?  Who was it who 
stood up at an inopportune moment to sing the national anthem and 
wave flags around?  Not the Bloc Quebecois members, but the 
Liberals and the Reform members.  Who was it who created a totally 
artificial crisis about the flag? Not the Bloc Quebecois, not the 
NDP, not the Conservatives, not the Liberals, but the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who was it who refused to respect the House of Commons and its 
procedures?  Not the Bloc, not the NDP, not the Conservatives, not 
the Liberals, but the Reform Party.  Since the beginning of this 
story, Reformers not only caused the initial problem, but they 
exacerbated it.  They let the rest of Canada think the Canadian 
flag was being challenged here in this House, which was never the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> No, never.  They are liars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> No fear, this is reassuring for the 
sovereignists. 
When there is no crisis in this country, Reformers cook one up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is going on here? Do the people Reform represents 
have such a serious identity problem?  Is there such a serious 
identity problem over there that it is necessary to wrap oneself 
in the flag daily, to stick them all over the place, wave them 
about, put them in our pockets, or paint cars to match the Canadian 
flag? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is going on with this political party? Is there no 
grasp whatsoever of what the rules of Parliament are?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they not understand that, in a Parliament, regardless of one's 
political opinion, one must respect the foundation, that is the Chair, 
its rulings and the rules under which debates must take place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we suddenly change the rules of this House following a 
show of enthusiasm by Reformers and Liberals? Why should we start waving 
flags at every opportunity? What is going on in this country? Do 
Reformers have a problem of perception, a problem of identity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are spoiling for a fight with the separatists. They are intent 
on scoring political points. They want to pass themselves off as the 
only patriots in this country. Just what is the problem with Reformers? 
What is the problem with the official opposition? 
What sense of responsibility do these members have? They were so happy 
to become the official opposition and replace the bad separatists in the 
House of Commons, so they could make things move forward in Canada, they 
could make things work in this country. What are they proposing to make 
things work? They are talking about flags. This is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard all kinds of falsehoods. First, some tried to tell the 
rest of Canada that sovereignists wanted to deny the existence of the 
Canadian flag. This is false. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
We never said any such thing in this House. It was also said that 
separatists had objected to the singing of the national anthem in this 
House. In fact, we were among those who agreed that, on Wednesdays, at 
the beginning of our proceedings, the national anthem be sung. It is 
false to say, as Reformers claim, that we object to the singing of the 
national anthem in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge them, including the Leader of the Official Opposition, 
to find a single objection to this effect raised by a Bloc Quebecois 
member. 
The Reform Party leader did not tell the truth. We did not create a flag 
crisis. We did not oppose the national anthem. We have always respected 
the flag, the anthem and the rules. We have complied with the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today challenges the Speaker's ruling, which 
is based on parliamentary law, on tradition and on what is being done in 
every Parliament. But why do Reformers want the Parliament of Canada to 
be different from all other parliaments? What is going on in their 
heads? Do they have such an identity problem that they have to wrap 
themselves in the Canadian flag to remember they are Canadians? Is this 
their problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the Reform member said that, by the end of this day, those 
who are watching us would be able to judge who was more serious, who 
presented the best arguments, who is right. People made up their minds 
a long time ago. 
So did journalists.  All parliamentarians on both sides of the 
House, in all parties except the Reform Party, understood long ago 
that there was no flag war, that we were being made to waste our 
time.  Instead of addressing real problems, Reformers are having 
fun adding fuel to a possible debate between sovereigntists and the 
rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is this.  Reform members can rest assured that 
sovereigntists do not have to invent an artificial flag war to make 
Quebeckers understand that there is a problem in this Parliament. 
We do not need to invent quarrels with Reformers.  They invent them 
all by themselves. 
We do not have to come up with things to explain to Quebeckers that 
there is an identity problem.  They provide us with evidence on a 
daily basis.  That is what is wrong with the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not respect the Chair, the Speaker and other political 
parties.  They were unable to sign an agreement with other parties 
that was reasonable and that would have made it possible to resolve 
this supposed flag crisis.

we have certainly heard a lot of sound and fire, signifying

teach us about tolerance when we have his government in Quebec 
which says that even in Chinatown the use of English is incorrect 
on signs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that it was his member who went to Nagano at 
Canadian taxpayers' expense, costing probably in the 
neighbourhood of $15,000, to attend the olympics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She not only brought this whole issue to a boil as a result of 
her very intemperate comments with respect to the show of 
patriotism of our Canadian athletes in Nagano, but she also said 
that one of the reasons why she was there was so that she could 
make contact with and learn about international affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If and when she and the colleagues in that party are ever to get 
their wish of being able to smash Canada, she would be able to

She was doing this at Canadian taxpayers' expense.

by the House leader rather than as an issue being terminated

</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, I quote Mr. Speaker yesterday from <I>Hansard</I>. 
He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I have been challenged to show my colours as a patriotic 
Canadian by allowing the unfettered display of flags in the 
Chamber.  This would constitute an unprecedented unilateral 
change to the practice of the House of Commons, a change, my 
colleagues, that no Speaker has the authority to make.  So, 
whatever pressure that I have to do so, I cannot and I will not 
abrogate such authority to myself.  Unless and until the House 
decides otherwise, no displays will be allowed and the current 
practice will be upheld. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His words, were “unless and until the House decided otherwise, 
no displays will be allowed”.  The whole purpose of this motion 
is to get on to the floor exactly that question so that we will 
be able to see which members of this Chamber choose to support 
the separatists and not permit the display of flags in this 
Chamber.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have heard 
the member's comments, because I can now clarify certain things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he has just talked about what is going on in Quebec. 
I would like to say in this House and tell the hon. member and 
anyone else interested that no minority in Canada receives better 
treatment, has more institutions and enjoys more rights than the 
anglophones in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do francophones in Canada, wherever they live in Canada, have 
their own universities, colleges, CLSCs and hospitals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anglophones can manage their own school boards.  They can 
do all that. 
They have their own press, television and radio, which are very 
much at home in Quebec.  What francophone minorities in certain 
western provinces have anywhere near the privileges enjoyed by the 
anglophone minority in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Not a one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Let the rest of Canada begin by giving 
francophones the same room and opportunities for development that 
Quebec offers anglophones, and we will take notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has just said “It was the Bloc member who went 
to Nagano at taxpayers' expense”.  Are you aware that Quebeckers 
pay more income tax than Manitobans, than Albertans, than British 
Columbians?  Do you realize they pay 23 per cent of Canadian income 
tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Thirty-one billion dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> When are people going to realize that 25%

about spending our money.  However, we would prefer to manage it 
ourselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I very 
much welcome the opportunity to enter the debate on the official 
opposition motion which is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a few words about what the debate may appear to be 
about, what the Reform Party would like to pretend this debate is 
about, and then I want to say something about what this flag flap 
issue is really about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would try to create the impression that this is 
a simple, straightforward issue, that it is a simple question of 
whether members of the House want to display on the corner of 
their desks a Canadian flag.  That is all it is about.  That is 
all there is to it.  Let us just vote for it and get on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that I do not think that is what this issue is 
really about.  I do not think that is why the official opposition 
has put before the House today a motion which it wants Canadians 
to interpret as meaning that we either vote for its motion on its 
terms and show we are for Canada, we are for the flag, or if we 
vote against the motion on its terms and then we are not for the 
flag and we are not for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is about Reformers whose approach to politics is so 
simplistic that they would have Canadians believe that flags on 
the corner of the desks of members of Parliament will unite the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no committed federalist in this House who is not proud 
of the Canadian flag.  There is no committed federalist in Canada 
who is not proud of the Canadian flag.  Let us be clear.  What 
this is about is the Reform Party trying to create division among 
those who were elected to this House of Commons to stand up for 
Canada and to fight for a united Canada.  We will not be divided 
by those crass, cheap political tactics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me briefly review the tactics used by the Reform Party in 
this flag flap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in what our Speaker has properly ruled as inappropriate, 
Reformers used a proud symbol of Canadian freedom, our flag, to 
stifle the freedom of speech of one of our colleagues.  Then, not 
having got their way with the Speaker, out of respect for the 
Canadian flag, a Reform member threw it on the floor of the House 
of Commons and marched out of this chamber. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT16"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT16"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1115

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then Reform members, again not in a very proud moment in the 
history of this Chamber, tried to intimidate the Speaker by 
suggesting that if he dared to rule that Reform members had used 
the flag improperly he should fear for his job.  Those kinds of 
intimidation tactics of the Speaker have no place in this Chamber 
and have no place in parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, the leader of the Reform Party suggested 
that this kind of hooliganism by his members was perfectly 
acceptable; it was, after all, just a question of freedom of 
speech.  When I last checked the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
it did not guarantee the right of people to threaten and to 
intimidate, particularly in this parliamentary institution.  It 
was a shameful display by the official opposition and its leader. 
It did no credit to any of us. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a debate about the flag.  The Reform merely wants 
to take advantage of any opportunity to create division and 
confusion.  Major issues for Canadians, such as jobs, education and 
health care, are too important for us to waste the precious time we 
have here in the House of Commons on other matters.  But the Reform 
members do not seem to find them important. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic in the extreme that this is the week Reform members 
wrap themselves in the flag and say they are the true loyalists, 
the true patriots of Canada.  This is the very same week that 
Canadians across the country are calling on their government and 
their members of Parliament to stand up for Canada's future, to 
say no loudly, clearly and without equivocation to the 
multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the adolescent pranksters of the Reform zealots had their 
way, all that would be left of our country would be the flags in 
the corner of our desks.  They want to see the MAI, an investors 
bill of rights, approved, an MAI without protection for Canada's 
culture, without protection for our health care, our environment 
or our employment standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job of running the country would move from Parliament Hill 
to corporate board rooms in New York, Tokyo and Seoul.  We might 
be able to have flags in the corner of our desks, but in Reform's 
Canada after the MAI, MPs would not be able to effect most of the 
issues that directly affect the lives of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is Reform's vision for Canada.  That is Reform's vision for 
the flag, a small flag on the corner of our desks in a toothless, 
powerless parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform members showed no respect to the Canadian flag when 
they threw it on the floor of the House of Commons.  I want 
Canadians to know what the Reform is up to.  They are playing a 
dangerous game, a divisive game, a childish game, and we must join 
forces to put an end to it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is behaving like a school yard bully. We 
all know the way to deal with bullies and that is to stand up to 
them.  Mr. Speaker, in your ruling yesterday you did that. In our 
dealing with their antics today we also must do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motivations are suspect and transparent.  They say they want 
to reduce the question of whether we are for or against Canada to 
a simplistic question of whether we are for or against flags in 
the corner of our desks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week it was Reform members who thought so little of our 
Canadian flag and who were so disrespectful of the Canadian flag 
that they flung it on the floor in this Chamber and retreated 
from the debate.  That kind of cheap, crass approach to politics 
has no place in this parliament. 
That partisan petty form of politics will not strengthen and 
unify the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
what the Reform members are suffering from is a lack of 
discernment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have trouble differentiating between a desk in the House 
of Commons and a podium in a public meeting.  They are far from the 
same. In a public meeting, a partisan meeting, a person can do as 
he pleases, spout whatever propaganda he pleases.  But what is 
involved here is a desk in the House of Commons.  There are rules, 
this is an existing institution.  The Reform Party is therefore 
suffering from an inability to differentiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I see it, we in the Bloc Quebecois, and the other 
opposition parties, are in a position to see what the real problems 
are: employment insurance, the budget surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member for Halifax if she sees the 
problems which are facing us, at this time, and which are doing 
enormous harm to the Canadian and Quebec economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member raises the 
issue of whether this is simply a matter of poor judgment on the 
part of Reform members, whether it is a matter of discernment. 
The member suggests, as others have already suggested including 
myself, that it is really about two very serious issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about Reform members playing games that on the surface may 
just look silly.  They may annoy Canadians, and heavens knows by 
all the indications we are getting in our offices that people are 
becoming very impatient.  Reform members are wasting the time of 
the House and trying the patience of Canadians to reduce the 
issue of Canada's future to one of whether we will display flags 
on the corner of our desks as the key to Canadian unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes much deeper than that.  It is more serious than that. It 
is an insult to Canadians.  Reformers think they can wrap 
themselves in the flag and present themselves as the only true 
patriots because they have chosen this tactic.  At the same time 
they are escaping the real issues.  Each and every one of us were 
elected to the House to represent our constituents, not in a 
simplistic or petty partisan way but to the best of our ability 
and to try to grapple with finding a consensus on how to 
strengthen and improve this great country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On their official opposition day Reformers could have dealt with 
some of the issues of substance.  They could have put forward 
recommendations for good substantive debate that might actually 
help to improve the unemployment problem in Canada.  They could 
have come to the House and said that they understood it weakens 
and divides Canada to continue down the path of Americanizing our 
health care system so that it is two tier.  They could have come 
to the House and said that they have reconsidered their position 
on universal access to education and would no longer advocate two 
tier education so those with personal wealth could gain the 
education they need to get into the new economy and enjoy 
prosperity in the future.  They could have said they realize that 
if we do not deal with the issue of access, only those who could 
afford to gain education would get it and the others would fall 
further behind.  The very kind of growing gap between the super 
rich and everyone else which the Reform Party has been fuelling 
with its policies would grow even wider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were really hoping these were the kinds of issues that would 
be debated on an official opposition day from a variety of 
perspectives.  We have five different parties in the House with 
different views on how to deal with substantive issues.  However 
Reform Party's contribution to official opposition day and to 
solving these problems is to push them aside, push them under the 
rug, and to wave the flag on their terms and the heck with 
whether or not the concerns of Canadians get dealt with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is probably the saddest day I have spent in the 
Chamber since being elected.  As a young member I hope there will 
not be many more like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening in the House of Commons we will be asked to approve 
billions of dollars in public expenditures.  Today is the last 
day in this supply period on which we would have been able to 
debate issues that affect the lives of Canadians who are 
unemployed and looking for work, Canadians who are waiting in 
medical line-ups and in waiting rooms in hospitals across the 
country.  It was an opportunity to debate the real issues 
Canadians want to hear about most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are substantial issues that are life altering, yet here we 
are at the bequest of the Reform Party debating whether we can 
have a little flag on the corner of our desks in the Chamber.  I 
suggest we have entered the theatre of the absurd, not the 
chamber of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as I look at you sitting in the chair, you are a 
symbol of Canadian patriotism.  The flags that adorn the chair 
next to you equally symbolize that.  There are flags outside the 
door of the Chamber, flags that fly from the Peace Tower.  Many 
of the members in the Chamber are sporting lapel pins to express 
their patriotism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask a rhetorical question.  By putting another little flag on 
your desk are you somehow elevating your level of patriotism? 
Are you somehow improving yourself, your country and all the 
constituents you represent when you sit at this desk in the House 
of Commons? I would have to say no.  The level of debate we are 
reaching today is again a new low brought about by the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lessons to be learned in all this.  Let us look 
carefully at how the Reform Party members have behaved over the 
last number of days.  In all candour I feel that our priorities 
have been derailed, soiled by the mendacity of the motion. 
Perhaps it is a good example of what drives the member for 
Calgary Southwest, the policies of division.  Perhaps that is 
what is driving the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party have used the flag in the Chamber as 
a weapon to assault another member of the House.  Members of the 
Reform Party have used it as a weapon in an attempt to intimidate 
the Speaker of the House.  Members of the Reform Party stood in 
the Chamber and threw the flag on the floor of the House of 
Commons, which has been referred to a number of times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a letter sent to the Speaker by a gentleman named 
Thomas Sigurdson from Surrey, British Columbia. 
He was here in the gallery the day the Reform Party erupted. I 
quote from his letter sent on March 14, 1998:  “I must comment 
on the shameful behaviour of the official opposition the day that 
followed your ruling.  I have never, ever witnessed this kind of 
tantrum that exploded from the benches of the Reform Party.  From 
the public gallery I had the sad misfortune to watch some members 
yell not only verbal abuse at you but also hurl paper, books and 
flags off their desks in an act of infantile defiance”.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to say that this was the most shameful thing he had 
ever seen. Most shameful of all was the throwing of the small 
Canadian flag on to the floor of the House of Commons.  His 
letter ends up with the final comment that flags that surround 
the dais indicate to all members and visitors of our nation that 
the identity as well as the national pride is here in the House 
of Commons signified by those flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about pride.  I borrow the words of my colleague, 
the hon. member for Chicoutimi. It is not about pride, it is 
about provocation, it is about intolerance, it is about 
partisanship.  Pointing to the flag and grunting and making these 
comments is a way to avoid meaningful debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party have returned to the in your face 
style of politics that we have seen in this country.  By 
surrounding or wrapping themselves in the flag they get 
themselves off the hook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until this week there has never been a suggestion that we 
should have these flags on our desks.  They are prepared to stop 
free speech by anyone who disagrees with them and then wrap 
themselves in the package of the flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to search for words to somehow describe what is going 
on and to describe the conduct that we have seen in the Chamber, 
they would be found in Beauchesne's but I could not use them 
because they are all unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have seen that those new defenders of patriotism, 
those who threw the flag on the floor of the House of Commons, 
are the same patriots who ran advertisements during the federal 
election campaign that called a leader from Quebec a person not 
fit to be the prime minister.  I share my leader's description of 
those ads and I also share his description of those who designed 
and perpetrated those ads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past weekend I was in the province of Nova Scotia in my 
constituency and I spoke with many people about this issue.  When 
it came down to the final analysis as to what was going on I was 
asked why we are discussing this when there are so many important 
issues.  With the expiration of the TAGS program, with the sorry 
state of national health care, the high unemployment and the many 
substantial issues that we do discuss in the House of Commons, 
why are we wasting our time discussing a tiny flag on the corner 
of our desks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hope is that Canadians will see this attempt by the Reform 
Party to divide the House for what it is.  It is a shameful 
attempt to derail the national agenda.  What people do not want 
is this debate to go on and on.  What they want is trust and 
respect for members in the House of Commons, but it has to be 
earned.  What they want is a sense of honour and respect for 
national institutions, which the House surely is.  Let us work to 
bring some decorum back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flag is above all to be treated with dignity and respect. It 
is not a desk decoration or to be hung as a drapery in a window 
as proof of one's patriotism.  We will oppose this motion and we 
will do so not because we do not love the flag, for we do. The 
Progressive Conservative Party has been around this country since 
its inception.  We have been around this country carrying the 
flag for all Canadians since that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A ruling was made from by Chair and that ruling has now been 
brought into question by the Reform motion.  Again we are talking 
about decorum, we are talking about respect, we are talking about 
order in the House of Commons.  It would be improper for anyone 
to stand up between the second and third period of a hockey game 
and sing the national anthem.  It would be improper to break out 
into enthusiastic flag waving in the middle of a church sermon or 
in the middle of a child's recital at school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest those are apt examples of what the Reform Party 
is trying to do here and it is doing so for all the wrong 
reasons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that this is not simply about a flag.  It 
may be the simple common denominator that the Reform Party would 
have us believe, but this is about decorum, dignity and order.  I 
would say that from the Reform perspective, this is about trying 
to get its way against the will of everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find most ironic of all is the Bloc, the big bad 
separatists, as perhaps one of the most respectful parties in 
this House when it comes to the dignity and decorum that we are 
supposed to surround ourselves in.  There is a great irony in 
that when my colleagues to the left in the Reform Party engage in 
this infantile behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I value the flag, as much as I hold it dear, 
democracy must hold a higher place.  Indeed the flag stands for 
that principle among many others.  When a member of the House, a 
member who has been democratically elected here, is shouted down 
and drowned out in the name of patriotism I say that is wrong. 
Democracy has to be given a higher priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I take no great offence to a flag being on a desk, 
what I take offence to is the manner in which this has been 
presented and the manner in which this has been brought about by 
the Reform Party for, again, all the wrong reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put our shoulders to the wheel and do what Canadians 
expect us to do.  Let us come to this House and discuss 
substantial issues.  Let us get on with the nation's business. 
Let us put this matter to rest and do the right thing.  Let us 
dismiss this motion and get down to the job that our constituents 
sent us here to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
know that it is your intention and always has been your intention 
to be very fair in questions and comments.  I note, however, that 
this is Reform bash day and I was just wondering if you would 
give precedence to Reform people to ask questions of people who 
have been bashing the Reform Party and this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is aware of the nature of 
the discussion.  However, what your Speaker has tried to do is 
ensure a relatively fair distribution of questions.  The New 
Democratic Party has not had an opportunity yet to ask a question 
or make a comment at the end of any member's speech and that is 
why I recognized the hon. member for Qu'Appelle in this instance. 
He has been rising consistently in an effort to get the floor. 
In respect of each of the government speakers, I gave precedence 
to the Reform members since they were members of the official 
opposition and since it was their motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is incumbent on the Chair to ensure that all parties 
get an opportunity to participate in questions and comments.  The 
Bloc Quebecois has had one person rise on questions and comments 
to be recognized and this is the first time the NDP has had that 
opportunity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
make a comment and preface that with a short question for 
the House leader of the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I resent about this debate is the Reform Party playing 
politics with a very important national symbol of this country. 
I think that can be very dangerous in terms of the flag waving 
and the political games it is playing.  Let us really call it 
what it is.  It is the Reform Party wanting to go around the 
country after this is over and say “We stood up to those 
terrible separatists.  We stood up for the flag and for Canada 
but those other parties did not”.  That is exactly what it wants 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform members are smirking here this morning because they 
are going to have the four other parties voting against this 
motion.  This is the most pathetic partisan politics I have ever 
seen.  It is an abuse of the flag and of our national symbols.  I 
really resent that.  I have never seen that happen in all my 
years in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about games?  Who was it in this House who threw the flag 
on the floor of the House of Commons?  Was it a separatist?  No. 
It was the member for Medicine Hat, the Reform Party finance 
critic, who threw the flag on the floor of the House of Commons. 
If that is not playing politics with the flag then what the devil 
is it?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who was it that took an old convertible and painted it the 
colours of the Canadian Flag?  Was it a member of the 
Conservative Party, the NDP or the Liberal Party?  Who was it? 
The Reform Party.  It is the Reform Party that is using the flag 
as a gimmick, as a narrow partisan instrument for its narrow 
partisan political beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are trying to divide Canadians, be divisive, pit 
Canadian against Canadian.  I resent that as someone who has been 
in this House for a number of years.  I have never seen this kind 
of gamemanship in the history of the House of Commons. That comes 
from a political party that said it wanted to do politics 
differently, bring decorum to the House of Commons. We are seeing 
the true Reform Party in this House of Commons here today.  When 
I am out in my riding, as I was last weekend, people are saying 
to me why do we not talk about the real issues, the real issues 
confronting all Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Parliament costs over $1 million a day in terms of sitting 
days to run.  The budget of the House of Commons is over $200 
million a year.  We sit for approximately 140 or 150 days per 
year, over $1 million a day. The Reform Party is wasting that 
kind of money trying to divide Canadians by being partisan with 
the flag of Canada.  I resent that and I want to have a comment 
from the House leader of the Conservative Party whether he agrees 
with me that it is narrow partisan politics on the flag and a 
waste of money.  We should be dealing with real issues of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question and 
I welcome the remarks by my colleague in the NDP who has been in 
this Chamber a lot longer than I and has a very eloquent way of 
making his point.  I agree very much so with what he has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same comment was made this morning by my colleague from 
Fundy—Royal that this is indeed a strictly financial argument, 
removing all the rhetoric and removing all the emotion that has 
surrounded this debate.  I do not know if it is $1 million or 
$500,000 but to think that we are spending that kind of money to 
discuss this issue certainly raises the hackles on the back of my 
neck.  I am sure it offends Canadians greatly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for his comment about the disgraceful display of throwing the 
flag on the floor of the House of Commons and his comment with of 
whether it was the separatists who did it, let me raise this 
point.  Maybe it was.  Maybe there is something more insidious 
here that we are not quite aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers have brought a different agenda to this House of 
Commons, a different agenda from that which they held themselves 
out to be when they were elected in western Canada. I am hoping 
and praying that those who supported them in western Canada will 
look at the display and look at the way they have behaved and 
performed in the House of Commons when they make their decision 
the next time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I might suggest to the House that if 
there is considerable interest in questions and comments at the 
conclusion of members' speeches, we could revert to that good 
practice of one minute comments and one minute responses, which I 
am happy to do if the House is agreeable for the rest of the day. 
That will try to ensure wider distribution of the questions and 
comments in the limited time we have. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
was mentioned earlier that this was not about the flag.  It is 
mostly about the flag but I would say it certainly goes deeper 
than it.  It is about everything the flag represents.  It is 
about the symbolism, the pride and patriotism of being a Canadian 
and I want to talk about that for a few minutes in the 10 minutes 
I have allotted to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned earlier by the government House leader that I 
was the one who brought forward the motion to sing O Canada.  It 
was I at the beginning of the 35th Parliament in 1994.  I was 
proud to do that.  It had never been done.  The members said they 
were not sure we could do that. They denied unanimous consent and 
of course it went to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whip across knows that it went to committee and then they 
said today that we were playing political games because we knew 
it was in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you were on that committee and I think you will 
remember the dates and the times. Let me just remind you and get 
it into <I>Hansard</I>.  It was almost two years later, at least a 
year and a half, when I said what happened to this thing.  I 
asked the committee, of which you were the chairman, if I could 
be a witness in front of that committee and you granted me that 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It went through committee not by any grand gesture of any 
government member but because I phoned and asked where is that 
thing, let us get it going. You granted me that opportunity to 
come as a witness.  It was by no magnanimous gesture of any 
government member who said we want to get this thing through as 
fast as we can. 
I appreciated being allowed to attend the committee as a witness 
but it was at my request as a result of referendum day 1995.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about who is more or less patriotic.  That is 
not the issue.  I am not trying to say I am any more patriotic 
than other members.  I am not trying to say I am a better 
Canadian.  That is not the issue.  It is about freedom of 
expression and being able to express patriotism on the particular 
days when it hits us, when we feel like it. If I want to 
celebrate Canada, there ain't nobody who can tell me that is not 
my privilege and experience as a Canadian citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give a few personal thoughts in this debate. Heaven 
help me if I would ever use a prop as I know that is not 
appropriate in the House of Commons, but I have my birth 
certificate here and I want to read something from it.  I promise 
not to throw it. It reads:  Name, Deborah Cleland Grey. Birthday, 
July 1, 1952. Place of Birth, Vancouver, British Columbia.  It 
can be seen that this flag means a little more to me than just 
something I want to put on my desk, or something I will wear 
proudly and passionately, the red and white and you bet I will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the fourth child in my family.  I was born three and a half 
weeks late, which is practically unheard of.  My mother said to 
me, and it still rings it true today “You knew exactly the day 
you were waiting for, Deb”.  I had no idea I would ever be a 
member of Parliament yet the symbolism of that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  They can snort and say whatever they 
like but no one in the House can challenge or dare me and say, 
“Isn't she cute, doesn't she play stunts, doesn't she play 
gimmicks”.  These people who are sneering say they deserve 
freedom of speech. I would ask for the same respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so deep, the symbolism of the flag.  It is not just the 
flag.  It is the symbolism of my flag.  I am speaking here for 
myself and that is all.  When I say it is important to me, you 
bet it is.  Maybe it is a first, that someone else would sneer 
and snort, but I am here to say to him and to everybody else, 
ain't nobody who can tell me that my Canadian flag is not 
important to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the flag on my desk but deep within myself. I was 
13 years old in 1965 when the first flag debate took place.  I 
was proud to see the end of that flag flap.  I was a teenager and 
I loved the maple leaf. I have travelled in Europe. That maple 
leaf was sewn on my knapsack.  I was proud to be a Canadian, not 
just for the flag but for everything it represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the highlights of my elected life was on October 1, 1996, 
right after the Atlanta games when the Speaker of the House 
invited all the Olympian athletes here on the floor of the 
Chamber. Mr. Speaker, you were here and I know you shared my 
excitement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to look for a few moments at <I>Hansard</I> from that day 
because we have heard today that the rules in this place cannot 
be changed.  The Speaker made his ruling yesterday and it cannot 
be changed, do not mess with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what he said in <I>Hansard</I> on October 1, 1996:  “We 
are going to do a few things differently in the next few 
minutes”.  Then he went on to say: “For the first time in the 
history of our country, we are going to bring on to the floor our 
Olympic athletes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a day that was.  I sat farther down toward the door. Silken 
Laumann, Donovan Bailey and Curt Harnet, and all the others with 
the special Olympics, when they wheeled in and walked in, that 
was a rush. People on all sides of the House had goose bumps 
because for the first time ever they stood on the floor of the 
House of Commons. Let me say I was proud.  The Speaker said: “We 
do not usually have guests here on the floor of the House of 
Commons but this is an extraordinary day and we wanted to bend 
the rules just a little because we here in this Chamber and we 30 
million Canadians want to pay tribute to you and to congratulate 
you”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a wonderful day.  We celebrated those Olympian 
athletes.  What a job they did in Atlanta.  I was so proud of 
them. The Speaker unilaterally made new rules to celebrate, 
allowing those Olympic athletes to come to the floor of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The editor's note reads:  “After the singing of the national 
anthem, Canada's 1996 Paralympic and Olympic athletes left the 
Chamber”.  It was a spontaneous, exciting and passionate 
rendition of <I>O Canada</I>.  And today we are saying that maybe 
that will not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the Olympic athletes in Nagano?  What about the 
athletes who did such a superb job for Canada?  They love our 
flag, as do I.  They serve it, as do I.  They celebrate it, as do 
I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about Sandra Schmirler?  With the time zone change I would 
love to ask who got up at 3.30 in the morning to watch a live 
curling draw.

sailing down the run in the bobsled with the Canadian flag on the 
front?  He won the gold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about Catriona Lemay-Doan?  I hope she is in this Chamber 
with that grin from ear to ear celebrating what it is to be a 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about Annie Perreault with her speed skating?  What a day 
that was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they going to be coming to the floor of the House of 
Commons?  Knowing the Speaker as I do, I would bet a dollar that 
he would want them to come.  He has opened up this place.  I 
appreciate that. They are going to be here on the floor of the 
House of Commons. And I bet a dollar they will be in their red 
and white Roots Canada jackets.  I bet they will.  But we will 
not be allowed to, judging from what has happened here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can go into any building, any parking lot, any mall, any 
radio station anywhere in this country and they are allowed to 
show the flag.  However if they come here to the floor of the 
House of Commons and if this motion is not supported today, there 
will be no little Canadian flags to celebrate them. Will we be 
allowed to have a spontaneous rendition of <I>O Canada</I>?  I am 
not sure.  Apparently not.  It does not sound like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be the only building in Canada where the Olympic 
athletes will not be able to be spontaneous.  Why in the name of 
common sense, why in the name of freedom of expression are we not 
allowed to jump out of our seats, wave the flag and sing <I>O 
Canada</I> at the top of our lungs to celebrate the Olympic 
athletes?  They have come home from Nagano.  They love the flag. 
They serve it and they celebrate it.  I want to be there to 
celebrate with them.  I want to show my patriotism in any way I 
can when they are here in the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the words of the hon. Reform member. 
She delivered a very passionate message to Canadians.  However, I 
would suggest that it is not an accurate picture of what this 
debate is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask her honestly and straightforwardly, how she can make that 
monumental mental leap to suggest that having a little flag on 
the desks is somehow going to bar our Canadian athletes from 
walking in here as they have in the past and having a spontaneous 
rendition of our national anthem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the issue at all.  That is a blatantly misleading 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I want to do something 
which is spontaneous because my flag means so much to me, I think 
I should be given the privilege, the right and perhaps even the 
obligation to stand.  If I want to wave my flag as a symbol of 
what is inside, I figure I ought to be able to do that. 
If I want to sing <I>O Canada</I> in this Chamber, I tell you, Mr. 
Speaker, I will do it.  If they are here I will do it.

but when we choose, to have that flag which is so much deeper and 
which represents so much about what it means to me to be a

use it at my desk, because I love it and because I serve it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member talks about spontaneity. I certainly do recall the 
spontaneity when she tore down the back aisle after a member of 
Parliament, Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais, and threatened her in 
this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also reminded of something because of the way she was 
hurling her papers around that she made a statement in her speech 
that far be it for her to use props. I wonder if the member 
recalls an incident whereby she took a platform document of the 
Liberal Party during question period and hurled it onto the floor 
of the House.  I wonder if the member would think that was a 
prop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given what the member has done compared to what she has said, 
how is anybody to believe anything the member has said? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member will remember 
that the case he is talking about, about a defeated member from 
New Brunswick, had absolutely no merit to it.  The Speaker ruled 
on that once and for all.  It is unbelievable that he would bring 
up some silly thing like that again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the red book.  Yes, I must admit on that 
day I thought that was just where the red book deserved to be, 
right smack on the floor.  I have never thrown a flag.  I never 
will.  Is it not ironic that the red book would be allowed in the 
Chamber of the House Commons, but the red flag would not.  What a 
caution, what a pathetic statement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the Reform Party member. Thank goodness she was not born on 
December 25, because she would think she is God Almighty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was here when the incidents occurred and what concerns me about 
the attitude of Reformers is that they behaved like a bunch of fanatics. 
People who, individually, are usually sociable, tolerant and 
understanding behaved like a pack hunting some prey, and this scared me. 
History tells us—and there is no need to refer specifically to 
Germany during the second world war—that people wrapped in their flag 
like that often commit the worst possible crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell us whether she is proud of the attitude 
displayed and the means used here by her colleagues in the Reform Party, 
including the threats made to the Speaker of the House, such as airing 
his private life in public? I wonder if she is proud of her fellow party 
members and if she is proud of herself, considering she was born on July 
1. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not get the point 
about December 25.  I am not sure what the hon. member was 
referring to.  I must admit I did not have a whole lot to do with 
the family planning.  I was born when I was born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will remember that the incident which happened last week had 
nothing to do with the flag flap.  It had everything to do with 
some comments the Speaker had made elsewhere which he 
straightened out.  He did not recognize the Leader of Her 
Majesty's Official Opposition.  That is why many members were 
angry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something happened that day which was regrettable. My seatmate, 
the member for Medicine Hat, tossed a flag up in disgust.  He was 
exasperated, he was frustrated and he said that he is very, very 
sorry and very ashamed that he did that.  I appreciated the 
honesty in that.  I think all of us need to say thanks for being 
honest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great honour to stand today in this House of Commons to debate 
this motion.  The motion is a very simple one.  In the positive 
as it is stated it says that members will be permitted to display 
small flags at their desks if they so choose.  That is the 
essence of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me it was really defined at a time when I was denied that 
permission. 
Because I have been quite involved with this story, I appreciate 
the opportunity to rise today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a little background.  I am a first generation 
Canadian.  I had no choice as the previous member had about when 
and where I was born.  However, I am very glad that I was born in 
Swift Current, Saskatchewan, in a province of Canada.  I grew up 
in a family which had chosen to make Canada their home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with other people in their immediate group, my 
grandparents while living in southern Russia during the first 
world war, suffered from a lot of persecution.  The revolution 
came after the war.  Members of our family in that country were 
killed in that revolution simply because of their beliefs and not 
because they committed any crime or anything else.  They were not 
on the right political side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My grandparents having escaped from the same disasters made the 
decision to move their family out of that country.  They 
literally fled that country and came to Canada.  They came here 
because this was the country of freedom, opportunity and safety 
for their family.  Though they did not know each other, this 
happened in parallel to my grandparents on both my mom's and 
dad's sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a youngster growing up in a farm home, we had central heating 
which was defined as being a stove in one of the main floor 
rooms.  There was a hole in the ceiling that allowed the heat by 
convection to go upstairs.  There was a grate at the hole and we 
could hear what the adults were saying downstairs.  I remember 
hearing my grandparents, my uncles, aunts and some of their 
friends discuss how things were in the old country.  Over and 
over I remember hearing how wonderful that we could come to 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not part of my speech but it is tremendously important. 
I was asked this week a number of times whether I was proud to 
be a Canadian.  I said yes.  The word that describes it better is 
that I am grateful to be a Canadian.  I am thankful to be a 
Canadian.  I am so thankful that my grandparents made that 
decision to leave that country and come to this country.  There 
is deep within me feelings and convictions of the importance of 
preserving freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of 
choosing one's faith, all these freedoms in this country which I 
and my family value so highly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to February 26 when the member came back from 
Nagano.  At the suggestion of one of the Liberal members, a 
member of this House had placed flags on all our desks.  It was 
agreed that when the member who had said things about our 
Canadian flag came back from Nagano that as loyal Canadians we 
would wave these flags and show her that we love our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that stage I did not know who had made this suggestion.  No 
one in our party had said they had done it so I did not think it 
was from our party, and I did not care.  I said I agreed with 
this.  Yes, I confess to engaging in a spontaneous demonstration 
in this House of Commons when the member who had spoken 
disparagingly of our flag came back from Nagano.  I  confess I 
joined in that demonstration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is should I now apologize for it?  The answer is 
no, I should not.  If we do not have freedom of expression in 
this country, in this very House, then really what else matters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly thereafter we went back to the budget debate.  This is 
the defining moment for me.  This is the moment in my entire life 
where my flag meant more to me than at any other time. 
That was the same Thursday when, a few minutes later, there was a 
Liberal member droning on about how wonderful their budget was. I 
had heard most of the things before, therefore I will confess 
again that I was not paying a great deal of attention to what he 
was saying.  I was reading. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a little demonstration, without thinking instead of 
putting my flag back into my desk, I placed it into my little 
water holder.  As a result, it just sat there, this little, tiny 
flag, three inches by six inches, and for those who are metric, 
seven and a half centimetres by fifteen.  There it was.  I was 
reading a paper.  A Liberal member was droning on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suddenly, there was a point of order.  A separatist member of 
this House got up and said “Madam Speaker”—it was the one of 
the Acting Speakers who was in the chair—“I see flags and I 
would like to have them removed”.  That is a paraphrase, not a 
quote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I basically ignored it.  I will admit that.  The Acting Speaker 
did ask for members to remove their flags.  I was busy reading 
and really did not pay too much attention to it.  It was also in 
a language that I do not understand, and I regret that I do not 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stood up immediately again and said “Madam Speaker, I still 
see flags” and she did not see them.  My flag was very small and 
very unobtrusive.  It certainly was not bothering the Liberal 
member from speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He pointed right at me and then she looked at me and said “Will 
the member for Elk Island remove his flag?”  I have to say at 
that moment that flag meant more to me than anything.  When I was 
asked to remove it, I did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I sorry?  No, I am not.  See how torn I am.  The rules do not 
permit me in that instance to display a simple, little, Canadian 
flag and that is wrong.  There is not another geographical 
location in this whole country where we cannot display our flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have it in our offices.  That has already been mentioned.  I 
do not think there is a business in this entire country where, if 
an employee of the company would have a little flag on their 
desk, anyone would have the audacity, the nerve to say “Take it 
away”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me, it is not the permission to have the flag.  It is an 
assurance that it will not be taken away from me.  That is what 
happened on that day.  That was the defining moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have bombasted here today.  We did not plan this.  We 
honestly did not.  I said that on very many talk shows this week. 
It was not a planned thing by the Reform Party.  I did not know 
until two seconds before this happened that this is how it would 
develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say one thing.  If I am asked to stand up for my country 
and my flag, I will do it and there will not be a member who is 
trying to tear this country apart who will stop me, nor any other 
Canadian or non-Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I do not have that kind of fortitude, I do not have the right 
to stand here.  It is a formidable task we have. Judging by the 
debate so far, everyone is against this motion.  They are somehow 
trying to judge our motives.  Because our motives are wrong, they 
are going to vote for what is wrong instead of for what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appealing, I am begging, I am doing everything I can to ask 
hon. members on all sides of the House to do what is right.  What 
we are asking is for a small incremental change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I believe in rules.  I believe in law.  I believe in order. 
I believe that we have limits to our freedoms of expression.  We 
are moving.  We want to move those limits ever so little in this 
House so that when a member gets into a situation like I was in, 
the rules of the House cannot be used to defeat and to destroy my 
freedom of a very simple expression which I value so highly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let me say, since the previous speaker mentioned that 
his parents were refugees from another country, that I was a 
refugee from Hungary and came to Canada in 1957. 
Let me tell him that there are ways of celebrating flags and 
there are ways not to celebrate flags.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members recall communist countries, every May 1 was May Day. 
The factories emptied.  All the workplaces were empty.  Those 
workers were forced to march past the reviewing stand in order to 
celebrate May Day.  I recall when I was five years old going 
along with my mother because we had to bring family members 
along.  I could not understand why all the adults around me 
wanted me to carry their flags.  It was because they did not want 
to carry the flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me further say that October 27, 1995 was one of my proudest 
moments.  I was at the Place du Canada in Montreal with my family 
and 600 people from my riding where we proudly carried the flag. 
That was an expression of our love for our country and our flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only question I have for that member is where was he? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not accurate to say that 
there were no Reformers there.  It just has not been advertised. 
There were some, and some pretty high profile ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides that, the member mentioned the old countries.  This is 
what distinguishes this country from other countries and why I am 
so grateful that my grandparents chose this as their country.  In 
those other countries people are punished if they do not fly the 
flag.  Does that make them patriotic or right?  No.  I could even 
ask the question:  Does the distribution of free flags around the 
country, causing people to wave them who otherwise were not doing 
it, make them patriotic?  I think not.  The difference is that in 
this country and in this place we are punished if we do fly the 
flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comment would simply be that the sequence is most important. 
I believe, for myself and probably for most Canadians, that we 
should fly the flag because we are patriotic rather than thinking 
that we will become patriotic by flying the flag.  There is a 
huge difference there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my 
time with the hon. member for Timiskaming—Cochrane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today cannot be separated from the incident in the 
House on February 26 from which it arose.  If we go back to that 
incident we will find that there was some anger and concern on 
both sides of the House with remarks attributed to the hon. 
member for Rimouski—Mitis in far away Japan.  As reported, the 
remarks were deemed offensive by a number of people.  I believe 
this is what produced the incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have since seen an explanation of it by the hon. member for 
Rimouski—Mitis.  As many of us know from her work in committee, 
she has been a good committee person and has been respectful of 
House rules in her conduct.  I have seen the explanation since, 
but in the origins I think there was an anger in her remarks that 
was considered intemperate and offensive to many members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened I think needs to be traced.  On February 23 I was 
told to look in my desk in the House.  When I looked in, I found 
a small flag with a note which read “As a loyal Canadian, please 
wave this flag the first time Suzanne Tremblay, BQ, stands to 
speak in question period”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member knows that he 
must refer to members by their constituency and not by name.  I 
urge him to comply with the rules in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was referring to the 
hon. member in the context of a document in which her name was 
mentioned, but I will accept— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I appreciate the hon. member's 
argument but the rules of the House are clear, that one cannot do 
indirectly what one cannot do directly, even quoting a document. 
Your Speaker has experience with this from having had made the 
same mistake.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have checked the authorities and I am satisfied it is quite 
correct that you may not refer to the hon. member by name, even 
when quoting from another document, so I would urge the member to 
comply with the rule in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would defer to you 
because of your charm as well as your learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was really saying that what would have been an understandably 
spontaneous action lost some of its attraction when there was a 
three day interregnum.  I think it is correct to say, as an hon. 
member on this side who was associated with the incident said on 
March 9 in the House, it may have been ill advised but it never 
was supposed to go this far.  It took intellectual courage and 
honesty for the hon. member concerned to make that remark and I 
think he is right.  This debate should have been closed then and 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have a motion on the order paper today, let me simply 
say that our reaction and attitude to our country and the symbols 
of our nationhood are changing.  The two founding nations, 
perhaps because they regretted their 19th century history which 
was rather bloody and rather inconsiderate of other people, 
tended to develop a certain self-restraint.  What was very 
noticeable in the twenties, thirties, forties, the World War II 
period and just before, was an absence of the breast beating 
nationalism in many parts of continental Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the greatest of the Conservative leaders in Canada 
during the post-war period, Premier John Robarts whom I advised, 
defending the choice—and it was much in controversy—of the 
maple leaf flag as the Canadian flag against some very angry 
Conservatives who said that people fought and died under the 
Union Jack in the last war.  He replied, as somebody who had 
served in the Mediterranean theatre in small boats, that none of 
us fought and died under flags in Word War II, that you would 
have given away your cover.  Let us be realistic.  Symbols of 
that sort were more relevant in the 19th century.  He was 
representing an attitude of self-restraint which reflected the 
thinking of people in the two founding nations at that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States Supreme Court in World War II gave two massive 
rulings.  I remember studying them as a law student.  They were 
key to the evolution of American constitutional democracy. One 
sometimes thinks in Canada that the Americans are given to 
excessive breast beating displays of nationalism.  In 1942, in 
the Gobitis case, the court ruled by an eight to one majority 
that school children could be compelled to salute the flag even 
though it violated their religious beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was such a flood of criticism of that decision, including 
from marines serving in the Pacific theatre, “is it the country 
we are fighting for”, that the court reversed that decision two 
years later.  It was a defining moment in Americans' attitude to 
themselves and to their symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the change in this country, the influence of 
immigration, the influence of our passage to a multicultural, 
plural society in which the views of new cultural communities are 
as relevant and determining as those of other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the Speaker of the House introduced what you have on the 
left and the right of his chair, Mr. Speaker, the Canadian flag. 
It was not displayed before but he introduced that and it has 
been a practice supported by all of us.  In 1994 he also 
introduced the practice—and I think it was first suggested by 
the hon. member for Edmonton North—of singing the national 
anthem each Wednesday afternoon. Again it is a practice that all 
parties in the House have supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each generation of Canadians has the right to redefine its 
attitudes to the nation including its choice of symbols.  It may 
well be that we have been less demonstrative than we should have 
been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember visiting India in the post-war period 15 years after 
independence and being struck by the fact that the main traffic 
circle in town, which had a huge, monumental plinth, was still 
dominated by a statue of King George V of Great Britain. 
One said to the Indians “Does he not represent the past?” The 
Indians said “yes, but we have no inferiority complex.  In time 
we will remove the statue,” and they did 10 years later.  In 
other words it should not be assumed that the new immigrants will 
follow the attitudes of colleagues from the other side of the 
House just referred to.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One remembers the East German regime of Mr. Honecker, which was 
dramatically in evidence for the gymnastic displays, those three 
or four hours of sporting exhibitions accompanied by literally 
thousands of flags.  In 1989 the Berlin wall fell and the 
particular flag Mr. Honecker had supported disappeared into the 
dustbin of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking for a way of reconciling new attitudes, new 
expectations of what our national symbols should be with the more 
traditional values which I think have been toward self-restraint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps with a certain degree of smugness Canadians have set 
themselves aside from other people.  We do not need to say that 
we are Canadians.  We know.  We have confidence in our future. We 
know that we have a great future.  We know that we are a tolerant 
people.  This process is a legitimate one and one that we would 
all welcome, but I wonder whether, in the aftermath of the 
incident in the House on February 26, this is the right time and 
context in which to consider it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the House put forward a sensible suggestion that 
it go to a very powerful and prestigious committee of the House 
which you once chaired, Mr. Speaker, in one of your earlier 
periods.  You were an erudite, an eloquent and perhaps a 
loquacious incumbent of the chairmanship of that committee, but 
you did well by us and we did well by you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suggestion to the hon. members opposite, to the hon. member 
for Edmonton North who was active in the movement to display the 
flags on either side of the chair and the singing of the anthem, 
why not recall the motion?  Why not let it go to the committee so 
in a proper context of calmness we can consider what 
redefinition, if any, we want to make of what we have already 
done? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot believe, in light of arguments that have 
already been presented, that the Liberal member who just spoke 
still wants to send such a simple yes or no issue to committee to 
languish there, as has been already stated, never to see the 
light of day again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to bring forth two other points.  I have in my 
office on my desk in my riding a Canadian flag.  I have in my 
office in Ottawa near my desk a Canadian flag.  I have three 
desks.  The third desk is this one that I occupy in the House of 
Commons on behalf of my constituents and all Canadians, where I 
try to make valued judgments on legislation brought forward for 
people in my riding and for all Canadians.  Why, on this third 
desk of mine, should I not be allowed the symbol of what I 
represent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask, if I may, why, when his own former deputy prime 
minister and heritage minister spent millions, nay tens of 
millions of dollars, promoting the Canadian flag and telling 
Canadians to be more— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it assumes too 
much to imagine the committee over which you presided so 
eloquently will take 19 years to reach a decision.  It is the 
sort of thing that could be decided promptly and we would 
recommend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have the flags in my office.  I added them recently.  I 
have been a serving member of the armed forces.  I think one of 
the difficulties perhaps with the House is that it has too little 
acquaintance or contact directly with the last war or military 
service.  I always found that military people are more modest in 
displaying nationalism than those without it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is a question of decorum and practice in the House.  When 
the original flag flap was happening, Progressive Conservative 
members physically stormed the Speaker.  Jim Fulton, a member of 
the New Democratic Party, intentionally brought a raw fish into 
the House that he slapped down on the Prime Minister's desk. 
A former member of the New Democratic Party actually ran after 
and grabbed the mace, which represents the power of the House.

House changes its rules this will not be permitted”. What we are 
doing, very simply, as my colleague has said, is asking for a 
simple yes or no.  Why can we not have a simple yes or no?  Why 
can we not simply change the rules so we can display the flag and 
get on with business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member will know 
that I made no pejorative remarks about him or any other member 
of the other side of the House, but I would suggest that there is 
a feeling on this side of the House that his party should have 
followed the course the member on this side did in saying that 
enough time had been given to this issue.  Let us put it off. Let 
us consider it in that context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that on his side a gaffe was made.  I also believe 
that the art of politics is to retire gracefully from situations 
such as that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder 
if the member could comment on the observations I have made.  The 
leader of the Reform Party a couple of years ago could not have 
been bothered to attend the flag day celebration because it was 
not very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today members of the Reform Party are cloaked in the flag. 
Somehow they are the great defenders of the flag.  I wonder if he 
could comment on what I believe to be a very shabby and shallow 
patriotic venture on the part of Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that patriotism 
like religion is a matter of personal choice and personal taste, 
at least in its display. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go to flag ceremonies.  I do so proudly.  I think we should 
leave it to each member to make that judgment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming—Cochrane, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, contrary to most members who have spoken previously, I 
am not pleased to participate in the debate today.  I do so out 
of a sense of duty not to my party but to my country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will probably give the most difficult speech of my 
political career.  I understand fully the predicament we have put 
the Speaker in with the so-called flag issue.  I too feel caught 
between a rock and a hard place.  My heart is torn apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand I would like to support the motion, as I have 
previously been adamant about my right to place a flag on my 
desk.  On the other hand, because of the manner in which members 
of the Reform Party have conducted themselves on this issue, I 
cannot and I will not support the motion.  I will try to explain 
why to the best of my ability. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting to the heart of the matter, let me remind the House 
of the events that led to this dilemma. I feel that after doing so I 
will have managed to upset both the separatists and the Reformers. In 
any case, it is important to set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The separatist member for Rimouski—Mitis made some comments at the 
Nagano Games that upset Canadian parliamentarians, and in fact all 
Canadians. We could not let her get away with this. We had to respond to 
the member and to proudly defend the use of the Canadian flag, and we 
did. 
We did so spontaneously and with pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair ruled that the way we did it was against the rules. I 
respect the decision. However, I am warning separatists that whenever 
they attack our flag, I will be there to defend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a suggestion for the member for Rimouski—Mitis and all her 
separatist colleagues: if they are offended by the Canadian flag, if 
they cannot loyally represent Canada at international events, then they 
should stay here and leave that opportunity to other members who will 
represent our country with pride and dignity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now address the motion of the Reform Party.  Let me say 
from the outset that I favour having a Canadian flag on my desk. 
Two weeks ago I would have supported such a motion.  I hope that 
through the Committee on Procedure and House Affairs or through a 
private members' bill we will one day be able to do so.  However, 
to bring such a motion today in light of the recent events is 
divisive, disruptive and plain low politicking.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a lot easier for me to grandstand today and be the 
lone Liberal hero by supporting this motion.  But when one is 
elected to the Canadian Parliament, one must not ask himself what 
is best for the party, one must not ask himself what is best to 
be re-elected, one must ask himself what is best for Canada.  That 
is a lot harder to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manner in which the Reform Party conducted itself on this 
issue, and other facts which I have learned in the past week, has 
led me to reconsider my position.  Here we are in the House of 
Commons saying that we want to promote the Canadian flag and 
teach respect for the flag.  What does the Reform Party do?  It 
throws the flag on the floor.  It took a very serious issue and 
turned it into a circus.  I have too much respect for the 
Canadian flag to support and witness such disrespectful acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the Reform Party when we had the flag rally in 
Montreal on October 27, 1995?  We were there.  The Reform Party 
opposed the fly the flag program brought forward by the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage.  We supported it.  Yet, it comes into the 
House pretending to be holier than thou and somehow making the 
impression that it is more patriotic than we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House have no lessons to learn from the 
Reform Party on patriotism.  We want the flag to unite Canadians, 
not divide them.  By forcing this issue now, today, they are 
playing right into the separatists' hands.  They are pouring 
gasoline on the fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done some research in the past week.  In other 
legislatures around the world, the use of flags on MPs desks is 
not permitted in the British Parliament, Australia, the American 
Congress or the American Senate.  Maybe we could set a precedent 
in this House and become the first parliament to do so, but today 
is not the time.  We must put this issue to rest for now by 
referring the matter to a committee.  We have important matters 
and bills to debate in this House.  It is time for us to move on 
with the business of governing this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that most Canadians would agree with MPs having a flag 
on their desks.  I also suspect that first and foremost they 
demand and expect that we conduct ourselves in a civil manner and 
that we do the job that we were elected to do, which is to help 
create jobs, improve our social programs and pass legislation for 
the betterment of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is saying that it wants change.  I too want 
change.  I challenge the Reform Party to show that it is not just 
playing politics with this issue.  I challenge the Reform Party 
to give unanimous consent to the House to an amendment that I am 
prepared to put forward.  The amendment is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting immediately before the 
words “this House” the words “the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs to prepare a report by June 15”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member for 
Timiskaming—Cochrane have the unanimous consent of the House to 
put the amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is no consent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate that the remarks we have just heard were 
tinged with so much hypocrisy. Let me explain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Timiskaming—Cochrane is one of those whose 
conduct, since the very beginning of this flag business, has been— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member for 
Timiskaming—Cochrane on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré:</B> Mr. Speaker, while members of the Bloc Quebecois 
claim to respect the rules of decorum in this House, the hon. member has 
just called another member a hypocrite. I think this is unparliamentary. 
I would ask that he withdraw his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans wish to reply? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> I will be happy to, Mr. Speaker. I suggest you 
check the blues, Mr. Speaker. I know you take your job seriously. I 
never called the hon. member a hypocrite, that is totally false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> Yet he is one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> I must say, however, that he just gave us 
another example of his conduct, which I described earlier as tinged with 
hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of this flag business, the hon. member for 
Timiskaming—Cochrane has been displaying a small Canadian flag on his 
desk. I must say on the outset that members of the Bloc Quebecois are 
not allergic to flags or to the national anthem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national anthem is played in formal ceremonies in the riding of 
any one of the 44 Bloc members. Take Remembrance Day, for example. I 
personally hold Remembrance Day ceremonies in my riding. In fact, no 
fewer than four ceremonies are held in my riding in which we pay tribute 
to Quebeckers and Canadians who lost their lives on the battlefield. So, 
we are not against the flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want the hon. member for Timiskaming—Cochrane to confirm 
that he kept a flag on his desk for three days after all his colleagues 
had taken theirs off. He has never taken his flag off his desk. Has he 
not been at the centre of the masquerade behind all this? No way that 
was a spontaneous remark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré:</B> Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of my speech 
I said that I would be making the Bloc members angry.  I think I 
have succeeded in doing so.  I must have touched a nerve, because 
they reacted to the truths I said in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I confirm that I had a flag on my desk for a few days. 
I had it there with pride, and I wore it with pride.  I hope to be 
able to do so again some day.  But the way to accomplish that is 
not to add fuel to the fire, but to refer the ruling to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely disappointed that Reform, which claims to be 
prepared to co-operate and to desire change, is refusing to use the 
same process as for the singing of the national anthem in this 
House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I respect 
the hon. member and his views.  I also respect that he has now 
decided, apparently from his speech, to not support this motion 
which rather comes as a surprise to me since I thought he was in 
favour of this freedom of expression to display a small flag on 
our desks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my understanding he has tabled a private member's bill to 
permit this.  Can he now clarify this.  Is he going to withdraw 
the bill or will he stand by it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Serré:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am in the process of 
preparing a private member's bill with the legal department but 
it is not done yet.  It will come in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that this private member's bill will need to 
have some kind of provision to prevent the Reform Party from 
throwing the flag on the floor.  Their motion does not say much 
about their party because of what happened with the member for 
Medicine Hat.  They have to put a provision in their motion that 
it will be stationary or glued to the desk because they cannot 
trust the conduct of their own members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope if and when a private member's bill is introduced 
it will have provisions to prevent that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like my colleague to comment on the recent intervenor's behaviour

for our institutions?

on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party had conducted this issue with decorum, I 
would probably be standing here today in support of that motion. 
I agree with the idea per se, but the Reform Party took an issue 
that is dear to my heart and made a circus out of it.  There is 
no way I will attach my name to this type of conduct.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, several years 
ago, there was a vigorous debate in the House of Commons about a 
new flag for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing here is the result of that debate.  A few 
members displayed their favourite flag.  The Speaker of the House 
then declared such demonstrations out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the new Canadian flag was approved by the Parliament of 
Canada, this tradition continued.  The flag has a symbolic role for 
all countries of the world and for Canada.  It is an expression of 
pride, of nationality and of authority. It is an important 
expression for many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker said clearly that a unilateral change in the rules 
governing how this House operates.  I accept this, but members 
themselves can reform those rules is unacceptable. That is the 
reason for today's debate. The motion before us clearly says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House should recognize the Canadian flag as an 
acceptable symbol that may be displayed at any time on the 
desks of Members of Parliament in the House of Commons 
provided that only one flag be displayed on a Member's desk at 
any given time, and that the said flag remain stationary for 
the purposes of decorum and be no larger than the standard 
recognized flag. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For whom does this statement represent a problem?  For 
journalists?  Why?  For the Liberals?  Why?  For the other parties 
in the House of Commons?  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a constructive debate for Canada.  The vote is simple 
and clear: a vote for the flag of Canada here in the House of 
Commons, if a member wishes.  A flag on each member's desk, if a 
member wishes.  A stationary flag, if a member wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have consulted my constituents in Macleod, Alberta, on this 
issue;  89 of them gave a very clear yes to the flag in the House 
of Commons.  I listened carefully to what other Canadians had to 
say.  They said yes to the flag in the House of Commons.  And for 
those who say this is not an important problem, I say that Canada's 
emblem is very important.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, having listened to the debate 
since it began at 10 o'clock this morning and especially in the 
last hour and a half, in my almost decade of service for my 
constituents in this House of Commons, quite frankly I have never 
heard so much bombast and so many half truths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today the hon. member for Edmonton North made reference 
to the appearance on the floor of the House of Commons in 1996 of 
the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic athletes. She seemed to imply 
that the Speaker cast a blind eye at the rules to permit what 
proved to be a very exciting experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With one glance at the official record any member of this place 
would see that the rules were not ignored at all.  In fact the 
<I>Journals</I> of the House of Commons for October 1, 1996 read: 
“By unanimous consent of the House, the House resolved itself 
into committee of the whole to recognize Canada's 1996 Summer 
Olympic Games and Paraplegic Games medalists”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clearly shows that the reception of the athletes in 1996 
was done with the unanimous consent of the House. There was no 
breaking of any rules by Mr. Speaker. The Speaker permitted the 
athletes on the floor only with the unanimous consent and 
agreement of the House to waive the normal rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one quick, simple question for the member opposite. My 
question for the hon. member of the official opposition is would 
he think any less of me and my patriotism toward the country I 
love if I do not put a Canadian flag on the corner of my desk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member makes a 
point very eloquently.  Of course I would not.  The opportunity 
though to be able to do that is something which I think members 
would both value and accept with the responsibility we have here. 
It would be completely voluntary.  It would have nothing to do 
with force.  It is patriotism by desire, rather than patriotism 
by design. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the member, the choice would be his.  My choice 
would be to display a flag at times when I felt most patriotic. I 
guess I would go back to the question of what would his 
constituents say to him when he had the opportunity to simply 
display the flag here, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have two questions for the member.  Was the member at 
Place du Canada in Montreal on October 27, 1995?  Does he feel 
that members of the Reform Party who threw the flag on the floor 
should be disciplined, and if not why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, although I was born in 
Montreal, I was not at that demonstration in Montreal. Having 
considered that question very carefully however it is interesting 
that when I made the representation to those who in fact guided 
me on this issue—and they were not members of my party—I was 
advised not to go.  That may or may not have been good advice, 
but it was the advice I received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of what should happen to an individual who deals 
with the flag inappropriately, I would turn that question back to 
the member himself.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The inappropriate restriction of the flag in this House as I 
said in my speech came about when the debate was on a brand new 
flag for Canada.  It was being used inappropriately. I do not 
think that should take place in the Chamber any more than the 
hon. member does, but to be able to demonstrate a small flag, 
what would the hon. member's constituents say? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to another member say that this could have been done 
another way.  I will grant that there are different ways to bring 
an issue forward.  I will grant that making a circus of an issue 
is not appropriate.  But this is important.  We are not talking 
about the process here.  We are talking about a simple 
declaration, should the flag of Canada be allowed in the national 
House of Parliament.  What would the member's constituents say 
about him having— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time for 
response has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether it is really a 
pleasure to be speaking in the House on this particular motion. 
This is not what I thought I would be debating. I was preparing 
for a debate on the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling of the Speaker yesterday put it very clearly that he 
was not in a position to decide, and that Parliament, this House 
of Commons, had to make the decision itself.  I think it is very 
appropriate that this motion be on the floor today so that this 
House of Commons deals with the issue and we put the issue to 
bed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate about flags in the House of Commons did not start 
three weeks ago.  Half of all Canadians are too young to remember 
the first great flag debate 34 years ago when the red maple leaf 
replaced the red ensign.  It was one of the most emotional 
debates both inside this House of Commons and outside by all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a teenager I recall the debate taking place around the dining 
room table.  I can remember vividly the emotions in that debate. 
My father, like many men of his generation, had a particular 
attachment to the red ensign.  As a naval officer and a medical 
doctor serving in the North Atlantic during the second world war, 
my father saw too many men die fighting for Canada and for the 
red ensign.  He was very emotional about the defence of the red 
ensign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many others objected to the adoption of the maple leaf as our 
flag because the broad leaf maple is native only to the eastern 
part of the country and not to the western part. Still others 
thought it was a Liberal plot. In spite of these objections, 
today most Canadians have a very emotional attachment to the 
flag. Most Canadians felt a very deep sense of pride when they 
saw the maple leaf rise up the flagpole at the Olympics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was at the recent winter Olympics that the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis announced to the Canadian public that there were 
too many Canadian flags on display at the athletes village. In 
response to this pronouncement when the hon. member returned to 
this House, members on both sides of the House demonstrated their 
objections to those comments. I was one of them.  I was one of 
the many members on both sides who were out of order in that 
demonstration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Rimouski—Mitis was never denied her opportunity 
to speak. She was just delayed.  Many of us have been delayed in 
posing questions in this House because other members were out of 
order and causing distractions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flag waving and singing of the national anthem should have 
been the end of it.  However, because of the overreaction of 
certain members in this House and the joy of continuing this 
debate in the media, we have found ourselves in the middle of the 
second great flag debate.  What should have been a one day story 
is now reaching its third week. Efforts to reach a compromise by 
the various House leaders were unsuccessful because people and 
parties refused to budge in their positions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Speaker ruled that he did not have the power to 
change the rules of the House.  Therefore today we are having 
this debate to see if members of Parliament are willing to change 
the rules to allow a small Canadian flag to sit on a member's 
desk in an unobtrusive manner.  But make no mistake about it. 
The debate will not end here with this vote because we still have 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs examining 
another aspect of this story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we having all these debates at all?  When people have 
asked me why we have reached this position, the only answer I can 
give is that this entire debate is due to an excess of 
testosterone in this House.  People have become so intransigent 
in their positions that reason and logic have left the debate and 
it is now based on pure emotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us to today's motion.  I do not believe that anyone 
who does not have a Canadian flag on their desk is any less a 
Canadian than someone who does. I spent my first four years in 
this House without a Canadian flag on my desk and I feel no less 
a Canadian for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question in today's motion is should the Canadian flag be 
allowed to sit on a member's desk in the Chamber. The only 
argument I have heard against having desk flags is that they can 
be used as props to cause a disruption in this House.  We do not 
need flags to cause a disruption in this House.  We are a clever 
group of people and to get our point across we find many other 
means of causing distractions and disruptions in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what would have happened if some members started to 
disrupt the proceedings by banging their shoes on their desks 
like Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev did at the United Nations in 
the early 1960s.  Would we then have motions to outlaw shoes from 
this Chamber?  Of course we would not because everyone would 
realize that it was not the shoe that was the problem but the way 
it was being used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same point with the flag.  Today's motion makes it 
clear that the flag is to remain stationary and is not to be used 
as a distraction to the debate.  How can this be objectionable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a member decides to use the flag to create a disturbance, he 
or she would be clearly out of order and subject to the authority 
of the Speaker.  If a member cannot bring a small Canadian flag 
into this Chamber, then where can we bring a flag? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I conclude my comments on this subject, I would like to make 
the following observation.  The federalists have no reason to 
apologize to the separatists in this House.  We must counter 
their separatist arguments with intelligence, logic and positive 
use of emotion and patriotism.  The separatists would like 
nothing more than to provoke another incident like the 
desecration of the Quebec flag in Brockville in the early 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be diligent to keep the debate focused.  It would be 
refreshing if all parties and all members would take the high 
road and get on with the serious debate that Canadians expect us 
to carry on in this House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member just stated if we cannot bring the Canadian flag into the 
House where can we bring it. I and many of my colleagues have 
been bringing the flag on our lapel pins into the House ever 
since we were elected.  I do not know where the member has been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is not about flags. It is about the institutions of 
Parliament.  It is about the institution of free speech.  It is 
about the ability of expression in this House.  The Reform Party 
does not seem to understand or respect our basic institutions of 
Parliament.  Is it fair to wipe out somebody's ability to speak 
freely in this House just by having demonstrations?  What other 
kinds of flags can we bring into this House?  The Canadian flag 
and what about some provincial flags? Would that be acceptable to 
the member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have no objection to 
bringing provincial flags into the House but the motion is—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have proven my point. We 
do not need any flags to disrupt a person's right to speak. We 
are all capable of disrupting a person's right to speak and of 
denying them the opportunity.  We do not need flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the Liberals want to listen to the answers to their 
questions, the point of this motion is clear that it is Canadian 
flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That's not what you just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>   No.  They asked me what I thought and 
I said I have no objection to provincial flags being brought into 
the House.  But the motion is very clear that we are talking 
about the Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of Parliament, when I want the right to express 
myself by putting a Canadian flag on my desk, it is wrong but if 
somebody wants to wear a button or make comments on the 
expression of their position, that is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest I have as much right as anybody else to express my 
emotions or whatnot in whatever way I feel is applicable.  Maybe 
a small Canadian flag is the way I wish to express myself, and I 
am being denied that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before the hon. 
member for York South—Weston poses his question, I remind all 
hon. members to address each other through the Chair. In 
particular when emotions run high, it tends to keep us at arm's 
length. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, can the hon. member advise the House whether she is 
aware of any other place in Canada, whether it be a public place 
or a private place, where the displaying of the Canadian flag is 
prohibited?  Could she also comment on whether she believes the 
prohibition of the displaying of the Canadian flag in a place 
other than the House of Commons would be contrary to the charter 
of rights and freedoms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not aware of any 
place where the Canadian flag is prohibited from being displayed. 
Any infringement on a person's right to put a Canadian flag up 
in a public place would be an infringement.  It certainly would 
be in the House of Commons.  This is the seat of government for 
the country called Canada.  If we cannot put a small flag on our 
desks, I think it is an infringement on my right. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have one point to make and a short question.  It is 
not against the law to display the flag.  We have two flags here. 
We are talking specifically about putting them on our desks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week one of our colleagues, the member for Medicine Hat, 
threw the flag on the floor.  As far as I know, he did not 
apologize for it, nor did he pick up the flag.  Did the hon. 
member have the chance to speak to her colleague about the 
incident?  What does she have to say on this subject? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, no one condones what 
happened at that time and the member for Medicine Hat has 
apologized for throwing the flag. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my 
time with the member for Brossard—La Prairie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked to speak today but I am saddened that this debate 
is taking place.  I think of all the things we could be debating 
tonight.  We are voting on budgets, among other things.  I think 
of what has been displaced by this time.  But it is a choice. 
Canadians have to understand that while the government is elected 
and generally puts its legislation forward to be properly debated 
in this House, we have these days of opposition motions, and it 
was the Reform Party, the party of the member who just spoke, 
that chose to have this debate.  We must understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is not about who is the most patriotic.  I do not 
find this debate to be about patriotism.  I firmly believe that 
patriotism is not only individual.  It is collective as a nation. 
It is the sharing of values and what we believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not find it necessary to stand up and parade all the 
examples of how I show my patriotism. 
I am here as the servant of the people who elected me from the 
constituency of London West.  They elected me to do the business 
of the nation.  They elected me to come to this Parliament and to 
debate with my words, not with props, with flags or with noise. 
They elected me to think, to research, to represent and, I 
believe, to lead.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was thinking about what I would say today I looked back 
to my first speech in 1993 when I talked about what a privilege 
it was to serve in this House.  I talked about having the courage 
and the courtesy to serve not only my constituents but my own 
sense of values.  That courtesy, I believe, extended to members 
sitting across from me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke for the first time in the 36th Parliament I said 
“I wish to congratulate the Speakers”, and I went on to say 
that I would co-operate and respect this office and this 
Parliament. I also said that I would continue to treat other 
members with the respect and courtesy which any member of 
Parliament deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is fundamental.  I think the issue we are really 
addressing today is how this Parliament functions for all 
Canadians and how we bring the legislature out of the war of 
words into action in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very democratic institution.  From across the nation 
men and women are drawn together, often sacrificing time from 
their careers and their families, to express ideas and to battle 
each other through ideas and policies, not individually, not the 
political thrust of the cheap shot.  How we manage to do that is 
through an institution called the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker in Canada is elected by all members of the House. It 
is the very first thing we do each time we come together to open 
a new Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has been given the obligation to make sure that 
order is maintained in the House.  The Speaker is there to make 
sure that when I rise to speak I do not have to fear someone 
coming at me physically.  I can get my ideas across to all the 
people in the land.  I can put forth an argument that can be 
heard.  The Speaker ensures that I have the ability to make my 
argument democratically, logically, without coercion or fear from 
anyone in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are parliaments, such as the one in Kenya, where last 
spring the members almost began a fist fight.  There have been 
other examples throughout the Commonwealth and other democracies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this Chamber is to debate ideas.  It is not for 
stunts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask how have we come to this position where it is us and them 
politics. The symbol of our nation sits beside us.  It has not 
been outlawed to have the flag in this Chamber.  I am looking at 
it. Canadians can look at it.  Every time the camera is focused 
on the Speaker they see it.  We are not outlawing the flag.  This 
is not about flags.  This is about our being able to speak 
freely. We are able to speak freely because there is a person 
sitting in that chair who keeps order in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a back door effort to appeal a ruling of the Speaker, 
whom we all said we respected when we elected him, which was made 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard an hon. member opposite say that all they are asking for 
is a yes or a no today.  They want to talk about it again.  If 
they had ears or eyes in the House yesterday they would have seen 
every party except one stand to applaud the Speaker.  The 
Speaker's decision was right.  It was based on precedent and 
precedent in this Chamber has ruled out props.  Why?  Because 
they are not necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not necessary to have push button politics and stunts on 
the Hill.  It is not necessary to hire mariachi bands to know 
that absenteeism is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two teenage sons.  I do not want to see grown men sitting 
around in an unsafe manner, abusing the flag as was done on the 
Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayers do not want to see any member of Parliament behave 
as these people have behaved in the last little while.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a time in 1993 when somebody said “we came to Ottawa 
to do politics differently”.  How different has it been?  It has 
been very different.  It seems that research, logic and courtesy 
have gone the way for cheap headline hunting.  I see this motion 
as political manipulation of a very base kind.  I do not have to 
defend myself that I do not love my country or I am not patriotic 
enough because there is a symbol sitting in front of me.  I 
wonder how many people sitting at their desks today have a symbol 
sitting in front of them.  However, I would never question their 
loyalty to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The absence of symbols in this House in this manner is not the 
be all and end all.  I appreciate the fact that members opposite 
have even acknowledged that today.  I think it is reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about reasonable debate, following the rules, courtesy 
and respect for the institutions of our democracies as shown by 
the Speaker's rulings.  To my knowledge there are no appeals to 
Speaker's rulings.  We do not do things in democracies by the 
back door.  There are rule books such as Beauchesne's which 
states very strictly how to go against the Speaker.  One may 
bring forward a motion and debate it.  Do the members opposite 
have the courage to debate that?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a way out.  However, things are very rarely 
answered properly by a yes or a no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is something which I regard as one of the 
lower days of debate and it is not because I do not value my 
flag.  The flag deserves to be known for what it really is.  In 
Canada it is a symbol of a country that knows peace, shows 
tolerance and knows understanding.  It is a symbol of those that 
are greater than the individuals who stand in this country, 
whether they are here by choice or by birth, and it is worthy of 
respect.  It is not worthy of disrespect to make cheap political 
points and play political games that are not entertaining, funny 
or worthy of the democratic institutions as fine as Canada has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have one of the best democracies in the world.  We have one 
of the best parliaments in the world.  In my maiden speech in 
1993 I said to a member of the Bloc, who talked to me about the 
right to speak, that I would defend their right to speak but did 
not have to agree with their ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be voting against this motion tonight because I do not 
believe that I need to have a prop to show my love for my country 
or the value of this institution.  I know what I am doing and I 
know my constituents will understand. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did note 
very carefully the member's comments about respect for the Chair 
and that is something that I share.  I wonder if she could 
reflect for me on the Chair's statement that the Chair could not 
unilaterally change the conventions of Parliament but that 
Parliament itself could.  We have a convention which states that 
flags should not be used in the House.  This convention came from 
a specific display years ago.  However, the Speaker said that 
Parliament could change the conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member stand and explain to me how she finds this 
process today, which is attempting to do that, offensive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before the hon. 
parliamentary secretary responds, because we had other members 
from the opposition wanting to ask questions, we will go to the 
opposition for the second question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt in my 
mind that the member of the Reform Party had the right to choose 
the subject matter of debate.  There is also no doubt in my mind 
that Reform members knew last night, as we applauded the Speaker, 
what the outcome of that vote would be.  All they had to do was 
look around to see that the only persons not applauding the 
Speaker's decision were the Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, they have the right to bring this to debate.  However, it 
is not a debate that was needed to take the time of this 
Parliament when we have situations of unemployment, the budget 
and other important situations.  However, that was not my choice. 
It was theirs and they have made.  I also think there are other 
manipulations going on here which I think Canadians are beginning 
to understand. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. member is so opposed to the debate, why is 
she participating in the debate?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to the debate all morning.  Perhaps the 
hon. member can explain why, instead of dealing with the merits 
of the motion before the House, she and her colleagues have 
chosen to attack another political party.  They accuse the Reform 
Party of being partisan in bringing forward this motion.  Rather 
than dealing with the merits of the motion itself, she has chosen 
to attack the Reform Party, presumably to make political points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member is does she feel somewhat 
inconsistent?  On one hand the Government of Canada is saying to 
Canadians to fly the Canadian flag and it sent out hundreds of 
thousands of flags to Canadians this past year at a cost of 
millions of dollars.  On the other hand, she would support a 
restriction of the use of the flag in the Canadian House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the 
member has shown up for this debate.  I am glad he is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here because I am on House duty today.  Members of 
Parliament come to this place to work.  This is part of my work, 
being in this House at a time when I am responsible to be here, 
to partake in the debate of the day and I will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member opposite knows that is a part of the work 
of this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member talk about how reprehensible the stunts 
that have revolved around this issue are and how offensive they 
are to her.  I would ask her if that is the case, speaking for 
herself or her party, why all the flags were waving on that side 
of the House on the day the incident took place.  It was a 
Liberal member, I believe, who distributed the flags.  It was a 
Liberal member who started to sing <I>O Canada</I> during the 
debate.  What has her party done to discipline those individuals 
for this reprehensible display that they started? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the 
member opposite, but of course I am constrained from doing so, 
what his party has done to discipline those members who threw the 
flags in this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I find it very interesting that the opposition, given a day of 
debate, uses the whole day to talk about flags, when there are so 
many national issues and concerns.  I consider this opposition 
party is paying us a remarkable compliment on the work we have 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could point out that I consider respect for 
patriotism is also expressed through respect for the language of 
those who make up our country and I can only deplore the fact that 
the text of the motion, which arrived by electronic mail, contained 
so many mistakes in the French as to insult me personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Patriotism is a fine thing, but it starts with respect for 
those who make up this country and respect for my language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of patriotism, I would like to mention two or 
three very brief experiences demonstrating that patriotism does not 
always find expression in a flag.  It is something we feel very 
deeply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last July 1, my first Canada Day as a member of Parliament, I 
was given the honour of an invitation to attend a citizenship 
ceremony.  I spoke with the new Canadians saying “Look, I arrived 
here twenty years ago and like you I ended up here on these chairs; 
today I represent the Government of Canada”.  That was a symbol of 
pride for me.  That is my patriotism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the great demonstration in Montreal before the 1995 
referendum, my daughter Jessica had the honour of singing the 
national anthem.  I was behind the podium when she did.  I saw the 
crowd.  I saw the emotion.  That is what patriotism means to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991, I was elected to chair the Quebec wing of the Liberal 
Party of Canada, when it was very difficult being a federalist in 
Quebec. And for my daughter to have sung the national anthem and 
for everyone to have risen with tears in their eyes, that for me is 
patriotism.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My patriotism is not the show off type. It is deep and genuine. It 
is not made up of symbolic values artificially displayed for purely 
political reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that symbols are very important. I noticed, in Quebec in 
particular, that the Quebec flag was appropriated by the separatists, as 
if it belonged only to separatist sympathizers. I have deplored that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word “Quebecois”, as in Parti Quebecois and Bloc Quebecois, was 
also appropriated by the separatists, as if the other parties in Quebec 
were not “Quebecois”. I know how powerful symbols can be, but beyond the 
symbols, there is something greater, there is what we feel deep down. 
To fight about flags in this House is to use a highly respectable symbol 
for partisan reasons of opposition and appropriation, which I vehemently 
condemn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems to me to be a pointless motion. It seems to be 
counterproductive, unnecessary. What saddens me above all is that we are 
wasting so much time debating it. It is as if we were giving Canadians 
the signal, or symbol, that we parliamentarians are prepared to waste 
precious time that would be better spent serving the people of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it most unfortunate that this flag debate has been turned 
into an exercise in demagogy. I want to believe that, when the flag is 
used, there is a modicum of sincerity— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order.  I was listening very intently to my 
colleague opposite and to his impassioned speech about patriotism 
and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that when we impugn motives in this House that we 
should be censured.  The member opposite has just accused us of 
practising demagoguery.  I submit that that is impugning motives 
behind our motion today.  The motion today is not about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I apologize.  I was 
not paying attention to the hon. speaker.  I did not hear the 
words being used.  However, the hon. member for Wetaskiwin is 
quite right. If the word or the inference was there, I would ask 
the hon. member for Brossard—La Prairie not to impute motive. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Mr. Speaker, when one moves a motion, one should 
logically have a reason to do so. And if so, it is my duty, as a 
parliamentarian, to make a value judgment on that reason. I am not 
imputing motives. So, I stand by my comment to the effect that this is 
a red herring. It is not a debate on patriotism, but a debate that has 
absolutely no substance. Again, I deplore this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was going to conclude by saying I sincerely hope that everyone in 
this House will agree on the eminently respectable character of the 
Canadian flag. 
However, I will conclude by asking this question: If the motion is 
passed, if those who want to display a flag on their desk are allowed to 
do so, and if I do not want a flag on my desk, would this mean I am less 
patriotic than other members? This is totally absurd. I condemn it and 
I deplore it.

<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the speaker and certainly I think he should read our 
motion.  Our motion is not about asking or forcing people to put 
flags on their desks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is entirely about the ability to put a flag on one's desk if 
they so choose.  I think if this debate were to be held anywhere 
else in the free world, it would be surprising. 
Our flag is welcome absolutely anywhere on foreign soil and it is 
just amazing to me that we are debating whether or not the 
Canadian flag can sit on members' desks if they so choose.

is speaking.

English, if this motion were to be adopted and if I decided not 
to have a flag on my desk, the question was clear, should that

than someone else who has it?  I say putting the question is 
totally absurd.

Canadian about 20 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to remind him that, originally, there were two 
founding peoples in Canada, and the first one was a francophone people 
called the Canadiens. At the time, the term “Canadiens” referred 
strictly to francophones. Then came a period known as English Rule. 
Being the nice people that we are, we agreed that there would be two 
founding peoples, and Canadians who, until then had always been 
Canadiens, redefined themselves as French Canadians.

happy, I will say that francophones were one of the first two founding 
peoples. It was only later, when the English came, that we called 
ourselves French Canadians. Then, when we realized that this definition 
put us in opposition with English Canadians, we decided to call 
ourselves Quebeckers, and today—

Brossard—La Prairie has one minute to reply.

These days, we hear a lot about the people of Quebec, and I am glad to 
see that the member opposite knows that the founding people did not only 
settle in Quebec, but includes all French speaking people in Canada. 
Together they do form what I recognize as a founding people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other more important issues that we could be dealing 
with, but unfortunately we are being forced to debate this issue 
in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought it was understood that it is the right of 
every Canadian to have, to hold and to wear the Canadian flag in 
Canada.  Of all the places on earth it is inconceivable and hard 
to imagine that Canadians could be prohibited from displaying 
even a small Canadian flag in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where else can we display our flag?  Tomorrow someone could 
stand and ask me not to wear a Canadian flag pin.  Is there a 
more sacred place to display our flag than in our own national 
legislature?  In the highest law making body of our country we 
cannot have a flag on our desks.  This is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I embraced Canadian citizenship I assumed that I was given 
a bundle of rights.  The first thing I did after my swearing in 
as a Canadian citizen was to sing our national anthem.  I then 
carried home a Canadian flag which I respectfully put on my desk 
in my home office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of our flag like all other Canadians who have 
called my office in the last few days.  I have a Canadian flag on 
my desk in my offices, yet today I am defending the right to 
place a Canadian flag on this desk, my constituents' desk in the 
House of Commons.  This is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the most respected House and the highest court in the 
land.  I strongly believe and join with my colleagues in their 
belief that we should respect decorum in the House.  Every 
Canadian's voice is roaring without fear or intimidation in the 
House.  Ridiculous heckling is allowed in the House and sometimes 
it is disrespectful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What some Canadians would say are treasonous comments. 
Disrespect for our national symbols is allowed in the House. 
However, Canadians have a problem when our national symbol, the 
flag of this great country, is considered offensive in the House. 
I feel intimidated that my right to display the Canadian flag is 
being denied today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me and my constituents that this weak government has 
been blackmailed by those who are bent upon tearing the country 
apart.  It seems as if the government has been scared by the 
separatists.  The Liberals are running like scared cats.  They 
have spent $25 million of the taxpayers' money to give away 
Canadian flags so that our flag would have an increased presence 
in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, Mr. Speaker, the number of flags around 
your chair has doubled since 1992 and now the presence of the 
Canadian flag is being decreased in the House.  The government 
has given me large quantities of Canadian flags and Canadian flag 
pins to take to my constituency and present to my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What answer should I give to someone who may ask me where our 
flag can and cannot be displayed?  This is not a flag waving 
issue today as stated by some members and as reported in the 
news.  The issue is not that I must put a flag on my desk, but 
the issue is why I should be prohibited from putting a flag on my 
desk.  It is about the infringement of my rights, freedom of 
speech and freedom of expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just because someone feels offended by the displaying of the 
Canadian flag in the House, I feel more offended when I am 
prohibited from honourably displaying my country's flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents of Surrey Central and I want the record to be 
very clear that this problem was not initiated by the Reform 
Party. Let me remind the House and Canadians that the flag we are 
debating today was distributed and displayed by Liberal members 
to all members in the House.  Members from all the parties except 
the Bloc participated in singing the national anthem on the day 
when the issue arose. 
If props are not allowed, why were they distributed in the first 
place in the House?  Even on the day the budget was tabled some 
Liberal MPs displayed a big flag in that corner of the House. Why 
were they not ruled out of order?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the Reform Party that originated this issue.  The 
official opposition is simply fighting a forceful denial of the 
right to exhibit the flag on our desks in the House because of a 
fear of the separatists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an issue between the Reform Party and other parties. 
It is an issue of calling a spade a spade and having the right to 
fight, to defend our country's flag, to defend the integrity of 
our great country and to respect our national symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue separates those who are afraid from those who do not 
like the Canadian flag.  Those who are afraid to defend our 
Canadian flag are those who are afraid of offending anyone in 
defence of our flag.  Those are the members of the Liberal Party 
and other parties in the House.  They wanted to unnecessarily 
drag the issue on and bury it in a committee.  They have made the 
issue a political football.  It is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They fail to recognize the consequences of their cowardliness in 
Canadian history.  They are not only leaving behind high debt and 
high taxes for future generations, but today they are leaving 
behind a legacy of a shameful story in our history.  What else 
can we expect from the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything the government does raises suspicion.  The House and 
the government voted against my motion asking the government to 
call a Canadian a Canadian and discourage the concept of 
hyphenated Canadianism.  That motion could have been uniting and 
integrating Canadians rather than segregating them further.  It 
could have helped restore national pride.  Instead, the Liberals 
do not want Canadians to be encouraged to call ourselves proud 
Canadians.  They do not foster and develop Canadian culture.  Now 
they allow our right to sing the national anthem and the right to 
display our flag to be attacked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the weekend my 13 year old son, Livjot, asked me what country 
all members of Parliament represent in the House of Commons.  I 
said “Canada of course”.  He asked if Quebec was a country.  I 
said “no”.  Then he asked why there was a problem about the 
Canadian flag in the Canadian parliament.  I was ashamed.  I 
could not answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, a vote against the Canadian flag being displayed by 
an elected and sworn Canadian is like a vote against motherhood. 
The flag flap has gone on long enough and certainly should not be 
decided by backroom negotiations but by Canadians through their 
MPs in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the constituents of Surrey Central I will vote in 
support of today's official opposition motion and I will be proud 
to have the Canadian flag displayed on our desks in the House of 
Commons.  I urge hon. members in the House to put the issue to 
rest and focus on more important issues.  Let us have a free vote 
on the matter in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On questions and 
comments, we have the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre and 
then we have the hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood who has

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I continue to be quite shocked at the way the Reform 
Party attempts to divide the country.  What it is doing in this 
assembly, in this House of Commons, is what a very famous writer 
by the name of Samuel Johnson once said about actions with 
respect to so-called patriotism or the flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Samuel Johnson, a great political writer of another century, 
wrote about this kind of action, this kind of party, and said 
that patriotism was the last act of a scoundrel, a desperate act 
of a scoundrel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is exercising hooliganism tactics of former 
decades which political parties of other countries have used to 
bully people around this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform member is so patriotic about the flag, how many 
Reform members have a flag on their property, on their homes, 
hanging in front of their houses on poles or in their offices in 
their ridings?  How many have those flags in their houses to show 
what great patriots they are? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we expect these comments 
from the member of a party that is out of touch with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not putting a flag on a desk.  The issue is why we 
are not allowed to put a flag on our desks when we want to put 
one there.  For many years there were no flags on the desks of 
members of the House.  We did not start the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members who are not listening now are the ones who are using 
it as a political football.  The issue was decided upon by 
members on the other side.  They displayed the flag.  Why did 
they not object the other day when the flag was displayed on the 
other side of the House?  It is simply because they want to get 
political mileage out of it, which they will be unsuccessful in 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We respect the Canadian flag.  If we respect the Canadian flag 
then why are we forced not to display it in the House? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this debate is unbelievable.  The Reform Party motion 
talks in its last sentence of “purposes of decorum”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look around this Chamber which was designed and built by 
some of the greatest craftsmen and women in the history of our 
country.  We see stained glass windows and woodwork.  This 
Chamber is very much like a cathedral in Rome or in some other 
great European city.  This is a room of decorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are missing the whole point of what this Chamber is 
all about.  They are trying to suggest that none of us really 
care about the flag, even though there are two flags on either 
side of the most respected chair in the House of Commons. They 
could not be in a more prominent place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that Reformers are so interested in the decorum of this 
place, the look or the design of this place, they should also 
present some other ideas that I have heard from that side.  What 
about flags of different sizes across the banisters here from 
left to right or from north to south like we see at gas stations 
or at Canadian Tire stores?  Is that the kind of decorum the 
Reform Party wants in the House of Commons?  These guys— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt.  The hon. member for Surrey Central has about 35 
seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am more than happy to 
answer the question.  He is one of the members who displayed the 
six foot flag on the other side of the House the day the budget 
was tabled.  Where was he or his colleagues— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I can stand in the House of Commons and say that on the 
day that display took place I was at the opposite end of this 
Chamber.  I did not have a flag— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood has made his point.  Now perhaps the hon. 
member for Surrey Central could finish up.  You have 10 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe he is not the 
member who displayed the flag but it is in that same corner that 
the flag was displayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I take part in a debate about our flag, the symbol of our 
land.  As with all that occurs in this honourable House, our 
contributions are made both with a view to the current benefit of 
Canadians and as a testament to our time and our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be it 10, 20 or 50 years from now, students and scholars of 
Canadian history will read our words and interpret what has gone 
on here.  We should always be mindful that every time we speak as 
members of this honourable House we contribute to the history of 
our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that the words of myself and my colleagues will be 
viewed in this light.  I trust that my colleagues' expression of 
support will serve as a catalyst to do more to help break the 
bonds of apathetic Canadianism, to usher in a new found spirit of 
love for our country and its symbol, our flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permission to display a small, aesthetically appropriate desk 
flag as we speak to the world and as we speak to history is all 
that is being requested.  For those who wish, as I do, to have 
the choice to be identified with a flag in this way as we debate, 
why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who know why I strove to arrive in this House, they 
understand.  For those who fought, spilled blood, lost friends on 
foreign lands for our great country in three wars, they 
understand.  For millions who held their breath two years ago 
when the no side came through, they understand.  For the 150,000 
people who gathered in Montreal two days before the referendum, 
they too, understand.  For the 2,000 people from all parts of 
Canada who gathered in Quebec City one year later, they also 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish <I>Hansard</I> to show how I see this debate.  I want 
history to record my sentiments toward our flag and how our flag 
has been viewed in this debate, and the events leading up to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak to my hon. colleagues and to history as follows.  How a 
nation views itself is a measure of its pride and self esteem. 
How a nation is viewed by the world is a reflection of its 
collective deeds.  How a nation projects this image is through 
its national symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our nation is known throughout the world for its deeds in war 
and peace.  Canada's symbol is its flag which floats over this 
very House.  Our flag is the embodiment of our nation's heart and 
soul.  Our flag is inseparable from our national will.  This 
House must carefully ponder why my voice should be put to rest 
when the flag stands by my desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish to reflect our support.  We choose to have a small flag 
on our desk for the country we represent, to identify our role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was privileged to have been elected to this House by the 
constituents of Edmonton East.  I am privileged every day I am 
permitted to sit in this honourable House at this desk, a desk 
that shall never belong to me or any politician of the day but 
instead remains the property of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with this sense of privilege that I express myself today. 
I am one of the parliamentarians who declined to remove the 
Canadian flag from his desk when requested to do so by the Deputy 
Speaker.  In doing so, my privileges as a member were adversely 
affected.  I was not recognized for the purpose of speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of respect for the office of the Speaker and out of respect 
for the need of orderly regulation in this House, I did not 
protest further.  I was saddened but I did not protest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker now has ruled.  It is out of respect for the office 
of the Speaker that I have removed my Canadian flag today.  I am 
pleased to be able to participate in the debate to support a 
motion to allow my flag to return to my desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to speak about respect for our Canadian flag and respect 
for our Canadian institutions, of this institution, this 
honourable House and the Supreme Court of Canada or any other 
through which our democracy is preserved and enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my great sadness, I notice that the display of the Canadian 
flag has been regarded by the separatists in the House as a form 
of provocation.  I notice, too, that the request to remove the 
flags from our desks came from a separatist.  Provocation is a 
word used many time in the House, both today and last week, 
provocation by the Liberals and provocation by Reform. 
The simple fact is that this sad affair was started by the 
Liberals bringing flags into the House, exasperated by Bloc 
members wanting them to be removed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now closure has been effected by the Reform motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received many e-mails on this issue in the past three 
weeks.  Almost every one of them has been supportive.  Over and 
over again Canadians asked:  How can it be provocation to fly the 
flag of our nation?  Many of these grassroots Canadians suggested 
that if a member has a problem with the sight of the Canadian 
flag, perhaps he or she should look in the mirror for the source 
of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated in my motion which is on the Notice Paper, 
the flag should not be considered to be offensive and should 
always be welcome in the House.  I agree that it should not be 
used to suppress the rights of a fellow member, but the mere 
sight of the flag does not do that.  It is a symbol of our 
commitment to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most of the history of this House there was not a Canadian 
flag present, until the efforts in 1973 of Alexandre Cyr, then 
the hon. member for Gaspé.  Today that riding is represented by 
the Bloc.  Representing his constituents, Mr. Cyr brought a flag 
to this House 25 years ago.  Now there are two, twice as many as 
the 1973 motion allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that this flag debate is considered by some to be 
provocation and by others to be frivolous.  Provocation is in the 
eye of the beholder.  No provocation is intended in my 
contribution to today's debate, nor in my earlier actions. 
However, I must say that I certainly do not approach this debate 
with a sense of the frivolous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's problem is a deep-seated inferiority complex. Canadians 
have been uncomfortable with flag waving, celebrating our country 
and singing our national anthem.  There is little hesitancy in 
other countries.  The national pride, as exemplified by the 
waving of flags, is seen everywhere in England, France and the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me provide the House with an example of how the display of 
flags, both in this House and elsewhere, is important to our 
future as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall a well published event which took place outside 
Montreal's city hall.  Visitors from France spoke to Jacques 
Parizeau and a group of his separatist cohorts on the steps of 
the city hall.  Many Quebec flags were visible.  Where did the 
flags come from?  From inside Montreal's city hall.  What was the 
problem?  There were several veterans present who wished to see 
the Canadian flag displayed before the delegation from France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Montreal that day on one of my frequent visits to the 
city.  The veterans who I met that day were beside themselves 
with angst.  To describe matters in a most charitable fashion, it 
appeared that the display of the Canadian flag had been very much 
discouraged at the time of the appearance of the visitors from 
France.  France is free today, due in no small part to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I ask the House to allow the display of this symbol of our 
country when we speak in this honourable place.  I want to show 
to all that our national symbol may sit with us in this 
honourable place as a symbol of how close it is to our hearts. 
When I speak to Canada, there is no flag visible to those who see 
and hear my words.  I wish only to do as I did at the chamber of 
commerce meeting in Edmonton two weeks ago.  I placed the flag of 
Canada on my table in that chamber.  I would like to do likewise 
in this Chamber.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
passion filled debate today.  I do not think for a second that 
members of the House should forget why we are here and what this 
is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened closely to the words of the hon. member and I have 
some serious problems and difficulties with where he was coming 
from and what exactly he was talking about. There are a number of 
people who are watching this debate who may not understand it. It 
is simply a question of respect and trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one group in the House of Commons, along with some 
members opposite, who wave the flag and use it as a type of 
sledgehammer to beat upon someone else who may not be willing to 
wave it.  That is why we do not have flags on our desks.  That is 
why there are flags beside the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about the Canadian flag; this is about a waste of 
time.  We are wasting the Canadian taxpayers' time to debate 
whether we should have flags on our desks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to add another point.  We are listening to talk about the 
flag today.  On February 15, 1995, the leader of the member's 
party was the guy who stated that the debate over the Canadian 
flag on Canada's flag day at that time was frivolous and a waste 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You don't wear the flag— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Excuse me.  I would 
remind members to address other members through the Chair.  It 
tends to keep the tempers in control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member 
is missing the whole point of this issue.  The point of this 
issue is that we are in the television era.  We are in an era 
where I can speak here and I can speak directly to the 
constituents in Edmonton East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I view the TV camera and if I am speaking in my critic area 
of veterans' affairs or some other important issues, there is 
nothing visible here to say where I am from.  If I wish to have a 
Canadian flag on my desk which would help indicate my loyalty to 
the flag and to the country when I speak on veterans' affairs 
issues, I think it is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I specifically wish to have this flag on my desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Scarborough Centre has 
about a minute. 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is funny that the Reform Party which came here after the 1993 
election, four years down the road has just discovered where it 
is from.  I am surprised why its members did not put on a flag in 
1993 when they first got elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is this.  They talk about the flag and 
the pins.  I happened to be in Nagano during the olympics.  I 
want, for a moment, to tell this House what the member from 
Rimouski—Mitis did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She was very proud to give out the Canadian pins, one that I 
wear today.  She was very proud to wave the Canadian flag 
celebrating our athletes.  I do not see their Canadian olympic 
pin being worn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point when they talk about a form of provocation, was the 
member for Rimouski—Mitis provoking when she was handing out the 
pins, when she was waving the flags celebrating our athletes?  I 
do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have said to me what has taken the Reform Party so 
long to discover that they want to display the flag?  In the 
opinion of my constituents, the flag is best suited right on each 
side of your honourable chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the many parliaments that we have visited, we have not seen 
members displaying flags on their desks.  I see no reason why we 
have to do that now.  They are best presented right where you 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member 
opposite is forgetting what I just said in my speech.  I will 
repeat it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple fact is that this sad affair was started by the 
Liberals bringing flags into this House.  They were exasperated 
by the Bloc and wanted them removed.  Now the Reform Party is 
affecting closure on it by bringing forth this motion.

this year the focus of the United Nations Children's Fund,

</I></B></P><P align=left>Malnutrition is a world problem.  It is an invisible killer 
which affects 800 million children annually.  Incredibly and 
sadly, more than half of child deaths worldwide can be attributed 
to malnutrition.  This is unmatched by any other infectious 
disease since the black death and, further, those who survive are 
usually left vulnerable to infectious disease, illness and 
intellectual disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to nutrition is a matter of international law. 
Agreements such as the 1989 convention on the rights of the 
child, ratified by 191 countries including Canada, recognized the 
right of all children to have the highest attainable standards of 
health, including the right to good nutrition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Government of Canada to support UNICEF and honour the 
provisions of our international declarations by helping overcome 
this silent killer of the world's children.  Action against 
malnutrition is both imperative and possible.  No child should be 
hungry in this world of plenty.  No child should be hungry in 
Canada.

benefits dropped from 60% in 1993 to 42% in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the so-called spring gap, the time of year when thousands 
of unemployed workers see their benefits run out as they wait for 
seasonal work to start again. These families have to turn to social 
assistance or use up their savings to provide for their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the federal government continues to reduce its deficit by 
dipping into the employment insurance fund. 
The employment insurance fund keeps growing by $17 million a day, for a 
total of $14 billion to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough. It is time the money went back to those to whom it belongs. 
The government should give back to the unemployed the benefits it took 
away from them and to workers the portion of their premiums in excess of 
what is needed to maintain a fair and equitable system.

in Victoria, I attended the International Summit of Sexually 
Exploited Youth.  This gathering was co-chaired by Senator Landon 
Pearson. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit theme, out from the shadows, reflects the importance 
of giving a voice to sexually exploited youth and children.  We 
listened to children talking about their personal experiences. We 
listened as 15-year olds and 16-year olds said they were not 
given the chance to be a child and to enjoy all the joys and 
challenges that come with childhood, as my daughters have.

victims of abuse related to child pornography and child 
prostitution.  Since Canada is a signatory to the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the summit was an 
excellent opportunity to renew our commitment to the right of all 
children and youth to live free from sexual abuse and free from 
sexual exploitation.

<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today British Columbia's latest unelected unaccountable 
senator was sworn in at the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fitzpatrick is not like other patronage appointments though. He 
actually hired the Prime Minister when the Prime Minister was out 
of a job. Last week the Prime Minister told Canadians that he 
received no remuneration for that work.  Insider trading reports 
showed that Fitzpatrick gave the Prime Minister a sweetheart 
stock deal worth at least $45,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the Prime Minister explain this contradiction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, every document is absolutely public.  Everything 
occurred during the time when I was not a member of Parliament. 
Every transaction is absolutely legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party likes to attack the personal integrity of 
people rather than deal with the issues of Parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Ross Fitzpatrick made a private stock deal with the 
Prime Minister.  He sold him shares at a huge discount, which the 
Prime Minister flipped a week later.  That stock flip gave the 
Prime Minister at least $45,000 in a single week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said he received no remuneration for his work 
at the company so what was the $45,000 for?  Was it a downpayment 
on a seat in the Senate? 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was out of politics and I never told my father that I 
would be Prime Minister so I had no commitment with destiny.  I 
did not know at that time that I would come back to the House of 
Commons as Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know why the leader of the Reform Party is preoccupied with 
this issue.  It is because Senator Fitzpatrick is an extremely 
able citizen of British Columbia.  For years he has worked in the 
public domain giving advice to a lot of people.  He has served 
the province very well, as the premier of B.C. said a few days 
ago. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government feigns outrage at our questions on this 
subject but it is the people of British Columbia who ought to be 
outraged.  A Senate appointment tainted with patronage.  A Senate 
appointment tainted with backroom deals.  An appointee who could 
not get elected dog catcher in British Columbia if he had to 
submit to a democratic vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister wants to clear the air, why does he not 
cancel this outrageous appointment now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very proud of Mr. Ross Fitzpatrick the senator, as 
I stated.  At a very early age he worked in Parliament as an 
assistant to a minister.  Since he has left that job he has 
remained committed to public service helping everybody who wanted 
to serve, whether it was a provincial or federal government. 
There were years when it was not easy being a Liberal in British 
Columbia, but because of his good work it is now very pleasant. 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are not accusing the Prime Minister of doing anything illegal 
with those things back then.  We are just asking questions now 
about the fact that just last week in the House of Commons the 
Prime Minister said he received no remuneration.  In fact he got 
$45,000 in one week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to ask is this:  What is the problem with the Prime 
Minister saying “Sure, here is a Senate seat for you” a few 
years later.  Was this $45,000 not a downpayment on a Senate 
seat, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, a few months ago the hon. member made an accusation 
against me about my riding and she had the company completely 
wrong. It was a company from Winnipeg and she did not know the 
difference between Winnipeg and Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still waiting for the hon. member's apology because she 
misled both the House and the nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we are taking our facts from the insider trading reports.  The

bought the shares for and how much he sold them for just one week 
later.

in a letter dated March 5, the president of the Association

department of trying to use the Semaine de la francophonie to serve 
its own ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wrote as follows: “The heritage department feels that it is 
legitimate to appropriate the week and to alter it to suit its own 
exaggerated need for visibility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Minister of Canadian Heritage have to say in 
response to the president of the ACELF's accusation that she is 
appropriating the Semaine nationale de la francophonie in order to 
raise the government's profile?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> We were not

</I></B></P><P align=left>The ACELF president, Mr. Bordeleau, speaks out against what he 
calls, and I will repeat his exact words, “the heritage 
department's exaggerated need for visibility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister realize that she is insulting francophones, 
offending them, just to satisfy her burning need for visibility? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if anyone is trying to make political hay at the expense 
of francophones, it is the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec minister of the day never supported francophones in 
getting the Jeux de la Francophonie for Canada.  He even wrote 
saying they ought not to come here, but he had a change of heart 
this week because it is the Semaine de la Francophonie. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are going 
to set the record straight for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter dated March 5, the president of the Association 
canadienne d'éducation de langue française, Louis-Gabriel 
Bordeleau, said, and I quote “Less than a month before the event, 
greatly disappointed and with reluctance, we had to let the private 
firm of Leroux Rhéal & Associés use our trademarks until March 31 
in exchange for a grant from the Department of Canadian 
Heritage”.

blackmail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:  </B>Soon to be the sixth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B> —that the contract amounts were exactly 
the same as last year and the year before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for recognition of francophones in Canada, I am proud that 
my colleague, the member for Moncton, is working with all 
francophone and francophile colleagues in the House to ensure that 
the visibility of francophones, here in the House and across 
Canada, is greater than in the past. 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to say to 
someone “I will give it to you only if you do this against your 
will” is blackmail and that is what the minister did with respect 
to the Association canadienne d'éducation de langue française. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member not to use the piece 
of paper as a prop.  I give the floor back to the hon. member.

because it pains us to see the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
resorting to blackmail.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

If ever anyone did a flip-flop, I would like to recall what the 
Hon. Sylvain Simard wrote, and I quote “As for the Jeux de la 
Francophonie, the uncertainty that hung over the Madagascar games, 
and that, in some respects, still hangs over them, calls into 
question the very model of the games”.

28 of the 25,000 businesses affected have received federal 
assistance.

the House will recall that the reason my colleague, the President

was because the Government of Quebec refused to take action and to 
co-operate.  They wanted to drag things out and use the issue for 
political ends, but we would not go along.

organized crime in an organized way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The MAI is stirring people up everywhere in the world. For

</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally international trade agreements bind national

</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend suggests that we should back out of negotiations,

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—CANADIAN FLAG 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK222">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the member for Kitchener Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We usually begin our addresses in this place by saying we are 
pleased to rise on the particular issue.  I wish I could say that 
about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing I want to do is surrender to the authorities if 
that is appropriate, to admit my guilt that I waved a flag in 
this place.  Members opposite referred to someone over here 
waving a full size Canadian flag.  Guilty.  The member for 
Scarborough East and I held it up.  We sang the national anthem. 
We were proud to do it, no question.  We were making a point to 
the separatists and to the reactions of the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis at the Olympics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy House leader for the Reform Party seems fit to chirp 
as she leaves her seat.  She knows and you know, Mr. Speaker, 
that members of the Reform Party are absolutely nothing but 
opportunists in this issue.  They are a disgrace to this place. 
They are a disgrace frankly to the Canadian flag for using it for 
their own political benefit.  Reform Party members should be 
ashamed of themselves for what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it for me— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  You never want to wave it again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  If the member opposite wants to take 
her seat and debate this in a normal fashion, I would be 
delighted to take her on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  I did that already this morning.  You 
were not here when I was speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order.  Hon. members 
may feel free to address other hon. members through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would make the point 
that if members of the official opposition really wanted to deal 
with this issue in a proper parliamentary form, they would 
participate with the House leaders in coming to a resolution. 
There is an option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government representatives and all other representatives of 
every party in this place came to an agreement proposing that the 
House Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs could be 
mandated to study possible uses of the flag on Parliament Hill 
and in the House based on the conventions in other parliaments, 
particularly in the Commonwealth countries.  I could support that 
if that was the motion put forward by the opposition.  It would 
make sense.  It would calm the issue down.  It would allow for 
some proper time to study how we might more appropriately use the 
Canadian flag in this place and in the precincts around the 
capital and Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it for me to quote from the media, but I want to read 
from an article that Andrew Coyne wrote.  It says there is 
nothing wrong with “a little flag waving so long as honest love 
of country is the motive”.  I think the Canadian people will in 
time recognize the motive of the Reform Party as being purely 
political in this matter.  It has nothing to do with freedom of 
speech.  No one's freedom of speech is restricted in this place 
as long as they do so within the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting thing that happened.  We broke the rules 
and I think everybody knows it.  Some 200 of us waved little 
flags in the air, my colleague and I held up the large flag, and 
we broke into a rendition of <I>O Canada</I>.  I was proud to do 
that and I would do it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I know it is against the rules in this place, it was 
important for once to make the point to the Bloc Quebecois, to 
the member for Rimouski—Mitis that we do not accept her remarks 
at the Olympics with regard to the display of the Canadian flag 
on behalf of Canadian athletes and Canadians everywhere.  In fact 
it was a proud thing to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was particularly proud to see the Olympic athletes smuggle in 
that huge flag.  And it is against the rules in the Olympics. 
It was the second time it has happened at the Olympics. It became 
the focal point of the televised section of the closing 
ceremonies of the Olympics.  It was a marvellous thing to see. 
If it bends the rules a little bit, so be it.  Those athletes, 
not all of them kids, had a Canadian heart beating in them and 
they wanted to share that with the world.  They wanted to tell 
the world that they had just competed for their country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a member of Parliament to make a comment like the separatist 
member has made is enough to make the hairs stand up on the back 
of one's neck. We wanted to send a message and did so with our 
demonstration. The message is that Canadians right across this 
land, including Canadians who live in Quebec and want to stay in 
Canada, are fed up with that brand of separatism as that member 
would try to sell to her constituents back in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents have called and said they were really angry with 
this.  They know we have called a vote to put the flag on every 
desk.  They think it is a difficult argument but wonder why we 
would not put a flag on our desks.  Maybe we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in legislatures and Parliament for several years and 
I have seen many, many instances where the rules were bent.  I 
have seen people filibuster by reading names and addresses out of 
telephone books.  Should we make that legal?  Is that a proper 
form of debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in the Ontario legislature I even presented Mike 
Harris with an American flag to make a point.  The point was that 
we could see the Americanization of the agenda that has since 
come out as the common sense revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Point over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The member says I should point there 
and he is right, but I have trouble pointing to the left when I 
talk about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that I did that for effect.  I knew that the 
Speaker would admonish me and say it was not proper parliamentary 
procedure.  I also knew I would not do it again because the point 
had been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also made the point to the separatists.  Let us not forget 
that what the Reform Party is doing by turning this into a debate 
over our cherished flag, by saying we have a bigger flag than 
they do or that we are prouder to be Canadians than they are, we 
are totally allowing the separatists to get off the hook.  They 
started this.  They are the ones who denigrated our flag with the 
comments by the member, on federal taxpayers' dollars, at the 
Olympic games with Canadian athletes fighting for their country. 
And we are letting them off the hook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I object to the cheap political antics of painting a car. 
Imagine. A member has put a private member's bill forward as a 
result of one of the Reform members actually throwing the 
Canadian flag on the floor of the House of Commons in anger.  The 
private member's bill states that it will be a criminal offence 
to desecrate the national flag of Canada. It should be a criminal 
offence.  If that bill existed, that member would be hauled out 
of here and charged with a criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Reform members to now get on their high horse and try to 
tell Canadians across the country that only they care about the 
flag, I reject that.  It makes me so damned angry.  Canadians 
right across the country are proud of our flag and proud to be 
Canadians and so is the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are just playing cheap politics which in fact is a 
method of denigrating the Canadian flag.  They should be ashamed 
of themselves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the member is letting it off the hook by 
opposing this motion.  The member is saying that we are to be 
patriotic yet he is castigating that party because it said there 
are too many flags at the Canadian Olympics.  The member is 
saying that is wrong.  There should be flags at the Canadian 
Olympics.  But what the hon. member is also saying is that there 
should not be in the House of Commons, the federal government of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still suggest that if there is a problem in this House it is 
not the matter of the Reform Party's bringing this motion forward, 
but rather the hon. member rejecting the idea that Canadians 
should be able to see their federal members with their federal 
flag on their desks.  What is wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a question earlier but time did not allow it so I was 
cut off. I put it to him.  The minister of heritage spent over 
$20 million of taxpayer money giving away flags and trying to get 
Canadians to be more patriotic.  Why, after spending all that 
taxpayer money, is he opposed to a small display of the Canadian 
flag here in this House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that 
the Reform Party opposes the distribution of flags by this 
government which was an attempt to share the patriotic view of 
the House of Commons.  It was done on behalf of all members 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not say I am opposed to the flag being displayed. I am not 
opposed.  It currently is displayed and I can see two of them as 
I speak.  If the Reform Party were serious it could have adopted 
the agreement made by most members in this House over the 
weekend.  The members said the issue should be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs and the 
committee be mandated to study the possible use of the flag on 
Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want it done, we can send it in the proper 
procedural way to a committee.  Let the committee bring a report 
and we can depoliticize this issue.  To play games with the 
Canadian flag is to do an injustice to that proud flag that I 
will stand behind in my constituency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what it says on this little label: “As a loyal Canadian, 
please wave this flag the first time you see the Bloc member 
stand up to speak in question period”.  These flags were put out 
by the member for Oshawa.  The credibility of this government is 
such that I am mad, and damn mad.  My relatives died for a flag. 
This type of credibility in this House is not deserved and I want 
to know what this member would do when a gun was pointed at him, 
not just a little stick? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand the passion 
the member feels because I too feel passionate about this issue. 
He is right.  It was a Liberal backbench member who put these 
flags in everybody's desk and the message was to send a message 
to the member from the Bloc who was making the comments in Japan, 
and we sent that message with pride. I stood here and waved a 
full size flag in this House with pride and sang the anthem with 
pride. My relatives fought for this country too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not have a corner on being self-righteous about this 
country or about this flag and I resent the comments by that 
member attacking my integrity and the integrity of this 
government.  We should send this to a committee.  We should 
calmly discuss it and if the committee can come up with a way to 
properly and in a larger way display our wonderful flag in this 
House, then that is what we should do.  It would be supported by 
all members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of points that I would like to make at the 
outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the official opposition have been speaking to the 
effect that only small desk flags would be the result of the 
passing of the motion before us.  However, the motion clearly 
states that the flag would be no larger than that of a standard 
recognized flag.  This indicates that a flag of any size would be 
permitted to be displayed on desks.  I would ask why members 
opposite are being so selective as to the flags they are 
referring to in the debate we are having today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is that members of the official opposition have 
been stressing the importance of flags being permissible in the 
House of Commons.  I remind these members that it is difficult to 
sit here in the House today and not see the two Canadian flags 
proudly displayed on either side of the Speaker's chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two points aside, I have thought about this issue a lot 
over the past week and a half, as I know many of my colleagues 
have.  I was in the House the day the flags were spontaneously 
waved and our national anthem was sung.  I was in the House to 
see a member of the official opposition throw a Canadian flag on 
the floor of this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the emotion of members of this House and of 
Canadians upon learning what the hon. member of the Bloc said 
about the display of our national flag in the Olympic village. 
Her comments were, at least to say, unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the actions in this House upon her return have also 
done damage.  They have further politicized our national emblem. 
It has been used as a mere prop of nationalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion does not suggest that flags be mandatory.  My 
question to members opposite is if I do not have a flag on my 
desk and my seatmate has a flag on his desk, does the logical 
extension then say that he is more nationalistic, a prouder 
federalist than I am?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nationalism and patriotism run deep.  They are not limited 
merely to the display of our national flag.  They are 
demonstrated in numerous ways, too many to count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind our colleagues that just over two months ago 
regions of Ontario and Quebec, just across the provincial border, 
close to the Hill where we now are, were stricken by an ice 
storm?  Need I remind members of this House how Canadians of all 
political stripes, from all regions, from all backgrounds and 
ethical beliefs banded together in a massive demonstration of 
nationalism of the strongest kind, nationalism of action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are elected representatives to the House of Commons.  We are 
elected to represent the people of our constituencies.  We are 
elected to use our best judgment when dealing with sensitive 
issues based on our firsthand knowledge.  We are elected and sent 
to this House to debate government policies and to initiate 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not deny members of the official opposition the right to 
introduce any motion of their choice on their allotted day.  I 
do, however, regret that they have decided to further debate the 
issue which was ruled on yesterday in this House by our Speaker; 
an issue which most parties represented in this House recommended 
be directed to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs for further study; a study based on precedent and the 
conventions of this and other parliaments, particularly those of 
the Commonwealth countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that members of the Reform Party do not support this 
recommendation, which is based on respect for the institution and 
the procedures of our democracy, further demonstrates that their 
motion is not about patriotism but merely about politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party are using the flag as a lightening 
rod to attract the attention of the media, overshadowing larger 
issues, issues which need to be discussed in the House, issues of 
job creation, health care, child care and industry development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not allow politics to be ruled by sound bytes used by the 
media, short clips heard on television and printed in newspapers. 
Yes, these things do provide information, but it is only a 
snapshot, not the whole picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues we deal with in the House are much larger and much 
more substantive than the way this whole issue has been 
portrayed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House to return to the issues of importance to all 
Canadians.  I ask Canadians to see this motion as one that will 
not move the envelope of Canadian unity toward a lasting 
stability for the country.  Canada's future lies in a strong 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that the orders of precedence be respected and that we 
return to work on the important substantive issues facing the 
country which will make longlasting differences and help shape 
the future for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member's 
speech, but my recollection of the event that led to this 
parliamentary crisis is not quite the same as hers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She spoke of a spontaneous demonstration.  What I remember is 
that, when my colleague, the member for Rimouski—Mitis, rose to 
ask a very relevant question, flags began waving everywhere in the 
House, and it did not look spontaneous.  It looked very well 
organized, by both the Liberals and the Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result today is that all Quebeckers have understood that 
this demonstration that fired up nationalist sentiment in English 
Canada apparently did nothing to improve relations between Quebec 
and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went back to my riding.  What I found most distressing was 
that people were saying “What is it with that Parliament?  You are 
wasting your time on this sort of thing.  Is Parliament some kind 
of farce?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that sense, today's Reform Party motion only makes matters 
more farcical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have been more important today to address the 
issues of employment insurance, poverty, and the multilateral 
agreement on investment, all daily concerns of Quebeckers and 
Canadians? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would concur with the 
last comments of the member opposite that there are more 
substantive issues and there is a more productive way we could 
use this time.  However, I would also like to underline that the 
comments, although made outside this Chamber by a member of the 
Bloc, were indeed unfortunate and were responded to with almost 
unanimity from members of other parties in the House.  It was 
very difficult to deal with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
saddens me somewhat to even address this issue because I feel it 
should not even be discussed today.  We must look realistically 
at how the issue commenced in the House.  I emphasize in the 
House because members are free to do what they want outside.  If 
people have concerns, they should be dealt with outside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the flags were waved in the House as a prop and the 
national anthem was sung to silence a member who had the right to 
speak, that was wrong.  It is wrong now to be debating this issue 
as if it were one about flags.  It is not an issue about flags. 
It is an issue about people wanting to get their way, to prove 
what they did was right and to justify what they did.  I hear 
people making all kinds of excuses as to why they did it.  It was 
wrong then and it is wrong now.  It is not an issue of flags and 
we should not misinterpret it as being an issue of flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very sad because the Canadian public is being taken in by 
this whole issue.  We as parliamentarians who are supposed to be 
responsible people elected to serve our constituents are here 
wasting our time, spending taxpayer money debating an issue that 
ought not to be debated, should never have begun in the first 
place. The people who started it should be big enough to stand up 
and agree they were wrong and let it drop at that. Not every 
member of the House stood and sung O Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree.  The Chair ruled 
on the events of that day.  We are more than willing to accept 
that ruling and move forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
try to address my concerns to the Chair and keep them very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a greater question here and I would like to ask the 
former speaker what she thinks of this.  If we display a Canadian 
flag on our desk, what does that tell the people who do not 
display the Canadian flag?  It does use it as some type of a 
weapon or some type of coercion to convince everyone else that 
they too should have one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I fully support this 
being referred to a standing committee and being dealt with 
through the proper channels and procedures. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this debate has had an interesting fate in the way it has 
progressed over the last two weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of issues I want to deal with.  I think one 
of the most important things is that all of the people who are 
listening to this understand why we are doing this, putting an 
end to this.  This issue admittedly arose from members of the 
government side standing to wave a flag, as well as members of 
this party, and rightfully so.  They should have.  I stood up 
proudly and waved the flag in response to comments made by a 
member of the Bloc.  We said enough is enough, we have to get on 
with the important governing issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members repeatedly have said send it to a committee. Sending 
that to a committee would be a colossal waste of time.  It is 
important but it is not rocket science.  We are talking about a 
very simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the only way we can put this thing to an end once and 
for all and make every single member in this Chamber stand up and 
be counted.  Will you allow a flag on your desk or will you not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debated this supply day motion as to whether or not to 
proceed with it, that was the number one issue.  Let us get this 
thing over with, make people stand up and be counted and move 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fisheries and oceans committee I am involved with meets two 
or three times a week and we do a lot of good work.  By sending 
something like this to committee to be buried in months and 
months of meetings is insane.  It is absolutely ridiculous it has 
arrived at this point where we have used a supply day motion 
because there are lots of important issues. We were forced into 
this.  We were pushed and we had to respond.  This is one way to 
put an end to this and that is what this is all about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be argued that we are sitting here using up valuable time 
but we are not going to have this issue go on until May or June 
and then into next fall because that is crazy.  That is what you 
guys keep telling us to do, send it to a committee and let us 
talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we did get a ruling from the Speaker yesterday and he did 
say it was clearly out of order.  I accept that.  No question. 
What happened?  There were about 200 members of Parliament 
responding to comments made outside the House when a member was 
visiting a foreign country representing Canada with taxpayers' 
dollars.  They were infuriated.  They were outraged and they 
responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were comments by the Speaker yesterday that this should 
not be repeated.  With the highest respect for the Speaker 
himself and the authority of that chair, I would suggest that if 
these kinds of comments are made outside the House again exactly 
the same thing would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw members of the government proudly wave a three foot by 
six foot flag during the budget debate only weeks ago when this 
issue came up.  I supported them.  I stood on my feet and sang 
<I>O Canada</I>, and I was proud to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate has been elevated and it has progressed but thank 
goodness the Reform Party is bringing it to an end. 
It will not go to a committee.  It will not go off to further 
meetings.  They will not be talking about this in June.  We will 
not be hearing grumblings about it.  It is over today, once and 
for all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member will have to stand in this House and be counted. 
There will be no ducking behind some orders of the government. 
They have an opportunity to stand and be counted on whether they 
will allow members to have a flag on their desks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are advocating that we should have this place give each 
person their right.  They do not have to if they do not want to. 
I heard a member opposite just moments before referring to the 
flag as a weapon. For goodness sakes, that is the craziest thing 
I have heard.  It is the elevation that this debate has come to. 
They talk about respect for institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe that a majority of these members, with the 
exception of one party, believe in this country and are 
patriotic.  Some members just want to demonstrate that.  However, 
I do not want to lose sight of why we are here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important question:  Can some members put a flag 
on their desks?  I admit that we did not do this in 1993 and we 
did not do it last September.  This whole thing evolved out of 
the outcome of actions by a member of this House on a taxpayers' 
junket to another country and the House responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has elevated to this and it is time that it has to stop.  It 
has to be over and done.  This is the one way that it can be 
done.  The Reform Party had to use its supply day motion to put 
an end to this nonsense, to make sure they stand up and are 
counted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in a state of awe that those members are sitting over there 
saying “Send it to a committee.  Let them talk about it.  Let us 
come back in June.  Let us come back next fall.  Let us carry 
this thing on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is such an elementary question.  It is so painfully simple 
that we have to make sure they stand up in this House, that they 
are heard and that we move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard people suggest that the Reform Party is using this 
as a lightning rod and as an opportunity.  I will tell this House 
and every single Canadian out there watching in all sincerity 
that we do believe in this country.  We do believe in the flag. 
I proudly stand here on Wednesdays and sing the national anthem. 
I do.  If I did not, I would not be standing here right now 
making this speech.  I would have a lot better things to be 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue to fight for this country and fight for my kids 
so that they have a good place.  I mean that sincerely.  I really 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To carry on with this nonsense is just absolutely crazy.  The 
only way that we could force an end to this matter is to use our 
supply day.  That is exactly what we have done.  Every member 
over there will have to stand and be counted. They will have to 
say what side they are on.  Let us talk about what this is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members can say that it is a weapon.  I heard one of the 
top strategists for the Progressive Conservative Party equating 
this to a Reform member having this tattooed on their body and 
displaying it in the House and whether that would be acceptable. 
There is all this craziness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where all the other parties are taking this debate.  It 
is simple.  Can we take a little desk top flag and put it on our 
desk when we want to talk about a very important issue?  Maybe we 
will want to leave it there all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the House of Canada.  This is the Parliament of Canada. 
There is only one flag for Canada.  There is only one national 
anthem for Canada.  I will stand up in this House and say that 
the Quebec flag does not belong in here any more than the 
Newfoundland flag or the British Columbia flag or any other flag 
from this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only flag that belongs in this House is the maple leaf.  I 
am sure I would have a lot of people who would agree with me.  I 
stand in this House as a proud Canadian.  Those flags belong 
beside the Speaker and no other flag on this desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member of Parliament sitting in this House should be 
standing up and fighting for the good of all Canadians.  That is 
what we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are hearing comments that we are wasting time.  The 
reality is respect.  We are spending three or four hours debating 
this in this House.

today.  People have to stand up and make sure they are heard, 
which is what we are here for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to ask anyone to ask me any question on this issue.

want to get into some silly debate about a whole bunch of issues 
that we are not talking about today.

</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what foolishness this motion is.  It has crowded the 
talk show lines in my riding and people believe that what this is 
all about is that parliamentarians cannot stand and speak in this 
House holding the Canadian flag as a symbol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was elected in 1993, I put a Canadian flag pin on my 
lapel.  In all that time, Mr. Speaker, you have never ruled me 
out of order because I have stood in this House with the Canadian 
flag pinned on my jacket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, from time to time I have risen to speak in this House 
wearing a tie that had Canadian flags on it and you have never, 
Mr. Speaker, ruled that out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are plenty of opportunities to stand and speak in this 
House wearing a Canadian flag as a symbol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with having a Canadian flag at the desk?  Well, we 
saw it with the Reform member for Medicine Hat.  He got angry and 
took the flag, threw it on the floor and desecrated it.  On this 
side we tried to figure out how to retrieve the flag from the 
floor of the House of Commons before it was stepped on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the member opposite that a flag in the hands of the 
Reform Party or on a desk may be desecrated.  It is safer next to 
you, Mr. Speaker.  Why can he not have on his jacket, as I do, or 
even on his tie a Canadian flag?  Why is that not sufficient for 
him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am going to bring this 
back.  It is very simple.  We even heard members of the Bloc 
talking about the flag as being vulgar.  Imagine that.  People 
responded to that, including the people in the member's party. 
The government party stood up and responded like the people did 
here, appropriately.  I stand on those words.  I stood proudly 
and waved that flag and stood proudly and sang <I>O Canada</I>. 
That is what this is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate has elevated from that.  We can all argue about this 
but that is the reality.  That is what has happened and what has 
gone on for two weeks and it has to end.  People out there have 
to know where we stand.  We are going to make people stand up and 
be counted, that is what this is all about.  We want to bring a 
closure to this issue once and for all today so we can address 
the other important issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to a good deal of the debate today and the word that 
keeps coming back is the word “flagrant” which consists of two 
words “flag” and “rant”, which is what we mostly have today 
from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the member for Blackstrap bellowing away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing here today is a flagrant waste of time.  I 
will be very proudly voting against this motion in a couple of 
hours time, but I will take no back seat to any of the members of 
the Reform Party in terms of their patriotic endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am probably the only person in this House who had the 
privilege of being outside this building on February 15, 1965 
when the Canadian flag was raised for the very first time on top 
of the Peace Tower.  I remember it very well.  I was a student at 
the university here and came down to a relatively small 
gathering.  Prime Minister Pearson came out for the event.  Had 
the Reform Party members been around in 1965 they probably would 
have voted against this new flag because of the red ensign.  They 
would have wrapped themselves in the previous flag because they 
are very good at promising Canadians a better yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the previous speaker.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the vast research the Reformers have done, could they tell us 
what other countries allow flags to be displayed on members' 
desks in their parliaments?  If they want to bring an end to this 
debate today, why are they running ads on radio stations in 
Saskatchewan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member asked me what goes 
on in other parliaments.  I have been to many countries and have 
been to their parliaments.  I have yet to hear people refer to 
their flags as vulgar.  I have yet to hear their elected 
officials go off to other countries and say that there are too 
many of their own country's flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in this House responded and appropriately so by 
saying that was not acceptable.  The ministers, the government 
and the Reform Party stood and said that we were not going to 
allow that.  This has elevated from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we put an end to this?  How can we stop it?  How can we 
get on to the governing of the country?  We said we would force 
them to stand and be counted, and that is what we have done.

one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of the House have turned what I believe to be a 
positive initiative on behalf of the official opposition into an 
us against them debate that would divide us rather than bring us 
together as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You should be ashamed of yourself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  I am ashamed right now to listen to 
these heckles.  Here we are talking about pride in Canada and the 
flag, and here we have people yelling at us from the other side. 
As a relatively new Canadian who has adopted this country and 
takes pride in its flag and what it stands for, I do not know why 
in a democracy I cannot rise in an institution like this one to 
address those things and say how proud I am to be a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from the other parties today that Reform does not 
respect rules.  I beg to differ.  We were waiting for the Speaker 
to rule on the issue.  He took some time to rule.  If we look 
around today we see that members on the Reform side have 
respected his decision.  We took the next step, which was to hear 
from other Canadians in the House on how they feel about the 
flag, if they feel it is a positive initiative to display it on 
their desks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If many members opposite feel it is not a positive initiative 
then they can say so.  That is what the debate is all about.  We 
on the Reform side continuously argue that if members of the 
House representing people from across they country who are proud 
to be Canadians want to display that flag on their desks on 
behalf of the people who elected them, why not allow them to do 
so.  It is a positive initiative.  I have yet to hear some 
constructive debate from the other side as to why it is negative, 
instead of attacking this side for being proud about our symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from members of different parties that this is a 
negative initiative.  This is what the House of Commons is all 
about.  It is a place in which to freely debate ideas that may be 
of contention, that may mean something to some and not to others. 
Bringing this issue to the floor and letting the members decide 
is not negative.  Members opposite and members from all parties 
have the right to vote yes or no in the end to the motion, 
whether they like it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resent the fact that people have been so negative overall in 
the debate when the initiative in the official opposition motion 
is very positive.  I wish we would hear less rhetoric and more 
about why a flag on a desk is so negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To some extent I was happy for a little while to hear members 
from all sides talking about what Canada means to them and what 
the flag means to them.  It was somewhat enlightening to hear 
some of the stories of various members of Parliament and their 
families and what exactly the flag means to them.  To have this 
kind of debate once in a while is healthy for parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I briefly touched on what that means to me.  I am a recent 
Canadian.  I have been here for 26 years.  I came here as a 
little child.  I adopted the flag and the country.  It is mine 
and it is my home.  For me it means freedom.  It means 
opportunity.  It means democracy.  Those are things that did not 
exist in the country my family had to flee from as refugees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be able to take a moment to reflect on those things in the 
House is the perfect place to do it.  I am very proud that we 
have the opportunity to do so.  I resent the fact that we are 
hearing such negative comments from all other sides of the House 
on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard members of the New Democratic Party yelling out that no 
other parliament or legislature in the world may necessarily have 
flags on their desks.  This is an opportunity for us as 
Canadians, as we have been in the past, to be leaders and maybe 
start something positive, start something to be proud of.  It is 
not negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a chance for us to stand and actually start something new. 
If we took the time to reflect on that for a moment and reflect 
on how it could bring us together, maybe we would have more 
support in the House than what we see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the issues I would have liked to address. Many 
of us have misinterpreted what the motion is supposed to be about 
and how positive it is. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to address the people of Quebec, people who love 
Canada and the Canadian flag. Do not be mistaken: while Quebeckers love 
their province, they also love their country. If the members opposite 
refuse to give them a way of expressing their patriotism in this House, 
I will be proud to take on that responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flag is an emblem, a deeply important symbol. Displaying the 
Canadian flag shows commitment to Canada, but this commitment to Canada 
is not one to the geographical boundaries of our country. 
To display a flag shows commitment to the values honoured within those 
boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My family and I came to Canada looking for a place to rebuild our 
lives. We were not looking for handouts, but opportunities, which we 
found. Canada gave us the opportunity to go to school and to build 
prosperous businesses. So, when we see Canadian flags, we are reminded 
that Canada gave us a second chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now a part of a country which gave me the opportunity to 
represent the electoral district of Edmonton—Strathcona in the House of 
Commons. I came from a country where there was no respect for democracy 
to a country where, at age 26, I was allowed to speak as an equal in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community of Edmonton—Strathcona judged me on the basis of my 
abilities and allowed me to come and represent it here because it liked 
what I had to say. 
So, when I look at the Canadian flag, I also see freedom. When I look at 
the Canadian flag, I am reminded that, in Canada, democracy is the 
principle of equality which is part of our laws and our government 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the people of Quebec see what I see when they look 
at the Canadian flag: freedom, opportunity, democracy and equality. I am 
convinced that, given the chance to speak with one voice in this House 
today, the people of Quebec would ask their representatives to make the 
best decision and support our motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the last note, I would like to focus specifically on the fact 
that we have gone through a really strange week in the House.  We 
have had funny behaviour on both sides.  It is an emotional issue 
and it goes without saying that people react the way they do when 
issues of symbolism and patriotism are discussed in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members to take a moment to see the principle 
behind the motion and to support it because they are proud of 
their country.  If all hon. members take a second to take a step 
back, they will see that the motion in its principle is something 
positive for all of us.  It allows freedom of expression for 
individual members in the House who are proud to be here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member who spoke before me 
say that a spirit of democracy and respect was needed. I invite him to 
bring that up with the Reform member who spoke before him. That member 
accused a member of the Bloc Quebecois of having called the Canadian 
flag vulgar. I challenge him to find a single instance of a Bloc member 
having called the Canadian flag vulgar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis said was that she found 
there were too many Canadian flags in Nagano. It was an assessment, and 
as far as I know we are entitled to our personal opinions on the 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point something else out. He said we have been elected 
here for the good of Canadians. 
For those who elected me as their member of Parliament, what would be 
good for the whole of Canada would be to create two sovereign countries 
that would enter into a partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the message I have for the House on behalf of my 
constituents. In 1993, more than 50 members of the Bloc Quebecois were 
elected. Today, there are 44 of them. This is still a majority of 
members from Quebec who, as sovereignists, have been elected to pass on 
the message that the solution in Canada, in fact, is to create two 
sovereign countries having economic ties with each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I agree with him that the Liberals also had a hand 
in the initiative that led to this crisis, and that they are now 
adopting a position I find unacceptable. I agree with him on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to answer my question. For Quebeckers 
and Canadians to become proud of living in this country, instead of 
putting a flag on the desk and waving it about whenever the spirit moves 
them, would it not be preferable for the members of this House to have 
democratic debates on the issues of real concern to Quebeckers and 
Canadians, including the national issue? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member refers to 
whether or not it is good to debate this type of motion in the 
House, given the fact that his mandate is to create two sovereign 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking today about whether a member of Parliament, who 
is proud to be a Canadian member of Parliament and wants to 
display a flag on his desk in the House, should have the right to 
do so. That is the fundamental basis of the motion.  That is what 
we are debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that most electors in his riding elected 
him and his party to create a vision of two sovereign nations. 
They are free to work to that end.  However, as it stands right 
now, we are still a united country.  While we are in the House we 
should have respect for the symbols that represent the country. 
It is not negative to have the flag displayed on anyone's desk in 
the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, like the member opposite, I too come from an immigrant 
background.  My father came here over 70 years ago.  Before I 
learned my first nursery rhyme, I learned how lucky I was to be a 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take no back seat to anybody when it comes to pride in this 
country.  That is precisely why nearly two weeks ago I stood in 
the House and did something that I knew was absolutely out of 
order.  I waved a flag.  I sang my national anthem.  I was quite 
content then to sit down and let the member for Rimouski—Mitis 
have her say in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had to respond to an insult to something that means more to me 
than a symbol of a country.  For me it is a symbol of my father's 
life which was dedicated to this country.  That is precisely why 
I will not vote for the motion tonight.  I will not have the flag 
sitting here to be knocked over, to be fiddled with, to fall on 
the floor, to be trampled on, to be treated with the kind of 
disrespect I saw from some of the members in the House last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I value the flag too much to use it as a symbol to point to 
separatists members of the House and say “in your face”.  That 
is not what it is for.  It is to cherish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have heard from members 
opposite that people had disrespect for the flag in the House. 
I would like to put that issue to rest.  The hon. member for 
Medicine Hat had lunch with the snack pack prior to that event. 
His hands were greasy because he had a greasy meal and I believe 
he dropped the flag.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I could just have a 
second— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I should point out that on questions and 
comments we try to be fair.  If members have been in the House 
during the course of the debate, for most of the day, we would 
normally recognize those members before others who have just come 
in.  Sometimes it seems a little arbitrary, but it really is not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party, by putting 
this motion before us, is trying to create the impression that it 
is leading the country in patriotism.  The motion purports to 
start a practice of allowing the displaying of the Canadian flag 
on members' desks in the House as an act of patriotism.  That is 
what it would like the Canadian public to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we take the motion of the Reform Party with any modicum 
of seriousness and sincerity when barely two weeks ago it 
condoned utter disrespect for our national emblem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same Reform Party which allowed one of its members, 
the member for Medicine Hat, to desecrate the Canadian flag on 
the floor of this Chamber, duly documented in the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, when Canadians realize all of this, the motion before us 
quickly loses its moral edge, particularly when it is realized by 
all that the Reform Party did not introduce the motion before the 
Speaker's ruling but one day after that ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recall that the Reform Party has been widely reported in the 
media as having threatened the Speaker with a vote of 
non-confidence if he ruled against the Reform's pleading.  This 
motion is a classic example of the Reform Party's sense of 
procedural justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I would like to display the Canadian flag on my desk. I 
know I would treat it with the utmost respect and dignity 
befitting our national emblem, the embodiment of Canadian dreams, 
a sentiment aptly articulated by John Matheson in his book 
<I>Canada's Flag: A Search for a Country</I>: “The traditions of 
our people, their accomplishments, and their hopes for the future 
are summed up in the symbolic meaning of our flag”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How then can the House show support for this motion when its 
authors belong to the same party which has failed to discipline 
one of its own members who showed a complete lack of decency in 
handling the Canadian flag on his desk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind all colleagues and all Canadians that the said 
member of the Reform Party, a senior member of that party, 
instead of apologizing for his cowardly act, had the arrogance to 
tell the media “it was no big deal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party ought to heed the words of Jennifer Robinson, 
that our flag is not a prop for the Reform Party's stunts, which 
appear in a column in today's issue of the Montreal 
<I>Gazette</I>: “Reformers may love their country, but they do no 
honour to the flag by using it as a prop for their political 
stunts.  There is no honour in singing the national anthem if it 
is only to drown out political adversaries, no patriotism in 
waving a flag if it is only to show contempt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A distinguished member of the House, the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke, correctly said on the weekend: “A flag is meant to 
be cherished and is to be a symbol that unites people, not 
something to be bandied around for the purpose of trying to make 
a political point”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party said: “We think there is a 
second principle, equally important, the freedom of expression”, 
in hinting his disagreement with the ruling by the Speaker, who 
based his decision on the principle of decorum and order in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the leader of the Reform Party that freedom of 
expression, like all freedoms, is not absolute. As the old saying 
goes, my right to swing my fists ends where your face begins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the wisdom of the Speaker's ruling yesterday.  He 
said: “Without order there is no freedom of speech and, 
fundamentally, that is what this place is really about”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> in today's issue timely reminded 
Canadians about the Reform Party: “Above all, they declared 
their determination to restore seriousness and decorum to 
Parliament and to put an end to the raucous disorder that 
infected question period.  So what has happened to turn the 
Reformers into the bunch of merry mischief makers that they are 
today?”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Truly it is an appropriate question begging for an urgent answer 
from the Reform leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with today's issue of the Toronto <I>Star</I>: “The two 
and a half week controversy that led to yesterday's ruling was 
damaging and unnecessary.  It cheapened Canadian patriotism, hurt 
national unity and put the Speaker in an impossible position”. 
It went on to say it is a shame that the Canadian flag was used 
to disrupt the proceedings of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Toronto <I>Star</I> posed a challenge to the Speaker: “The 
Speaker should set himself the higher task of ensuring that the 
Canadian flag is used to symbolize tolerance and pride in the 
House of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind all members and respectfully inform all Canadians 
that we already have in full view two full size Canadian flags on 
each side of the Speaker's chair.  Moreover, we sing O 
Canada every Wednesday before question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I could even force myself to understand the Reform 
Party's frustration or political argument with the Speaker.  But 
the utmost of my understanding cannot condone any immature 
display of temper, to say the least, or any unconscionable 
deliberate insult to our flag, an act unbefitting any citizen, 
let alone a member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would like Canadians to believe that it is 
serious and sincere with this motion to display the Canadian flag 
on our desks as a manifestation of patriotism.  Anyone can see 
through the Reform Party's motion a veneer of hypocrisy.  A 
disguise is a disguise is a disguise.  A disguise of outrage 
cannot hide a vacuum of sincerity in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Speaker of the House issued his ruling, pointing 
out that such a display of the Canadian flag on members' desks is 
not sanctioned under the present rules of the House. It should be 
said that the Speaker's ruling is not without precedent.  In 1964 
the then Speaker of the House in a precedent setting ruling 
prohibited flags at MPs' desks to be used as props. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of Reform's motion reads “that the said flag remain 
stationary for the purposes of decorum”.  Yes, by this motion 
the Reform Party pretends to be the defender of decorum in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform motion purports to do one thing while its behaviour 
in the House clearly showed manifest disrespect for the flag and 
for decorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hugh Windsor of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> in yesterday's 
issue rightly observed in his column “The Power Game” that the 
Reform Party has, to some extent, effectively used a staged photo 
opportunity as a tactic to draw media attention but that in the 
case of the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis, alluding to the flag 
waving fuss which should have been another one day wonder, it 
carried the game too far by totally disrupting proceedings, 
denying the MP her right to speak and turning the Commons into a 
minstrel show by jumping up and singing O Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's issue editorialist John Dafoe of the Winnipeg <I>Free 
Press</I> writes: “Obviously inspired by the success of that 
photo opportunity, they moved on to their newest caper, fun with 
flags.  They turned the Canadian flag into a prop for yet another 
of their sight-gags”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why even before the Speaker's ruling I regretted the 
disruption to the proceedings of the House the incident caused. I 
imagined before the Speaker's ruling what would happen to the 
business of the House were we to allow ourselves to be drawn to 
such actions so often.  That is why, in all humility, I see the 
wisdom behind the ruling of the Speaker who emphasized the need 
for civility in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A wise man once said he who says he has learned everything, for 
him that is the beginning of educational death.  There is a place 
for a dose of humility in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party did not hide its threats, its displeasure of 
the Speaker on the flag issue.  Why did the Reform, in the 
interest of a greater goal, to allow the business of the House to 
proceed, decline to give its hands of peace, setting aside 
partisan politics?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Without decorum and order, the House cannot be expected to 
conduct its business, government proceeding with its legislation 
and the opposition holding the government accountable.  What a 
pity that we are using this time not to debate the budget, 
education and health care but this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Displaying flags on the desks of the members could invite 
further indignity to the flag as exhibited by the Reform Party. I 
intended to propose an amendment, but I will decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his book <I>The Story of Canada's Flag</I> published in 1965, 
George F.G. Stanley, a leading Canadian historian, captured the 
historic and emotional significance of the Canadian flag when he 
wrote: “A flag speaks for the people of a nation or community. 
It inspires self-sacrifice, loyalty and devotion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is just that, a motion, an empty statement devoid of 
sincerity, good will and respect, a parody of patriotism and a 
travesty of civility and decorum in Parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
incident occurred, two weeks ago, I rose and said I was a proud 
Canadian. I said I was a proud Canadian from New Brunswick with a flag 
in both his Ottawa and New Brunswick offices, but that I was not proud 
of what the Reform Party and the Liberal Party had done, particularly 
when a Reform member threw the Canadian flag on the floor. I said all of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud because the flag is close to my heart. It does not have 
to be displayed on my desk. I am truly proud of that. And the flag will 
not be thrown on the floor because I am proud of it. 
But I cannot be proud of the fact that, today, Parliament is spending 
over $1 million of Canadians' money to hear about the flag, while some 
children in our country go hungry because their parents are on welfare, 
and while 730,000 people will be forced to rely on social assistance 
because of the changes made to the employment insurance program. This is 
what we should be debating here today. We should be debating the budget, 
because that was the issue before the House on the day the incident 
occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member opposite. Reformers claimed that 
the member from Quebec was still able to put her question that day. 
However, since oral question period lasts 45 minutes and since each 
member only has 35 seconds to put his or her question, is it not true 
that, because the proceedings were interrupted that day, some parties 
were prevented from asking a fourth question, as is the custom? There 
was an interruption which may not have had an impact on the hon. member 
from Quebec, but which had one on the New Democratic Party. 
We were entitled to a fourth question, but could not put it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with 
the member that we should be spending this time debating the 
issues that matter most to Canadians, the issues of the budget, 
health care, education, research, job creation and all those many 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also concur with the member that we ought to discipline 
ourselves.  We cannot tolerate any behaviour that will insult our 
colleagues.  However, when the record says so, we must state the 
record.  For that, we have a duty to perform. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a number of 
people today have said that we should be debating important 
things, and I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think this is best summed up in what a writer of a 
fax sent to me.  He said that we can debate the budget all day 
but that the Liberals, with their majority, will do whatever they 
want anyway.  He said that the debt will not go down any faster 
because of our debating this all day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he suggested was that if we lose the most fundamental of 
freedoms, the freedom of expression, then really it does not 
matter anyway.  This is really a matter of freedom of expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a question.  I presume he also 
stood and waved the flag and joined in the singing of our 
national anthem as a way of saying to the Bloc that we love our 
country. I agree, it was a demonstration that obviously has been 
ruled out of order and which we are not proposing.  In fact,  we 
are proposing the opposite in this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on I was asked by the same separatist party to remove my 
flag because I had not had the sense to put it away.  I left it 
sitting here.  I stood on principle and said that I do not want 
to comply because of a party that wants to tear the country apart 
asking me, a loyal Canadian, to put away the flag of this 
country. 
That is why I refused.  That is what this motion is about, to say 
that if a member has a small flag he cannot be required by 
someone else to take it away, thereby taking away his freedom of 
speech.

secretary has 60 seconds, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my 
debate, no freedom is absolute.  There has to be a limitation. I 
must admit that I too stood and waved the flag.  I too sang <I>O 
Canada</I> as a spontaneous show of love for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask myself what would happen to House proceedings if we would 
do it every 10 minutes during question period.  That is why I 
deferred to the wisdom of the ruling of the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of the flag, I discussed it in my debate.  It 
being so reachable, it can be played with, it can be used as a 
prop during the passion of debate.   We have the two big flags on 
both sides of the Speaker's chair.  That more strongly signifies 
the commitment to patriotism we have for this country. If I may 
say the Bloc's commitment— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for Simcoe—Grey. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before I speak to this motion I might convey my feelings as a 
Canadian, as a first time elected member.  The day I walked into 
this House, the day we started to sing the national anthem, I 
cannot put into words the sense of pride I felt as a young 
Canadian, as a third generation Canadian, as a representative of 
Simcoe—Grey.  It hurts me to see the Reform Party twist that 
feeling.  It has damaged the pride of this House.  I have great 
concern over the Reform Party's approach to this thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does it stop?  Today, a small flag on the desk?  Tomorrow 
should the curtains behind us be Canadian flags?  The next day 
should the windows in front of us be Canadian flags?  We should 
make no mistake why the Reform Party is doing this.  It is simple 
grandstanding.  Nothing more than that.  It should be absolutely 
ashamed of itself for what it has done.  It is showing absolutely 
no respect for this House.  It is showing no respect for the 
Canadian flag.  Most important, it is showing no respect for the 
Canadian people.  For that I say shame, Reform.  You have turned 
yourself into a mockery.  You are looked at both in Canada and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would ask members 
to address each other through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  My apologies, Mr. Speaker.  As you can 
see, I am somewhat passionate on this issue because of the 
absolute disgust that I have for the way this thing has gone on 
for the last two weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some comments made here today with respect to 
the members on the Reform side suggesting that they are being 
respectful, that they are following due process, that they are 
simply trying to get these Canadian flags on their desks.  They 
feel that it is a good use of time discussing this for two weeks, 
effectively shutting down government for two weeks when we should 
be discussing things like health, we should be discussing things 
likes education, we should be doing things like true 
parliamentarians and not simply grandstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to quote a couple of statements that were made by my 
Reform colleagues just to refresh their memories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 15 the member for Edmonton North sent out a press 
release.  I will quote it. “I just wish there was some substance 
to go along with this symbolism.  Setting aside a day for waving 
the flag, jumping up and down, singing stirring songs, is a nice 
gesture.  It is also a good way to keep warm in February.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not find that very humorous.  Canadians would rather see 
some substance from this government, a national unity plan, real 
job creation, a balanced budget and much needed tax relief.  That 
is exactly what this government is trying to do.  That is exactly 
what this opposition party is trying to stop.  It is simple 
grandstanding and they should be absolutely ashamed of 
themselves.  They have been carrying on like spoiled children. 
Imagine driving around the Parliament Buildings in a car with the 
Canadian flag painted on it, with the roof cut off, hooting and 
hollering and waving the flag. 
True parliamentary spirit?  I think not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a statement made by the member for Fraser Valley that 
this is ridiculous and it should not be happening.  This was on 
March 9, not that far in the past.  He said we should be on to 
the business of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. members can say what they want about newspaper 
articles, but what we are going to do is waste our time.  It is 
absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleagues on this side and that side of the 
House are truly proud Canadians.  I suggest that my Reform 
colleagues reflect on what they are doing to this nation.  They 
suggest that they are a national party.  I say shame on them. 
They are not a national party.  They are driving a wedge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must understand the true reason why the Reform members are 
doing this.  The true reason is not because there is some great 
sense of patriotism that has come over them in the last two 
weeks.  The true reason is that it is nothing more than headline 
grabbing.  It is an opportunity to drive a wedge in this country, 
ever widening the problems that we are facing right now.  I am 
absolutely disgusted at what has actually been taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat here and listened to my hon. friend—I should say 
my Reform colleague.  I will not use that term when dealing with 
them from now on.  I have listened to my Reform colleague talk 
about how proud his members are of the Canadian flag and how this 
is such a just issue that we should be debating, costing the 
taxpayers hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I sat there and listened, I almost believed him.  Then, when 
he was talking about one of his Reform colleagues having greasy 
fingers from lunch and slipped and dropped the Canadian flag on 
the ground, that is not the way it happened and he should not try 
to twist it that way.  The flag was thrown on the ground in 
disrespect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a very proud Canadian.  I look around this House and see 
all sorts of symbols that represent what Canada is to me.  I see 
young people.  I see a democratic process taking place.  I see 
two very large Canadian flags.  I look around at the lapels of 
most of the people in this room and see Canadian pins.  I can 
demonstrate my sense of pride without having a flag on the corner 
of my desk.  I too have had constituents call me and they are 
absolutely disgusted about the way the Reform Party has carried 
on for two weeks.  It has compromised the integrity of this House 
of Commons which has a proud tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one saving grace, it is that Canadians truly 
understand now that there is absolutely no level that the Reform 
Party will not sink to in order to grab a headline or to 
grandstand.  That is shameful.  The only good thing about this is 
that Canadians now know what the consequences would have been had 
they ever made the Reform Party a government.  Reform members 
should be completely ashamed of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some extremely important issues that we need to be 
discussing in this House.  The government should be dealing with 
issues of tax relief and the direction of this country and not 
just today but for years to come.  No party should ever tie up 
this House for several days for no other reason than 
grandstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party truly had this sense of patriotism that it 
seems to be showing with its Canadian ties, shirts and flag cars, 
it would withdraw this motion.  I do not think Reform members 
truly understand the harm that they are doing to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that my NDP colleagues, Conservative colleagues 
and Bloc colleagues are all trying to come to some sort of an 
agreement on this issue, the Reform members simply do not want to 
play ball.  They see an opportunity to get front page coverage. 
They see an opportunity to drive around in a funny little car 
with a Canadian flag on it, throw some flags and insult some 
people.  Well, that is not what a parliamentarian is to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in my riding of Simcoe—Grey, shortly after being elected I 
decided to put in place a program where I have actually toured 
around and visited schools.  I have handed out Canadian flags to 
students and Canadian pins to those who are travelling abroad.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is lots of room in this country for Canadian flags. I am 
sure members will agree with me that this motion is truly 
unconscionable and is disrespectful to this House.  It is 
disrespectful to Canadians and you have absolutely embarrassed 
yourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we get to 
questions and comments, it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 
38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at 
the time of adjournment are as follows:  the hon. member for 
Frontenac—Megantic, Asbestos Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On questions and comments, the hon. member for West 
Kootenay—Okanagan and then a member for the Bloc. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member that just spoke talked about disrespect 
and what a terrible thing this is.  Let us examine what terrible 
thing it is we are doing.  We are asking for the right to display 
a small stationary flag on our desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter arose out of deliberately instigating an event which 
we joined in along with everyone else.  Their party instigated 
the disruptive part of this matter.  The members of his party 
were the ones that instigated this and the hon. member should 
keep that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for the right to use these as props, but 
simply to have them available and have them on our desks.  One 
member did something that was totally inappropriate and he is 
very sorry for it.  If someone right now at tax time is doing 
their tax returns and in frustration at the taxes they are going 
to pay, throw their coffee mug at the wall, they do not do it to 
punish the cup.  They do not do it to punish the wall.  They do 
it out of frustration.  This does not make it right.  Let us get 
things in perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask this one question.  After all the rhetoric by that 
member, would he be ashamed to display a small Canadian flag on 
his desk as he probably does on his desk in his office in Ottawa 
and perhaps even in his riding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Reform member 
for the question.  I do display a Canadian flag.  It is here on 
my lapel.  I do display Canadian flags in this House.  They are 
on each side of the Speaker's chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am part of this House and as part of this House those flags 
are every bit mine as they are the Speaker's.  To sit here and 
have the Reform member trivialize our flag, trivialize a flag 
being thrown on the ground to that of taking a coffee cup and 
throwing it against the wall truly epitomizes what the true 
Reform feeling is. It is absolute disregard for the flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about the flag.  Understand that very clearly.  Do 
not believe for one minute that this is about some proud little 
Reformer having a Canadian flag on the corner of his desk.  This 
is about grandstanding.  It is about headlining and it is about 
embarrassment. They have truly done just that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
followed the debates since two this afternoon, and I was also 
present during the demonstration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to set things straight.  The Liberals are sensing 
that the wind is changing direction pretty well everywhere, and 
also that the public is not thrilled about what went on, so now 
they are trying to dissociate themselves from it and point the 
finger at the Reform Party.  The Reform Party, however, ought to 
have been aware that this is not the first time the Liberal Party 
has not lived up to its commitments.  We saw it in 1980, when 
Trudeau promised to renew federalism.  We saw it in 1995, when the 
present Prime Minister also broke his word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, in this battle, this situation in the House, the Liberals 
are as responsible as the Reform members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard a lot of use of words like hypocrite and 
ridiculous, and a lot of reference to the Bloc Quebecois, which is 
going to break the country apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this: with a day like today and with all its 
buffoonery, is the Bloc really needed to break apart the country, 
or will their country break apart just as a result of their own 
actions?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member needs to 
realize that there are two separate issues.  I would be one of 
the first to admit it.  I too stood and waved my Canadian flag 
and sang the national anthem but I did it in response to a Bloc 
statement that was made while the MP was travelling on Canadian 
tax dollars.  I was very upset with that.  The young people who 
were in Nagano representing this country at the Olympics deserve 
more than that as do people from Ontario, Alberta and Quebec. The 
Bloc members should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for the 
statements they made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two separate issues.  The second issue is this motion 
that is coming to a head this evening.  This motion is about 
being able to put a flag here.  I say it once again. Where does 
it stop?  It is obvious grandstanding and nothing more than that. 
The good thing about it is the entire country realizes Reformers 
for what they are, headline grabbers and grandstanders.  I am so 
ashamed of that party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before resuming 
debate, I should inform members that on questions and comments 
some members have been standing for quite some time. When we get 
to the next round of questions and comments we will get over to 
the member for Mississauga South first.  That is a commitment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  The debate that is taking 
place is extremely important.  I would like the assurance of the 
Chair and the House that as an independent member I will be given 
an opportunity to make submissions before the House with respect 
to this motion.  If I could seek consent or have your undertaking 
to ensure that I would appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
York South—Weston has asked for consent of the House to ensure 
he will have the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Our time 
will be fairly close with the people on the list. Does the hon. 
member for York South—Weston have the unanimous consent of the 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No.

have unanimous consent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.  The previous speaker referred to a letter sent 
to the member for Edmonton North.  We request that it be tabled 
so we can have a copy of it.  We do not know what he is referring 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Will the hon. member 
for Simcoe—Grey undertake to table the letter? 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,  I 
would certainly be more than happy to table the document.  I am 
not surprised that one Reform member does not know what another 
one is doing.  That seems to be typical in this House.

<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since this 
morning we have been involved in discussing a matter which could 
very well have been debated within the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, except for the Reform Party's 
obstinate insistence that it be brought before this House once 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing whether or not it is appropriate to have a 
small Canadian flag on members' desks.  I will come back to this 
concept of the Canadian flag in a few minutes. 
For now, however, I would just like to submit to your attention, 
and to the attention of all those watching us on television as well 
as those who are with us in the House to watch our debates live, 
that we have wasted many hours in discussing this unfortunate 
matter of flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have wasted the time of this House needlessly in a debate 
on this matter, with all that involves in terms of costs, staff, 
utilities and so on to run this venerable institution, in order to 
discuss such a trivial question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trivial, because we have been forced, need I remind the House, 
to take many minutes away from the budget debate, just because the 
Reform and Liberal members decided in a fit of rehearsed 
spontaneity to teach our hon. colleague for Rimouski—Mitis a good 
lesson.  I shall come back to that point as well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, we have consistently been wasting time in this 
House.  We have been wasting the House's time debating this 
business rather than the budget, as we should have done, rather 
than the real misappropriation of funds the millennium fund program 
constitutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than debate this matter, we could have discussed child 
poverty in Canada.  We know that Canada's record on child poverty 
is one of the worst in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have discussed the employment insurance program, I 
would even say the “so-called employment insurance program”, since 
it is a euphemism for the unemployment insurance program, and we 
are in fact debating the unemployment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have talked about it and the reform that has created 
problems of poverty throughout Canada, especially in those regions 
where the economy depends on seasonal work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have debated all these issues.  But no.  Because of 
the opinionated Reformers, we are wasting our precious time as 
parliamentarians debating this matter.  I consider this a fine 
example of the Reformers' double dealing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a discussion behind the curtain.  I will not mention the 
name of the Reformer I was having discussions with, but we were 
discussing the relevance of this debate, and he said, in all 
seriousness “This is a goodie for us.  It increases our popularity, 
it is unbelievable.  You, separatists, you too will benefit from 
this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could be more appalling than a political party that 
promotes its strictly partisan interests over what it claims to be 
defending—national unity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider this a fine example of the double dealing—I would go 
so far as to say hypocrisy—of that party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tendency all too often is to intimate that this debate would 
never have occurred were it not for the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis' unfortunate statement on the Canadian flag in 
Nagano. 
This is all a circus, a big sham, a farce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers and Liberal members could easily have used a forum other 
than this venerable House of Commons to express their disagreement with 
the remarks made by my colleague, the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, what was so terrible in what the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis said in Nagano? She made the same comment many members 
of this House would have made in front of that many American flags 
displayed all over any Olympic village. They would have commented on the 
chauvinism of Americans, implying that they were happy to be Canadians 
because Canadians are different from Americans. 
And yet, we saw the very same shameful demonstration of narrow 
patriotism when too many Canadian flags were displayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis never made any comment on the 
flag itself or questioned its relevance, symbolism and importance to a 
country like Canada. Never did she denigrate the Canadian flag in any 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We show the Canadian flag the respect owed to the flag of every 
country around the world and I never heard any of my colleagues utter 
negative or disparaging remarks about the Canadian flag. Nor is that 
what my colleague from Rimouski—Mitis did. 
She simply noticed a fact, as any member of this House might have, had 
they witnessed a similar spectacle be it in Nagano or at any other 
Olympic Games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that several members of this House openly make this 
kind of comment about our neighbours to the South in particular, when 
they show off their patriotism for the world to see. Are we Americanized 
to the point that we now have to use the same tactics when we 
participate in international events, going as far as to display, during 
the closing ceremonies at the Nagano games, a huge flag taking up nearly 
one third of the olympic stadium in a country like Japan?

</I></B></P><P align=left>What poor taste! What a self-centred attitude, which carries 
with it the risk of bad press for Canada on the international 
scene.  In the past, Canada had always distinguished itself on the 
international scene by its avoidance of such manifestations of bad 
taste.  My colleague for Rimouski—Mitis said nothing against the 
Canadian flag or the national anthem.  All she did was voice a very 
straightforward opinion that there were too many flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They seized upon this as a pretext for welcoming her back to 
Canada with a little surprise, one that was totally spontaneous, 
according to them. 
That is why all Liberal and Reform members had carefully set small 
Canadian flags on their desks all ready for a spontaneous 
demonstration for the benefit of our colleague for Rimouski—Mitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This totally spontaneous demonstration took place on two 
separate occasions on February 26.  The first time was in the early 
afternoon, when she was speaking in response to the budget speech, 
and some hon. members rose spontaneously to show her their love of 
the Canadian flag.  At that time, Mr. Speaker, you yourself felt 
that such a demonstration was totally inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the ruling made a few minutes later by the Chair, our 
spontaneous Liberal and Reform members very carefully kept their 
little Canadian flags ready on their desks in preparation for 
another spontaneous demonstration of their love for their flag the 
next time my colleague for Rimouski—Mitis spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This occurred during Oral Question Period, when the Speaker 
called upon her to speak and she rose to do so. 
She rose to ask her question, but even before she could get a 
single word out, our spontaneous Reform and Liberal colleagues 
stood up, waving their flags, booed her and, in another surge of 
equally great spontaneity, began to sing the national anthem, thus 
creating a lengthy interruption in the proceedings of the House 
and, understandably, giving their Conservative and NDP colleagues 
no choice but to stand up and sing along.  And all of this was 
perfectly genuine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I personally deplore about this incident, is that the 
arrogant and exaggerated way in which the anthem was sung obliged 
me to remain seated during the national anthem, a thing I never do. 
I stand when any national anthem is sung. 
But it was done with such contempt that it forced Bloc Quebecois members 
to remain seated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some tried to take advantage of the situation by saying “You see, 
the separatists remained seated; they have no respect for the symbols of 
the Canadian identity”. This is not true. We respect the symbols of the 
Canadian identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Canada is a great country, as are the United 
States, Germany, Japan and France. It is simply not the country in which 
I would want to raise my children. But this is an altogether different 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us quickly go back to the Nagano incident. The member opposite 
said earlier “She travelled at the expense of Canadian taxpayers. She 
made disgraceful comments about the Canadian flag, at the expense of 
Canadian taxpayers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réginald Bélair:</B> She did too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Indeed. It should be realized that, as long 
as Quebeckers continue paying close to $31 billion in taxes to the 
Canadian government, they will continue to benefit from this federation, 
even though they get too little out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those parliamentarians who say that the member for Rimouski—Mitis 
should not use taxpayers' money to say there were too many flags in 
Nagano are really adding insult to injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> As for the unfortunate incident that 
occurred in this House, the hon. member for Roberval rightly pointed 
out— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645
<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, would you please tell the 
hysterical member opposite to keep it down while I am speaking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Roberval, quite rightly pointed 
out that the Standing Orders had been infringed in several 
respects.  First of all, as I pointed out to you earlier, you 
yourself had issued a ruling.  In this respect, parliamentary 
tradition could not be clearer, and I will later quote article 333 
of Beauchesne's <I>Parliamentary Rules and Forms</I>, fifth edition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will cite Standing Order 10, which is also mentioned in 
article 168.1 of Beauchesne.  It says, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>10. The Speaker shall preserve order and decorum, and 
shall decide questions of order— 
No debate shall be permitted on any such decision, and no such 
decision shall be subject to an appeal to the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You yourself made a ruling.  That ruling notwithstanding, our 
members, in their spontaneous enthusiasm, returned to the charge a 
few minutes later.  Standing Order 16.2 states that, when a member 
is speaking, no member shall interrupt him or her, except to raise 
a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the spontaneous interventions of our Liberal and 
Reform colleagues were not for the purpose of raising points of 
order.  Their sole purpose was to interrupt, intimidate and poke 
fun at our colleague, the member for Rimouski—Mitis.  In so doing, 
they were in contravention of the Standing Orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Props were also mentioned.  The Speaker ruled on this 
yesterday. 
Article 333 of Beauchesne's <I>Parliamentary Rules and Forms</I>, fifth 
edition, to which I referred earlier, stipulates that speakers have 
consistently ruled that it is improper to produce exhibits of any 
sort in the Chamber, except written documents, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until further order, this category does not include Canada's 
flag.  It therefore had to be considered a visual prop that should 
not have been used for the purposes to which it was put. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, as soon as the House disintegrated into 
confusion, the Speaker rose to call members to order. 
Despite that, our colleagues carried on their heckling to the point 
of singing the national anthem, thereby contravening another 
section of Beauchesne, paragraph 168.1, which I also referred to a 
little earlier. It provides, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No member may rise when the Speaker is standing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members must accordingly remain silent.  That is not what 
happened.  In all respects, yesterday's ruling by the Chair was 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the incident itself, we have been told, in 
connection with the remarks made by my colleague from 
Rimouski—Mitis and sovereignists in general, that we have no 
respect for the Canadian flag, for the national anthem and for 
the symbols of Canadian sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc has never questioned in any way the presence of the 
flags in this House or the singing of the national anthem.  In 
fact, it co-operated with the political parties present in the 35th 
Parliament to permit the singing of the national anthem here on 
Wednesdays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Bloc arrived in the House in 1993, there was a single 
Canadian flag behind you, to your right, as flag etiquette 
provides.  The flag is to be to the right of the Speaker, therefore 
on the observer's left. 
This is the way it had been for many years in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oddly enough, the day after the 1995 referendum, a second 
Canadian flag appeared, this time to your left, Mr. Speaker. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this decision was made obviously for political 
reasons, the Bloc Quebecois never questioned the relevance of 
Canadian parliamentarians having a second flag behind the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is not a question of lack of respect by the Bloc members 
for the symbols of Canadian identity.  We are very proud of them. 
We are very proud that Canada chose as a symbol of its identity 
what were symbols of French Canadian identity.  We are proud that 
Canada chose the maple leaf in the 1960s, with all the debate it 
provoked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that Reform members are now very proud of 
this flag. 
A reading of the debates of the day shows just how opposed members 
from the West were to the maple leaf flag, which they claimed was 
not representative of their region, their part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for “O Canada”, much has been said about it.  It was played 
for the first time at Quebec City in 1882, on June 24, 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, to be exact.  The words were by Justice 
Basile Routhier, and the music by Calixa Lavallée, a native of my 
riding, incidently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be pointed out, moreover, that when the decision was 
made to adopt it as the national anthem of Canada, only the first 
verse was selected, as the rest did not perhaps represent the 
notion of a national anthem to be sung from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Basile Routhier wrote of the Canadian “living close to 
the giant river leading to the sea”, I am certain he was not 
thinking of the people of the Yukon or Saskatchewan.  He was, of 
course, thinking of the French Canadians, those who had been called 
“les Canadiens” for centuries, and whose name was taken over as the 
centuries passed so that it now applies to everyone here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much can be said about the Canadian national anthem, but the 
fact is that, returning to the object of today's debate, this 
motion by the Reform Party demonstrates that party's duplicity. 
There were negotiations among the leaders and they were going well. 
The only party that stood aloof was the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the negotiations was to enable us to raise the 
flag question in the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs in order to determine whether or not it was appropriate to 
have Canadian flags on our desks. 
But no, the grandstanding Reform Party wanted to get TV coverage by 
forcing Parliament to commit itself and vote on a motion permitting 
the presence of the flag in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had they really been serious in this desire, had they really 
wanted to advance this idea, they would simply have allowed this 
matter to be dealt with by the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs, but they did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This totally partisan attitude on the part of the Reform 
members must therefore be punished and condemned. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a brief comment and a question for the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members certainly will know that this has been a media circus. 
The bottom line is that all of us, this place and all members, 
look worse.  As a end result it has hurt us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago in 1993 when we were elected there was no call 
for flags on the desks by Reformers.  Neither was there in 1994, 
1995, 1996 or 1997.  There is no question the only reason this 
came up is that there was a political opportunity.  Despite their 
protestations, this is clearly a political, opportunistic move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have?  We have the Reform member for Medicine Hat who 
wants to throw a flag.  We have the member for Edmonton North who 
wants to throw books.  We have the Reform member for 
Okanagan—Shuswap who wants to throw punches.  All these actions 
show that there is clearly a bent toward aggressiveness on behalf 
of the Reform Party.  Clearly the motion has to be defeated 
simply because if we were to put 300 flags around the Chamber it 
would be like a giant pin cushion.  Surely within a week one of 
them would be impaled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians will see through the childish games that are being 
played by the Reform Party.  Canadians will also understand that 
most members of Parliament are here not only to defend the flag, 
their country and their constituents but to do whatever we can to 
make this a better country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member concerns the comments by the member 
of Rimouski—Mitis.  The member should concede that her 
observations were with regard to the athletes' village.  Did she 
go to the athletes and say “dear athletes. you have too many 
flags”?  No, she did not.  She waited until she got her 
photograph.  She went to the press.  She said to the Canadian 
people that they had too many flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the member rise now and concede that his own member is the 
sole reason we have this terrible situation in the House of 
Commons today? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to say 
that I am a long way from thinking that this whole business in the 
House began with the statement by my colleague, the member for 
Rimouski—Mitis.  It was inevitable that there would one day be an 
attempt to use the symbols of Canadian unity to rally everyone 
against the nasty separatists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Rimouski—Mitis was certainly not going to go 
to the Olympic village to disturb Canadian athletes during their 
preparations for the various competitions in order to tell them 
there were too many Canadian flags and that they should curb their 
excessive display.  She simply made an inherently innocuous comment 
to the effect that there were too many Canadian flags. 
If, through immaturity, hon. members flared up and used the 
Canadian flag for purposes other than those for which it was 
designed, well, that is their problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who say that Bloc Quebecois members and 
sovereigntists in Quebec generally do not show respect for the 
symbols of Canadian sovereignty, I say that we have never treated 
the Canadian flag with as little respect, as little regard and as 
little dignity as the federalist members in this House.  We never 
used our flag, the fleur-de-lis, to take part in this disgraceful 
demonstration in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the House apparently expected that, on our election to 
office in 1993, we would march in, drums beating and fleur-de-lis 
held high, to show our pride. 
That is something we never did, because we respect the institution, 
we respect the rules of the House, and we respect our colleagues. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been consultations among the parties and I believe 
you would find consent for the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, immediately following the vote to be taken later today on 
the second reading of Bill C-19, the Speaker shall put, without 
debate or amendment, all questions necessary to dispose of the 
second reading stage of Bill C-20, an act to amend the 
Competition Act and to make consequential and related amendments 
to other acts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I have not been consulted with respect to this matter.  A 
few moments ago I was asked for consent of the House to speak on 
the flag debate and I believe the member for Verchères denied me 
that consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to co-operate with the House.  I would like to give 
my unanimous consent to the votes later this evening, but I would 
also like the right to speak on this motion before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  May I suggest that 
the hon. member for York South—Weston again seek unanimous 
consent when the opportunity arises.

the Canadian flag flying in the Quebec National Assembly?  If he 
has an objection to the Canadian flag flying in the Quebec 
National Assembly, can he indicate the reasons why?  Would he not 
agree that as long as Quebec is part of Canada and is a province 
in the country of Canada that it would be respectful for the 
Quebec National Assembly to fly the Canadian flag? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also would it be respectful that the city hall in Quebec City 
should fly the Canadian flag?

trying to shift the focus of the debate slightly. While my respect for 
the symbols of Canadian identity suggests to me that they have their 
place, as in this case, in this venerable institution, I think this 
debate should not extend to provincial legislatures, and that of Quebec 
in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to the Quebec legislators to decide which flag shall be

longer have to answer questions as to whether or not the Canadian flag 
should be displayed inside the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am on the subject of Canadian flags, are the provincial 
flags not Canadian flags? Since the hon. member for York South—Weston 
has asked the question, I would like him to answer it. Perhaps he could 
give me an answer behind the curtain later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the procedure and House affairs committee ever determine 
that the Canadian flag has a place in this House on members' desks, I 
think it will have to determine at the same time that, Canada being a

place in this House.

this time in the House, when the Canadian flag has been around since 
1965 and we have always been able to work, to function in this House 
without feeling this absolute need for a Canadian flag on every desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has this now become a national unity issue, and one of such 
vital importance? First, I think that, as we speak, the federalists are 
suffering from chronic insecurity. Second, I think the Reformers are 
trying to make the most of a political opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I spoke 
a couple of times here today.  I realize there is five minutes 
left and I will try to sum up my feelings and I am sure some of 
the feelings of our party on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the Canadians who are watching Parliament today, for the 
men, women and children who are watching the parliamentary 
station, I think there are some things that have not been said 
which need to be said and need to be understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about patriotism.  This is not about whether or not 
we love the flag of this country. 
I am going to point out a couple of reasons why it is not about 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here a motion which on its surface sounds positive. 
However if this motion goes forward it will only serve to 
perpetuate the problem.  The problem will continue.  The Bloc 
members will get up next week and will want to know why they 
cannot have the Quebec flag on their desks alongside the Canadian 
flag. Then maybe a member from Nova Scotia will want to know why 
the Nova Scotian flag cannot be on his desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell members why we do not have those flags on our desks. 
It is because they are represented in this House at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address veterans.  I have heard our veterans mentioned 
time and time again today by the party which proposed this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My grandfather fought in World War I and in World War II.  My 
father was a soldier in World War II.  I can tell this House, and 
I have no shame in saying it, that my father never, ever, for one 
day, accepted the new Canadian flag.  His flag was the flag which 
he served under.  It was the red ensign.  Does that make him less 
of a Canadian?  I presume that it does not.  I insist that it 
does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of other issues at stake here.  We have 
talked about cost.  I have heard the name of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage mentioned today and the $25 million which she 
spent distributing flags.  Today it has cost us $700,000 to stand 
in this Parliament to debate the flag issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a cost to this institution, to the respect of this 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard today that we need to stand to be counted.  We will 
see if the flags go on the desks who will stand to be counted. If 
I put a flag on my desk does that make me a better Canadian than 
someone who does not have one on their desk? I do not think so. 
I will insist that it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard today an excuse as to why the flag was thrown on 
the floor of the House during a heated debate.  It is something I 
am sure that the member who did it would like to forget.  I am 
sure he would like it to go away.  I can understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The excuse was made that he had been eating greasy food and it 
slipped from his hands.  Surely we are above making such 
ridiculous and petty excuses in the House of Commons of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The car that was painted to resemble the Canadian flag, did that 
red and white paint fall from the sky?  Was the car just driving 
along and suddenly it got painted?  No, it was a deliberate act 
meant to incite the Parliament of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thought I would like to leave with the House. It is 
not about the flag.  It is not about patriotism.  It is about 
levers.  We all have agendas in this building.  Should we ever 
use the Canadian flag, a flag which I honour and respect, as a 
lever to push our agenda in this House?  I say that we should 
not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to clarify the point which was made 
about the car because it has come up so often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We received a phone call from someone who made a 1967 Oldsmobile 
his symbol of the 100th birthday of Canada.  He had the car 
painted.  When the flag issue became so prominent he phoned us 
and said “I would love to have some MPs take a ride in my car”. 
He is an ordinary citizen.  I thought, is it only okay to fly the 
flag here if it is on the limousines of the big guys in 
government?  I thought no, let an ordinary person do it.  We 
complied with his— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The last word goes 
to the hon. member for South Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I note that the clock shows 5.15 p.m.  I would like to ask again 
for unanimous consent to be given the opportunity to speak on 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Does the hon. member 
for York South—Weston have unanimous consent to speak to this 
motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the indulgence of the House. 
I have been here for most of the day listening to the debate.  I 
have had the opportunity on several occasions to ask questions of 
speakers.  I wish to speak to the motion before the House on 
behalf of the residents of York South—Weston.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, it is important that this debate take place.  Much 
has been said today about whether or not this motion should be 
before the House.  In my view, it is extremely important that we 
discuss this matter and that it be debated in the Parliament of 
Canada. I am not sure whether this is the appropriate time to do 
it given the events of the last several weeks.  However, the 
motion was properly put by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the motion for the benefit of my constituents: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House should recognize the Canadian flag as an 
acceptable symbol that may be displayed at any time on the desks 
of Members of Parliament in the House of Commons provided that 
only one flag be displayed on a Member's desk at any one given 
time, and that the said flag remain stationary for the purposes 
of decorum and be no larger than the standard recognized flag. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you were to put this question to Canadians right 
across Canada, the decision would be overwhelming.  If it were 
put in a referendum, of course they would endorse this. I find it 
regrettable that there are a number of different political 
agendas at play this afternoon.  I believe the political agendas 
at play this afternoon have tainted the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, no one wants to vote against the flag but for 
whatever reason four of the political parties in this House have 
decided en masse to vote against the motion before the House.  In 
my view, it should be a free vote.  I regret that some of the 
political parties in this House have made it a political vote, a 
party vote, a whipped vote.  In effect, several parties have 
given talking points with respect to the motion to their members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be morally wrong for members of this House to prohibit 
the waving or the display of the Canadian flag in the Canadian 
House of Commons.  Why are we as Canadians so proud to wave the 
Canadian flag when we travel abroad, so proud to wave the 
Canadian flag in an uninhibited fashion when our athletes are 
successful at the olympic games or when our hockey teams are 
successful at international competitions?  Why are we so prepared 
to wave the Canadian flag during those moments yet we appear to 
be prepared as a House of Commons today to limit the display of 
the Canadian flag here in the House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the process of denying ourselves in the House of 
Commons of Canada the right that every Canadian has in this 
country, that is to display a Canadian flag.  Could we imagine 
for a moment an employer prohibiting an employee from displaying 
a small Canadian flag at his or her desk?  There is no place in 
the country of Canada where the display of the Canadian flag is 
prohibited, where the right that is given to us under the charter 
of rights and freedoms is restricted or prohibited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others Canadian have the right under the charter of rights and 
freedoms to display the Canadian flag in their workplaces.  If a 
person were prohibited from displaying the Canadian flag and a 
court case ensued, I submit that a competent court in this land 
would declare that to be unconstitutional.  Canadians would have 
the right to display the Canadian flag, but not an unfettered 
right.  As members have pointed out, it would be a qualified 
right.  All rights are qualified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an hon. member pointed out, the right to swing your fist ends 
where the other guy's nose begins.  The right to shout fire in a 
crowded theatre is limited.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we limiting the right to display the Canadian flag?  I 
submit it is for political reasons.  I have a flag in my desk but 
I am prohibited from sitting it and displaying it on my desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 14 years I have served in the House of Commons I have 
never wanted to or had the opportunity to display a flag at my 
desk, but I knew I had the right to do it.  That is what is 
important, having the right to display a flag at my desk.  Some 
members may choose not to display a flag at their desk.  That is 
their right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians express their patriotism in different ways.  Some 
prefer to wave or fly flags outside their residences.  Others do 
not.  Some prefer to belt out <I>O Canada</I> at a hockey game. 
Others choose to remain silent.  They have that right to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of Parliament, it seems to me I ought to have the 
right to display the flag.  The Speaker yesterday invited members 
to make a decision.  It is up to the House to make that 
determination.  It seems to me that if we were truly representing 
our constituents as opposed to narrow partisan interests that we 
would vote in favour of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that much of the opposition to the motion 
presented is not directed at the merits of the motion but at the 
authors of the motion, the Reform Party of Canada.  I submit we 
are doing a disservice to our country and to our constituents by 
allowing narrow, partisan interests to interfere in a matter as 
important as this, a matter as symbolic as this is for Canadians 
right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with the House some editorial opinion. 
The Toronto <I>Star</I> says “We believe there is no better place 
than the Parliament of Canada for Canadians to see their flag 
displayed freely and proudly”. They go on to state “We merely 
think an exception should be made for the Canadian flag.  It is 
our most powerful national symbol.  As long as MPs display it 
respectfully, we believe the public interest will be well 
served”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, I believe, would be the sentiment shared by the 
overwhelming majority of Canadians.  We tolerate much in the 
House.  We have tolerated much in the House with respect to free 
speech and the ability of those who hold different political 
persuasions to speak in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems patently strange that we say to people they do not have 
to swear allegiance to Canada in order to sit in the Parliament 
of Canada.  I do not deny for a moment the right of separatists 
to sit in this House because they have received a mandate.  It 
does not sit well with me but they received a mandate from their 
constituents to sit in the House of Commons of Canada and they 
have a right to sit here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, as members of this House, one has to respect the 
traditions of the House and respect the symbols of the House. 
Yes, hon. members say that there are two large flags flanking the 
Speaker, and rightfully so.  They ought to flank the Speaker. 
Likewise, every member of the House should have the right to 
display a small Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What harm does it do to people?  Are we offending somebody?  Who 
is it that we would be offending if we were to display a small 
Canadian flag at our desk?  Is that the reason why there are 
those in the House who would defeat this motion?  Is it because 
they are afraid of offending a group of people in the House of 
Commons of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is morally wrong to deny members of Parliament the right to 
display the flag. 
It is morally wrong to prohibit or limit the use of the flag of 
Canada in the House of Commons of Canada for fear that it might 
offend somebody.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been chagrined by the fact that we as Canadians at 
times find it difficult to express our patriotism and love for 
this country.  It is with envy that I at times watch our American 
friends when they are given the opportunity to exhibit their 
patriotism.  Some people find that offensive and un-Canadian, but 
I find it touching for American nationals to be so proud of their 
flag and what it stands for and the freedom that it symbolizes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Men and women have gone to war for the freedoms and rights that 
we have in this country.  Mr. Speaker, the flag that flanks you 
as you sit in the House of Commons is symbolic of our democracy 
and the freedoms that we have in this country.  To limit, 
restrict or in any way prohibit the waving or displaying of that 
flag I would submit is morally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that when this motion is put in a few moments it will 
be defeated.  It seems to me that this motion will be defeated 
not because it is not a good motion on its merits, but because of 
the various political agendas at play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we are sending out conflicting messages to Canadians.  On 
one hand we are spending millions of taxpayers' dollars inviting 
Canadians to fly the Canadian flag as the Canadian government did 
a few short months ago at a cost of millions of dollars. 
Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Canadians are now 
flying the flag.  We were giving away free flags to Canadians a 
few short months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of a mixed message is the government sending to 
Canadians when it is telling them on one hand to fly the Canadian 
flag, do not be inhibited or shy, show their patriotism, but on 
the other hand we are about to deny ourselves the very right that 
we would give to other Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude with what I indicated earlier.  The net 
effect of this motion is to deny ourselves the freedom that every 
other Canadian has.  At times we are chastised and criticized 
because we give to ourselves certain rights such as the freedom 
of speech that most other Canadians do not have.  We have the 
ability to say things in this Chamber that we could not say 
outside the Chamber because we could be sued for slander. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the reverse is true.  Other Canadians have that 
right.  Other Canadians want us, as their representatives in the 
Parliament of Canada, to have that right.  Yet, for some 
inexplicable reason I suppose we are about to deny ourselves the 
right to fly or display the flag at our desks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a question of order or disorder.  Disorder is always 
contrary to the rules.  If the Canadian flag is used to restrict 
someone from speaking or to prevent someone from speaking, that 
of course would be unacceptable as would any other display or 
prop that is used in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to prohibit the display of a flag at my desk is 
excessive when dealing with the problem of disorder in this 
House.  In the 14 years that I have served in this House only on 
a handful of occasions have we spontaneously sang <I>O Canada</I>. 
I recall when the government of the day was passing the free 
trade bill, members of the opposition and members in the gallery 
spontaneously broke out in a rendition of <I>O Canada</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that members are that irresponsible that if 
they are given the right to display a flag they would abuse that 
right.  If they were to abuse the right it would be incumbent 
upon you, Mr. Speaker, to prevent disorder in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when I was first elected to this House on October 25, 1993, I 
brought my little flag with me, all quite innocently, into this 
House and put it on my desk.  An officer of the House came to see 
me, very discreetly of course, and said “In this place, sir, there 
are rules you must follow”.  I told him I loved my Quebec flag. 
“No props are allowed here”, he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also told me I could not have any grape juice or apple 
juice here, only water or ice water. 
Props in the House of Commons, even <I>La Presse</I>, were not permitted. 
I voluntarily complied with the rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the flag is concerned, I clearly remember that, in 
Sault Ste. Marie, the riding of Ron Irwin, the former Minister of 
Indian Affairs, they stomped on the fleur-de-lys, the Quebec flag. 
What did the member for York South—Weston do to defend the Quebec 
flag?  Nothing.  What has this independent member done to punish or 
call to order the members of the Reform Party, who threw the 
Canadian flag to the ground, because the Speaker ruled against 
their wishes?

hon. member who threw the flag has since apologized to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I would like to make to the hon. member is if he wants 
the right to display his provincial flag at his desk, I have 
absolutely no objection.  If it is his desire to display a 
fleur-de-lis at his desk, that is his right.  But please do not 
deny me my right to fly my flag at my desk.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
not been here as long as the hon. member and I have a great deal 
of respect for him.  But we have to start building bridges in 
Canada.  In the past two weeks we have put a whole lot of cracks 
in the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referred to the Olympics.  This is not the 
Olympics.  We are not in here with a soccer ball.  We are not in 
here for basketball.  We have two Canadian flags here for which 
all of us have respect.  We have really hurt Canada in the past 
two weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked up to the gallery that day I saw the shock on all 
the faces.  People in the gallery could not believe this was 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent Canada's first incorporated city by royal charter 
which dates back to 1783.  A flag cannot be placed in the council 
chambers other than the flag placed beside the Speaker.  The flag 
is placed beside her worship.  No other flags are allowed on the 
desks.  Nothing else is allowed in the council chambers, the same 
as the House.  We follow the rules laid down by the British 
Parliament.  My colleagues ran on a platform to bring decorum to 
the House of Commons and they have ruined it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member 
was not directing her comments at me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member speaks of decorum.  Since when is it not proper 
to wave the Canadian flag?  When does that show a lack of 
decorum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House is not to allow members of 
Parliament to display large Canadian flags.  The motion before 
the House is to give the right to members of Parliament to 
display a desk flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have considerable respect for the hon. member and I know she 
has been an excellent member of Parliament, but she also takes 
pride in representing her constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite a poll that was commissioned.  The question was should 
MPs be allowed to have flags on their Commons desks, and 75% said 
yes to that question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
couple of brief questions to the member.  He made reference to it 
being morally wrong for members to vote to prohibit the placing 
of flags on desks in the Chamber.  My understanding is that in 
the G-7 there is not another legislature that permits individual 
flags at individual desks of members.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it morally wrong for this legislature to follow what is 
generally the accepted practice in the legislatures around the 
world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already flags beside the Speaker's chair. Many of us 
wear the Canadian flag pin on our clothing.  I wonder why he 
feels there is a need for additional flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to other G-7 
countries, frankly I do not care what other G-7 countries do with 
respect to how they treat their national symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying to the hon. member is that the overwhelming 
majority of Canadians, including his very own constituents, want 
him to have the right to display the Canadian flag at his desk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he were truly representing the people of his riding, he would 
vote in favour of this motion.  It seems that what is being asked 
here this afternoon is not the ability to disrupt the House, to 
wave large Canadian flags. Some members of Parliament, I 
included, want the right to do it.  Why should I be prohibited as 
a member of the Canadian Parliament from waving this flag at my 
desk?  What is so offensive— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The hon. member for York South—Weston referred to the 
fact that there was a poll— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point 
of order.  It being 5.43 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the 
proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose 
of the business of supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is on the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  All those in favour 
of the amendment will please say yea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Yea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  All those opposed 
will please say nay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Nay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In my opinion the 
nays have it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.)</b>, seconded by the hon. 
member for Kamloops, moved that Bill C-245, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code, penalties for sexual offences involving children, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I stand today to perform one of my most 
important duties as the member of Parliament for Oxford.  This 
duty is to introduce legislation when I see that current 
legislation is not responding to a need within our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last year and a half I have identified such a need.  I 
have found that those who sexually prey upon our children are 
merely being slapped on the wrist by our judicial system. This 
seems horrendous to me and to my constituents.  Finding that the 
sentences for these crimes against our children are inadequate, I 
introduce Bill C-245 which we have before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the NDP member for Kamloops for seconding 
the bill.  The bill will increase the maximum sentence for sexual 
assault on a child to life imprisonment without possibility of 
parole for 25 years.  As well the sentence for forcible 
confinement of a child is increased to 14 years from the current 
10.  The definition of child pornography would extend to any 
information or reproduction transmitted by electronic means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next few minutes I want to share with hon. members why my 
constituents and I believe the bill should be passed by 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current maximum sentence for sexual assault is 10 years. 
According to information obtained through the adult criminal 
court survey, the average sentence given in 1993 and 1994 for 
level two sexual assault and level three sexual assault was 1,287 
days, less than four years.  Yet level two and level three sexual 
assault are sexual assault with a weapon and aggravated sexual 
assault.  These statistics were compiled using data from nine 
provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no real distinction between sexual assault on a child 
and other charges of sexual assault.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to share with this House the average sentence for 
sexual touching of a child under 14.  For this charge, in which 
sexual intent must be proven, the average sentence imposed by the 
courts was 288 days, not even a full year.  Furthermore, 77% of 
the accused in solved violent incidents involving children under 
12 had a relationship with the victim.  In 31% of these cases, 
the accused was a member of the victim's immediate family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, these are not statistics that make one sleep 
easily at night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent 36 years of my life in education as a teacher, union 
representative, principal and superintendent.  I worked with our 
children.  I am witness to the effects of abuse on children.  I 
know the innocence of a child is destroyed by sexual abuse.  I 
have heard the confusion and self-guilt in the mind of a 
sensitive teenage boy after his experience with a pedophile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as legislators must ask ourselves how an average sentence of 
377 days for level one sexual assault can atone for the loss of a 
child's innocence and self-respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-245 speaks directly to sexual assault upon a child.  The 
bill seeks to amend section 271 of the Criminal Code by 
increasing the maximum sentence to imprisonment for life with no 
parole eligibility for 25 years if found guilty of sexual assault 
on a child under eight or under fourteen who was under the 
offender's trust or authority or dependent on the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it very clear that this sentence is the same 
sentence as that for first degree murder.  It is my belief and 
that of many of my constituents that in the very worst cases of 
child sexual assault the sentence should be equal to that of 
murder.  Why?  Because these assaults have murdered the child's 
soul, the child's self-esteem and the child's mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot see a Martin Kruze throw himself off a bridge without 
knowing why.  His abuser led him there and pushed him off with 
his continued abuse as surely as if he were present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One constituent wrote to me of the sentence received by a sex 
offender.  The writer said “He gets a lousy two years probation 
and my child gets life”.   Two years of probation to walk the 
streets, be employed and have a life while the child is 
devastated and emotionally murdered and his parents hope that 
just maybe he might find his life worth living again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately many victims of abuse find that life is not worth 
living again.  And far too many of their abusers walk the streets 
after a sentence that does not reflect the severity of their 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My office has received many letters like the one I have just 
quoted from.  Some are short and simply indicate support for this 
bill.  Others are long and tell of the writer's experience with 
sexual abuse.  These letters are not easy to read because they 
talk of the hurt and betrayal felt by the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the three main cases I have received correspondence on, all 
have told of abuse delivered by someone known to the victim and 
to his or her family.  The abusers were not strangers but a 
stepfather, a neighbour and a “big brother”, that is in this 
case a volunteer from the Big Brothers organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from one letter I received from a woman in 
my riding whose son was abused by his Big Brother volunteer.  The 
mother says “I cannot believe when this man came to my house, 
when I thought it would be good for my son to have a big brother 
to look up to, a father figure in his life, that he could end up 
doing the things he did to him.  I interviewed this man for at 
least two hours and was happy to think that my son was lucky to 
have a man like this in his life”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years later this mother was devastated by the news that 
this man, this father figure, had sexually abused her child 
beginning at the age of eight.  The woman's son had a very 
troubled adolescence.  He spent time in jail and his mother now 
knows why.  This woman has asked me to do everything I can to 
ensure that those who prey upon our children, as this man did on 
her son, are punished severely for their crimes. 
I want us to promise her today in the highest legislative body in 
this land that we will not let her down.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue was brought to my attention through a case in my 
riding.  A father was convicted on three counts of unlawful 
confinement for locking his three sons in wire cages in a dark 
basement, three counts of administering a noxious substance for 
making them eat their own feces and drink their own urine, and 
three counts of assault for beating them. In addition this man 
was convicted of numerous sex charges, including three counts of 
intercourse with a girl under 14.  The victims of the sexual 
assaults were his three stepdaughters. The perpetrator of these 
crimes was sentenced to 18.5 years in prison but he will be 
eligible for parole in just over six. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer my thanks to the Woodstock <I>Daily 
Sentinel Review</I> for bringing this case to my attention.  The 
reporter who covered this trial for the <I>Sentinel Review</I> 
called it the most disturbing case she has ever had to report on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can honestly say that this bill represents a fine example of 
how the press and the community has worked with me, their local 
member, to try to correct the weakness in our judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the frightful instances of forcible confinement in 
the aforementioned case, I have included in Bill C-245 an 
amendment to section 279 of the Criminal Code.  This amendment 
would increase the maximum sentence for forcible confinement to 
14 years from 10 in the case of a parent or ward who confines 
their child and thereby harms the child's physical or mental 
health.  Anyone who questions why I felt an increase in this 
sentence is necessary need only recall what that father did to 
his sons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final section of Bill C-245 would ensure that the definition 
of publication in the case of child pornography would cover 
display, transmission or storage by electronic mail and the 
Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some think government has no business regulating the information 
superhighway but I suspect that protecting our children in 
society from those who would trade in child pornography is far 
more important than any supposed right on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information technology is an incredible development.  I continue 
to encourage my constituents to take advantage of the Internet to 
benefit themselves and their communities, but we cannot allow 
criminal use of the information superhighway to endanger our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my belief that my introduction of this bill into the House 
of Commons was my duty as the member of Parliament for Oxford. As 
I stated at the outset, it is a duty I take very seriously. As a 
member of Parliament and as a citizen of this great country of 
ours, I also have another duty. That duty is to speak for and to 
protect those members of our society who cannot protect 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of us here in this House has a moral obligation to protect 
our children from those who prey upon them.  I do not doubt for a 
moment that all members feel this obligation to our nation's 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-245 is not a votable bill.  During the subcommittee 
meeting I was asked by the member for Brandon—Souris why I felt 
my bill would increase sentences when in fact it did not impose a 
minimum sentence for these crimes. It was an excellent question. 
I dare say some members who are to follow me in this debate will 
raise this as an objection.  For this reason, I offer my 
colleagues an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament speaks with a loud voice in the courtrooms across 
this land.  If we were to pass this bill, we would be saying to 
our judicial system that the protection of our children is 
paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our voice with the governor general's signature attached would 
say that in the worst cases of abuse, those who prey upon our 
children must be removed from society for life.  Our voice would 
represent constituents across the country who speak through us 
and who want their children protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some changes may need to be made to this bill.  I feel our 
colleagues on the justice committee can make these changes in the 
best interests of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The support I received for this bill from the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police and the Canadian Police 
Association has let me know that our front line law enforcement 
officers agree with increased sentences to protect our children.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that this bill should be voted on by members of this 
House.  For those members who are not familiar with the cases I 
have dealt with in my riding they need only look at cases in 
their own ridings.  Any members who have dealt with children have 
met those who have suffered from the horrors of abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all remember the recent problems within Maple Leaf 
Gardens or with Graham James and Sheldon Kennedy.  We can recall 
the abuse perpetrated on our aboriginal children in orphanages 
and residential schools, religious or otherwise.  Thank God for 
people like Sheldon Kennedy who spoke out about the years of 
abuse he suffered.  He has battled back to be a model for victims 
but we must also remember that for every Sheldon Kennedy there is 
a Martin Kruze who saw as his only escape, especially after a 
ridiculously short sentence given to his abuser, a jump off 
Toronto's Bloor Street viaduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask members to look into their hearts and ask themselves 
if we would be performing our duty if this bill was not put to a 
vote. It is time to send a message to sex offenders that the time 
for judicial slaps on the wrist has past.  Canadians will not 
allow us to pass the buck to other jurisdictions or wait until 
some obscure commission passes recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this House decides in approximately 35 minutes that this bill 
should not be votable I ask those members present to look into 
the eyes of a victim or the mother of a victim and tell them why 
they have to wait for justice.  If amendments should be made let 
us send this bill to committee so it can hear witnesses and make 
changes to improve the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in my speech I read from a letter sent to me from an abused 
child's mother.  I would like to refer to that letter again. 
This mother says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child abuse of any kind has to stop, and the introduction of 
your bill will certainly be a start.  I am tired of those people 
being set free and sent to counselling and everything is okay. It 
certainly is not okay, that doesn't do a thing for the victims 
who have to live with this the rest of their lives.  In 
requesting higher sentences for these sex offenders, how can I 
ask this be considered out of line, when, in fact, the children 
are sentenced to life without parole, in trying to live with what 
was inflicted upon them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to perform our duty and to protect our children.  I 
ask this House for its support of Bill C-245.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to be able to speak 
today to the bill sponsored by the member for Oxford dealing with 
penalties for sexual offences involving children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for Bill C-245.  I support the amendment he 
is making to the Criminal Code.  I wish that more members from 
his side of the House would also recognize that creating stiffer 
penalties would go a long way to curbing crime in Canada, 
especially of this heinous type. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members came to Ottawa in 1993 with a commitment to the 
Canadian people to reform Parliament. Included in those reforms 
was the promise to be supportive whenever possible of the 
people's agenda over party manoeuvres.  We promised not to oppose 
government legislation or private members' bills simply for the 
sake of opposition.  If a bill enhances public safety we will 
support it.  We therefore support the member for Oxford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-245 if passed by this House will change the definition of 
publication in the case of child pornography to cover 
transmission by electronic mail or posting the material on the 
Internet or any other electronic net.  This amendment to the 
Criminal Code is simply in keeping with the advances of the 
technology and the prevalence of child pornography on the 
Internet today.  I applaud the hon. member's effort in this 
regard.  However, this amendment should and could have been 
enacted by the government.  However, there is a pattern.  The 
government is weak.  When action is needed there is a pattern of 
Liberal government weakness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this government is introducing legislation which deals 
with technology and privacy it has neglected to make the 
necessary Criminal Code amendments to protect our children from 
the perverts who surf the net.  It is not surprising given the 
low priority this government places on the protection of society 
and in particular our children.  We have discovered sex slavery 
in Canada and sadly we have juvenile prostitution in every major 
city.  The government has done little while at the same time 
shuts down private members' bills that deal with these things. 
The government is weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite claiming in June, 1997 that revamping the Young 
Offenders Act was a priority, the justice minister has failed to 
bring one single amendment.  The minister's failure in this 
regard has put our children who are most often the victims of 
crime at needless risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also support the increase in the maximum penalty for 
forcible confinement from 10 to 14 years in the case of a parent 
or a ward who confines a child and thereby harms the child's 
physical or mental health.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party fully supports the penalty of imprisonment for 
life with no parole eligibility for 25 years for anyone found 
guilty of sexually assaulting a child under 8 or a child under 14 
who is under the offender's trust or authority or who is 
dependent on the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do, however, question the age of eight years.  In 1994 the 
Liberal government refused to amend the Young Offenders Act to 
include 10 and 11 year olds, claiming they were much too young to 
be held accountable for their criminal behaviour.  I therefore 
have to wonder why the hon. member for Oxford has not at least 
included 10 and 11 year olds.  I would recommend including 
children up to the age of at least 13, in recognition of the 
vulnerability of children within this tender age group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find it questionable that the member for Oxford has 
proposed what can only be considered a heavy penalty, one which 
would not be supported by a majority of his own 1700 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 a majority of Liberal members voted against eliminating 
the faint hope clause for murderers.  I question why this member 
and his Liberal colleagues would ever agree to put a child 
molester behind bars for a minimum of 25 years when they have 
repeatedly failed to keep murderers locked away for at least the 
25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that it was the Liberal Party which gave us 
the faint hope clause, claiming some hope must be given to first 
degree murderers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clifford Olson raped and killed 11 innocent children and after 
serving only 15 years of his life sentence this sadistic killer 
took full advantage of the Liberal made faint hope clause and 
applied for early release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that the former justice minister is directly 
responsible for Olson's full press court.  The former justice 
minister failed to bring in Bill C-45 in time to prevent Olson 
from once again terrorizing these victims' families.  There was 
plenty of warning.  There was no excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and many of my colleagues were there the day Olson, to the 
horror of the nation, was once again terrorizing his victims' 
families.  I and many of my colleagues were there, at court, the 
very day Olson, to the horror of the nation, was once again 
granted the absurd privilege of making a mockery of our justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week when representatives of the Canadian Police 
Association were in Ottawa they left a message for the Liberal 
government.  Topping their list was the elimination of the faint 
hope clause.  Perhaps finally the justice minister will see to it 
to repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code and keep murderers 
behind bars where they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other areas which require attention.  To 
date the justice minister has done little or nothing with regard 
to enhancing public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentences for violent offenders must be eliminated. 
How many more rapists must walk free before the justice minister 
amends specifically her predecessor's flawed section of the 
Criminal Code? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to one significant omission in Bill C-245. It does not 
amend the Young Offenders Act.  Therefore, anyone under the age 
of 18 who sexually assaults a child will not be sentenced to life 
imprisonment.  The maximum sentence they will receive under the 
YOA is three years, plus a possible two years of additional 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adolescent males commit approximately 20% of sexual assaults 
against teens and adults, and between 30% to 50% of such assaults 
against children.  According to the forum on correctional 
research, January 1995, sexual assaults committed by youth are as 
serious as those committed by adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without changes to the YOA the maximum penalty a youth can 
receive for raping or molesting a child will remain three years, 
with an additional optional two years.  If the young offender is 
released into the community no one will know because of the 
privacy provisions of the YOA which do not allow for the 
publishing of young offenders' names, including young rapists.  I 
mentioned that today in my question to the justice minister and 
received a very unsatisfactory answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jason Gamache was a sex offender, but this fact was not made 
known to his neighbours.  An unsuspecting mother allowed Mr. 
Gamache to babysit her young daughter.  Her daughter was raped 
and killed by Gamache.  The mistakes in the provincial 
administration of this case were all started by the secrecy 
provisions of the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 26 my colleague from Crowfoot introduced a private 
member's bill to amend the YOA.  Unlike the Liberal justice 
minister, the member for Crowfoot worked all summer on Bill C-210 
and at the first opportunity introduced his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party have introduced many private members' 
bills on the Young Offenders Act.  Where are the minister's? 
Amending the YOA is a priority for the Reform Party, as it is for 
many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June, 1997 the justice minister said that the YOA was a 
priority, and yet we have seen nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the justice committee travelled throughout the 
country, spending close to half a million dollars reviewing the 
act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April, 1997 the committee tabled a report containing a number 
of recommendations for amending the YOA and the Reform Party 
produced a minority report which was rejected by the committee 
because it was too comprehensive.  We ensured that our report was 
given to all the provincial attorneys general, many of whom have 
been requesting similar changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the former justice minister mandated the committee to 
review the Young Offenders Act upon the 10th anniversary of its 
enactment, the Reform Party has questioned the commitment of the 
justice minister and the Liberal dominated justice committee to 
effectively change this act which is now 14 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government failed during its first three and a half year 
mandate to improve public safety and it is failing again.  This 
justice minister has done very little.  It has been a very weak 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Oxford can count on Reform's support but, 
interestingly, he cannot count on the support of his bleeding 
heart pals who refuse to keep murderers locked up for at least 25 
years.  By the process of this bill today, we can see that the 
justice agenda of average Canadians is reflected in the Reform 
Party position and not the bureaucratic, top down agenda of the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conclusion is obvious. If Canadians want a good justice 
system they need to elect a Reform Party government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, 
private member's bill C-245 covers three extremely important 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first has to do with the transmission of child pornography 
through the Internet or electronic mail.  The second has to do with 
sexual assault on a child, and the third has to do with the 
confinement of a child by a parent or ward.   These are three 
extremely important points.  As the member who introduced the bill 
said earlier, these are three things that cannot be tolerated in a 
free and democratic society such as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to examine the bill clause by clause, because there 
are only three of them. 
The first clause deals with the definition of publication per se. 
The issue raised by the first clause of the bill is a very special 
one.  What is the role of the lawmaker with respect to cyberspace? 
Although clause 1 of the bill looks specifically at the publication 
of child pornography, it raises the more general issue of 
governments' responsibility with respect to management of the 
Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of us has his or her own perception of cyberspace.  Some 
people positively worship the Internet.  Internet surfers consider 
this virtual space to be one of the great achievements of the 20th 
century.  Others fear the Internet.  This electronic network seems 
to interfere with the respect of certain principles our community 
holds dear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Internet is seen as a source of all knowledge, it is 
also the favourite realm of individuals with a warped view of the 
world, who spend their time using it to distribute illegal 
material.  Child pornography is a perfect example.  The following 
question therefore arises:  What can we as lawmakers do to stop 
this unhealthy use of the Internet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether to limit the distribution of hate propaganda, 
discriminatory material or child pornography, various initiatives 
have already been suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, the suppression of child pornography 
focuses on protecting the children that are its subjects.  In 
Canada, while not dealing specifically with publication on the 
Internet, section 163(1) of the Criminal Code defines child 
pornography in broader terms. 
Child pornography is condemned not just because of its direct 
impact on the young people who are its subjects, but also in order 
to eliminate its impact on pedophiles and various criminals of this 
sort who use these media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, as the Université de Montréal authors of a work 
entitled <I>Droit du cyberespace</I> pointed out, the regulation of 
violence on information highways must be consistent with the 
imperatives of freedom of expression.  Concerns about the 
circulation of violent material arise primarily from the fear that 
exposure to this kind of material trivializes the real phenomenon 
of violence or encourages people to resort to violence.  To this 
general concern is naturally added the concern to protect children.

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Striking a balance between freedom of expression and a 
justified control of material harmful to society is not easy.  For 
example, in 1996, there was an American bill, the Decency Act, 
which was intended to criminalize the distribution of pornographic 
material, but it was declared unconstitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering how difficult it is to establish the identity of 
a user, the effect of that legislation was to restrict the freedom 
of expression of the distributors on the one hand, but also the 
right of adult users to receive information on the other hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause does not solve all of the problems relating to use 
of the Internet, and others, but it does engage a debate, which 
makes us reflect as lawmakers.  The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of 
this more thorough analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 addresses sexual assault against children.  There is 
most certainly nothing more abhorrent than sex crimes involving 
children.  Children are the incarnation of everything that is most 
fragile in our society.  When someone decides to sully the 
innocence of our young people, society as a whole suffers. 
Children are arguably our most precious resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How, then, can such acts not be vigorously denounced?  How can 
we understand someone stooping so low as to commit such monstrous 
acts?  A lawmaker cannot remain indifferent to offences of this 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of the hon. member for Oxford is intended to offer 
some elements of a response to these questions. 
Clause 2 of the bill provides for special sentencing of those found 
guilty of sexually assaulting children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would add to section 271 of the Criminal Code, which 
pertains to sexual offences, and include in it a special regime for 
cases when children are the victims.  The sentence proposed is 
harsh: imprisonment for life.  This sentence is sought when the 
crime is particularly heinous, but that is what he are dealing with 
in cases of sexual assault of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, while the bill is severe, the member proposes 
certain application criteria that would require the courts to 
evaluate certain characteristics of the victim.  Clause 2 thus 
provides that imprisonment for life would apply when the child 
involved is under the age of eight years or under the age of 
fourteen years and in the trust of or dependent on the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus the terms provided in section 271(1.1)<I>b)</I> would provide a 
defence for the accused if it could be proven that the victim aged 
between 8 and 14 years was not in a in the trust of, under the 
authority of, or in a relationship of dependency on, the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be pointed out that the Criminal Code currently 
provides a defence that the offender charged under section 271 
could use. 
Section 150(1) of the Criminal Code provides that a person accused 
under section 271 may use consent as a defence, if the victim is 
between 12 and 14 and the aggressor is all of the following: aged 
12 or older but less than 16; less then two years older than the 
victim and not someone with whom the victim is in a relationship of 
dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the bill makes no mention of section 
150(1).  While this silence does not affect the merits of the bill, 
that is, the application of a more severe sentence in the case of 
the sexual assault of children, the fact that it does not mention 
the terms of section 150(1) would have the effect of proposing two 
different defences for a single offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we agree with the content, with the objective of 
clause 2, but I believe it lacks some refinement to really achieve 
the intended objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 3 deals with the confinement of a child or ward.  It 
proposes an addition to section 279 of the Criminal Code to 
introduce more severe sentences when the offence of confinement or 
imprisonment involves children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like sexual assault, this offence is most intolerable, since 
it takes advantage of children's weakness.  Once again, this 
situation must be denounced and the bill seems to meet that need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, this private member's bill addresses three 
extremely important points, since situations or acts involving 
children are involved. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1935"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT108"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as always, we in the Bloc Quebecois do not 
necessarily always have a visceral reaction in such cases.  I 
believe that an analysis that is as cold and objective as possible 
of these clauses is necessary if we are to attain the objective of 
amending the Criminal Code in such a way as to truly have the 
desired impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal is to protect our young people, the most important 
thing in our country.  I do not believe anyone in this House could 
be against this bill.  I do, however, think that it merits more 
study in order to improve its clauses and its approaches to the 
objective sought.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in this important debate on Bill C-245.  Let me 
first say how much I appreciate my colleague from Oxford for 
bringing the bill forward.  It is very timely and very 
appropriate.  It provides members of Parliament with the 
opportunity to speak out on behalf of those who are unable to 
speak for themselves.  I refer particularly to the children of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last number of years I spent a great deal of time with 
friends and associates who have worked in the Kamloops Sexual 
Assault Centre.  I have received countless letters from 
constituents concerned about the issue of child abuse, sexual 
predation upon children and other related issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my time before I became a member of Parliament I was a 
teacher for 15 years.  I knew of countless cases of young people 
whose lives had been destroyed irreparably because of some 
unscrupulous person involving them in unwanted sexual acts at a 
very young age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my friends are guidance counsellors and family 
counsellors of one kind or another.  Many are in the field of 
rehabilitation in terms of sexual assault victims as well as 
those accused and found guilty of sexual assault.  The stories 
they tell can be summarized in a word and that is devastation. 
Young people who are forced to experience this type of activity 
at a young age essentially have their lives destroyed in most 
cases forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but mention many of my friends, particularly those 
in the Shuswap First Nation in Kamloops, who over the years 
brought forward the stories of their experiences in so-called 
Indian residential schools which, I am loathe to say, were 
sponsored by various religious orders.  They tell of the physical 
abuse they experienced and in particular sexual abuse that not 
only destroyed their lives in many ways but destroyed the lives 
of their children as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen generation after generation of people whose lives 
and the lives of their children and perhaps their grandchildren 
have been affected in a negative way because of being involved in 
some sexual predation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Oxford brought forth Bill C-245, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code regarding penalties for sexual offences 
involved children.  I applaud him for this initiative.  I assume 
all members of Parliament, when they have a chance to vote on it, 
will vote in support of the bill.  I know I speak for myself and 
for colleagues to whom I have talked about the bill when I say we 
endorse it enthusiastically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply say that the reason there is so much enthusiasm in 
support of this initiative is that many members of Parliament 
find that sentences for crimes against children are inadequate in 
today's court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countless times people have said to me that we have a legal 
system but we do not have a justice system, that it lacks a sense 
of justice.  Therefore, the bill which will increase the maximum 
sentence for sexual assault on a child to life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole for 25 years is supportable. 
As well, the sentence for forcible confinement of a child in the 
bill is increased to 14 years from the present 10 years. 
The definition of child pornography would now extend to any 
information or reproduction transmitted by electronic means.

<A HREF="#LINKT109"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next few moments I want to say why I support the bill so 
strongly.  The current maximum sentence for sexual assault, as I 
said, is 10 years.  According to information obtained through the 
adult criminal court survey, the average sentence being given for 
sexual assault is less than 1,287 days, less than four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are sexual assaults with a weapon.  These are sexual 
assaults resulting in aggravated assault.  These are horrendous 
acts perpetrated against a person, in this case against children. 
It is difficult to imagine a more unscrupulous, heinous type of 
individual than one who would participate in these types of acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because there is no real distinction between sexual assault on 
the child and other charges of sexual assault, the member shared 
with the House the average sentence for sexual touching of a 
child under 14.  This is a charge in which sexual intent must be 
proven, I might add.   The average sentence imposed by the courts 
is 288 days, less than one full year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People involved in a direct sexual way with the intent of having 
a sexual act with a child, if found guilty, may receive a penalty 
to serve time in prison of less than a year.  What kind of signal 
does that send to people who have destroyed some young child's 
life?  Having a few days in jail certainly does not deter one, 
but it sends a signal that we as a society essentially or 
relatively condone this type of behaviour.  As a society we ought 
not to have any tolerance at all regarding violence toward 
people.  We should not have any tolerance at all involving adults 
perpetrating sexual activity with a young child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-seven per cent of the accused in solved violent 
incidents involving children under 12 years of age have had some 
kind of relationship with the victim.  In 31 per cent of these 
cases the accused was a member of the victim's immediate family. 
This is the kind of information that does not make one feel 
terribly comfortable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-245 speaks directly to sexual assault on a child.  It 
amends section 271 of the Criminal Code by increasing the maximum 
sentence to imprisonment for life with no parole eligibility for 
25 years, if guilty of sexual assault on a child under 8 years of 
age or a child under 14 years of age who is under the offender's 
trust or authority or dependent on the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as an aside at this point, I might add that it is a rare 
case when a serious pedophile or someone who has been involved 
with aggressive sexual behaviour with a child is rehabilitated. I 
know there are programs that people attend.  I know there are 
courses that people are required to attend when serving prison 
terms for these types of offences, but I think the evidence would 
suggest that it is a rarity for someone to modify their behaviour 
sufficiently to ensure that type of behaviour will not be 
repeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I think locking these people up, these sexual 
predators of children, makes sense in terms of protecting society 
from this type of behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear at this point that the sentence being 
advocated in Bill C-245 is the same sentence as that for first 
degree murder.  It was the mover's suggestion that many of his 
constituents felt that in the very worst cases of child sexual 
assault the sentence should be equal to that of murder, the 
reason being that these assaults have in many ways murdered the 
children's soul, the child's self-esteem and the child's mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just need to recall the abuse of young hockey players that 
occurred in the Toronto stadium, Maple Leaf Gardens.  One of the 
victims ended up committing suicide as a way of dealing with his 
trauma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on, but I will not take up valuable time 
because I know other of my colleagues want to speak to this 
important issue. 
I refer particularly to the section of the bill that suggests we 
should increase the maximum penalty for forcible confinement from 
10 to 14 years in the case of a parent or ward who confines a 
child and thereby harms the child's physical or mental health. 
My colleague pointed out the case where the individual locked his 
three sons in wire cages in a dark basement.

<A HREF="#LINKT110"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all recall these kinds of examples we see revealed in the 
courts from time to time where parents or those responsible for 
young children for whatever peculiar horrible set of reasons 
decide to confine children in unimaginable circumstances.  It is 
fair to say that anybody who is perpetuating that type of 
activity should be punished.  More important, society needs to be 
protected from these kinds of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Oxford for introducing this bill.  We 
have to take steps to keep child pornography off the electronic 
mail and the Internet.  He can count on my support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK315"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</b> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of the bill put 
forward by the hon. member for Oxford.  I support his initiative 
in this regard.  It is indeed a pleasure for me to speak on this 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a number of speakers have already mentioned, if adopted, this 
bill would essentially accomplish three things.  In the worst 
cases of sexual assault involving children, the sentence imposed 
on the individual would be given the same emphasis, the same 
range of sentence for the judge who would be handing down that 
sentence.  That range would include a sentence of up to 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum sentence of imprisonment for life with no parole 
eligibility for 25 years would accurately reflect society's 
disdain for the serious types of sexual assaults that sadly do 
occur in our society.  It would allow society to feel protected 
in the sense that it would have the assurance that a judge would 
have that at his or her discretion. If adopted, the act would 
create an increase in the maximum penalty for forcible 
confinement from 10 to 14 years in the case of a parent or ward 
who confines a child and thereby harms the child's physical or 
mental health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to consider the deterrent effect that this 
increased range of sentence has when looking at cases such as 
this.  In this scenario, a judge's discretion should be expanded 
to allow for that.  Sadly, in my career as a crown prosecutor, I 
encountered a number of cases where if the maximum sentence had 
been expanded, if the judge had that range, perhaps higher 
sentences would have been handed down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing this piece of legislation would accomplish is 
with respect to the Internet and the use of the Internet as a 
means of transmitting child pornography.  The bill would make 
this a prohibited act under section 163.1.  It would give 
assurances that the definition of publication in the case of 
child pornography would cover transmissions via electronic mail 
or posting of material on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a rapidly changing ability to transmit and the use of 
technology, it is with some sad reflection that we are faced with 
the fact that there are those in society who will use this mode 
of communication for such a sick and twisted purpose.  This bill 
puts in place something in the Criminal Code that allows us to 
respond and to respond with force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This private member's bill has received the support of both the 
Canadian Police Association and the Canadian Association of 
Chiefs of Police.  They have said:  “Sentencing reform for 
sexual offences against children is, in our view, an important 
improvement and required”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the remarks we have heard in this Chamber and the 
remarks from many groups, including victims advocate groups, 
parental groups and society in general would certainly echo those 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to have worked in the justice system with many 
dedicated men and women whom I have spoken to in relation to this 
legislation. 
I voice their support of it through my comments today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to individuals in Antigonish—Guysborough who have 
worked in the justice system, Corporal MacGenny, Sergeant MacNeil 
and many others who are on the front lines.  They are the thin 
blue line of the police who deal with these laws.  I am 
encouraged to see that initiatives are taken to bring forward 
very positive changes to our Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to say that the Progressive Conservative Party 
of Canada equally embraces and encourages these initiatives taken 
by the hon. member for Oxford.  It is indeed time to give 
children the protection that they need.  It is time that we as 
legislators send a very serious message to the courts stating 
that sexual offenders deserve tougher sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As victims of child sexual offences have asked many times, those 
victims who are struggling with painful stories, why does an 
individual who has perpetrated such a heinous act receive a light 
sentence and probation at times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, to use the analogy that has been made in this House, the 
child is forced into a life sentence of coping and of dealing 
with this trauma.  That life of painful memories and the damage 
that results cannot be erased and will never be erased because of 
the ensuing court case and the ensuing cases.  However, I would 
suggest that it does, in some small measure, restore some dignity 
and faith in the system and its ability to react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when victims' rights should be at the centre of the 
changes to our criminal justice system, this bill provides 
victims in question the comfort of having offenders at least 
sentenced or at least the possibility that they can be sentenced 
to a real significant period of incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics have consistently shown that sexual offenders are not 
getting the length of incarceration that they deserve.  There 
have been a number of references to those sentences.  The ones 
that jumped out at me are based on the average prison sentences 
in 1993 and 1994 when statistics showed that sexual assault 
levels two and three, the more serious and high end assaults, get 
an average of 3.5 years incarceration.  Again one has to ask if 
society is being sufficiently protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average sentence for sexual touching of a child under the 
age of 14 is less than one year of incarceration.  One questions 
the deterrent effect but one also has to question the 
rehabilitative aspect of a sentence of such short duration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, let us remind ourselves that children under the 
age of 12 account for 16% of the population yet account for 28% 
of the victimization.  I think that we as a society and as 
legislators must remind ourselves consistently that we have an 
obligation and responsibility to protect those most in need and 
those most vulnerable.  That can be done through positive changes 
to our Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers that I have referred to and others that have been 
referred to in this debate are incredible and do raise very 
important and serious questions as to what we as members of this 
House do in response and do we in fact do enough to protect those 
who are most vulnerable.  Sadly, women and children in this 
country are the ones who are most often at the receiving end of 
victimization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very least we can do is take up the challenge, take these 
initiatives and see them through to fruition in a timely fashion. 
These changes to the Criminal Code are presented and put forward 
in a very common sense approach.  It does not take a great deal 
of intellectual gymnastics to figure out what the intent of these 
changes are.  Quite simply, I support them wholeheartedly.  I 
really feel that sexual offences are not and should not be 
considered minor offences.  Indeed, these short sentences somehow 
diminish the seriousness of the effect they have on victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting this bill, we are going to tell the courts and 
those in the criminal justice system that we do consider these to 
be important changes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By supporting the bill, we are also sending a very serious and 
strong message to perpetrators that this type of behaviour will 
not be tolerated and giving the judges an important tool to use 
in combating these types of human indiscretions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government improvements and general improvements to the Criminal 
Code transcend partisan politics as has been exhibited by the 
comments in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me end by referring to what a young mother has said to me 
about a young boy who was a victim of a sexual assault. She said 
“In requesting higher sentences for sexual offenders, I ask how 
can this be considered out of line when in fact the children are 
sentenced to life without parole in trying to live with what was 
inflicted on them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heinous crimes are happening right now as we make these remarks. 
It is up to us to take up that challenge.  I support this bill 
fully and I am sure those in the House will do likewise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK316"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my 
colleagues on the other side of the House who have spoken on Bill 
C-245 for their support and their thoughtful input on my private 
member's bill which will bring about improvements hopefully in 
our whole justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member for New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby for reminding us that the Young 
Offenders Act needs some improvement and changes.  I know our 
government will be bringing those forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member for Berthier—Montcalm who talked 
about the balancing of the freedom of expression in the 
protection of our children with respect to the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member for Kamloops who seconded my private 
member's bill and who pointed out from his experience as a 
teacher that this was something he had some first-hand knowledge 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to thank the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who in his other life was a crown 
prosecutor and whom I feel made the point very clearly that major 
offences which incur short sentences are not really what we are 
looking for in Canada which is of course exactly what my bill is 
trying to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my address earlier I mentioned how I considered the 
introduction of the bill to be my duty as a member of Parliament 
for Oxford.  <I>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</I> defines duty as 
a moral or legal obligation which one is bound or ought to do.  I 
can assure hon. members I do feel a moral obligation to protect 
our children from abuse.  This bill will help provide this 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of Parliament I feel a legal obligation to introduce 
legislation that responds to a need within our society.  My 
colleagues have made that quite clear in the last hour we have 
listened to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cases I have laid out for hon. members show why I feel there 
is a need within our society for this legislation.  If any 
members doubt me, they need only read of Martin Kruze or any 
other victim of abuse and ask themselves if the sentences being 
meted out are adequate.  If so, please tell me why 44% of those 
convicted of sexual touching of a child under 14 received only 
probation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we have a duty here today to provide protection 
for our children from those who prey on them.  As part of this 
duty I ask the House for unanimous consent to introduce a motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, 
on December 1, I put a very important question to the Minister of 
International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The asbestos region is facing hard times with chrysotile 
asbestos.  Great Britain has announced its intention to ban this 
asbestos following in the steps of France and seven other European 
countries.  Since March 1997, I have been calling on the Prime 
Minister to take vigorous action with France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He, through his Minister of International Trade, preferred to 
take route of diplomatic negotiations.  They led nowhere.  What the 
asbestos industry needs is vigorous action before the WTO against 
France to avoid the domino effect that could result from other 
countries like Great Britain banning chrysotile asbestos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Canada could claim financial compensation from 
France as the result of its unilateral action.  Instead of dozing 
off with diplomacy in the style of Jacques Roy, the government must 
listen to the people in the industry and defend us just as 
vigorously as it defended durum wheat and the Sherritt company of 
Toronto against the United States and the Helms-Burton legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the asbestos region, Thetford Mines to be specific, the 
consensus is to demand the federal government take legal action 
before the WTO. 
Led by the Government of Quebec, asbestos producers, LAB 
Chrysotile, with Jean Dupéré, and Johns Manville with Bernard 
Coulombe; the three unions, FTQ, CNTU and CSD; the members for 
Québec, Vallières and Lefebvre, under the banner of the Liberal 
Party of Quebec; the RCM, with its chairman Fernand Huot; the 
Thetford Chamber of Commerce; all are unanimously calling on the 
federal government to file a complaint with the WTO, but the 
federal government is refusing to take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for the asbestos region, the response I would 
have liked to hear from the Minister for International Trade, and 
it is undoubtedly a response dated December 2, will be read this 
evening by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice 
and the Attorney General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the response, which undoubtedly dates back to 
December 2, should have been modified to fit today's circumstances, 
because almost four months have passed since that time, but for 
lack of anything better, I will naturally content myself with this 
late response. 
I hope it will provide some hope for producers and especially for 
workers in our asbestos mines.
