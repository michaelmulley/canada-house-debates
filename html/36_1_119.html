</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Ukrainian community in my riding of Parkdale—High 
Park and Ukrainians worldwide are commemorating the 65th 
anniversary of the 1932-33 famine in the Ukraine.  This famine is 
considered to be the largest famine of the 20th century and one 
in which some seven million Ukrainians perished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1932, under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union 
dramatically increased its grain procurement.  Wheat grown on 
Ukrainian farms was shipped to Russia and as a result many 
Ukrainians were unable to feed themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soviet leaders, backed by the military and secret police units, 
seized all food in an attempt to break the spirit of 
independent-minded Ukrainians.  Large parts of the Ukraine were 
blockaded, with no food being allowed in and no one being allowed 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1980s did 
information on this terrible human tragedy come to the world's 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join today with members of the Ukrainian community and all 
Canadians in recognizing and remembering this man-made famine 
that killed seven million Ukrainians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the situation on the Pacheedaht Reserve in my riding is 
desperate.  Band members have begged for over a year for the 
department of Indian affairs to investigate allegations of the 
gross misappropriations of funds and lack of accountability.  For 
example:  $1.8 million from Parks Canada, misappropriated; $1.3 
million for treaty negotiations, misappropriated; $47,000 for 
suicide prevention, misappropriated; septic fields draining into 
the water table; social assistance and pension fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response?  Go to the RCMP.  The RCMP, however, 
cannot investigate.  The result is that the Pacheedaht people are 
caught in a vicious cycle with deteriorating third world social 
conditions and nowhere to turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has tossed money at these aboriginal people 
without accountability.  The result is an abuse of the grassroots 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the minister to listen to the aboriginal people, do 
independent audits and help those grassroots people right now.

Abitibi will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the annexation 
of its territory to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until 1867, the Abitibi region was part of the Northwest 
Territories.  Negotiations were then initiated between the 
provinces and the federal government concerning disposition of 
the northern regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 13, 1898, the Canadian government gave a favourable 
response to the Quebec government's request, and the territories 
of Abitibi and Mistissini were annexed through legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter took 25 years to bring to a conclusion, and as a 
result, Quebec acquired an additional 168,749 square kilometers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This region, which is renowned for its mining and forestry 
activities, plays an important role in the economic history of 
Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My best wishes to all those who will be organizing activities 
throughout the summer to mark this important anniversary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canada is not the segregated United States of 
yesteryear when government officials at all levels conspired to 
defraud black Americans of their democratic and constitutional 
right to vote in any election, including school board elections. 
The segregationists used every trickery in the book to ensure 
that southern blacks could not get their names onto voters' 
lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections for the linguistic school boards are taking place 
right now in Quebec and thousands of English-speaking Quebeckers 
are being cheated out of their right to vote for the English 
school boards because of the Péquiste government's ill thought 
out voter registration process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all of my colleagues, including the Bloc MPs, to join 
their voices with mine in denouncing this election debacle and in 
calling on the Quebec government to ensure that all Quebeckers 
can cast their votes on June 14 in the elections of our 
linguistic school boards.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on May 8, a round table was held at York University in 
Toronto, focussing on the commercialization of Canadian 
education services.  The Minister for International Trade 
co-chaired this event.

exchanges between all suppliers of education and training in 
Canada as well as some partners on the international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Familiar as I am with what Canada has accomplished in education 
and with the huge potential for international exchange and 
co-operation in this area, I believe this initiative by the 
Minister for International Trade will stimulate the

commercialization of our expertise in education, both here and

the Ukraine, but the people were barricaded in.  The results

that ombudsman's investigators are exactly the same people who

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada agreed in Kyoto that greenhouse gas emissions reduction 
begins at home.  It begins by cleaning up our own act.  But today 
we have evidence that Canada is behind closed doors in Bonn 
promoting instead unlimited emissions trading, a massive loophole 
to escape responsibility for domestic emissions reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to Canada's Kyoto commitment?  Was it a sham? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Kyoto is taken very seriously by this 
government.  It was not a sham.  It was extremely important to 
Canada that we get mechanisms like trading of emissions, joint 
implementation, clean development mechanisms within the protocol 
of Kyoto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we reduce greenhouse gases at $20 a tonne if we can do 
so at $2 a tonne?  That is why we are pursuing this avenue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, why 
would we sign on to an agreement that we have no intentions of 
honouring?  What Canadians need is not loopholes but leadership 
on climate change.  That is what the environment commissioner is 
looking for as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government telling Canadians one thing and saying 
something completely different behind closed doors in Bonn?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment,

ridiculous.  This government is totally committed to our Kyoto 
protocol commitment and we will reduce by minus 6%.  Trading of 
emissions is an important way not only for Canada to achieve its 
goals but for other nations around the world as well.  We are 
showing leadership on this file.

all the documents referred to in that report were before Mr. 
Justice Krever.  He looked into all of the facts and, in fact, 
they were referred to in his report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report this morning on the radio was factually wrong in 
important respects.  I encourage the member to look at the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was alleged that there was no action taken until 1993.  In 
fact, Health Canada issued a directive in 1991.  It said this 
morning that Health Canada awaited a U.S. study.  That is false. 
Health Canada instructed manufacturers to start screening plasma 
a full two years before the publication of the U.S. report.  The 
Health Canada directive was issued five months before the FDA 
acted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts were— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Charlotte. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is confusing the issue.  What we are talking about is 
the responsibility of Health Canada.  At the end of the day, the 
safety for Canada's blood supply stops at his doorstep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister considering compensating those victims?  His 
facts, unfortunately, disagree with what the record actually 
states.  Again, will he consider compensating those victims 
outside of the previously announced package for 1986 to 1990? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the whole issue of compensation is before a working group with 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I want the member to acknowledge that it is very important 
to get the facts right.  The fact was improperly reported this 
morning.  Health Canada issued a directive in 1991.  We did not 
wait for the Americans.  We were ahead of the FDA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, we have accepted the Krever recommendations on 
regulation.  We are going to spend more money to put better 
regulation in place and make sure that through the Blood Safety 
Council we have the highest standards of safety for all Canadians 
because that for us is the bottom line. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the health 
minister says the facts were wrong in this report.  The U.S. made 
it illegal to use hep C tainted blood in September 1991.  I have 
the directive from the health protection branch here.  It was in 
fact issued November 15, 1991, and it said “effective January 1, 
1993, you cannot use the blood”.  The facts are straightforward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did we continue to use dirty blood for that period of time? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as I have said, all of these facts and all of these documents 
were before Krever.  They were all gone into in detail and 
referred to in Volume 2 of his report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the question is that the practice at Health Canada 
at the time, 1990-1991, reflected the scientific knowledge and 
understanding of that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 a directive was issued in keeping with the usual 
practice to get manufacturers to test plasma.  That is what we 
did.  We did it ahead of the Americans and in advance of the 
publication of many American reports. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be 
happy to table these documents in the House because it was 
illegal in the U.S. in September 1991 and it was not illegal in 
Canada until January 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question stands.  Why did Canadian regulators, who were 
warned outside Canada and inside Canada, continue to use dirty 
blood? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I refer the member to Volume 2 of the Krever report, page 698 and 
following, in which Mr. Justice Krever goes through this whole 
history, examines all of the facts and puts them into the context 
of the scientific knowledge of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to stress is that this government has accepted the 
recommendations of Krever in relation to regulation.  We have 
established the Blood Safety Council.  We are going to have the 
highest standards of regulation in the world because for this 
government safety is the bottom line.

I have responded on the factual matters to other members of the

policy of the government of the day was in relation to such 
tests, perhaps she ought to take it up with the party then in 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as we are concerned we have adopted all the 
recommendations of Mr. Justice Krever.  Seventeen of his 50 were 
in relation to regulation and safety.  We have adopted them. We 
have every intention of putting them into effect, spending the

the safest blood supply system in the world for the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is a process in place between governments to look at all 
the options for dealing with hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this session of parliament there is a trend that has 
emerged from the NDP. It is to make suggestions on a daily and

weeks ago it was satellites and toys that were going to endanger 
the health of children and that proved to be wrong.  Then there 
was an international conspiracy in relation to drug testing which 
proved to be wrong.  Two weeks ago it was albumin that was a 
threat to health and that proved to be wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
unemployed Canadians across the country are continuing to suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government introduced EI reforms in 1996, approximately 
40% of the unemployed did not qualify for EI. Today as a result 
of that reform nearly 72% of the unemployed are on welfare 
because they no longer qualify for EI assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister tell the House that the act must be 
restructured to ensure Canadians that when they need EI 
assistance EI will be there for them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all the number of 
people on welfare in Canada is the lowest that it has been in 
five years because of the performing economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the member can look at his own province of New 
Brunswick.  He will find that 80% of people in New Brunswick are 
covered by the employment insurance system and not the number 
that he mentioned this afternoon in the House for his own 
province. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there certainly seems to be confusion between Ottawa and the 
ridings. All local HRDC offices are of the opinion that the 
reforms are not effective. It is the minister's position to sit 
back and accept the status quo rather than to examine the 
shortcomings of his department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 employment insurance monitoring assessment report 
failed to show what we already know, that the EI system is not 
working properly. Will the minister tell the House today that he 
will revamp the EI act and give Canadians the assistance they 
need when they need it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been very clear on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are well aware that after 25 years we have made the most 
important reform of the employment insurance system to overhaul 
it, update it and modernize it to better serve Canadians with the 
new conditions in the labour market.  We will have to monitor it 
very closely. We are well aware of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reason that I tabled in the House last January the 
first report of the impact of our EI reforms on Canadians and the 
unemployed.  We will do it every year to make sure that the 
impact of our reforms serves Canadians well.

Abiola who is now coming up to his fifth year in prison. This 
would be a wonderful step for Nigeria and for the entire world.

Her Secretary of State for Parks has been working directly with 
the mayor and the council has been involved in the process right 
from the word go.  Yet without even knowing the results, without 
even having a bylaw, the minister has said there is no way she

the sale of nuclear Candu reactors to Turkey.  They also state 
that these reactors will be placed in a seismic area that is more 
than eight on the Richter scale and which could foresee leaks and 
will affect the neighbouring countries of Cyprus, Israel, Syria, 
Lebanon and Armenia.  They also state that Turkey is a state that 
does not respect the human rights of its citizens, represses 
minorities and has used force and military aggression against its 
smaller neighbours and that giving nuclear technology to such a 
country will give it the ability to produce nuclear weapons of 
mass destruction and destabilize the whole region.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are concerned about the government's failure to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-25, an act to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to open the third reading debate on Bill C-25, an act to 
amend the National Defence Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is a comprehensive package of amendments that 
will strengthen the statutory framework governing the operations 
of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments proposed in the bill are the most extensive 
amendments to the National Defence Act since its enactment in 
1950.  Bill C-25 addresses a broad range of provisions in the 
National Defence Act.  However, it is primarily about military 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military justice system anchored in the code of service 
discipline is designed to promote morale, discipline and military 
efficiency.  One must appreciate that the Canadian forces are 
armed forces, trained for combat, requiring a distinct system of 
justice.  Discipline is at the heart of any efficient and 
effective armed force.  Whether in peace or in war it spells the 
difference between military success or failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government took action after a number of unfortunate 
incidents in recent years called into question the capacity of 
the military justice system to promote discipline, efficiency, 
high morale and justice.  We consulted with persons within the 
military, with the public at large and with distinguished 
Canadians with specialized knowledge.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  There have been consultations among 
the parties and I think you will find unanimous consent for the 
following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Order referring Bill S-2 to the Standing Committee on 
Transport be discharged and the said bill stand referred instead 
to a committee of the whole and that the said committee of the 
whole be deemed to have considered the said bill, reported 
progress thereon and granted leave to consider the bill at a 
future sitting. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would be happy to provide my consent to these matters 
provided that the government does not try to sneak them through 
when I absent myself from the House and provided that I am 
consulted in advance.  In order to discharge my responsibilities 
as a representative for the people of York South—Weston, it 
seems to me that before I give my consent to any motion for 
unanimous consent, at the very least I ought to know what I am 
voting on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the time being I am not prepared to give my consent, but if 
the government wishes to discuss this matter I would be happy to 
discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I take it, then, there is not 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government took 
action after a number of unfortunate incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments contained in Bill C-25, which has now had the 
benefit of second reading debate and the committee study, are the 
result of that process.  With the amendments the government has 
followed through on the defence minister's report to the Prime 
Minister in March of 1997 and the reports of the special advisory 
group chaired by Chief Justice Brian Dickson.  The government has 
also responded to the recommendations of the Somalia commission 
of inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank in particular my 
colleagues on the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs for their work in relation to Bill C-25. 
Twenty-one amendments, mostly of a technical nature, to improve 
the bill were approved by the committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual members who were already heavily burdened with other 
commitments made significant sacrifices to move the bill 
expeditiously through the committee.  Their efforts have improved 
the bill and will ultimately assist the men and women of the 
Canadian forces to carry out their missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence appeared before the committee, 
as did several witnesses with experience and expertise in the 
areas dealt with in Bill C-25.  Chief Justice Dickson, who 
chaired the special advisory group, and Lieutenant-General 
Belzile were witnesses.  They fully endorsed the amendments 
contained in the bill.  The advisory group was satisfied that the 
enactment of the bill into law would follow through on its 
recommendations and would assist the Canadian forces and its 
leadership in the maintenance of discipline and in the 
accomplishment of its task on behalf of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chief Justice 
Dickson and other witnesses for their appearances at the 
committee and for their contributions to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister advised the committee and this House during 
second reading, the amendments under Bill C-25 will modernize the 
military justice system.  The main thrusts of this bill are:  to 
clearly define roles and responsibilities for key participants in 
military justice; to provide greater structure and transparency 
in investigations and charging; to modernize powers and 
procedures for service tribunals; and to strengthen oversight and 
review.  Each of these components is a significant building block 
in the revitalization of military justice.   During committee 
study each of these components was scrutinized and a variety of 
issues were raised and debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to make the government's 
position clear on a number of issues that were raised and debated 
in full. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the second reading date and in committee there was 
discussion as to whether we should have one system of military 
justice for peace and another for periods of conflict.  It was 
also suggested that we might have one military justice system for 
inside Canada and another for abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces must be ready to deploy at any place in the 
world on a few hours' notice.  The armed forces need one system 
that is at once workable in Canada and abroad in time of conflict 
or peace.  Bill C-25 provides such a system.  That was the advice 
of the witnesses at committee and of our military leadership, and 
the government followed that advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also discussion during second reading and in committee 
as to the independence of the judge advocate general and the 
military judges, both key factors in the military justice system. 
It was argued by a number of members that the JAG was still too 
dependent on the chain of command and that military judges should 
be civilians, perhaps members of the federal court, as 
recommended by the Somalia commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The JAG is appointed by cabinet on the recommendation of the 
minister.  Bill C-25 has set out the duties the JAG must perform. 
It clearly states that he will be responsible to the minister for 
the performance of those duties.  We believe we have done what is 
necessary to ensure the independence of the JAG. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for military judges, Bill C-25 will provide for fixed 
appointments of five years.  Judges will be appointed by a 
governor in council, as are other federal judges in the civilian 
system.  They will have financial security and will be removable 
for cause only on the recommendation of an inquiry committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the supreme court and the special advisory group have 
endorsed the practice of appointing serving military officers 
with legal training to perform the function of military judges. 
We are convinced that all measures necessary to assure the 
independence of military judges have been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the system as it now stands, the minister of defence is 
also a key figure and may play an active role in the routine 
administration of individual cases under the code of service 
discipline.  Bill C-25 will remove the minister from such day to 
day administration.  This will avoid the perception of 
interference by the minister in individual cases, reduce 
potential conflicts of interest and enable the minister to focus 
on other duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investigation and charging process has been criticized for 
its lack of transparency and for the broad discretion it gives 
the commanding officers.  A commanding officer may make final 
decisions concerning not only minor offences, but also serious 
and sensitive offences that may implicate interests well beyond 
his or her individual unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 will remove from the commanding officer the power to 
dismiss charges and will provide a clear statutory basis for 
tailoring the jurisdiction of summary trials to those minor 
offences necessary for the maintenance of internal unit 
discipline. 
At the same time, the amendments will ensure the valuable and 
essential participation of the chain of command in the process.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee heard testimony from Colonel Mitchell, the Base 
Commander at CFB Petawawa, and Lieutenant-General Belzile, now 
retired and former commander of the army.  These witnesses 
underlined the necessity for commanders, who are responsible to 
the chain of command and to the people of Canada for the 
accomplishment of missions assigned by the government, to have 
the necessary tools to retain control over discipline in their 
units.  Both witnesses were clear in their testimony to the 
committee that the reduced powers and jurisdictions resulting 
from Bill C-25 would not prevent commanders from doing their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the summary trial process, the minister indicated during 
second reading debate and in committee that reform is already 
well under way.  Amendments to the Queen's regulations and orders 
enacted on November 30, 1997 restrict the jurisdiction of summary 
trials to more minor offences that affect internal unit 
discipline.  They also grant accused persons the right to elect 
trial by courts martial in all but the most minor cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One feature of the summary trial reform that was discussed at 
length in committee was the requirement to provide commanding 
officers with more comprehensive training in their military 
justice duties and responsibilities and to have them certified as 
qualified to conduct summary trials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made it clear to committee members that we are 
committed to certification training for the conduct of summary 
trials.  It is now under development and we hope that the 
training will get under way in the fall.  Once it is in place we 
will require officers to be certified as qualified prior to 
conducting summary trials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was concern in the committee regarding the requirement to 
be able to award the punishment of detention at summary trials 
and the committee sought direct testimony on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Justice Dickson told the committee that it was vital that 
the commanding officer retain the power of detention.  General 
Belzile also told the committee that it was essential for the 
commanding officer to retain the option of awarding detention at 
summary trials.  While retaining the punishment of detention at 
summary trials, it has nevertheless been reduced from 90 to 30 
days.  The automatic permanent reduction in rank to private has 
been eliminated.  The members will be paid as privates while 
serving detention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has thus strengthened compliance with the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and detention will remain 
an effective tool for commanding officers to use to maintain unit 
discipline and operational effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In debate and in committee there has been reference to a 
two-tiered justice system.  It is the goal of the government and 
this bill to promote equal treatment of Canadian forces members 
under the code of service discipline, regardless of their rank or 
sex.  Several initiatives have been taken to ensure members are 
treated equally, regardless of sex or rank, and to provide 
treatment that is comparable to that under the civil justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The code of service discipline procedures have been reviewed to 
ensure that any departures from civilian standards are militarily 
necessary and changes have been made where they are not.  For 
example, at courts martial military judges will now sentence 
those convicted of service offences.  In addition, punishment of 
hard labour and the death penalty will no longer be available as 
a result of changes under Bill C-25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to sexual equality, men and women in the Canadian 
forces must be able to contribute equally and work together in an 
atmosphere of trust.  The extension of jurisdiction by courts 
martial over sexual assault offences that occur in Canada serves 
this purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the independent national investigation 
service will ensure that such offences are promptly reported and 
fully investigated.  Permitting courts martial to try sexual 
assault offences committed in Canada will ensure that such 
offences are dealt with promptly and will demonstrate the 
government's commitment to treat sexual violence against members 
as a serious issue and to foster equality in the Canadian forces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disciplinary and general courts martial panels which previously 
were composed of officers only will now include warrant officers 
and above where a non-commissioned member is being tried.  This 
better reflects the spectrum of individuals responsible for 
command and discipline in the Canadian forces.  Mandatory 
accompanying punishments have been removed, eliminating a number 
of differences between ranks and the application of punishments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, non-commissioned members but not officers were 
automatically reduced in rank when sentenced to imprisonment. 
Under the bill the automatic reduction in rank will not be 
removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 also demonstrates the government's commitment to 
strengthened oversight and review mechanisms for the Canadian 
forces and the department.  In committee it was suggested that 
there be a requirement for oversight by the inspector general.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL DEFENCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK221">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-25, an 
act to amend the National Defence Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,  as the minister stated 
in committee, we put in place a threefold strategy to improve 
oversight and review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are strengthening our co-operation with existing 
oversight bodies such as the Office of the Auditor General, the 
Commissioner of Official Languages and the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission.  Second, we are establishing new and specialized 
oversight bodies such as an independent and external grievance 
board and the military police complaints commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister recently announced, Mr. André Marin, a former 
assistant crown attorney and past head of Ontario's special 
investigations unit, has been appointed the first ombudsman of 
the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces. The 
ombudsman will be an alternative to the chain of command and will 
be vital for providing advice to members and superiors as to the 
best way to go about resolving sources of conflict and grievances 
to the satisfaction of the members involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment of an ombudsman is a clear demonstration of the 
government's continuing commitment to strengthen the 
effectiveness and transparency of oversight mechanisms as well as 
to improve openness and fairness in the Canadian forces.  The 
ombudsman will complement the mechanisms already in place to 
oversee the DND and the Canadian forces, including the new 
grievance board and military police complaints commission that I 
have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our third step to improve oversight and review we will 
substantially increase annual and public reporting.  There will 
be annual reports under Bill C-25 by the JAG, the grievance board 
and the military police complaints commission.  In short, there 
would be nothing left for an inspector general.  As I said in 
committee all bases are covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the opportunity of this third reading 
debate to address the issue of the removal of the death penalty 
provisions from the National Defence Act.  The removal of the 
death penalty from the military is long overdue.  It was 
abolished some 22 years ago in the Criminal Code.  Since the 
enactment of the National Defence Act in 1950 no member of the 
Canadian forces has been executed for a service offence under the 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During World War II three soldiers were sentenced to death by 
courts martial but only one was executed for committing murder 
which was a civil offence and punishable at that time by death. 
The military advice of the chief of the defence staff is that the 
death penalty is not required under the code of service 
discipline for military purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The removal of the death penalty from the National Defence Act 
will bring Canada's military law in step with its civilian 
counterpart and with the approach taken by most western nations. 
For more serious offences involving traitorous acts the 
punishment of imprisonment with ineligibility for parole for 25 
years which is being submitted will provide a sufficient 
deterrent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No witnesses who appeared before the committee supported the 
death penalty.  In Chief Justice Dickson's testimony before 
SCONDVA he underlined the importance of bringing the punishment 
into line with the maximum punishment available under civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the National Defence Act are the most 
comprehensive in 50 years.  The government has delivered on the 
reports of the Minister of National Defence, the special advisory 
group and the Somalia commission.  Also under Bill C-25 the 
government has undertaken to review provisions of the act in five 
years time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in Bill C-25 in conjunction with the reforms 
already undertaken will modernize the military justice system 
while continuing to meet the military requirements for 
portability, speed and involvement in the chain of command in 
time of peace or conflict wherever the Canadian forces operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will ensure that our military remains combat 
capable and ready to respond to the challenges and missions the 
Canadian people demand of it, consistent with the values of 
Canadian society and our constitution.  Our country, with the 
dedication of the men and women of the Canadian forces, deserves 
no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly I urge all hon. members to support the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think you would find unanimous consent for me to share 
my 40 minute time slot with three of my colleagues thus breaking 
it into four 10 minute slots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca split his time into four 
10 minute slots? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for its 
generosity.  I will be sharing my time with the hon. members for 
Lakeland, Edmonton East and Compton—Stanstead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-25.  Men and women in 
military uniform have been for a long time serving our country 
with courage, distinction and in silence.  They have worked hard. 
They are busier now than they have ever been and have engaged in 
some 17 military operations since the Korean war.  Yet their 
morale is the lowest it has been in years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that so?  There are many reasons for it.  The government 
had an opportunity but it is disappointing that Bill C-25 did not 
get to the heart of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary East put forth numerous constructive 
suggestions to the government.  It did not adopt any of them. The 
suggestions would have gone a long way to making Bill C-25 the 
bill that it should be, one that restores accountability, 
transparency and honour to the military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to make the inspector general independent which would 
have given the IG more power to represent our people in uniform. 
On reforming the office of the judge advocate general we asked 
that the JAG be separated from the chain of command.  In other 
words it would enable the JAG to have more power to investigate 
problems within the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A situation is taking place in our military that is tearing out 
its guts.  Criminal activity including rape is somehow being 
allowed in the military.  It is turning a blind eye.  Activities 
done by a very small number of bad apples are tarnishing the vast 
majority of people in the military who are doing an outstanding 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those things are hardly being touched upon.  Yet petty rules and 
regulations are being enforced which are eliminating the esprit 
de corps that is necessary to be able to mould a fighting force 
that can be deployed around the world. The traditions of our 
military have been torn away.  The ability to wear badges of 
merit are forbidden within our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we have a situation where promotions are basically 
flatlined and stalled, where people are in the same positions for 
10 or more years?  Salaries have been stalled and flattened out 
for a long time, and we understand that.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have put forth constructive solutions that 
would not have cost any money.  I presented them to then General 
Dallaire who was responsible for the military in that capacity 
two years ago when he appeared before the defence committee.  We 
were promised that action would be taken on them and nothing has 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One constructive solution was the provision of a tax free 
accommodation assistance allowance for all military people. Local 
base commanders should have more power and more ability to manage 
their services.  Public works should be taken out of the hands of 
base commanders so that they would be able to operate in a more 
constructive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important also to look at our equipment.  It is true that 
the government has made some sensible purchases recently, but the 
military still labours with equipment that is hazardous, rickety 
and dangerous to the health of our service people.  Military 
personnel move around the country. They move from a small base 
like the one in Cold Lake, Alberta, to the Esquimalt base in my 
riding, the Marine Pacific Command.  They find their costs 
increase dramatically but there is no allowance for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people enter the military they are willing to move around 
to various parts of the country.  They know it is part of their 
job but they do not expect to be kicked in the teeth when they do 
it.  The situation is so bad military service people are going to 
soup kitchens.  They are moonlighting.  Men with pregnant wives 
are forced to work abroad to make a bit of extra money to put 
food on the table back home.  How can they serve our country and 
our international obligations properly when they are forced to do 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all understand the situation of the government with respect 
to the financial crunch we all labour under.  However 
constructive solutions such as making a tax free accommodation 
allowance payable to everyone and reducing the rents of members 
quarters to what they were three years ago would be only fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>PMQ rents were repeatedly jacked up and the salaries were 
frozen.  That sends a very bad message to our military personnel. 
They are not looking to get rich.  They know the situation they 
are in.  They understand the situation of the government and the 
restrictions it is under.  However they expect to be treated 
fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not too much to ask for people who travel far away under 
extremely dangerous circumstances to wave the Canadian flag and 
do the bidding of our country to fulfil its obligations abroad 
and domestically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to consider the non-military people who work for 
the military, the civilian population.  At the base depot in 
Esquimalt the people have done an admirable job of cutting.  They 
have cut remarkably well, so much so that they have been used as 
a model for other bases around the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of those people have been working for the military at 
salaries less than what they would make if they had gone on 
welfare.  Yet they have chosen to stay with the military and work 
for DND because of the pride they feel in supporting an 
institution that is an honourable part of the history of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those individuals have no assurance of what will happen in the 
future.  They are not being communicated with at all on their 
future.  They know the tender process that is taking place is 
occurring for efficiency reasons.  All they ask is to be able to 
bid on the contracts fairly and on a level playing field.  They 
are not being allowed to bid on jobs in which they have worked 
honourably for decades in some cases.  That is no way to treat 
the people in our military.  It is no way to treat the honourable 
people who work in the Department of National Defence.

make sure our military people have the ability to carry out their 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To revamp their morale, make the accommodation assistance 
allowance non-taxable.  Make it applicable to every person 
serving in our military. Roll back the rents to what they were in 
1994 at the time their salaries were frozen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Give the base commanders the ability to maximize the 
efficiencies on their base and get public works out of their 
hair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bring back the traditions within the military.  Listen to the 
grassroots people in the military and allow them to wear their 
merit badges.  Bring back the honourable traditions that have 
given them pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stop penalizing the petty little infractions that enable them to 
have esprit de corps necessary for them to form a fused fighting 
force that will enable them to take care of the difficult 
activities they must engage in abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be hard on those who are engaging in criminal activities and be 
ruthless about eliminating them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take a look at the upper echelons of the military and make sure 
there are people there who are working for their soldiers and the 
grassroots and who are not people who are politicians in military 
garb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Give our soldiers a clear direction as to what their activities 
are to be.  They must not be ambiguous messages from the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs.  Through the minister of defence make sure 
that the direction of our military people is very clear and 
precise.  Ask them to do a task and they will do it, but make sure 
the message is not ambiguous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make sure we remember we are not training cub scouts, we are 
training individuals to go abroad and potentially engage in war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make sure we do not forget those individuals who are in civilian 
garb who operate and serve our soldiers and military garb in the 
department of defence.  Many have worked for many years.  They 
have undergone great cuts.  They have engaged in efficiencies 
willingly and they have done a superb job of doing that.  They 
need to be looked at, examine what they have done and do not 
throw the baby out with the bathwater.  In doing that we may be 
adopting systems that would be less efficient for our military.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this legislation.  I will talk a bit about 
the reforms in this legislation but unfortunately much more about 
what was not included in this legislation, in particular the 
position of ombudsman and independent inspector general.  I will 
make some general comments about the men and women who serve in 
our forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is in the legislation has been talked about to some extent 
but what we have in the legislation are some changes to the 
office of the judge advocate general.  There are some positive 
changes in that but by and large the positive changes laid out in 
this area are nullified because the judge advocate general is 
left within the chain of command.  There is not enough 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the improvements that have been made have lost their 
value because the independence is limited.  The military police 
is another area where there was reform in this legislation. There 
are some positive changes but again these positive changes are 
largely overridden because this office really is not made 
independent enough.  That is still a concern regarding that 
position and really limits to a great extent the value that could 
have been presented in this legislation had it been done 
properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is in this legislation.  What is not in the 
legislation?  The position of ombudsman is not mentioned in the 
legislation.  The position of independent inspector general has 
been completely left out.  There is no mentioned whatsoever and 
seems to be rejected by this legislation, and certainly was 
rejected by the minister's announcement of the ombudsman 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary in his opening comments said there 
is no need for an independent inspector general and his quote is 
that all the bases are covered by what is presented in this 
legislation and by the position of ombudsman.  The ombudsman was 
announced yesterday.  I am going to point out as clearly as I can 
that all the bases are not covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because independence is not given to any of those involved in 
this military justice system the reality is if any gains have 
been made they are very small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the position of ombudsman.  There is no mention 
of it in this legislation.  The interesting thing is that in 
spite of the fact that the ombudsman was announced by the 
minister yesterday, there is no legislation to establish a 
position of ombudsman.  What does that mean?  We have an 
ombudsman appointed.  There is no legislation.  To me that means 
absolutely no power.  That was something made very clear in the 
press conference yesterday.  The ombudsman who was appointed has 
no power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only real power this ombudsman has is in presenting 
information to the public about what is going on inside the 
department.  That is very limited because the ombudsman does not 
really present the information that he might have on a situation 
that is not being dealt with properly to the public.  The 
ombudsman rather presents the information to the minister.  It 
will be up to the minister to decide whether anything is done 
with the information presented to him. 
What really has been accomplished with that?  I would like the 
parliamentary secretary to explain how all the bases have been 
covered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read some of the things that have been said by the 
minister and General Kinsman, former ADM of personnel. They were 
talking about the position of ombudsman and what it would and 
would not do.  It is important to note here that this is an 
organizational ombudsman, not the ombudsman that people are used 
to when they hear about an ombudsman who is set out to deal with 
a particular problem by a provincial government or some other 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>General Kinsman said: “Typical functions of an organizational 
ombudsman would include listening to members' complaints and 
providing an opportunity for ventilation; providing information 
to members on policies, how to take action, where to find 
information and so on;  reframing issues and developing options 
for members; referring people to help themselves with advice or 
coaching; making informal, third party interventions”. As he 
goes down the line he makes it clear that this position does 
carry with it absolutely no power.  That was reinforced yesterday 
with the minister's announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>General Kinsman goes on to say: “Because of objections in the 
operational commands to the proposal as tabled a compromise 
option was developed which would limit members' direct access to 
the ombudsman office, to administrative actions only, but would 
authorize secondary access on all other matters after first 
attempting resolution within the chain of command”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who have a complaint that is not being dealt with still 
have to go through the chain of command and only then can it be 
dealt with in some way by the ombudsman.  The ombudsman, having 
no power because there has been no legislation introduced to give 
that power, has a very limited capability.  The minister in 
yesterday's press conference really reinforced that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the parliamentary secretary and the minister to 
show how all the bases have been covered.  It is clear that very 
little progress has been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most disturbing thing of all was said by the parliamentary 
secretary today and the minister yesterday at the press 
conference.  They said that because this ombudsman has been 
appointed there is no need for an independent inspector general. 
We had proposals again and again by the Somalia commission and by 
several other people who have done reviews of the military system 
that call for the appointment of an independent inspector general 
who would report to parliament completely outside the chain of 
command.  That is what people have called for.  That is what is 
needed and it is completely absent from this legislation.  It is 
a glaring hole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All bases covered, I suggest the government does not get to 
first base with this legislation.  I am extremely concerned about 
that because of the impact on our men and women who serve so well 
in the Canadian forces and their need now for someone to go to 
when their concerns are not dealt with properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that when I am talking about the 
position of ombudsman and the lack of authority and legislation 
to even establish the position, I am not criticizing the 
gentleman who was appointed, André Marin.  He seems like a bright 
young man and has great qualifications when one looks at what he 
has done.  He has been successful at what he has done. In terms 
of the person appointed I do not have a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think Mr. Marin is headed for frustration.  He goes 
into this position for six months and he is then going to realize 
he has been given an impossible task.  There are high 
expectations of what he would do but there is no authority 
granted to allow him to do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by commenting on the impact of this legislation 
which is very weak, on the ombudsman position which is very weak, 
and on the impact of that on the men and women who serve so well 
in our forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House of Commons defence committee found out, it is clear 
that there are very good people serving in the Canadian forces. 
They are dedicated.  They are certainly not there for the money. 
They are there because they want to serve this country.  They are 
proud of what they do, but they do need someone to help them when 
they have a problem that is not dealt with by the chain of 
command.  They need someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presenting legislation like this and saying that all bases are 
covered is completely letting down the men and women who serve 
this country so well. It is sad that has happened.  Something 
else has to happen to make up for the wrong that is being done in 
presenting this legislation and nothing more.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise as the humble servant of the constituents of 
Edmonton East to contribute to this debate on Bill C-25, an act 
to amend the National Defence Act.  I also contribute to this 
debate in my capacity as official opposition critic for veterans 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some commentators have remarked that there does not appear to 
have been that much of significance on the legislative agenda 
during this parliamentary term.  The debate on this bill 
demonstrates how commentators can easily be off the mark.  Bill 
C-25 is a most important piece of legislation.  Through this bill 
the most extensive set of amendments to the National Defence Act 
since its enactment in 1950 are proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As discussed by the Minister of National Defence in the House 
last March, the government intends by this bill to implement 
approximately 80% of the recommendations of the Somalia inquiry, 
an inquiry cut short by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill appears to be in part a government response to 
conflicts of interest in the military justice system identified 
in inquiries into the conduct of our troops in Somalia and 
Bosnia. It also appears to be an attempt to address the perceived 
discriminatory treatment of wrongdoing in the military.  The 
higher the rank of an accused, the less it is perceived that 
justice will be administered fairly or that punishment will be 
rendered equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I enter into this debate as a parliamentarian with a military 
background.  From 1962 to 1965 I served with the military police 
in the Royal Canadian Air Force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might argue that the justice system for the military should 
be no different than the justice system for Canadian civilians. 
Some might question why there is a separate justice system for 
the military; should the administration of the criminal justice 
system not be the same across provinces and across groups?  Some 
might argue that the military is no different from any other 
self-governing profession where matters of professional 
misconduct are addressed internally but where criminal matters 
are addressed through a civilian court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My opinion is that a separate military justice system is 
important and should be preserved.  One reason for this is that 
many of our most notorious cases in the military have related to 
events occurring while on service outside Canada.  It is far more 
efficient for such wrongdoings to be addressed through the 
Canadian military justice system than it would be to seek justice 
in circumstances of international jurisdictional disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated by the Minister of National Defence during the course 
of his remarks on this bill, “by tradition there is a separate 
military justice system because of the nature of dealing with 
matters swiftly—it is necessary to have a portable system. 
What we are attempting to do is to bring it as close as possible 
to the civilian system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I are very supportive of improvements to the 
system of justice in the military.  At the same time we will be 
opposing this bill.  A primary reason for our opposition is that 
we question whether this legislation is more akin to window 
dressing rather than involving substantive changes to the 
military justice system.  We question whether the legislation 
will achieve the government's objective of approximately 
paralleling the civilian justice system particularly in terms of 
increased bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all mindful of serious problems in the military 
particularly relating to troop morale and generalized sentiments 
that the higher the rank, the easier it is to transgress.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment of an ombudsman to address these concerns may do 
little to change matters.  The appointee is after all André 
Marin, son of Judge René Marin, a Liberal judicial appointee. 
Throughout any process to improve our military there must be a 
lack of political bias, both in appearance and in fact. It has 
been reported that André Marin was appointed at the personal 
insistence of the defence minister and over the objection of 
others who believed there were more suitable candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in any way impugning the competency of Mr. Marin. I 
find it interesting and of course purely coincidental that his 
appointment was announced two days before the final debate on the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is any issue of bias in appearance or in fact in the 
assessment of military procedure important?  It is because the 
memories of the Liberal shutdown of the Somalia inquiry are quite 
recent.  As may be recalled, that shutdown occurred as the 
inquiry was about to investigate the involvement of the Liberal 
government in the Somalia affair. To the extent that Bill C-25 
may be viewed as an attempt by the government to counter 
criticisms of its shutdown of the Somalia inquiry, the bill may 
be viewed as a vain attempt to deflect concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of clearly unbiased processes throughout, 
unbiased in fact or in appearance, the government may still be 
viewed as permitting a culture of secrecy, cover-up and 
intimidation to continue unchecked in the military.  The 
government may also be viewed as ratifying the behaviours and 
attitudes of senior military officials who are not held 
accountable for their roles in important mistakes and scandals. 
Invariably, subordinates are the ones who end up being blamed for 
the mistakes of their superiors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now wish to address certain particulars of the bill, 
particularly as they relate to the military police.  If one 
accepts as I do that a separate system of military justice is 
necessary, then a separate military police force becomes equally 
necessary.  If one accepts as I do that such a military system of 
justice should not significantly vary from the system of justice 
governing civilians, then a separate regulatory regime for the 
military police becomes necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In furtherance of a recommendation from the Somalia inquiry, a 
military police code of conduct is authorized by Bill C-25.  In 
addition, processes are established for complaints by or against 
the military police.  These processes for complaints against 
military police parallel those in civilian life.  There is to be 
an independent military police complaints commission to address 
what is referred to as conduct complaints. On the other hand, when 
military police have concerns that investigations have been 
interfered with, they too can complain to the complaints 
commission.  This is called an interference complaint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interference complaint may be made by a member of the 
military police who conducted or supervised an investigation and 
who reasonably believes that a member of the Canadian forces or a 
senior official at the Department of National Defence had 
improperly interfered with that investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This puts military police on a different footing from civilian 
police. There is a charge in criminal law called obstruction of 
justice. Police do not have to go before a police commission to 
have such a charge reviewed.  The charge may simply be laid based 
on the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being charged with obstruction of justice should not depend on 
where one is positioned in the national defence hierarchy.  I 
believe the military police should have similar powers to those 
available to civilian police.  By placing a commission between 
the facts and any charges, the government perpetuates the image 
of bias in the assessment of obstruction of justice charges. 
This is particularly so since the commission has the power to 
discontinue an investigation. This is one of the very failings 
within the military that is identified in the Somalia inquiry and 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a pervasive impression that justice can be obstructed 
within the military depending on the rank of the accused or in 
circumstances where the military perceives itself to be under 
attack by an organization. 
All legislative initiatives should be with a view to eliminating 
any impression that such obstructions of justice could occur or 
continue within the military.  I do not believe this legislation 
accomplishes this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On a more positive note, the possibility of a stay of 
proceedings by a commanding officer who may not be a lawyer is 
finally eliminated.  There is a clear appearance of bias when 
criminal justice proceedings may be stayed by someone who has a 
vested interest in the outcome.

of the military justice system, there is clearly much work to be 
done and in the case of this bill much more legislative drafting

the surface and we will always find an ulterior motive. Those 
motives generally are to look good rather than to do good.  Today 
is one of those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Addressing the issue of justice in the military is both 
important and urgent.  My party understands that if we are going 
to do something, it is worth doing it right.  Unfortunately while 
there are some interesting points in this bill, it leaves far too 
much out and does not address the real problems the Canadian 
forces face today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several questions we have to ask ourselves today. 
First, what events brought us to this point to have this bill 
reach Canada's House of Commons?  Second, did this government act 
in the appropriate way and does this bill address the need for 
change?  Third, if passed, will this bill work in a practical way 
when it is applied?  While all of these questions are certainly 
connected, it would serve us well to take time to ensure that 
they are answered to Canadians' satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question is perhaps the most important and the key to 
this.  What events brought us to this point? All members of this 
House are aware of the events that transpired as a result of 
other events in Somalia.  However they are worth repeating and 
repeating. The Somalia inquiry was shut down for political and 
personal reasons last year.  That brings us here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inquiry commissions are created because there is a public 
concern that needs to be addressed.  As elected officials to this 
House, it is incumbent upon all of us to take such matters very 
seriously.  It seems to me that if there is a good enough reason 
to begin an inquiry commission, then there is probably a real 
reason to complete that inquiry commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Somalia inquiry was cut short, this has never been 
resolved.  The result is that Canada's fine military has been 
dragged through the mud and still there is no resolution.  The 
result is that Canadians do not know what the true story is and 
still there is no resolution. It is not because this government 
suddenly cares about military justice. The government shut down a 
public inquiry and there was no resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month <I>Maclean's</I> magazine revealed that there was 
ongoing sexual abuse and sexual assault taking place in the 
military.  Women do not feel comfortable doing their job. This is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although my friends in the Reform Party seem to think that women 
should not be in the military at all, most members in this House 
and I believe the minister of defence agrees that this behaviour 
toward women is unacceptable. Saying it is unacceptable and doing 
something about it are two different things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have now is an atmosphere of distrust with the Canadian 
forces members who have been wronged.  They feel safer and feel 
as if more will be accomplished if they go to <I>Maclean's</I> 
magazine than if they report the crime to the appropriate 
personnel.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong with that and this bill does not fix 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence introduced a new ombudsman 
yesterday.  In this House, I congratulated that new ombudsman and 
wished him well on his new job.  When asked, this new ombudsman 
said that he has not been told what his budget will be, how much 
staff he will have and has not been given virtually any 
guidelines.  That is certainly not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the second point I outlined earlier.  Did this 
government act in the appropriate way?  Does this bill address 
the need for change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just told this House that I disagree with the way this bill 
arrived here.  However, there is much in this bill that my party 
agrees with.  The problem, however, is that when one tries to 
cover something up, rather than address the real issues as this 
government so often does, the result is very often inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, because this government is introducing this bill for 
the wrong reasons, it does not go far enough in addressing the 
real problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the government missed an excellent opportunity to instil 
new confidence in our military.  The government could have taken 
measures that would truly make a difference, measures the 
Canadian public could point to and say “my government listened, 
I now have faith in the way the military operates”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the government did not listen.  Instead it shut down an 
inquiry and stifled debate.  Now the Canadian public will feel 
cheated, and justly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ongoing investigations into sexual abuse.  Does that 
make the Canadian public feel good about the people who wear 
Canada's uniform?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government feels proud when it says it is fulfilling 80% of 
the recommendations of the Somalia inquiry.  I want to make two 
points about this not so great accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Somalia commission was cut short and so we do not 
know what the full recommendations would have been.  Second, 
while the government thinks 80% is something to brag about, my 
party's answer to that is quality is much more important than 
quantity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry commissioners recommended that the judge 
advocate general be a civilian.  The government ignored that 
recommendation.  The Somalia inquiry commissioners recommended 
that an office of inspector general be created.  The government 
ignored that recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party proposed in our election platform last year and we 
maintain today that creating the office of inspector general 
would be the best way to make the military accountable and 
increase transparency to give the public more confidence in its 
armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence said that the Canadian forces 
do not need someone looking over their shoulder.  Then he goes on 
to say that the role of inspector general is being fulfilled in 
other ways.  He mentions the grievance board made up of eminent 
Canadians. He mentions the new ombudsman.  Could it be that the 
grievance board and the ombudsman do not do what an inspector 
general could do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this bill would have it these bodies have absolutely no 
teeth.  They can make recommendations and the CDS can ignore 
them.  The Canadian public has little reason to believe that the 
recommendations will not be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The witnesses who came forward to speak to us on this bill were 
very knowledgeable.  Professor Doug Bland of Queen's University 
recommended that the committee look at chapter 44 of the Somalia 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be most effective if I read his words directly:  “With 
respect, I would direct your attention to the final section of 
the report of the inquiry, the Somalia inquiry, `The Need for a 
Vigilant Parliament', which comes back to my original point.  I 
believe that the defence of Canada, the operation of the armed 
forces, the delegation of responsibility, every act, every aspect 
of national defence policy in this country is the responsibility 
of members of parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was on May 12, 1998.  I would like to read a motion I put 
forward on November 29, 1997 at SCONDVA: “That the committee 
invite the three Somalia commissioners to appear before this 
committee to speak on chapter 44 of the Somalia report `The Need 
for a Vigilant Parliament”'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I presented this motion five months before Professor Bland and 
others appeared before the committee to discuss this very bill. 
I am sad to say the motion was turned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not want a vigilant parliament because if 
parliament were too vigilant, this government might not get away 
with all its schemes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the events of the last few days have demonstrated, when there 
is not one government member in the Chamber, this Liberal 
government has absolutely no respect for parliament and no 
respect for democracy. 
This government's members do not listen. They do what the Prime 
Minister's office tells them to, no questions asked. After the 
hepatitis C compensation vote all Canadians know this, but it is 
true in other instances also.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to review some of the amendments that I know this 
government in its arrogance would not even consider.  For 
example, if I had any faith that this government would actually 
listen and consider, I would have introduced a motion to 
establish an independent body of the office of inspector general 
including the powers to evaluate systematic problems in the 
military justice; conduct investigations into officer misconduct 
such as failure to take corrective action, personal misconduct, 
waste and abuse and possible injustice to individuals; protect 
those who report wrongdoing from reprisals; protect individuals 
from abuse of authority and improper personal actions including 
racial harassment and sexual harassment; and most important, 
report directly to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the government would not even listen.  The Minister 
of National Defence is not listening now.  But the government did 
turn down the inspector general with solid reasons that my party 
could not accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation we could have made is make the 
recommendations of the grievance board mandatory and binding and 
introduce a six month time limit within which the complaints must 
be examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this government does not listen.  It does not hear.  It does 
not want an office with teeth and with real authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party wholeheartedly agrees with the need to change the 
military justice system. This bill needs to go further to create 
real change.  We want the public to know that the military serves 
it and not itself. This bill fails to do that and the government 
has failed to do its job. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate at third reading on Bill C-25, an act 
to amend the National Defence Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since he tabled this bill, the Minister of National Defence 
has been trying to make us believe that the proposed amendments 
to the military justice system will ensure greater transparency 
and improved accountability on the part of his department and 
the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the bill includes some accountability 
mechanisms. 
The new grievance board, the new military police complaints 
commission and the judge advocate general will release annual 
reports that the Minister of National Defence will then have to 
table in Parliament. These reports are in addition to those of 
the Chief of the Defence Staff, the Provost Marshal of the 
Canadian Forces, and other reports issued by the new monitoring 
committee set up last fall by the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon, we will literally be flooded with annual reports from DND. 
While the Department of National Defence has long been 
criticized for lacking transparency, its new will to account to 
the public is somewhat surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in spite of this apparent openness, I have doubts about 
the objectivity of these various authorities in drafting their 
reports, considering how close they are to the institution 
itself. 
The judge advocate general, the chief of the defence staff and 
the provost marshal are all members of the military; the members 
of the monitoring committee are friends of the minister; 
finally, the chairman of the grievance board will work in close 
co-operation with the chief of the defence staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances, it is reasonable to think that we will 
not have access to very objective reports. When it comes to 
transparency, more is required than these reports to make 
Quebeckers and Canadians stop feeling that the Canadian forces 
are a state within the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since parliamentarians will not have free access to a critical 
and impartial analysis of defence issues, they will not be able 
to properly monitor military affairs.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly, my comments may seem harsh, but the issue here is 
not to launch a personal attack on those who will have to submit 
annual reports, but to be aware of the difficulty of objectively 
criticizing an institution of which one is a member.  Generally, 
it is preferable to have an impartial outside observer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, as the Létourneau commission recommended, we 
believe that an inspector general, working independently from 
the Canadian armed forces and accountable to Parliament, would 
ensure a fair, neutral and balanced analysis of the activities 
of the military, which the present bill will never be able to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the Bloc Quebecois think it would be preferable to 
have an non-political and independent review body, but all other 
parties in the House have also expressed the same view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Defence tells us that the Somalia commission of 
inquiry's recommendation regarding the office of inspector 
general is being implemented, but in other ways.  Among other 
things, the minister is referring to the review committee he set 
up last fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we pointed out at second reading of the bill now before us, 
this committee bears no resemblance to what the Létourneau 
commission wanted to see.  This review committee is composed of 
eight individuals who will examine the implementation of the 
changes announced in the department and in the armed forces. 
These people will have no say, however, regarding the actual 
conduct of the Canadian armed forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the minister is deliberately not pointing out that 
this committee has a mandate of only two years.  In the end, 
what will there be for it to do?  A few annual reports here and 
there in order to meet the accountability requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is thus misleading the public and giving the 
impression that he is agreeing to an inspection. We are not so 
foolish as to think that there will be a real inspection, 
independent of military activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his various interventions on Bill C-25, the minister has also 
said that implementing the amendments to the National Defence 
Act will increase the fairness and effectiveness of the military 
justice system.  Bloc members have raised several procedural 
shortcomings in summary trials during second reading of the bill. 
Time prevented us from discussing the problems associated with 
the military justice system specific to courts martial. We 
therefore welcome the opportunity today to comment on this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Defence Act provides for four different types of 
courts martial: the general court martial, the disciplinary 
court martial, the standing court martial and the special 
general court martial. The first two are comprised of a military 
judge and a committee whose membership varies the same way that 
of a jury does in a civilian criminal court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of this committee are the triers of fact, which 
means that they determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. 
It is therefore up to the committee to sentence any accused who 
has been found guilty. 
However, this prerogative of sentencing is abolished by the bill 
before us, and it will fall to the military judge. This 
amendment brings the military judicial process more in line with 
ordinary criminal procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it will no longer have authority over sentencing, 
the committee will nevertheless continue to determine guilt or 
innocence of the accused. Its judicial independence and 
impartiality is therefore of paramount importance to the 
accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, only commissioned officers can sit as members of 
general and disciplinary court martial panels. The bill ensures 
greater openness to non-commissioned members by allowing them to 
serve on courts martial under certain circumstances. 
However, since court martial panels remain composed of military 
personnel, the issue of institutional independence remains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can a military tribunal, made up of military personnel and 
therefore likely to be affected by military culture, really be 
impartial within the meaning of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms? Is it really independent enough to render a 
verdict without reasonable apprehension of bias?

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the principle of impartiality, a court must not be 
influenced by either the parties or outside forces, except to 
the extent that it is convinced by the arguments on the point of 
law being disputed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision makers' status must guarantee freedom from all 
outside influence.  As we know, military personnel undergo 
periodic performance evaluations which can impact on their 
career advancement as well as their pay.  A member of the 
military may therefore find himself in a situation where his 
performance as part of a court martial can be evaluated.  The 
assessment might, therefore, reflect the satisfaction, or 
dissatisfaction, of his superior. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true, however, that the Queen's Regulations and Orders 
were amended several years ago to prevent any consideration 
relating to the performance of a member of the military from 
affecting his promotion or pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we reasonably believe, however, that this change in the 
regulations has had the expected results?  In other words, can 
the person evaluating a member of the military really disregard 
that individual's performance in a court martial? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, can a member of a court martial panel really 
disregard the fact that he is running a risk if he goes against 
the will of the military establishment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the changes to the regulations, the risk is still there. 
What effect does this have?  It leaves us with committee 
members who may not be totally independent and whose judgment 
may be influenced by outside forces or considerations . 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier we pointed out that the bill now allows non-commissioned 
members to sit on a court martial, under certain circumstances. 
This opening up of the system to include non-commissioned members 
is probably the result of the negative image projected by the 
court martial of certain members of the Airborne Regiment, in 
connection with the incidents in Somalia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public as a whole gained the impression from these events 
that the lower ranks were the designated fall guys, while the 
senior ranks escaped unscathed.  These cases also left the 
impression that court martial panels were too heavily stacked 
with Defence Headquarters brass with interests to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they are trying to reverse engines by indicating a 
willingness to allow non-commissioned members to serve as members 
of court martial panels.  Imagine, however, the pressure there 
will be on non-commissioned members to go along with the wishes 
of high ranking officers on court martial panels.  Imagine the 
pressure there will be on non-commissioned members to conform to 
the military establishment.  Imagine the consequences on 
military careers of stepping out of line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an attack on the personal integrity of NCMs who 
serve as members of court martial panels.  It must be admitted, 
however, that the knowledge that a general or disciplinary court 
martial panel includes a non-commissioned member in a position of 
vulnerability might cause a reasonable and well-informed person 
to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the tribunal's 
impartiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of being repetitious, I wish to say that my remarks 
are not intended as any sort of attack on soldiers.  We must 
simply be aware of the risk of hierarchical influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. military court of appeal has already described 
hierarchical influence as the mortal enemy of military justice. 
Despite the sanctions in the Queen's Regulations and Orders for 
the Canadian Forces, the problem of undue hierarchical influence 
remains intact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that a court martial is always impartial, 
except that the knowledge that a general or disciplinary court 
martial panel includes soldiers might cause a reasonable and 
well-informed person to entertain a reasonable doubt as to the 
tribunal's impartiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very composition of general and disciplinary court martial 
panels does not meet the requirements of section 11(<I>d</I>) of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not answer concerns about the impartiality of 
court martials.  Under the circumstances, would it not be 
appropriate to simply abolish the court martial committee, 
which, one way or another, will always be open to criticism, and 
replace it with a real jury of civilians, which would be more in 
keeping with the standards of impartiality and independence 
guaranteed by the charter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say a few words about the new commission to 
review complaints about the military police.  Under the bill, 
the commission will examine complaints of misconduct by the 
military police.  It will also look into complaints of 
interference by members of the Canadian forces and senior 
officials in the department in its investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, there is merit in creating a new  commission. 
Unfortunately, the Minister of National Defence missed the 
opportunity to give this body real powers to intervene, because 
the conclusions and recommendations of the commission are not 
binding.  In fact, its conclusions and recommendations are 
reviewed by one of the authorities provided by the legislation. 
According to the type of complaint and respondent, the reviewing 
authority  will vary. 
It may be a provost marshal, the chief of staff, the deputy 
minister or the minister himself.  In other words, the final 
decision on treatment given complaints rests with one of these 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the commission has no decision-making authority, since 
the final decision on the handling of complaints rests either 
with the military—the provost marshal or the chief of staff—or 
with the executive—the minister or the deputy minister.  The 
minister therefore considered it enough to create a body similar 
to the public complaints commission for the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, or its imperfections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what exactly is the point of creating such a commission when, 
in the end, the result is the same?  Once again, had the 
minister really wanted to change things he would have created a 
commission with real powers instead of trying to fool us by 
setting up an empty commission? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I must say that the Bloc Quebecois will not vote in 
favour of Bill C-25. 
Contrary to what the minister claimed, we do not think that the 
amendments made to the bill will ensure transparency in the 
military justice system and increase its fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the accountability mechanisms provided by the 
bill will not ensure a better review of the activities of 
National Defence and the Canadian forces. On the other hand, 
since the standards that apply to military justice do not offer 
the same constitutional guarantees as those of civil criminal 
courts, we cannot support the bill. It is a matter of respect 
for all military personnel. They, like any other Canadian 
citizen, have a right to be treated fairly. Otherwise, their 
right to equality before the law is compromised.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-25, an 
act to amend the National Defence Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to take part in this debate on Bill C-25.  The bill was 
introduced last December.  It proposes the most extensive set of 
amendments to the National Defence Act in the past half century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main focus of this bill and a key focus of the act is the 
military justice system, the distinct system of penal law 
applicable to members of the Canadian forces and other persons 
subject to Canadian military jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eight parts of the act comprising the statutory basis for 
service, that is military offences and the procedures for 
enforcement, investigation, prosecution, trying and punishing 
those who commit them, are called the code of service discipline. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Service offences under the code of service discipline naturally 
include infractions which relate uniquely to military service. 
However, the code of service discipline also incorporates 
offences against the Criminal Code and other federal acts and 
with a few notable exceptions permits the military justice system 
to have jurisdiction over persons who commit them while subject 
to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the military justice system in recent years has 
been under increasing scrutiny and pressure for significant 
changes.  One factor is undoubtedly the extended and 
unprecedented period of time since Canada was last involved in a 
major war and the perception that the chances of such involvement 
are remote.  This situation tends to lead people to be less 
tolerant of any perceived systemic unfairness in the system and 
its retention of punishments perceived as excessive or 
anachronistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another factor has been the adoption of the charter of rights 
and freedoms.  This constitutional change has brought the 
military justice system as well as the Canadian legal system 
generally under increased public scrutiny regarding procedural 
safeguards for accused persons and principles of fairness and 
equality of treatment in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particular attention has been drawn to aspects of the military 
justice system which reflect the disparity of treatment between 
soldiers and civilians or among military personnel such as the 
lack of certain traditional criminal law safeguards at summary 
trials; the fact that only junior ranks, private and corporals, 
and non-commissioned officers, master corporals and sergeants can 
be summarily sentenced to detention or reduction in rank; the 
considerable discretion of commanding officers in deciding to 
proceed with or dismiss charges, possibly including even serious 
criminal offences; and that persons exercising judicial functions 
or what would be judicial functions in the civilian system are 
frequently members of the chain of command who have no legal 
training and who have other apparently conflicting 
responsibilities for administering the code of service 
discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few years such issues and concerns have been brought 
to the forefront by various high profile cases such as those 
relating to misconduct by some Canadian forces members in Somalia 
and Bosnia, which has been well discussed here this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the 1997 reports on Somalia and the Dickson report 
recommended a series of changes to the military justice system. 
There have also been a number of other internal and external 
studies about possible reforms to our military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a few minutes to talk about some of the things 
that have not been addressed in Bill C-25 that came out of that 
Dickson panel.  One is the office of the inspector general which 
was discussed at some length here this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Somalia inquiry recommended the creation of such an 
institution as a general supervisory and review body outside the 
chain of command.  It did not happen.  Whistleblower protection 
was another item that came out of the Dickson Report.  Again 
referring back to the Somalia inquiry, it recommended specific 
measures aimed at protecting both those who reported wrongdoing 
in connection with Somalia, both at the time and in conjunction 
with the inquiry, and those who may do so in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another item that was conveniently ignored in Bill C-25 is 
trials by civilian judges and juries.  The Somalia inquiry 
recommended that military accused charged with offences 
punishable by five years imprisonment or more have the right to 
elect trial by jury before a civilian court.  The Somalia inquiry 
also recommended that all military judges be civilians appointed 
under the federal Judges Act with the same security of tenure as 
civilian judges. Again, this was not acted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the independence of military police, a number of 
recommendations of the Somalia inquiry were directed at making 
concrete institutional and procedural changes to ensure the equal 
treatment of all suspects without distinction of rank and to 
insulate military police from direct or indirect command 
interference. This was not acted on at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising that as a result one of the three 
commissioners, Peter Desbarats, called the shutdown the most 
brazen cover-up and denials of responsibility in the history of 
our country.  He also said that the government's action were a 
brazen cover-up and a total denial of responsibility. 
Because the government opposite snuffed out the inquiry Canadians 
will never know all the truth about what happened in Somalia or 
who was responsible for the ensuing cover-up.  It has to be 
constantly restated that this was the first time in Canada's 
history that a federal government shut down a commission of 
inquiry before that important work had been completed.  It was 
profoundly undemocratic and an extremely dangerous precedent was 
set by the government in the previous parliament.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw my remarks to a close by referring to the charges 
of sexual misconduct in the military that have been revealed 
recently, particularly by <I>Maclean's</I> magazine, but by other 
news media as well.  I want to talk about it in terms of a 
specific case that deals with one of my constituents, with whom I 
met less than two weeks ago.  I want to put her case on the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I do that I want to say that, without a doubt, this was 
the most stomach churning, upsetting bit of casework that I have 
ever done in the brief time I have been here as a member of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the key points as they were related to me.  This 
individual, who was then 18 years of age, signed on as a female 
bosun.  As I understand it, it was at a time when females were 
being allowed to take that position for the very first time, 
which was in 1989.  She was dispatched to the west coast and 
assigned to a ship there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the fall of 1989 this individual said that she 
experienced several instances of unwanted and unwelcome sexual 
advances that included touching, rubbing, petting and patting. 
She advised that there was a particularly disgusting incident 
prior to Christmas 1989 when she was presented with a plastic 
penis from some members of the crew of another ship that was in 
port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the break over the holidays this individual, who went 
in as an ordinary seaman and had been promoted to an able seaman, 
returned to the west coast.  The occasional harassment and 
unwelcome sexual advances continued, including one incident of a 
male superior exposing himself in front of her on board the ship. 
However, nothing during the early months of 1990 prepared this 
individual for what took place on a night in early May of that 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this evening the individual stated that she was asleep on 
board the ship when she awoke to find a seaman in the cot with 
her.  The seaman was partially naked.  She says that she could 
feel his penis against her thigh and her bra had been pushed up. 
According to this individual, the male seaman had his hand in her 
underwear and a finger inserted in her vagina.  Her screams awoke 
the other females present in this female only section of the 
ship, who in turn began screaming at the male seaman, who then 
apparently picked up some of his clothes and repaired to a female 
only washroom to get dressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military police were called and the male in question was 
either arrested or detained.  A rape kit indicated that the 
individual, despite the overbearing harassment, had not in fact 
been actually raped, but she was sent home on compassionate 
leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she returned two weeks later she felt that she was being 
completely ostracized, excluded and was unwelcome by her peers 
and superiors.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The insensitivity of the military officials was heightened by 
the fact that she was forced to share a military bus on the base 
for two weeks with her assailant before somebody figured it out 
and changed one of their schedules so she did not have to go 
through this ordeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She eventually requested a leave.  She could not go back on the 
ship.  She was not much longer in the military before she sought 
to get out and was released from duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although she was under psychiatric care in Esquimalt, when she 
left there she was not eligible for treatment and there was no 
military psychiatrist who could treat her.  Her parents helped 
her out for a bit in terms of psychiatric help, but it was too 
costly and she stopped seeing anybody for professional help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also worth noting that the navy lost all of her 
performance records and she was told that if she wanted to go 
back she would have to start all over again as an ordinary 
seaman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My sense of this is that what the military did after this 
odious, horrible and shameful incident is as bad as the actual 
incident itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one ever contacted her.  She never had a chance to testify 
at the trial.  No one has ever told her that she may be eligible 
for compensation under veterans affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is symptomatic of the problem we have in the military.  We 
have low pay.  We have low morale.  We have a lack of leadership 
and we do not think that Bill C-25 begins to deal with the root 
of the fundamental problems in the military.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hon. John Reid, a native of Fort Frances, Ontario, studied 
at St. Paul's College, at the University of Manitoba, and at the 
University of Toronto.  He was first elected to the House of 
Commons in 1965, and again in 1968, 1972, 1974, 1979 and 1980. 
He was parliamentary secretary to the President of the Privy 
Council in 1972 and became Minister of State for 
Federal-Provincial Relations on November 24, 1978. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a number of years, he worked for a group well known to all 
parliamentarians, the Company of Young Canadians, to which he 
gave distinguished service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far more important in today's context is the fact that, during 
his time here, the Hon. John Reid was one of those in favour of 
our country's having campaign expenses legislation. 
He did excellent work in support of that cause.  Many credit him 
for the existence of certain components of the legislation we 
now have in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later, he worked along with another former MP, Alfred Hales, and 
others, on the creation of an access to information system to 
allow the Canadian public to gain a greater knowledge of this 
country's government machinery. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of information commissioner, which we are about to 
fill, is not an easy one.  It requires that an individual be 
dedicated to the ongoing development of democratic practices.  It 
also requires that one be willing and able to express strong 
opinion, and yet have an excellent knowledge of the inner 
workings of government and of the public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position was held, until recently, by Dr. John Grace.  His 
term, as I understand it, expired on April 30, 1998, just a few 
days ago.  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Dr. 
John Grace for the work that he did as information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Access to Information Act, 1983, Canadians have a 
broad legal right of access to information recorded in any form 
and controlled by most federal institutions, but subject to 
limited and specific exemptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner is a very special ombudsman 
appointed by parliament to investigate complaints about the 
refusal to provide information pursuant to the act.  The 
commissioner's priorities are:  to convince government to release 
information informally, without the need to resort to legal 
proceedings or the rigour of the courts; to follow, where 
possible, a non-adversarial approach; to resolve complaints in a 
fair, equitable and expeditious manner; and to ensure that 
response deadlines are consistently respected across government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position requires experience in managing at the senior 
executive level and in innovating and leading the management of a 
multidisciplinary team on sensitive issues in a public 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to possessing a thorough knowledge of the Access to 
Information Act, and of course an understanding of the rules of 
natural justice and fairness, the commissioner must have an 
extensive understanding of the principles of public 
administration, current government structure, the internal 
government decision making process, the complexities of federal 
and provincial jurisdictions and government security 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and I believe that the Hon. John Reid has the 
unusual kind of qualities necessary to achieve the desired result 
of providing information to members of parliament and the public, 
to respect the limitations that I have just described and to 
recognize the Privacy Act and the counterweight that it provides 
where appropriate and necessary.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard I thank my colleagues in the House who brought 
the candidacy of the honourable John Reid to my attention and to 
the attention of the government.  Even though the honourable Mr. 
Reid was a member of a Liberal government in the past and sat as 
a member of parliament, I think the fact that his candidacy was 
brought to the attention of the government by members of other 
parties in the House speaks very highly to his qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona and the hon. 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for drawing his name 
to the attention of the government.  Of course the government 
officially proposes the candidacy of an individual, which is what 
I am doing and what the government has done through the authority 
of the Prime Minister.  Now I am seeking the consent of the House 
to have this nomination ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The honourable Mr. Reid is an historian by training.  As I said 
a while ago, he was a member of the House for a number of years. 
His brother, Patrick Reid, served for many years and was the dean 
of the Ontario legislature at the time that I sat at Queen's Park 
many years ago, so long ago that I even had hair in those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That was some while ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  “That was a while ago”, says an hon. 
colleague.  Probably the opposition House leader would understand 
just how I feel in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the honourable John Reid I want to say a word as 
well about the late Jed Baldwin.  Jed Baldwin, a Conservative 
member of parliament, worked tirelessly for the adoption of the 
access to information laws in Canada.  I remember as a junior 
staffer working on the Hill many years prior to my first election 
as an MP, walking by Mr. Baldwin's office and seeing him work 
tirelessly as he did then.  I pay homage to him as well as a 
pioneer of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these few words, I offer to the House on behalf of the 
Right Hon. Prime Minister and the government the candidacy of the 
Hon. John Reid, PC, as information commissioner for Canada. I 
thank in advance my colleagues across the way for not only their 
generous support of the candidacy of the honourable John Reid but 
also for having drawn his name to the attention of the 
government, recognizing that it is the nomination of the 
government that will be supported hopefully later this day by the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I highly recommend this person.  I believe he will serve the 
country faithfully as he did in his previous function.  With 
access to information laws being what they are often individuals 
who administer those functions tend to do so and sometimes their 
judgment displeases the government more than they do the 
opposition.  As we say “Them's the breaks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that will probably happen every now and then once 
Mr. Reid assumes these functions.  I certainly undertake to 
respect that as I am sure all of us will once he begins to 
discharge the duties of information commissioner.  I am sure, 
though, that he will perform these functions with wisdom and that 
he will do a good job for the country he loves so much, Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am happy to see so many of my colleagues here today.  I will 
talk about the process of appointing an information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to support this appointment.  I had the opportunity 
and indeed the pleasure to interview Mr. John Reid and I was 
quite impressed.  I will go through a bit of the process.  I hope 
to influence my colleagues on the other side that the process was 
not as harmful as they thought it could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my lifetime I have probably interviewed 300 to 600 
people.  I lost count years ago.  I have always seen a benefit in 
it.  It is not just for bureaucracy but for business.  The 
process of interviewing people is so common that it is uncommon 
not to do it.  The selection process of any individual is common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sure you have done it in your past businesses. 
You have to know the type of individual you want in your 
business, in your company or in any job like that of information 
commissioner.  You have to advertise as widely as you can to get 
the most prominent applicants.  You have to look at all the 
applications and short list which does not come as a surprise to 
anybody over here.  You have to interview, talk to the 
individuals you have short listed and make a selection.  Then you 
check references to double check that your selection is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That process is not a strange process in the land but it is 
strange in the House.  I do not want to degrade any conversation 
in terms of patronage appointments, but I really want to try to 
influence my colleagues that we have started a process which 
could actually work for officers of the House of Commons. Perhaps 
someday we could expand it.  At the very least what should have 
occurred here is the process I was talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead some time ago an individual was proposed by the 
government.  I did not know that individual.  I do not know how 
many of my other colleagues or the media actually need this 
function as much as the opposition and others do. Once the name 
was proposed there was quite a backlash.  A lot of people said 
that the person was inappropriate for the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two problems with that.  First, whoever thought this 
individual could be good enough for the job made a drastic error. 
Second, we managed to embarrass the individual.  The individual 
had a job somewhere else and suddenly half the country turned on 
her because they did not like the fact that the individual could 
be an information commissioner.  That process clearly does not 
work.  It is very much like patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the process we went through further to that. Once 
that individual was basically turned down prior to even being 
interviewed or talked to, up came another name. Fortunately the 
two of my colleagues who put the name forward had a good person 
in mind, but that may not have been.  We took a chance.  The 
government took a chance and said let us bring this person before 
the government operations committee to be more or less 
interviewed by members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that person had been much like the first individual it could 
have been extremely embarrassing.  It turned out the individual 
was in my opinion quite competent.  When we went through the 
interview process I asked questions as I normally would with 
hundreds of other people:  what are your skills, what are your 
abilities, what are your qualifications, where are you going to 
take this job, and how does it apply to society in general and to 
the people who are looking for information. 
Lo and behold this person not only had good answers to those 
questions but had excellent answers.  John Reid had excellent 
answers to those questions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the impact?  Here is the impact I think we have just 
gone through.  John Reid in my opinion was a very good candidate. 
I will never know in my own mind whether he is the best because I 
only had one to talk to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not belittling in any way, shape or form this individual 
because I think he will do a very good job.  However I think even 
John Reid would be one of the first to admit that he could go 
against anyone else in an interview and probably win the job.  I 
would have guessed had we gone and asked him that he would 
probably have insisted.  That is how much I thought of this 
individual and his character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have left an open door on the whole process.  We will never 
know whether we got the very best, but we do know we have a very 
good individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another impact of this process.   What about all other 
well qualified individuals in Canada today?  There are well 
qualified executives who have been replaced and are out of their 
jobs because their companies closed down or for whatever reason. 
These are well qualified people who would like access to these 
types of jobs.  They would at least like to have the opportunity 
to compete.  They do not insist they get the job; they just want 
the opportunity to compete.  What we are telling good people out 
there is that they do not have the opportunity to compete.  I 
think that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see another impact.  Perhaps this is the positive part.  I 
think we have come a long way.  I applaud the whole House for 
that. However, the next time a position for another officer of 
the House becomes vacant I ask my colleagues to go through the 
process of advertising, go through the process of knowing what 
kind of individual they want, go through the process of a short 
list and interviews, and then at the end of the exercise they 
will truly know they have the best person beyond any amount of 
reasonable doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support Mr. John Reid and I congratulate him.  I think 
he is a very good candidate.  I also congratulate my colleagues 
in the NDP and the Progressive Conservative Party who had the 
ability to assess whether or not this individual was good and put 
his name forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go the next step.  Just one more time, I think the 
government will realize that this one did not hurt a bit.  It 
only gave credibility to the process.  The next time it should 
try it all the way.  From the official opposition's point of 
view, if the government goes through that process there will be 
no tomfoolery.  There will be no games played.  It will be 
business and it will be fair and square and above board at all 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My congratulations to Mr. John Reid.  My congratulations to a 
process that is halfway there and that has yet to come.

<A NAME="LINK247">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.)</B>  moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should seek 
majority support, through an official vote in the House of 
Commons, prior to committing a significant contingent of Canadian 
military personnel to an active military mission beyond the 
boundaries of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, I will explain the motion further before I 
really get started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not put specific numbers in there and that is intentional 
so that the government would use its discretion.   We are not 
talking about three people going off for telecommunications duty. 
We are not talking about some of the smaller missions.  We are 
talking about major engagements and about the kind of events that 
have occurred.  Many of my colleagues across the way were very 
vocal during the late 1980s and early 1990s about the 
government's not coming to the House of Commons to talk about the 
issue, to inform Canadians and to seek permission of 
parliamentarians to send troops on these kinds of missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certain today that my hon. colleagues on the government 
side will be supporting the motion.  I could list all the quotes 
from many of the people who are still there regarding the past 
government and how it did not talk to parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to relay some of the motivation for this.  I want to talk 
first of all about some of the Canadian troops I have encountered 
as I have travelled in many parts of the world. Specifically I 
want to talk about our troops in Bosnia and Haiti. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of meeting with these troops in both these 
locations.  In Bosnia I was there observing elections.  I was 
part of the OECD mission to observe the elections, basically 
working for the European Union in terms of that observation role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Haiti I was travelling with the foreign affairs minister and 
at that time he and I together had an opportunity to see the kind 
of role our troops and the RCMP were playing in that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was proud of what I saw.  I was proud of the men and women I 
had the opportunity to go out on patrol with.  While in a rented 
car, a Swedish translator and I were out in the boonies and we 
came across a Canadian armoured carrier with a Canadian flag and 
Canadians soldiers. I flagged them down in the middle of the road 
and they stopped and asked what a member of parliament from 
Canada was doing in Bihac.  They were surprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Canadian serving Canadian voters there was a pride there I 
cannot describe to the House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT44"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT44"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that they are there doing that job for all of us is 
something we should know more about.  I really feel Canadians 
know little about what our troops are doing in foreign countries. 
If for no other reason, bringing that information to the House 
will help Canadians to find out exactly where we are sending our 
men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but relay to members the pride when those little 
kids took me to a school in Bosnia and said “Look at that. There 
is a Canadian flag.  There is a Bosnian flag.  Your troops on 
their own time rebuilt this school, put the windows in it, put 
the desks up and we now have a school”.  A little old lady took 
me to the hospital and said “There is a Canadian flag and your 
troops on their own time came to this hospital and volunteered to 
do all kinds of things to make our lives a little better”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well I will never forget going into some of the really hard 
areas of Haiti on a 2.00 a.m. patrol.  I saw the kind of 
relationship that our troops had built with those people in that 
very impoverished country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to think about this issue and the motion at hand and 
what I am trying to accomplish in this private member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I love taking pictures.  When I talk to a rotary club or when I 
talk to a chamber of commerce I have watched people's faces when 
they see those little kids, that little old lady or that hospital 
in some of those pictures.  I have seen their faces light up with 
pride.  They said they did not know we were doing that sort of 
thing.  They did not know our troops got involved in that sort of 
stuff. All they have heard about is the negative stuff the media 
love to print.  They have not heard about the schools or the 
hospitals and all the positive things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To involve our young men and women in a foreign country I 
believe it is vital that we bring into this House and talk about 
this issue.  I believe that the top down cabinet decision about 
committing to some part of the world is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may hear these things come up overnight and we will not have 
time.  Nothing comes up overnight.  We knew about Bosnia.  In the 
1980s we talked about Bosnia and its potential. Many people 
thought Kosovo would be the place that would ignite first.  It 
turns out that it might be the place that ignites last.  We knew 
that something was going to happen there.  We have known for 
1,500 years that things were not well there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Rwanda in 1985.  It was very clear at that point that 
there was a problem.  When General Dallaire was there in 1990 he 
clearly told everyone there was going to a serious problem.  He 
told us that there was a problem between the Tutsis and the 
Hutus.  Nothing much happened.  People were not made aware of it. 
These things do not just happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans were in Haiti in 1925 trying to solve the problems 
of Haiti.  They built schools and infrastructure.  We know that 
85% of the people are illiterate and do not have jobs.  We know 
the potential places.  We know the problems in Sudan.  We know 
the problems in Nigeria.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a poor excuse to say that this would handcuff the 
government into not being able to discuss this issue.  That is 
not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unanimous consent would be given in this House, I am positive, 
to discuss the issue when it comes to the lives of our troops 
going to a foreign country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a single person in here who would dare 
stand up and oppose that sort of motion.  To say it cannot happen 
is just not acceptable.  To say it would handcuff the government 
is just not possible.  That is what was said in 1990 and so on 
but that is not true.  That is not an excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How should we handle this sort of thing?  How should we get 
accountability and transparency?  How would it work in this 
House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to put forward is a process something like 
this.  Members are aware of the special debates that we have in 
this House.  These special take note debates in the last case 
occurred the day after the press release and press statements 
were made downstairs, that this was what we were doing, extending 
our mission in Bosnia for a year and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had the next day the take note debate, of which there 
was an audience of one or two members.  That has been typical. 
That is not what I am talking about.  That is not an excuse for 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am talking about is where we have a problem in the world 
the Canadian government says this is a problem we should get 
involved with and Canadians should be interested in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then come to this House and committee of the whole and we 
inform this House so that every member has the opportunity and 
the responsibility to be in this House to listen to experts. This 
is non-partisan politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where every member is going to hear from the military 
experts, the foreign affairs experts, the academic experts and 
about the history of that part of the world we are proposing to 
send troops to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an education for us and for Canadians.  I would even go 
so far as to say it would be to our advantage as parliament to 
vote some advertising funds to let Canadians know that on their 
national television network they will be able to watch and get 
firsthand expert information on Bosnia, on Haiti, on Zaire, on 
Nigeria, on Sudan, wherever it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard yesterday from parliamentarians from Pakistan. The 
question was asked of how to solve the problem in Kashmir. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senator said the way to solve that problem and what Canadian 
parliamentarians could do would be to send a mission to Kashmir 
to see the atrocities occurring, 60,000 people dead so far, to 
report those to the international community and then the 
international community could take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a role he suggested he would like to see Canada play. 
That would be the best thing they could do to diffuse the issue 
in Pakistan and India. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe that is something the government would like to propose and 
get the best information we can on. The second phase would be 
speakers from each party would from a military and a foreign 
affairs perspective present their party's opinion on sending 
troops to wherever it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be all party input.  We would not have to listen to 
ten speeches, some of them written by researchers and simply 
read. People would speak who have worked on the issue, are 
knowledgeable about the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it.  We are busy enough in this place that members 
cannot be specialists on everything. 
They zero in on their little area of responsibility and that is 
what they work on.  Those are the people we would hear from and I 
believe parliamentarians would listen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an information session of two hours.  There has 
been debate for two hours. Now comes the most important part of 
all.  All members who have received the information, have heard 
the positions of the parties would vote on whether we send our 
young people to some unsafe place in this world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility.  We owe it to Canadians to give them 
the opportunity to become informed and to know where we as 
parliamentarians stand. Then in a free vote we stand up and are 
counted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me that is a responsible way to decide whether we send troops 
to foreign countries.  I cannot see how any government going into 
the 21st century cannot agree with that sort of approach.  It 
takes care of the accountability factor. It takes care of the 
responsibility factor.  We are responsible for every single life 
that we put in jeopardy when we send people to those places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would imagine that we would get unanimous agreement once we 
had gone through that process.  I cannot believe that it would be 
very controversial.  All of us would feel better. Canadians would 
be informed.  They would know about what they are reading in the 
newspapers.  As a result of that we would probably have done the 
best service that we possibly could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting this in the form of a motion allows it to be transferred 
to the committee and the committee can fine-tune it. The committee 
can adjust and fix it however it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the framework we are talking about.  With that framework 
I believe we have taken an approach with which everyone can 
agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I truly hope that all parties will be in favour of that and will 
speak in favour of that and not use the tired arguments that we 
so often hear that it would tie the hands of government and that 
government is responsible.  We are all responsible.  We all want 
to share the information. We all want to share the pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to share the pride of knowing what our young people are 
doing over there.  I find it very troubling that we do not know 
what they are doing.  It is troubling that we have to hear all 
the negative stuff about our troops when there is so much 
positive out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent poll done by the government showed that 61% of 
Canadians want to know more about foreign policy.  This poll was 
commissioned by the foreign affairs department and was tabled by 
the minister.  The minister's poll said that 61% of Canadians 
want to be informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What better way to inform them than to start with peacekeeping 
and to inform them in the House.  What better way to raise the 
profile of the House and of all its members, that we are really 
taking part.  I would challenge any party or member not to be 
here for those take note debates.  If they have young people in 
the forces in their ridings, they had better be here. If they 
have the parents or grandparents of those people in their 
ridings, they had better be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are going to be looking at them and saying it is a 
responsible way to make that decision.  Canadians are saying that 
is what they want.  The minister's polls have shown that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would lend legitimacy to budget figures that many people do 
not understand.  There are budget figures of millions of dollars 
for missions. This would lend some legitimacy to the spending of 
that kind of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion probably the most important thing would be to tell 
our troops:  “We care.  We parliamentarians are giving you an 
endorsement.

we have voted on the issue.  We are saying to you that we are 
behind you.  Canadians are behind you.  We do not care what that 
media might do to you.  We believe in you.  We trust you and we 
are giving you our confidence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what it is all about. That is why I hope all members 
will see fit to support this motion.  Adjust it, send it to 
committee and work on it, but this kind of concept should be 
carried through. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Red 
Deer has been a constructive and co-operative member of the 
foreign affairs committee.  We sometimes disagree but not in 
terms of the general thrust of his positions.  As I said 
yesterday in the committee, his ideas are listened to and we pick 
the best ideas out of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that there is a fundamental issue of constitutional 
law.  The hero of the persons case was really not the five 
ladies, although they were magnificent, but the shy law lord, 
Lord Sankey, who actually decided, and it was a revolutionary 
decision, that women are persons.  He also enunciated the concept 
of a constitution as a living tree, not a frozen cake of 
doctrine. One has to remember that with parliament.  Parliament 
is evolving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very surprising for the people who were elected and 
defeated before 1993 to come back to this parliament and realize 
how much has changed. In 1994, 1995 and 1996, and the hon. member 
for Red Deer was there, we changed parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We instituted those debates on foreign policy and they went on 
to the early hours of the morning.  There were 20 to 30 people 
staying until two or three in the morning to speak on these 
issues.  This is something that was started by this government, 
continued by two foreign ministers, three defence ministers and 
it is not reversible.  It is a change in parliamentary practice, 
the accessibility to ideas and the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some problems with constitutionalizing in an American 
sense.  The Americans put rigid amendments into the constitution 
and then spend their best time and best legal brains in evading 
that.  We all know the provisions in the American constitution 
but we will remember that President Johnson with excellent legal 
advisers literally turned them around. If one looks at the Gulf 
of Tonkin resolution, one can see that it is a bypassing of the 
constitutional provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we would rather see is the evolution and continuance of the 
trends already established by this government and which have 
opened up the issue of peacekeeping to parliamentary opinion. 
There is a flexibility here that lends itself to problem solving 
in a very concrete sense. I will cite a perfect example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became parliamentary secretary in the foreign ministry in 
July last year, there was an immediate issue of the extension, because it 
was raised by the American president and others in response to an 
emergency, of the mandate of our forces in Haiti.  Parliament was 
out of session.  Could we convoke it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the step in consultation with the foreign minister, who I 
think was abroad at the time, of calling the porte-paroles of all 
the opposition parties and telling them what we proposed to do 
and asking them if they would agree while parliament was not in 
session.  They all replied they would and I thanked them for it. 
I told them I thought we were making a precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have established in addition to the consultation of 
parliament when it is in session, the principle of consultation 
with the porte-paroles when it is not in session. If one gets a 
strong expression of opinion that it cannot or should not be 
done, then it goes back to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a very real sense the Prime Minister and the foreign minister 
are constitutional activists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the foreign affairs committee and it is astonishing 
the changes in that very august body, somewhat conservative in 
its approach in recent years before the new wave, of which the 
hon. member for Red Deer is as much a part as I am, of new 
members elected in 1993, the 208 new members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at what we have done and at the report made by the 
foreign affairs committee, its special subcommittee on 
international trade, on the MAI, multilateral agreement on 
investment. That is as good a report as one could get from an 
American committee which is endowed with the power and with the 
legal officers, minority and majority.  It is an excellent report 
and synthesis and breaks new ground. 
In any other major problem of that sort coming within the ambit 
of the foreign affairs committee, I hope similar studies will be 
made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have instituted travelling committees.  One went to Bosnia. 
The hon. member for Red Deer had been to Bosnia on a previous 
mission.  Another, headed by a minister to conform to the 
exigencies imposed by the Algerian government, went to Algeria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third one has just been to Chiapas, Mexico. Three opposition parties. 
That was an all-party group.  It functioned as a team I am 
assured by the chair and all those who took part in it. It has 
reported back.  It follows up our direct negotiations or 
consultations with the Mexican government and we expect it to be 
a standing concern of ours. There is a Mexican-Canadian parliamentary 
committee formed now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I call law in the making in a very dynamic sense. 
As the hon. member quoted today, we have had visits reciprocally. 
An Algerian group is in Canada today and we hope there will be 
another Canadian group in Algeria and one further following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee is in evolution. 
I would cite also the example of the special regional study 
group, the foreign minister's proposal, the outer Middle East, 
the area between the classical Middle East and the Indian 
subcontinent, the unknown area. The foreign intelligence services 
do not give enough information.  We will study it and I am 
delighted to have the co-operation and support of the hon. member 
for Red Deer in that because if it is a go-ahead as a foreign 
affairs study, we want all parties in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the change, evolution of parliamentary committees. That 
is the example of the pragmatic, empirical, step by step, problem 
oriented approach to constitutional development.  It is not the 
American way, but we think it is more effective.  It has that 
built-in element of flexibility.  We do not have to hire a lawyer 
to get around the constitutional provisions which I think too 
frequently the Americans do that builds distrust and distaste for 
the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have picked up the substance of the hon. member's 
idea.  I will assure him that with his support and others, the 
role of the foreign affairs committee will keep expanding.  I am 
very proud to have been associated with this committee, 
vicariously in a sense as the connection between it and the 
minister.  The work is impressive and it represents a revolution 
in the style of parliament of the sort that was unknown to those 
whose parliamentary term ended before 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may make to the hon. member a valuable suggestion, we would 
prefer the flexibility that now exists, but I would say the 
essential spirit of what he wants is there.  The defence minister 
and the foreign minister accept parliament's interest, all 
parties' interest in the engagement of our foreign troops. There 
is the very clear understanding that if parliament is in session, 
parliament will debate to allow, under circumstances, 20, 30 and 
if necessary 50 members to speak.  It may exhaust the occupant of 
the Speaker's chair from time to time, but I am sure the Speaker 
would agree that is a small price to pay for the cause of 
enlightenment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is law in the making in the Canadian way. I think the 
substance of the hon. member's suggestion is incorporated.  By 
the way, there is absolutely no inhibition to the parliamentary 
foreign affairs committee to study this and other issues of 
constitutional change.  It has already been suggested we examine 
the issue of treaty-making power. I believe I had a discussion 
with the distinguished member opposite on the subcommittee on 
that.  May I simply say that that is a somewhat inactive 
subcommittee.  I wonder whose fault that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless let us face it.  We like the idea of consulting 
parliament.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs has made the 
changes.  They are not reversible now and I expect a continuing 
momentum.

process should be more democratic and involve elected 
representatives to a greater extent than in the past in the 
important decisions governments make and are asked to make 
increasingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of these missions is increasing significantly and 
requires today's armies, including the Canadian army, to play a 
major role in maintaining international peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the revolution mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs is far from over.  While it 
is true that, since 1993, there have been debates in this House 
and in the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs on the issue of 
sending troops abroad, they have been held either in this House 
or in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those debates have had little impact on public opinion. They 
include the recent debate on renewing the mandate of the 
Canadian forces within SFOR, in which the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs followed by his colleague, the Minister of National 
Defence, spoke to a nearly empty House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to complete this reform.  I think the motion by the 
member for Red Deer today is very constructive in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member added a few words of explanation concerning the new 
three-stage process he is proposing in his motion, which provides 
that members of this House be adequately informed of the issues 
and intentions of the government and of the defence and foreign 
affairs ministers; that a real debate take place between members 
of all parties in this House; and that this House may express an 
opinion, this question remaining a matter of prerogative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, who gave us a crash course of sorts 
on constitutional law, that this Parliament could change this 
prerogative. It could even abrogate it, if it wanted to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may argue that the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Red Deer could have been broader. Indeed, if it so desired, this 
Parliament could pass legislation, as other countries have, to 
ensure that parliamentary approval is required before forces can 
be sent abroad and expenditures made in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore believe that the proposal of the hon. member for Red 
Deer is one that meets democratic and transparency requirements, 
which are not currently met, although we must recognize that 
there has been more debate on the deployment of Canadian 
contingents abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois have repeatedly been asked to comment 
on the way decisions have been made or announced, and debates 
prepared, since Parliament reopened in September, to discuss the 
deployment of Canadian contingents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said in this House before that, in my opinion, such a practice 
is inconsistent, that it lacks consistency and uniformity. 
Perhaps this lack of consistency and uniformity is what the 
parliamentary secretary seeks to preserve in trying to maintain 
the flexibility that all too often appears to suit the 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore in favour of this motion, which I feel makes a 
very useful contribution to the debate on the democratization of 
government foreign affairs decisions and important decisions 
such as those to send contingents abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to add, since the parliamentary secretary 
referred to this earlier, that the debate must be broadened to 
include additional foreign policy issues.  The parliamentary 
secretary implied that the House, through its Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs, had been fairly closely associated with the 
debate over whether to approve the Multilateral Agreement on 
Investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This involvement or association is still too minimal.  The only 
reason the issue of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment 
came to the attention of the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and its subcommittee was because there was a leak.  The 
text of the MAI, or the draft agreement, was made public by a 
non-government organization that pointed out the problems that 
could ensue if Canada or other countries signed this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, too, and the Bloc Quebecois and your humble servant intend 
to follow up on this, it will probably be necessary at some 
point to introduce a motion or a private member's bill requiring 
the government to obtain the approval of the House before 
ratifying agreements, a trend that is surfacing in other 
countries and jurisdictions, such as Australia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This trend toward involving Parliament in this will grow as the 
number and importance of international treaties, regulations and 
peace missions continue to increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member for Red Deer is doing by tabling this 
motion is calling upon us to respond to a true democratic 
shortcoming, one which has the effect of giving the government 
in the parliamentary system with which we are familiar the power 
of common law, a power which has without a doubt become 
excessive, and which it must now give thought to sharing with 
the House of Commons, with elected representatives.  These have 
the responsibility to be answerable to their fellow citizens for 
the government's leeway in setting Canada's foreign affairs 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to such vital questions as sending military 
contingents, the House must not only be consulted, it must also 
be increasingly integrated into the decision-making process.  One 
day, without a doubt, it will want to take part in the process 
of deciding whether or not to send contingents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, then, in a world where there will be an 
increasing use of the armies, the military forces of nations, 
for maintaining international peace and security, it seems to me 
increasingly imperative for Parliament to be associated in such 
decisions as sending contingents abroad.  The motion by the hon. 
member for Red Deer is, therefore, a most praiseworthy 
initiative, and one that deserves further refinement.  It has 
the support of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Red Deer can count on the support of the 
Bloc Quebecois MPs, and our parliamentary assistants, in further 
refining this proposal, and getting the government to share our 
conviction that it is in its best interest to share its 
responsibility with this Parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to speak to the motion of the hon. member for 
Red Deer and I congratulate him for bringing it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion gives us an opportunity to debate something which I 
think is very important for this parliament to consider and that 
is the extent to which parliament is not properly consulted by 
this government and in many cases by previous governments on the 
occasion of Canada's armed forces being committed to military 
missions outside our boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that we have not had debates from time to 
time with respect to various peacekeeping assignments.  I can 
remember some of those debates because I participated in them. 
They take the form of “take note” debates.  However, we do not 
have a debate in which parliament gets to express itself, up or 
down, yea or nay, with respect to a particular military mission 
outside Canada's boundaries, to use the language of this 
particular motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly want to speak in favour of the motion.  I 
would speak in favour of deepened and broadened parliamentary 
consultation on the part of the government when it comes to 
making these types of decisions.  This is not just out of respect 
for parliament.  Something as significant as this ought to be 
brought before parliament in a meaningful way and not simply in a 
“let them talk about it for a little while” kind of way.  It 
should be brought before parliament in a way that allows 
parliament to truly express itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large the types of things the government commits our 
troops to are things that would receive the support of 
parliament.  Our military men and women could participate in 
these particular assignments with the comfort and the 
encouragement of knowing they did so with the full backing of the 
Canadian people expressed through their representatives here in 
parliament.  That is the reason I speak in favour of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the parliamentary secretary, who outlined the 
extent to which he felt the government was already in conformity 
with the spirit of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me cite what I think is a glaring exception, that is, the 
fact that this government signed an order in council with respect 
to NATO enlargement, a major commitment of Canada's armed forces, 
beyond our boundaries, without it being debated for a single 
minute here in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through NATO enlargement we are committing the men and women of 
Canada's armed forces to the defence not only of the countries 
which are already members of NATO, but to new members such as the 
Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary.  Was this ever debated in 
parliament?  We did not just commit our armed forces to the 
defence of those three countries, we committed Canada, given 
NATO's flexible use doctrine when it comes to nuclear weapons, to 
a nuclear exchange with whomever would breach those boundaries of 
the three new countries, in addition to the existing countries, 
without so much as a sentence being uttered in defence of that 
particular decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shame and embarrassment of this is that we are the only 
country in NATO to be in this position.  Every other country in 
NATO, and I have checked and studied this, with the exception of 
the United Kingdom, requires parliamentary ratification of a move 
like agreeing to the enlargement of NATO.  But not Canada.  Only 
in Canada you say.  Not in Canada.  In Canada a decision of this 
magnitude can be made by executive order.  The United Kingdom can 
do the same thing because it has the same tradition of the crown 
being able to enter into these types of agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in the United Kingdom they had enough respect for parliament 
that they had a debate regarding NATO enlargement in the House of 
Commons at Westminster.  Did we have such a debate here?  Did we 
have a ministerial statement that members of the opposition could 
have responded to?  No.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So imagine the embarrassment if we were to think it through 
given all the self-congratulatory rhetoric that we use about 
Canada being a great democracy and wanting to export our 
democratic values and culture to all these poor third world 
countries that need to be more like us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet here we are in Canada where a major decision like this can 
be made without parliament's ever being consulted, without there 
ever being a parliamentary debate.  All other members of NATO 
require some kind of congressional or parliamentary ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring this up as a counter example to what the parliamentary 
secretary said. The government should examine its own 
parliamentary conscience with respect to how this transpired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This major military and foreign policy decision could have been 
made without the benefit of debate in parliament.  It is one of 
the reason I rise in support of the hon. member's motion. 
Although the motion does not particularly reference NATO or the 
enlargement of NATO, I think the member would agree that this is 
an example of the kind of thing he might have had in mind when he 
was framing his motion.  I think he was probably thinking in a 
more routine way about various commitments of forces but 
certainly the enlargement of NATO involves a major potential 
commitment and actual commitment of Canadian forces.  This was 
done without benefit of parliamentary debate whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I hope we would be able to pass the member's motion 
or that the debate on this motion would lead the government to 
examine its record in respect of this issue and others and 
improve its procedures accordingly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to this motion because I will have the chance 
to reveal some truths about both the Liberal Party and 
the Reform Party, which put forward this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberal Party has no interest in seeing parliament's 
having a real role in the most crucial national decisions, those 
involving sending young Canadians into danger, the Reform Party 
by wording the motion the way it has chosen to demonstrates once 
again it has absolutely no concept of foreign affairs or the way 
the real world works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read the motion so the House is clear on what I am 
speaking to: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should seek 
majority support, through an official vote in the House of 
Commons, prior to committing a significant contingent of Canadian 
military personnel to an active military mission beyond the 
boundaries of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentiment behind this motion is good and I applaud the 
Reform Party for that.  Twice since this parliamentary session 
began in September the House has met to debate the government's 
decision to send Canadian troops abroad.  The first instance was 
in February of this year.  I remember it well.  Let me share with 
the House the reasons why I remember it so clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As tensions in the Persian Gulf grew because Saddam Hussein 
refused to allow United Nations weapons inspectors to do their 
job, United States and Britain continued to build up their power 
in the region.  The situation looked very serious. It looked like 
there might be another war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sunday before this House resumed sitting after the winter 
break the leader of my party called the Prime Minister and told 
him we were going to request an emergency debate.  The Prime 
Minister and this House refused my party's request for an 
emergency debate.  It was not until the following week after 
President Bill Clinton requested Canada's help did the Prime 
Minister concede that debate was needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He told this House that he had told the president that he could 
not give him an answer until it was debated publicly in the 
House.  He told Canadians he would not give the President of the 
United States an okay that Canada's troops could be used until he 
checked with this House.  That was not accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  went on U.S. 
television and told the world that President Clinton had Canada's 
support.  That was on the Sunday morning, February 8. The Prime 
Minister did not tell the Canadian public that he had even spoken 
to the president until Sunday afternoon. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same debate the Prime Minister said was necessary before he 
made a commitment to the Americans was not until Monday evening, 
February 9.  By that chronology either the U.S. secretary of 
state said she had Canada's support before she really did or the 
Prime Minister gave the U.S. Canada's support before there was a 
debate. Under the latter scenario the Prime Minister fooled 
Canadians into thinking the debate had actual meaning.  That is 
disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second time this House met to debate sending troops abroad 
was on April 28 of this year.  That debate concerned Canadian 
participation in Bosnia, now under the NATO banner, beyond the 
current June 20 deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward that night by the government was that 
this House take note of an intention of the Government of Canada 
to renew its participation in the NATO led stabilization force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take note of the government's intentions; that is all that was 
accomplished on that evening. The ministers concerned in such a 
decision, a decision to keep young Canadians in a dangerous 
military zone, had the right under House rules to speak for 20 
minutes.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of 
National Defence split their time that evening.  Keeping Canadian 
forces in Bosnia was not important enough for this government's 
ministers to take all the time available to them.  That is rather 
disgraceful. It is disheartening to Canadians and to members of 
the Canadian forces who serve Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let there be no mistake, when this government enters into a 
debate of crucial importance it is not because the Prime Minister 
is interested in the opinions of other parties.  It has 
everything to do with optics, the show, the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made the point that it should not have been a 
take note debate. I said that if this government had the courage 
it would not have been a take note debate but a votable 
motion.  This government has no courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But just because this government has no courage, the Reform 
Party seems to think there has never been a Canadian government 
to show courage or that there will ever be a government that will 
show courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favour of the sentiment behind this motion. 
Unfortunately the Reform Party as usual did not get it right. 
The phrase “significant contingent of Canadian military 
personnel” is not clear.  The hon. member for Red Deer said it 
was to give the government more leeway.  If we give it an inch it 
will take a mile, just as it does now.  That is no change at all. 
I suppose I should give the member for Red Deer credit.  I am 
sure he was under pressure from Reform leadership to include in 
his motion a referendum.  Is that not what the Reform Party would 
like, a referendum to send a significant number of troops out of 
Canada?  Would the party of referendum not support that idea? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has no faith in Canada's institutions, 
including the institution of the prime minister.  To be fair, 
this Liberal government does not provide much reason to have 
faith.  However, my party believes that the prime minister must 
have the ability to act decisively in times of crisis.  That 
means sending troops at short notice when they are needed. Only a 
fool would pretend to know what sort of emergencies a prime 
minister will face.  To say that there will never be a time when 
national security depends on the prime minister's acting 
decisively and immediately would not be prudent.  I support the 
intentions of the this motion and I am eager to discuss it 
further with the member for Red Deer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view one of the problems is that parliamentarians do not 
have the information the prime minister and cabinet have needed 
to make such a decisive decision.  Most parliamentarians and, as 
is sometimes evident with this government, some ministers get 
their information from press and once in a while limited 
departmental briefing.  In my opinion that is the root of the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today we debated Bill C-25, an act to amend the National 
Defence Act.  During this debate and at other times I referred to 
a report from the commissioner of the defunct Somalia inquiry 
called “The Need for a Vigilant Parliament”.  Its 
recommendations included having a real staff of experts that 
answered directly to the defence committee. 
This would inform parliamentarians, keep parliament vigilant and 
improve democracy.

this place more democratic.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to this motion because I believe that any 
time spent by this House addressing the important work done by 
the Canadian forces is well spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 a similar motion was debated and at that time we did not 
support the suggestion that a vote be required before a 
deployment of Canadian forces abroad.  This remains the view of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional steps in the deployment process risk delaying our 
ability to respond.  This must be avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1996 debate government emphasized its desire to engage 
parliament on troop deployments whenever possible. The government 
remains committed to this principle.  A full discussion of any 
major deployment of Canadian forces is an important and valuable 
activity and we have engaged parliament on these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of this year parliament debated the possible 
participation of Canadian forces in military action in the gulf 
against Iraq. The majority of this House supported a Canadian 
role if all diplomatic efforts were exhausted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April of this year the House debated the renewal of Canadian 
participation in NATO led stabilization forces in Bosnia.  After 
thorough debate all parties agreed that Canadian troops should 
remain and continue the valuable work they are doing in that 
troubled country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in April a special joint meeting of the committees on 
foreign affairs and defence was held discuss possible Canadian 
participation in a peacekeeping force in the central African 
republic.  This option was chosen because of the need to make a 
decision and deploy troops as rapidly as humanly possible. Both 
ministers attended the special meeting and a unanimous resolution 
in favour of Canadian assistance was adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has engaged parliament because that is what 
Canadians want.  Canadians are proud of the role Canadian forces 
are playing abroad. They believe the world is a better place 
because of Canada's willingness to participate internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also understand these missions can be very dangerous. 
As a result they expect their elected representatives to be 
engaged when a potential mission is being considered or an 
ongoing one renewed.  We must take care, however, to ensure that 
Canada can react rapidly and effectively to international events. 
Why is this the case?  It is because Canadians also demand that 
we have a defence policy that meets the challenges of the 
post-cold war era. This government has risen to that demand and 
our defence policy recognizes the new security conditions that 
shape the world of the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that a special joint committee of this House 
and the Senate made an enormous contribution to developing this 
policy.  The government rightly believed that the members of this 
House would play a valuable role in helping define how Canada 
should act in the new international security environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian action in the new security environment includes 
continuing our great tradition as the world's pre-eminent 
peacekeepers.  The peacekeeping contribution of Canadian forces 
is second to none and Canada's commitment to peacekeeping has 
never diminished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the end of the cold war 80,000 Canadian military personnel 
had served and it is hard to devise a list of peacekeeping 
missions, UN or otherwise, which does not include prominent 
Canadian participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have suggested that Canada wrote the book on peacekeeping. 
This expertise is still required in the post-cold war era.  It is 
true that this new security environment has much to commend it. 
The end of the bipolar struggle between east and west was a very 
welcome development.  The threat of global war has diminished and 
in this sense the world is a safer place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in other senses safety is hard to find.  Regional 
security issues remain and in some instances are more threatening 
than ever.  Recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan are a good 
case in point.  As well, we have seen the collapse of states into 
anarchy, and the cost in human terms has been staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conflicts fueled by ethnic nationalism have become a 
depressingly constant story in the daily news. 
These problems are demanding the attention of the international 
community.  They are too horrifying simply to ignore.

to engage parliament either through debate in the House or 
through the appearances of ministers and officials before 
standing committees.

needed.

information commissioner appointment process, how Mr. Reid's name 
came to be considered and how it came to pass that we are now 
considering his nomination by the government for information 
commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before Mr. Reid's name came up the government had brought 
forward to House leaders the name of a Ms. Gusella who, as I 
understand it from being present at the meetings, said that she 
was prepared and in fact thought it was a good idea to go before 
a committee of parliament.  However she wanted to know beforehand 
whether any of the parties disapproved of her nomination.  If 
there was not this sort of prior approval she did not want her 
name to stand and subsequently would not want to go before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it turned out, upon consultation people did have concerns 
about Ms. Gusella's nomination, not about her competency or her 
character or anything like that but just about whether or not, 
given her particular history, she was the appropriate person for 
information commissioner.  I do not think it is correct to say 
her name was withdrawn.  Her name was never put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to that it came to my attention that the government 
was considering Mr. Reid and that Mr. Reid had been suggested to 
the government, not by the NDP and not by me but by someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a House leaders meeting I inquired as to whether or not it 
was true that they were considering Mr. Reid and, if they were, 
would they agree to allow Mr. Reid to go before a committee of 
parliament and allow members of parliament to form their own 
views of Mr. Reid.  Not all members of parliament were in the 
position that I was personally, that is to say in a position of 
being able to remember Mr. Reid having sat in the House with him 
from 1979 to 1984.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow my suggestion that if the government were considering 
Mr. Reid I would certainly be open to having him come before a 
committee to be questioned and examined by members of parliament 
has developed into a spin earnestly repeated on the floor of the 
House only a couple of hours ago by both the government House 
leader and the official opposition House leader that in some way 
or other Mr. Reid was nominated or put forward by myself and by 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  This is simply 
not the case.  I regret that this is so.  I regret that even Mr. 
Reid has this perception.  I saw a quote from him to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that I inquired of the government whether or not it 
was considering him and suggested that it have him go before the 
committee.  It is true that given my recollections of Mr. Reid's 
work in the House I was favourably disposed to the idea of having 
him come before other members of parliament and being considered 
for the post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened was that the minute we asked that question the 
government said “Isn't that a terrific idea” and at 9 o'clock 
the next day Mr. Reid was before the committee.  It is quite a 
stretch to imagine that the government was not considering this 
before I asked about it when he was before the committee the very 
next morning.  There was no opportunity for what I would think 
was due process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should have been a day or two between the discussion of 
the House leaders and some notice that Mr. Reid was to appear 
before the committee so that groups concerned about Mr. Reid's 
appointment for a variety of reasons would have had an 
opportunity to communicate with members of parliament and with 
members of the committee who were to have discussions with Mr. 
Reid.  This did not happen.  As I understand, Mr. Reid acquitted 
himself well at the committee meeting by all accounts from 
everyone who was at the meeting.  That is not the point.  The 
point is that the process was not adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Reform Party when it says that surely the time 
has come, if these positions open up, for them to be bulletined, 
advertised or made public in some way so that the wealth of 
Canadians who may be qualified for such positions actually put 
their names forward, instead of names kind of bubbling up through 
the bureaucratic or the old boys parliamentary network or 
whatever it is, all of which is not evil in itself.  It is just 
not adequate in a day and age when people should know that such 
positions are open and how to put their names forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the information commissioner it is a question of 
the person being an officer of parliament.  We could have 
applications.  People appointed by each of the parties could sit 
down, make a short list and bring it before a committee.  They 
could make another short list and eventually arrive at someone 
who was the best person for the job.  This would be far too 
rationale a process for anything parliamentary.  I think that is 
too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made some progress.  The fact that Mr. Reid came before 
the committee, albeit in an inadequate way, was nevertheless a 
step forward.  I commend the government for that tiny, baby step 
forward.  It needs to go a lot further than that.  It cannot be 
the kind of rush job it has been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret very much the perception that somehow the government 
was just sitting there with an empty mind, not thinking about 
John Reid at all.  Then along came the NDP and the Tories who 
asked “What about John Reid”.  “Isn't that a wonderful idea? 
It never occurred to us before”.   Then the government went on 
to kind of give the impression that it originated on the 
opposition side when we know that the government was considering 
it after it having been suggested by whomever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to clear that up.  I also want to put on record that we 
have concerns about Mr. Reid's appointment.  One things that came 
to light in the days subsequent to his name being bandied about 
was his association with the nuclear industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who know me will know that I do not think anybody in the 
House has a stronger record of opposition to nuclear energy and 
nuclear power than me.  I have had many private members' bills on 
this issue, some of which came to a vote.  In the last weeks I 
raised questions in the House about the sale of Candu reactors 
and my opposition and the opposition of my party to them. 
However, having said that, I still do not think that association 
with the particular industry is prima facie evidence of some kind 
of character flaw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can disagree about the role of nuclear reactors and nuclear 
energy without making an ad hominem argument about the adequacy 
or the values someone would bring to a particular job.  It is a 
legitimate concern on the part of a great many people that it is 
not just any industry, that it is the nuclear industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have dealt with the nuclear industry for over 19 years in the 
House and before when I was an activist against nuclear power and 
the nuclear arms race.  It is one of the most secretive cultures 
in the world.  Trying to find out anything about the nuclear 
industry is like pulling teeth.  It will bury you in 
inconsequential information.  It will fill your home with 
documents and memos which would take the rest of your life to 
read.  To find the one thing you want to find out, the one thing 
that is absolutely critical, is very difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Reid has an obstacle to overcome.  He has to prove himself 
to those who are suspicious of him because of his former 
association that he can rise above the culture that he was 
immersed in and be a good information commissioner.  I hope he 
will pleasantly surprise those people who are concerned about his 
nomination and about his appointment.  I hope the concerns that 
many of my colleagues and I have about that association will come 
to be seen to be unfounded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only time will tell and it is important for us to put those 
concerns on the record.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask a question of the member who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He indicated it was a misrepresentation that the name had been 
put forward by him and the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  Then a few minutes later he 
said it was true that they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member does not mind, I would like him to explain the 
mechanism.  I am also terribly curious about who precisely he put 
the name forward to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe I said 
what the hon. member attributes to me.  I did not say that we did 
not and then we did.  I said that we did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I explained the context in which I raised Mr. Reid's name in a 
House leaders' meeting because I was under the impression that 
the government was considering him and I wanted to know whether 
or not it was willing to send him before a committee.  That is 
the context in which I raised his name. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate.  I 
am pleased as well to follow the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona as I often find myself in debate speaking on 
the heels of his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has quite fairly and accurately set out or chronicled the 
events that led to the appointment we have before the House 
today.  I do not intend to delve into any great detail other than 
to add that I think his chronology is quite accurate.  I want the 
record to show that the Progressive Conservative Party put 
forward the name of Mr. Reid but in a very informal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note this was not a set in stone process. 
Suffice it to say the name was very well received and received in 
a very timely way by the government.  As the hon. member 
mentioned, the timing of his appearance before the committee 
leads one to believe or at least be somewhat suspect that it was 
not a new name or the suggestion was not the pivotal factor in 
the government's decision to bring forward his name. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1845"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT58"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT58"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1845

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, we have before us an individual who is 
obviously very qualified, an individual who will fulfil the very 
important role of information commissioner.  The information 
commissioner would be an officer of parliament and not of the 
government.  That is a key point.  The commissioner will be our 
commissioner, the commissioner of the Canadian people, the 
commissioner of this place, this House, not the government's 
commissioner. In light of that, I was pleased that I was a part 
of the consultation and part of a process that resulted in this 
nomination being before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier speakers have touched upon the fact that we have seen an 
improvement in the process of the selection of the information 
commissioner.  Although it is not perfect and some flaws still 
exist, it is an improvement.  The hon. member used the expression 
of baby steps.  It is perhaps a little more than that.  At least 
now we have a transparent process that allows members of a 
committee to directly question the nominated candidate.  I refer 
to him as a nominated candidate but it was really not that 
formal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This name came forward as the result of a conversation between 
myself and the government House leader.  I presume a similar 
conversation took place between the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona and the government House leader.  The process 
moved along somewhat differently than it had in the past where 
the Prime Minister, on the initiative of a party suggestion I 
would assume, appointed the commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not intend to go through the entire chronology of what 
happened but there is a necessity in this debate to have a little 
review of the history of the information act itself.  It is a 
proud history with respect to the involvement of the Progressive 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act is generally acknowledged as 
having been sired by the late Ged Baldwin who sat as a 
Progressive Conservative caucus member from the district of Peace 
River.  Mr. Speaker, you may remember the late Ged Baldwin. Mr. 
Baldwin began his campaign for the freedom of information 
legislation in 1969. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative government of the Right Hon. Joe 
Clark introduced the first government sponsored bill for access 
to information in 1979.  Mr. Speaker, you would certainly recall 
that, being the student of parliament I know you are. The bill, 
which did not satisfy all of Mr. Baldwin's wishes, did go a long 
way to setting up what we now have before the House in the form 
of an information commissioner.  Despite the casualty, the 
unfortunate fall of Mr. Clark's government, this initiative was 
continued by subsequent governments.  The present statute was 
sponsored and passed by the Hon. Francis Fox in 1982 and was 
proclaimed into law in 1983. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fourteen year struggle preceded the point we are at today.  It 
was a struggle to forge what Mr. Baldwin called an unholy 
alliance of parliament and press and the public versus the 
bureaucracy.  Mr. Baldwin saw the existing statute as a 
beginning.  He placed great faith in the commissioner of 
parliament to improve the existing law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 15 years of experience with the 1983 law, it is generally 
recognized that the law needs review and improvement. The act was 
drafted before the explosion of computers, including the 
appearance of computers even here in the Chamber, and electronic 
mail which is routinely in use in parliament, and the universal 
use of the delete button that accompanies every computer. There 
are certainly new conditions, new physical parameters, electronic 
and technological advances that perhaps even Mr. Baldwin with his 
great foresight and knowledge of the use of information could not 
have foreseen in those bygone years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important issues for us in parliament to address 
today.  I acknowledge in the name of Mr. Reid which is before the 
House today, that who is better to advance this cause than a 
former parliamentarian?  Who better to understand the needs of 
parliament itself than an individual who has been elected, a 
person who understands the system and how parliament works with 
the expectations and the pressures that come to bear?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased and state uncategorically that we in the 
Conservative Party support the nomination and the affirmation of 
Mr. Reid to this position.  The Hon. John Reid has demonstrated 
an ability to achieve results within parliament.  This will be 
very important in his new role as commissioner and certainly very 
important in the task he will take on to bring parliament into 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has a record of integrity and independence, a person who has 
shown he is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in when 
called upon to do so. He has told prime ministers and party 
leaders that they were wrong on occasion, perhaps at a cost to 
his own political career. He does bring a spirit of commitment to 
access to information, as well as a distinguished history of 
parliamentary service.  I think this will serve parliament well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally important, Mr. Reid is prepared to address the culture 
of secrecy that sometimes surrounds this place and is ever 
present in our public service.  This challenge is formidable in 
the sense that we know a great deal of bureaucracy exists. There 
are times when the information is so extensive and massive it 
seems it is almost impossible to sort through the volume of 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the reports of the previous commissioner have pointed out, it 
is going to be a very challenging task that awaits Mr. Reid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I acknowledge the diligent work of the retired 
commissioner John Grace.  Mr. Grace served the Canadian people 
well, served the post to which he was appointed very well, and we 
are grateful to him.  We in the Progressive Conservative Party 
and all Canadians are grateful to the yeoman service he did as 
the information commissioner.  We are content that his vigorous 
efforts will be continued and strengthened by the appointment of 
Mr. Reid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put some finality on my remarks, I add the names of the 
caucus of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to the 
list of previous speakers wishing Mr. Reid Godspeed and 
congratulations for his well-deserved appointment.  We hope that 
he will bring great honour and integrity to his new post. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  I am 
pleased to have an opportunity to make a few comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons Mr. Reid's name moved forward so quickly—and 
I do not know this through any inside knowledge—is that it was 
very obvious to many of us on this side that he is a very good 
candidate.  It is not surprising that in informal conversation 
when his name came up, leadership on this side immediately 
latched on to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking of Mr. Reid and the role that stands before him, it 
is not just a matter of the media and the public versus the 
bureaucracy.  We must appreciate that the government has to keep 
some secrets very necessarily itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are looking at in this new access commissioner is 
somebody who will gain the confidence of both parties.  It is not 
just a matter of acting for the media and acting for MPs, 
backbench MPs like myself or opposition MPs, it is also a matter 
of gaining the confidence of the bureaucrats who are charged with 
looking after the interests of the nation.  It is not a matter of 
advocacy or of confrontation; what we really want is someone in 
that position who can win the confidence of both sides and make 
the necessary decisions that are ultimately in the national 
interest. In Mr. Reid we have just such a person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to comment on Mr. Grace.  Mr. Grace has been a 
superb access commissioner.  The reports over the past few years 
have been superlative looks at the operation of government and 
the need for openness.  As Mr. Grace steps down, we are on the 
threshold of a new era of access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope, as with my colleague opposite, there will be new 
legislation or amended legislation coming before the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleague will support that legislation.  I ask him 
whether he or his party is prepared to support some of the 
private members' initiatives that are currently before the House 
on access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge the eloquent 
remarks that seem to be a common theme with respect to this 
subject.  I think they reflect the non-partisan nature which this 
process has unfolded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly Mr. Reid has a lot of the qualities that I think all 
of us are looking for when it comes to filling this important 
post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question itself is as to the support of the Progressive 
Conservative Party for individual private members' bills and 
legislation that is currently before the House.  Without knowing 
the specifics of that particular type of legislation, I am 
certainly not in a position to wholeheartedly embrace any 
legislation without having first had the benefit of reading it. 
Depending on each particular bill, we would have a critic 
portfolio that would be assigned to look at that bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any legislation tied to the Office of the Information 
Commissioner in the furtherance of openness and disclosure and 
transparency that is going to lead to greater confidence in 
government and greater confidence perhaps in the bureaucracy that 
surrounds us in this place would certainly be encouraged and 
supported by members of the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the debate in the last few days, we have seen that 
there needs to be a little bit of introspection as to the role 
not only of government but of backbenchers and opposition and the 
way in which we interact in this place. The information 
commissioner may very well be called upon in very short order to 
be an integral part of that process, when it comes to the 
interaction and the exchange of information that takes place 
between all members and other branches of the particular 
parliamentary precinct that we work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for his comments. I thank the Chair for 
its indulgence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member mentioned during his speech the impartial nature of 
the information commissioner's job.  As a former ombudsman and as 
a person who was involved with responsibilities for freedom of 
information, I would certainly concur that is one of the most 
important elements of the information commissioner's job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner must not only be impartial, but 
must be seen as being impartial.  That is very important.  I 
would echo the concerns that were expressed by our House leader 
in terms of the background of the individual being chosen. It is 
crucial that the individual must be able to show very clearly 
impartiality in dealing with these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former colleague of Mr. John Grace, I would like to add my 
words of commendation in terms of the job that he performed in 
his role as information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the 
NDP member from the province of Nova Scotia.  I congratulate him 
on the work that he has done prior to his arrival in parliament. 
I know that he is going to continue to do good work on behalf of 
his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the information commissioner, he has a depth of 
knowledge that may be of benefit to Mr. Reid at some point. I am 
sure that if he does not know Mr. Reid, in very short order he 
will become acquainted with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I think that the non-partisan commentary that has taken 
place in the last moments of debate here and throughout the 
process of selection of Mr. Reid is a very good and a very 
refreshing start.  It is something that we can learn from, to 
rise above the partisan nature when it comes to these types of 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member would agree that we are very hopeful 
and encouraged that the information commissioner role filled by 
Mr. Reid will continue in that same vein. Although he once wore 
the same red uniform of the government, I do not suspect that 
this is going to factor into his decision making.  He has proven 
himself to be a man of great integrity and a man who realizes the 
importance of arm's length from government when it comes to the 
dissemination of information.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not 
expect to rise in debate today because my House leader gave a 
fairly good summary of our stand on this particular issue. 
However, because I have been involved since I first came here in 
1993 with access to information and the integrity of government I 
decided to say a few words.  I was what was called for a while 
the ethics critic for our party.  I was involved in the joint 
House of Commons-Senate committee, as you were, Mr. Speaker, in 
looking at a code of conduct for MPs and senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just had so much to think about on this topic that I 
thought I would take the time to share it.  Normally I may not 
have, but because of the great motion that was passed by all the 
Liberals over there I have another nine hours to work today 
because we are going to be sitting until 4 o'clock in the 
morning.  So I thought that I might as well make some good use of 
that time by sharing some of my ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to talk a bit about the process because I 
think this is where the greatest flaw is in the appointment of a 
new information commissioner and, I suppose, generally in these 
positions.  A phrase that I have heard is very appropriate here: 
“We need to cast the net widely in order to get the best 
possible candidates”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same as with the contract just recently given to 
Bombardier.  There was no tender.  We have the government 
ministers telling us that it was a great deal for Canadian 
taxpayers, but we do not know if it is the best deal because 
others did not have an opportunity to bid on it.  Even though 
there may be some validity to the argument given, it still has 
its limitations because it was very exclusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel the same way about the appointment of the access to 
information commissioner.  There was a name put forward and after 
a very short time that name was withdrawn because on a little bit 
of scrutiny there were certain tests that were not followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the process that was followed.  A person's name was put 
forward and I think the government thought that maybe it would 
just be able to slide this through and move a motion or maybe a 
report that would be concurred in and, bingo, it would be done. 
However, it happened that there were certain facts drawn out and 
in a swirl of controversy the name was withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another name was then put forward, admittedly by a completely 
different process.  That particular individual seems to have the 
approval of all of the parties.  I know our House leader for the 
Reform Party gave Mr. Reid a good mark in his interview. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through my experience in personnel management and being involved 
in interviewing and hiring people over the years, I found that 
even occasionally when we did in depth interviews with a number 
of candidates, checked references, looked at work experience and 
everything like that, in the end we may not have made the best 
decision.  Most of the time we did, but sometimes we could have 
done better.  I think that principle applies here as well.  We 
should have cast the net wider and interviewed two, three or four 
people and then chosen from among them the one best suited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is all I will say about the process.  Now I want to 
put out a personal challenge to Mr. Reid because it appears that 
in a very short time there will be a vote taken in the House and 
he will get the approval of the House and be appointed by the 
House as an officer of parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to challenge him personally in this way.  This might be a 
strange venue in which to do this since he is not here right now, 
but I am sure he will read this.  It will impinge directly on his 
function and his work.  Perhaps we will make sure that he gets a 
copy of <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the big challenge is to be fair.  I understand that he is 
going to try to do that.  However, there is going to be a great 
deal of pressure on him because he deals with situations in which 
there is conflict.  The information commissioner is not involved 
if one of us in the opposition, or a backbench MP, or someone 
from the media puts in an access to information request.  If that 
request is met forthwith in a timely manner, then the information 
commissioner is not involved because the process worked.  Most of 
the time he will be involved when there is a conflict, when a 
member of the press, one of the aforementioned people, or a 
citizen who wants to know something about what is happening in a 
certain department of government puts in a request and for some 
reason that person is given the runaround.  Perhaps delay tactics 
will be used.  Perhaps there will be an excessive amount of 
white-out.  Perhaps there will be letters saying that the 
information was not available or that it was not kept.  That is 
when that commissioner becomes involved.  He now needs to 
arbitrate.  His job will be, in a way, to act as an ombudsman for 
the truth because that is what we are after.  That is what 
Canadians have a right to know.  That is what government, that is 
what business, that is what personal ethics are all about.  They 
are about dealing in the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give him a personal challenge on behalf of our party, 
and hopefully on behalf of all parties in parliament, to be 
excruciatingly fair so that when he does come to those situations 
he will evaluate them based on the principles and laws involved. 
Is the person entitled to this information?  If so, he will 
clearly and quickly order that it be granted.  If it is not 
available, his explanations will be clear and defensible so that 
there is a build up of trust in that office and an increasing 
credibility among Canadians on how government works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another challenge for the new commissioner, soon to be 
appointed by this House, and that is to avoid even the slightest 
appearance of favouritism toward the Liberal Party.  I say that 
because he is a well known Liberal.  He was a Liberal member of 
parliament.  He was a Liberal cabinet minister.  He has the 
Liberal label.  For the next two or three years, unless the 
Liberals all walk out of the House and there is a change of 
government, we will have a Liberal government.  Simply because he 
has that label he needs to be extra careful.  I predict, almost 
with certainty, that in the next few years there will be charges 
that he is protecting his Liberal pals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Liberal member opposite shaking his head and I have a 
tendency to agree with him.  I have a tendency to think that this 
is a man who will be fair.  I am ready to give him the maximum 
benefit of the doubt.  I am going to give him a fair chance.  But 
he needs to be very careful because he has that label. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He assured us that he has no close companionships within the 
Liberal Party and that he will be fair.  He told us that in the 
interview.  I attended the interview that was held by the 
committee.  It was refreshing to hear of his readiness to state 
that he would be fair.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to both warn him of the possible coming accusations and 
tell him that he needs to be doubly sure that he does not favour 
the Liberal government because, as the ethics commissioner is 
sometimes accused, he will simply be called part of the damage 
control team. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few specific examples in which we were involved with 
access to information where information was not given which 
should have been given.  We were not able to get it.  We went 
through all the channels.  I am not going to bring it up again 
because I dealt with it at length in the previous parliament. 
Suffice it to say that we asked for information and what we got 
were blank pieces of paper with a stamp on them.  I do not 
remember the number now, but it was the number of a section of 
the act under which this information was withheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information was withheld because it was personal.  It should 
not have been on that document because the personal attachment to 
the individual involved should not have entered the government 
documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a conflict.  We argued, I believe correctly, that 
having put that information into a public document it should have 
been available to us, notwithstanding that it was personal in 
nature.  Our argument was that it should not have been there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will we get answers to that type of thing?  I argued at the 
time and I will argue again that when there is such a conflict 
the way to answer it is to bare the truth.  I remember being 
interviewed by the media on this subject.  I said that the only 
thing that would clear up the controversy, which was not done, 
would be to simply lay it all out on the table and say “Here are 
the facts.  Here is everything.  What else do you want to know?” 
That is how we should deal with our government and departmental 
offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be an accessibility to information that is clear, 
that does not attempt to befuddle the person who wants to get the 
information, that does not attempt to withhold the information 
and that does not attempt to deceive or to throw off track the 
road to the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done two things in my little talk.  I guess my role as a 
teacher and an instructor for many years is coming out.  First 
you say what you are going to say and then you review it.  I have 
done two things.  I have talked about the process.  I sincerely 
hope the government hears that message and, for functions like 
this, makes sure that the process is one of openness.  It should 
be one where anybody can apply.  A short list should be developed 
and then they can nail it down to the best candidate, the person 
best qualified for the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I talked about was the personal challenge to 
truth and openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the information commissioner, the auditor 
general, the ethics counsellor and all such positions gain and 
earn an integrity in their own right where they are truly seen to 
be independent from the front bench of the government, 
particularly the Prime Minister, so that the people of this 
country can have the highest level of trust in their government. 
That is what the Liberals promised in the last two elections.  It 
is slow in being delivered.  We would like it to happen more 
quickly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to express my appreciation for the remarks of the 
member for Elk Island because, as it happens, from the last 
parliament I remember the interest he expressed in the Access to 
Information Act and the initiatives he made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He touches on a point that I do not think we can emphasize 
enough in this House and that is for opposition MPs, for 
backbench MPs, for MPs to do their jobs well, which is to 
question government whether on this side or on that side.  But to 
question the operation of government we must have legitimate 
access to the documents of government.

correct move in the person we are putting forward as the new 
access to information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member for Elk Island will agree with me that surely 
the next step is to seriously review the current Access to 
Information Act because it has become old.  It has become 
obsolete.  There are too many ways to get around it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member for Elk Island that the problems he has 
cited as examples in his remarks on his experiences with the 
Access to Information Act had nothing to do with the current 
commissioner or the past commissioner.  They had to do with 
inadequacies in the act.  The bureaucracy in interpreting the act 
interpreted the act honestly and correctly, we presume. 
Nevertheless the member opposite did not get the information he 
needed to have to ask questions in the House which I presume were 
relevant to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not agree that it is in the interest of everyone 
in the House, on the government benches, the front benches, the 
backbenches and in every opposition seat, to move now to review, 
to correct and to renew the Access to Information Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I practised succinct speech for 
many years, as I said, being an instructor and having to

<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and

powers of the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia in relation to education, 
be read the third time and passed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-30, an act respecting the powers of the 
Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia in relation to education, at third and 
final reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is truly a historic piece of legislation. Indeed, it is the 
first time since Confederation that jurisdiction over education 
is transferred from the federal government to First Nations, 
where it belongs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to thank the hon. members for supporting Bill C-30 
at second reading. Education may be the single most important 
investment a society can make, and members from all parties 
recognized the need for young First Nations members to gain the 
knowledge and skills required in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also agreed that education should be the responsibility 
of the parents and communities whose children are going to 
school.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to pay tribute to the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia for 
taking this unprecedented initiative, which could open the door 
to many similar agreements with First Nations throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Participating Mi'kmaq communities have been determined, patient 
and committed in negotiating the terms of the transfer.  Their 
efforts were guided by a single goal, that of ensuring a better 
future for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development for its thorough study of Bill 
C-30. 
Many witnesses appeared before the committee and most of them 
supported the bill and advocated its speedy passage.  After 
thoughtful discussion of it, the committee returned Bill C-30 to 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of this bill is essential to the implementation of the 
final agreement on the transfer of education signed by Canada 
and nine Mi'kmaq First Nations in February 1997.  I would like 
to describe for you the main points of the bill and indicate 
their importance for the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia and native 
peoples in other parts of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found the comments of one witness who appeared before the 
standing committee to be particularly insightful in explaining 
the impact of the proposed legislation.  Chief Lindsay Marshall 
spoke on behalf of the Mi'kmaq band that opted into the transfer 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What struck me most about Chief Marshall's presentation was this 
simple statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years everyone except Aboriginal people themselves have 
been making decisions about Aboriginal education. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell that is what we are trying to change 
with Bill C-30.  We are paving the way for the Mi'kmaq and other 
aboriginal peoples to exercise real jurisdiction over education 
and not just administrative control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 will begin to reverse the historic trend of taking 
local responsibility and accountability away from first nations. 
By supporting the legislation we can recognize the capacity of 
aboriginal people to take control over their own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-30 the government will delegate jurisdiction for 
on reserve elementary and secondary education to the nine 
participating Mi'kmaq communities.  These communities will also 
assume jurisdiction for post-secondary funding support for 
eligible residents living on and off reserve.  Under the terms of 
the final agreement the Mi'kmaq must also provide equivalent 
education to non-members living on reserves.  The level and 
quality of education must ensure that students can successfully 
transfer to any other education system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To exercise this jurisdiction each Mi'kmaq first nation will 
establish its own education authority with a constitution that 
outlines its responsibilities, accountabilities and reporting 
structure or process for passing laws in a transparent appeals 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 also provides for the establishment of a new Mi'kmaq 
corporation that will provide collective services to the nine 
first nations such as curriculum development, culture and 
language initiatives, and special education. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This transfer initiative was in response to a recommendation by 
the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples that the First 
Nations be given greater control over education.  It will 
consolidate the communities involved, in keeping with the 
objectives set out by the government in “Gathering Strength”, 
our response to the report by the royal commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the delegation of this jurisdiction, those First Nations 
participating will be able to set up the school curriculum for 
their children.  Courses and programs offered will reflect the 
customs and traditions of the Mi'kmaq, and, in some cases, will 
be available in the Mi'kmaq language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The First Nations will preserve their history as they prepare 
their students for the future. 
The result will doubtless be better education for Mi'kmaq 
children and youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind my fellow members of the broad public 
consultation that was held at each stage of the negotiation of 
the final agreement on the transfer of education. 
In fact, this transfer initiative was inspired by the public 
consultations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the five years of negotiations required to achieve a final 
agreement, there has been a constant bilateral exchange of 
information with the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia. Literally dozens of 
public meetings were held in the 13 Mi'kmaq communities of Nova 
Scotia. Presentations were made in First Nations schools, in 
academic circles, at the Nova Scotia Association of School 
Boards and before provincial education officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information sheets were distributed to Mi'kmaq households, and 
information booths were set up at annual pow-wows and other 
events. 
Several stories on the education transfer initiative were 
published in <I>The Micmac-Maliseet Nations News</I>, the Nova Scotia 
aboriginal newspaper. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the conclusion of the consultations a community ratification 
process resulted in nine Mi'kmaq communities opting to proceed 
with the transfer at this time.  Any of these first nations may 
opt out of the final agreement in the future.  Similarly the 
other four nations may participate in the legislation by having 
their names added to the schedule of Bill C-30 subject to a 
similar ratification process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Nova Scotia has been consulted extensively on 
the Mi'kmaq education initiative dating back to early 1994.  The 
provincial government confirmed its support for the transfer by 
signing a tripartite agreement with Canada and the Mi'kmaq chiefs 
in December 1996.  Provincial officials were also consulted 
during the drafting of Bill C-30 as were the Mi'kmaq chiefs.  As 
a result the legislation before us today meets the needs and 
expectations of all parties to the transfer process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has received numerous letters of support for Bill 
C-30.  For example, the presidents of St. Francis Xavier 
University, Saint Mary's University, Mount Saint Vincent 
University and the University of King's College have all endorsed 
the transfer as have the Nova Scotia Agricultural College, the 
Nova Scotia School Boards Association and the Most Reverend Colin 
Campbell, Bishop of Antigonish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Assembly of First Nations has written to the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development to express support for 
this historic transfer of jurisdiction.  The AFN sees Bill C-30 
as a significant step in restoring Mi'kmaq governance.  Most 
recently a letter of support was received from Premier MacLellan 
of Nova Scotia.  The premier reiterated his government's 
commitment to introduce companion provincial legislation to Bill 
C-30 as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important statements of support came at the standing 
committee's hearings on Bill C-30 from witnesses representing the 
Mi'kmaq people.  Rick Simon, vice-chief of the Assembly of First 
Nations, noted that education was the key to opening many doors 
that have been closed to first nations people for far too long. 
I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill sets out to change the course of education in a 
significant way—now is the time for change. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sister Dorothy Moore, acting director of the Mi'kmaq services 
division of the provincial department of education, had this to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move towards the 21st century, we the Mi'kmaq people more 
than ever before realize that quality education for our children 
is the priority.  In order for this to happen, Mi'kmaq people 
must take control of their own education. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairperson of the Nova Scotia School Boards Association 
also appeared before the standing committee to endorse Bill C-30. 
Marg Forbes told the committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enabling the Mi'kmaq to be responsible and active participants in 
the education process should make it a very positive exercise for 
all. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chiefs of the nine participating Mi'kmaq communities have 
passed a resolution asking the government to proceed with the 
legislation as expeditiously as possible.  Quick passage of Bill 
C-30 is needed to begin the implementation of final agreements in 
advance of the 1998-99 school year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind I ask hon. members to confirm their support 
for this historic transfer initiative by voting in favour of Bill 
C-30 so it can be sent quickly to the other place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to speak to Bill C-30, which concerns powers accorded 
the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia in the field of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that many Mi'kmaq from Nova Scotia are probably listening 
to our speeches, because this represents a vital step in the 
right direction, in giving them control over their education.  I 
will report on this later.  Native people have told us that 
education was definitely a step toward self-determination, and I 
greet them as a brother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First reading of this bill occurred on February 6.  It transfers 
legislative and administrative jurisdiction over education. 
This means that the Mi'kmaq education council, which will 
comprise chiefs from the various signatory nations, will have 
control over education.  Matters in this area will no longer be 
decided by officials in Ottawa.  People in their respective 
communities will say “This is how we are going to manage 
education.  This is how we intend to provide an education that 
reflects our culture.  This is how we will enrich education with 
the Mi'kmaq language”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this is very important for them and for the nine of the 
thirteen Mi'kmaq nations in Nova Scotia that have signed the 
agreement already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually, according to the bill under consideration, I say a few 
words in a native language, but today I tried to highlight the 
tales of the Mi'kmaq, the fabric of Mi'kmaq tales. 
It seems to me it is always important to start this way to 
provide a background on the way the Mi'kmaq react and view not 
only education but life as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who do not know, the word “Mi'kmaq” has a particular 
meaning. What does it mean?  It means “people of the dawn” or 
“those the furthest east”.  The first people in Canada to see 
the sun in the morning are the Mi'kmaq, the people of the east. 
So the notion of the sun is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For them, the sun links the creator, man and the environment. 
It also provides an explanation of the origin of man and of the 
earth.  There is often a very vivid image of the sun giving off 
sparks.  The sparks give form to life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is very interested 
in what I have to say and I am delighted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now resume my comments. This spark takes three forms.  There 
is one that disappears and decomposes after death, and one which 
transcends time, which ends up in the land and in the souls of 
men.  The latter is called mntu and is considered by the Mi'kmaq 
to be the most important form.  Finally, there is the spark that 
drives life, the good spark that helps people during their time 
on earth.  All this is based on the concept that everything on 
earth is living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To us, animals, plants and people are living things, but their 
belief goes further than that.  People and plants are living, 
but so are bodies of water and animals.  For the Mi'kmaq, all 
these entities have intelligence.  That is why negligence is so 
discouraged by the Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq, as it is by many 
aboriginal nations. 
Negligence and waste are not common among aboriginals, precisely 
because of the great respect for all these sparks of life that 
make up the environment around them. 
They believe that the shell can disintegrate, but the mntu I 
mentioned earlier remains alive forever.

will seep into the ground and eventually bring about the 
animal's reincarnation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important to any explanation of the Mi'kmaq philosophy. 
The legislation is perfectly consistent with the philosophy I 
have tried to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is transferring its jurisdiction over 
education to the nine Mi'kmaq bands of Nova Scotia. 
I will list them all: the First Nations of Eskasoni, Membertou, 
Chapel Island, Whycocomagh, Wagmatcook in Cape Breton, 
Shubenacadie, Annapolis Valley, Acadia and Pictou Landing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The convention leading up to this bill was signed on February 
14, 1997 with the nine Mi'kmaq bands. Bill C-30 implements most 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement is subdivided into several parts.  One part 
addresses powers over education.  What I said before still 
stands.  Everything decided in Ottawa for the Mi'kmaq 
communities of Nova Scotia will, from now on, be decided by 
them. This involves transfers at the legislative, administrative 
and financial levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial aspect lends a degree of originality to the bill 
we have before us. 
Not only does it grant them full authority, but there is also a 
five-year plan, along with a transfer of some $150 million, which 
should have been a bit higher to include members who live off 
reserve.  I shall get back to that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate the nine groups that have signed the 
agreement and will now be associated in a school board on which 
the chiefs will be represented.  The originality of Bill C-30 
lies in the fact that there is an option that allows the four 
non-signatory communities to join the agreement at any time. If 
the government manages to come to an agreement with one of the 
four, that community can then join the agreement and be covered 
by the bill we have before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being a tripartite agreement, education normally being a 
provincial jurisdiction, the Government of Nova Scotia must pass 
legislation. I know that it is in the process of drafting the 
Mi'kmaq Education Act, and this should be in the final stretch, 
so that these people can take over control of their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I described this before as one step toward native 
self-determination.   As we know, education is what enables all 
of us to achieve our full potential in life, and it is truly the 
gateway to freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the aboriginal people, education will open doors that have 
been closed to them until now.  Chief Lindsay Marshall of Chapel 
Island, whose immense contribution I must acknowledge here, said 
something most interesting when he appeared before the standing 
committee on May 26. 
I quote: “Jurisdiction of education is a basic right that is 
enjoyed by all Canadians and a right that our Mi'kmaq nation has 
not exercised since the time of colonization of this country, 
500 years ago”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phil Fontaine said he agreed totally with the fact that 
education was the path to self-determination.  Generations of 
native people necessarily grow up with a system of education. 
It provides them with values, a culture and a language not their 
own.  These people can never and will never be headed toward 
self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the new reality before them, education will ultimately lead 
them to greater self-determination and to the preservation of 
their culture, language and heritage—all vital to native 
culture.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When these young people go to provincial schools, it is hard for 
them to speak Mi'kmaq and to take Mi'kmaq courses, because they 
are thrown together with non-native children.  Now they can give 
their own language courses, teach their own Mi'kmaq culture and 
tales like the one I just told.  They explain the origins of the 
Mi'kmaq, what they do, where they have gone, at what crossroads 
they may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that, historically, we did all we could to 
deny the Mi'kmaq access to their culture, just as we tried to 
deny all aboriginal peoples the right to enjoy their own 
culture, language and heritage and to control their own lives. 
All that had been denied.  Residential schools are a blot on 
Canada's history. 
They are the best example of the negation of native culture, 
language and heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There, as in other parts of Canada, children were systematically 
taken from their families and placed in residential schools, all 
in the interests of assimilation.  The ultimate goal was to wipe 
out native cultures and languages, to assimilate these people 
into Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many aboriginals who appeared before the committee told us that 
not only had this damaged their self-confidence, but it had also 
left them ashamed of their own culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying that the residential system was created to 
break the native culture, to assimilate it.  In the end, it 
succeeded in crushing an entire generation of natives. 
With the help of God, the Creator as natives would say, we are 
trying to reverse this trend and recognize that there is a 
diversity in native communities and culture that will enrich 
Canadian and Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An entire generation of natives was wiped out.  This is a very 
shameful aspect of that era that was recently acknowledged by 
the minister in her reconciliation statement.  She acknowledged 
that the residential schools were an appalling failure and that 
this concept should never have been developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to turn to another concept.  Yesterday evening, 
during the infernal round of 80 votes that went on until 3 a.m., 
I read part of the royal commission's report.  The concept of 
resettlement is one that has been underestimated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mi'kmaq now listening know their history well. 
They are very much aware of how much they were victimized by 
their resettlement in Nova Scotia.  By this I mean that certain 
communities were uprooted and moved elsewhere on all manner of 
pretexts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one that was used in Nova Scotia was administrative in 
nature.  The public servants and Indian agents of the day said: 
“They are too spread out. It costs too much to deliver services 
all over the place”.  In the early 1900s, complete communities 
were shut down, often with the help of the churches and the 
Hudson's Bay Company. The latter would more or less bring about 
the automatic death of a village by announcing the closing down 
of its trading post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This forced the people to move elsewhere to survive.  Native 
people relocated to Eskasoni, on Cape Breton, and to 
Shubenacadie, on the mainland. Both of these are signatories of 
the agreement before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Theirs is a tragic history.  Even though the federal government 
was involved at that time in an attempt to uproot the aboriginal 
culture, we must congratulate the Mi'kmaq who survived all this 
upheaval.  Today at last, they are not only seeing the light at 
the end of the tunnel, they have also taken a giant step toward 
total self-government. When our education is in someone else's 
hands, taking control of it must be the first step.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 makes up to some extent for this past fraught with 
meaning for them. Naturally, the Bloc Quebecois not only 
listened to all witnesses but it also proposed a number of 
amendments, which were unfortunately defeated yesterday. I think 
it is important to address these issues at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, clause 7 of the bill provides that all the 
services I just mentioned will be available only to members 
living on reserve. Those living off reserve will not be 
admissible to the same education program, which means that they 
must attend provincial schools. 
Unfortunately, discussions on native culture, language and 
heritage will not be as extensive as they would be in their own 
education system. The government is discriminating against these 
people to a certain extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are these people not living on reserve? Often for reasons 
beyond their control. Let me read the provision which make the 
existing program applicable only to members living on reserve. 
Clause 6.(1) of the bill states, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A community shall, to the extent provided by the agreement, 
provide or make provision for primary, elementary and secondary 
educational programs and services for residents of its reserve. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means you can be a member of any Mi'kmaq nation, but if you 
do not live on the reserve, you are not entitled to the same 
programs as the people who do.  We introduced an amendment to 
include all members, but, for purely financial reasons, I think, 
the government and certain opposition parties unfortunately 
rejected the amendment.  I was speaking earlier of the sum of 
$150 million to provide all services, and this measure, in our 
opinion, would have cost an additional $60 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the figures we have for the Nova Scotia 
Mi'kmaq are approximate, but some 30% of community members live 
off the reserve.  The government's decision is therefore 
deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing my amendment, I discussed the situation of 
natives off the reserve, because it applies not only to the 
Mi'kmaq but to all native Canadians.  In some communities, up to 
half the registered members live off reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it deplorable that the federal government thinks two 
ministers should be responsible for this question.  The Minister 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is responsible for 
all natives on reserves and for the Inuit living north of the 
60th parallel.  Another minister is responsible for Metis and 
native people living off the reserve, hence the discrimination 
we mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the government member telling me in response to the 
amendment that the federal government could not get involved in 
this area, that it was now a matter of provincial jurisdiction. 
That means that the debate over those not living on the reserve 
and attending provincial schools was a matter for the provinces. 
I cannot argue with that, but I think the government is quick 
to dump its fiduciary responsibilities for these people.  I 
would even say that it is sometimes tempting to think that the 
government encourages them to leave the reserve, because their 
leaving would cost it less, and the provincial governments would 
then be responsible for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the issue is one of equity and non-discrimination in our 
opinion.  It is too bad that, in the end, the Mi'kmaq living off 
reserve will not be entitled to the same services as those on 
reserve. 
There will be a much greater inclination to try to assimilate 
off reserve members and include them in provincial programs that 
take very little account of the realities they face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to understand why people do not really have a choice. 
There are also huge problems with respect to native housing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, overcrowding on reserves is forcing people to leave. 
The lack of jobs on reserves is also forcing people to look for 
work elsewhere.  As soon as they leave the reserve, the federal 
government says that they are no longer its problem, that the 
provinces must take over.  Because of this, three or four 
generations are sometimes forced to live under one roof. 
Sometimes, there are 16 people in one three-room apartment. 
Imagine how crowded that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For their well-being or in order to find work, people are forced 
to leave the reserve. This shows the importance of band 
membership. 
Those who leave the reserve are cut off and will become 
assimilated.  We therefore have two classes of citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also has a negative effect on their culture.  The more one 
visits Mi'kmaq reserves, the more one realizes that, when 
natives have their education under control, they can take back 
their native culture and language. They are in a better position 
to identify with their past, to have a clearer understanding of 
their roots and therefore of where they want to go in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people will say that they do not want to see educational 
ghettos on reserves either, and they are right.  Those who 
appeared before the committee told us that natives have been 
careful to ensure that the native curriculum is in line with 
post-secondary and university curriculums. They do not want young 
people leaving the reserve to be unable to pursue their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is not to create ghettos, but to give them the 
opportunity to rediscover their culture, their language and 
their heritage and to develop pride in them, even at the 
post-secondary level.  Those who are in the Nova Scotia school 
system will be at greater risk of losing their culture, language 
and heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the reason for my amendment, to correct this situation. 
I wish to thank my colleague from Halifax West, who is here 
today, for understanding its impact and supporting it in the 
House.  Coming from Nova Scotia he clearly understands, I 
believe, the Mi'kmaq dynamic in that province. I therefore 
congratulate him publicly for the position he has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion was aimed at putting an end to the business of 
buck-passing between the federal government and the provinces. It 
was a lost cause and the provinces will be the losers, along 
with those living off reserve, who will pay for that loss with 
their culture, their heritage and their language. 
What I said before is true. The government rejected the motion 
because it would have had to fork out another $60 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is deplorable, when the government is patting itself on the 
back for its zero deficit, for having a balanced budget, yet we 
know full well it has done so by cutting EI benefits without 
reducing workers' and employers' contributions.  This is too 
bad, because this government will definitely end up with a 
surplus next year.  It would have had the opportunity to redeem 
itself for past mistakes, but it did not take that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment I felt was important was the matter of the 
treaty.  The government has a number of possibilities once an 
agreement has been signed.  It can either do what it did here, 
bring in a bill, or it can confirm it in a treaty. 
The government opted for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read my motion, which was as follows: “No later 
than three years after the coming into force of all the 
provisions of this Act, the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development shall convene a conference composed of the 
signatories to the Agreement in order to determine whether this 
Act should be converted into a treaty within the meaning of 
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt this was important, because when I asked the public 
servants, their reply was: “You know, it was the Mi'kmaq who did 
not want it”.  When I asked the Mi'kmaq, their reply was “Oh no, 
we did want it, but the federal government did not”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cited excuses such as “If we set a sum of money in an 
agreement and then have to enter it in a treaty the money will 
be frozen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the amendment I proposed aimed at giving the 
agreement and the bill a chance to remain in force for three out 
of the five years, at which time we would re-evaluate the 
situation with the nine communities—or ten or eleven, if more 
join—to see if we could convert it into a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of a treaty is important.  People who came to testify 
from the four communities that have not signed told us that they 
would be tempted to sign if it were a treaty or could become 
one. 
Even though the amendment was defeated, I encourage the 
government to pay a lot of attention to that, because treaties 
have a very symbolic value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does a treaty mean?  Treaties are not just international. 
The first Europeans to arrive here signed treaties with the 
native peoples.  For native peoples, treaties are solemn, almost 
sacred, because they are signed between nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I invite the government to give serious thought to converting 
this agreement, now a bill, into a treaty.  This would finally 
ensure protection under the famous section 35 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government preferred the bill approach.  A treaty and a bill 
are two very different things.  Even if the current approach is 
via a bill, perhaps the treaty approach a few years down the 
road should be looked into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To bolster my argument that some aboriginal people would be 
interested, I would like to quote what Rick Simon, regional 
Vice-Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, for Nova Scotia, 
said when he appeared on May 26: “We did talk about the concept 
of a modern-day treaty to education with protection under section 
35, but the federal government was not willing to go that far. 
In fact, we spent probably six months in discussion back and 
forth to the point of a treaty not being the route to go.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, the aboriginal people, being highly pragmatic, saw 
that they were faced with having to continue their battle for a 
treaty. In the meantime, the public servants in Ottawa would 
have continued to administer all educational services in the 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So they said to themselves: “Let us move ahead one step at 
least.  Let us accept conversion of the agreement of February 
1996 or 1997 into a bill.  Then later we will look into the 
possibility of its conversion to a treaty”.  The bill we are 
looking at does offer that possibility, but my amendment forced 
the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs to call the 
signatories together in order to examine whether it was 
appropriate to convert the agreement into a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-30.  I also want to wish 
the Mi'kmaq good luck.  I have no doubts about their ability to 
control their own education. 
I would even say that these people are capable of looking after 
their own economy, culture and heritage.  They are entirely able 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always thought that the way to end aboriginals' 
dependence on the federal government was through education, 
self-government, and land claims with a sufficiently large base 
to ensure financial self-sufficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that this is the only way to end their dependence 
on the federal government, which has led to a host of problems, 
including drug addiction, alcoholism, suicide, domestic violence 
and despair. These people must be given hope.

invitation from several aboriginal leaders to travel to Nova 
Scotia this summer.  At the end of July, I plan to go to Nova

communities.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Bill C-30, an 
act respecting the powers of the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia in 
relation to education.  This bill would transfer jurisdiction for 
education of band members to nine Mi'kmaq bands in my home 
province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Lindsay Marshall of the Chapel Island Band, and chairman 
of Mi'kmaw Kina'matnewey/Education, stated to the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jurisdiction of education is a basic right that is enjoyed by all 
Canadians and a right that our Mi'kmaw nation has not exercised 
since the time of colonization of this country, 500 years ago. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill sets out to begin to undo that injustice and place far 
greater control over education at the community level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak on behalf of the New Democratic caucus and our leader in 
support of Bill C-30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are some concerns that need to be addressed, there 
is nothing compelling enough to prevent this transfer of 
authority from being supported by this House and becoming law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I discussed this bill with many people in my home province of 
Nova Scotia, as well as with numerous witnesses appearing before 
the committee.  I also have copies of letters of support for this 
historic legislation from the executive director of the Nova 
Scotia School Boards Association, the presidents of Saint Mary's, 
Mount Saint Vincent, and St. Francis Xavier universities, and 
from the University of King's College, as well as from the 
principal of the Nova Scotia Agricultural College and from the 
bishop of Antigonish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This broad indication of support shows that we have come some 
distance indeed from the horrors of the residential school 
education that we are only beginning to confront and deal with 
today. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples described the 
premise of aboriginal education earlier this century as setting 
out to “kill the Indian in the child”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Marshall in his remarks went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years everyone, except aboriginal people themselves, 
have been making decisions about aboriginal education.  This 
decision making process has had devastating effects in our 
communities.  Some of these effects include social 
disintegration, loss of cultural identity and a lack of 
self-actualization.  This proposed Bill C-30 will provide our 
leaders with the autonomy that is required to develop and 
implement culturally relevant curriculum that will promote the 
language, customs and traditions of the Mi'kmaq people.”

</I></B></P><P align=left>The more that education is made relevant to the life, culture, 
history and language of aboriginal peoples, the more that 
education will be pursued.  Chief Simon notes that overall, 
aboriginal education levels achieved are roughly half that of the 
national average.  These statistics are a testament to our 
history of using education, and I mean using in the most callous 
and exploitative sense, of using education to strip the cultural 
and spiritual being of aboriginal youth away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, it should be the reverse.  Rather than stripping away 
the cultural identity of youth, education should be used to 
inspire, develop and feed youth on the strengths and lessons of 
their collective past in order to best achieve individual and 
community objectives in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 is a step in ensuring that education instead of 
re-education becomes the norm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Mi'kmaq education is not a new idea, or a process that began 
with the negotiations early this decade.  As Sister Dorothy 
Moore, acting director, Mi'kmaq Services Division of the 
Department of Education and Culture of Nova Scotia said to the 
committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mi'kmaq education did not commence with the arrival of the 
European visitors on this continent.  It had been going on for 
centuries.  Education was the basis of survival for centuries for 
the Mi'kmaq people.  In the 20th century, the countless formal 
education techniques utilized to integrate and assimilate the 
Mi'kmaq students have met with failure, because these techniques 
have ignored the culture, the language, the history and 
philosophy of our people. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that there are many issues related to this effort 
still requiring resolution.  Mr. Don Julien, director of the 
Confederacy of Mainland Micmacs, raised several important 
concerns. 
In particular is the issue of what lies in the potential void 
beyond the five year term of the agreement. Mr. Julien notes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no protection provided for a long term future of 
educational needs of the communities or the right of 
self-determination for the Mi'kmaq and the education of future 
generations.  There is no commitment in an educational regime 
beyond the five year term of the agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I supported an amendment that called for a conference three 
years after this legislation takes effect to determine whether 
this act would be converted into a treaty.  As has been mentioned 
earlier by the hon. member for Saint-Jean, this amendment 
unfortunately did not receive government support at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Julien and others have pointed out that this legislation 
sets out geographic limitations of the reserve borders.  Further, 
while there is no provision for covering Mi'kmaq off reserve, 
education must be provided under this bill to non-Mi'kmaq on 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke out earlier on this issue supporting an amendment that 
would extend the provisions of this bill to all members of the 
signatory First Nations whether they lived on or off reserve. 
Again that amendment, as has been mentioned already, did not 
receive government support at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are indeed issues that need continued effort, the 
provisions of this bill herald an important transfer of 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government continues only to brush the surface of issues 
dealing with First Nations and other aboriginal peoples. If only 
this government would give a full response to the recommendations 
of the multiyear and multimillion dollar Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples.  If only it would address the host of 
recommendations and discussion outlined in that report on 
education issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this Liberal government does a serious injustice to 
aboriginal peoples by refusing to respond to its own royal 
commission, Bill C-30, this initiative by Mi'kmaq leaders and 
community members in Nova Scotia deserves our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I conclude, I would like to congratulate the Mi'kmaq elders, 
chiefs, band councils, activists, community members, leaders and 
negotiators who have been involved over the year in reclaiming 
education for Mi'kmaq. I would also like to commend those in 
government, both staff and elected officials, who have worked 
co-operatively to bring this effort this far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those who made representations to the committee have 
played an essential role in drawing out the issues at hand 
related to this initiative.  The staff of the committee and the 
Library of Parliament were invaluable in aiding with the process 
and research on this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am happy to rise in this House to speak in favour of Bill C-30 
concerning Mi'kmaq education in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move through this final legislative obstacle on the way to 
Mi'kmaq self-determination in the area of education, all I can 
say is finally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally we are moving away from the repression of our ancestors 
who saw Mi'kmaq culture as a problem to be cured and not a 
heritage to be celebrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally we are turning self-government into a reality that will 
make lives better instead of words that make politicians feel 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally this House can be proud of its contribution to the 
ongoing debate about the role of our First Nations in Canada's 
past and future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally this is a bill limited in scope.  It will influence less 
than 10,000 people in nine communities in one small province.  In 
terms of the impact that the passage of this bill will make, I 
cannot overstate its importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill lays to rest once and for all the attitude expressed 
far too long by Ottawa, that we know what is best for aboriginal 
people, that we know how to provide the tools that they need to 
succeed.  It is appropriate that that attitude be laid to rest 
for one simple reason.  It was wrong.  It was immoral and it 
failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's policies toward the First Nations are a list of 
failures and crimes centuries long.  More failures followed as we 
tried to correct previous mistakes:  residential schools, and 
reserves that became ghettos. 
Even when we tried to do good it turned bad.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that all of those great plans and schemes to 
civilize the aboriginal peoples, to integrate them with the 
mainstream of white western society collapsed.  No, they 
collapsed because they suffered from one central and 
insurmountable flaw.  They failed to involve the very people they 
were designed to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways the Canadian government is still guilty of behaving 
in this fashion, of ignoring the concerns and ideas of aboriginal 
people as it creates policies which affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples that 
submitted its huge and comprehensive report, only to see it 
shelved and ignored by the government.  That was a report that 
had within it the voices of our First Nations and those voices 
have again been muzzled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choices that our governments have made bring shame on them 
and on the House.  But Bill C-30 is a small light in the 
otherwise dark history of aboriginal Canadian relations.  Here we 
see honest consultation among bands and among governments carried 
over several years, but with a definite goal in mind, the 
establishing of a uniquely Mi'kmaq education system for the bands 
of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party's critic on aboriginal affairs has done an admirable 
job of presenting the New Democratic Party's position on the 
bill.  He has walked the House through the legislation in a clear 
and concise manner, noting the flaws and the imperfections as 
well as the positive elements I have mentioned again here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to address are the broader issues that 
surround the package of Bill C-30, especially the often 
ill-tempered attacks made upon it by the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has made much of the word equality and 
painted a picture that has this bill as its focal point, a 
picture of special interest and hidden agendas that lurk darkly 
behind the facade of multiculturalism and fairness.  Through 
coded words and oblique suggestion, the impression has been 
created by the opposition benches that Bill C-30 is a Trojan 
horse for some unspeakable invasion force that will soon be 
unleashed on the “Leave it to Beaver” world they would have us 
believe is Canada.  This is shameful and reminds me of the bad 
old days I spoke of earlier.  But worse than that, the impression 
it creates is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Lindsay Marshall from the Chapel Island Pudletek Reserve 
located in my riding has been one of the principal aboriginal 
advocates for this bill and has worked tirelessly to promote it 
over the past years.  In his testimony given to the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development he 
stated the truth about Bill C-30 and the truth about the Reform 
Party's position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cornerstone policy of the Reform Party is equal treatment 
for all Canadians.  There is concern that Bill C-30 will 
segregate the Mi'kmaq community from society.  My response is 
that Bill C-30 will provide equal treatment to all Canadians, 
including Canada's aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time since colonization, aboriginal people will 
have the right to make laws regarding the education of their 
children along with the rest of Canadian society.  Furthermore, 
with the passage of the proposed Bill C-30 our education leaders 
will continue to work in close collaboration with the province of 
Nova Scotia to bridge the gaps that exist between First Nations 
schools and provincial school curriculum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Significant milestones which contributed to the bridging of the 
gaps were achieved during the implementation period of this 
agreement.  Among those milestones are:  provincial legislation 
for the establishment of a Mi'kmaq education council; Mi'kmaq 
representation on provincial school boards; and the promotion of 
the Mi'kmaq language and culture in the public school program for 
both aboriginal and non-aboriginal students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the truth of the origin and intention of Bill C-30.  It 
is a bill that will create and enhance equality, not diminish or 
destroy it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the problem the Reform Party has with this legislation 
comes from the fact that this bill is grown from the very 
grassroots that party loves to talk about, from consultations 
with communities and individuals both inside and outside the 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of that grassroots generating negative and destructive 
impulses that divide instead of unite, this bill has proven the 
official opposition wrong.  It proves that when we talk to people 
and respect their opinions they will often come up with solutions 
that are inclusive, not exclusive, that look to the welfare of 
communities and not simply the desire of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strength of this bill can be seen in the diversity of the 
bands in Nova Scotia.  There are 13 Mi'kmaq communities and only 
nine have signed on to the provisions that will be enacted by 
this bill.  The other four are reserving their options, 
consulting closely with Chief Marshall and others who support the 
process.  They will wait to see.  If they like the results they 
will come aboard as equal partners with the other bands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this speaks to the strength of the bill and the processes 
that created it.  If only the hon. members of the Reform party 
could advocate such a system of tolerance and respect, if only 
they could acknowledge that decisions do not consist of stark 
blacks and whites, then the political culture of our country 
would be better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that we have much to learn from our aboriginal 
people.  I hope some of the points I have raised will illustrate 
that truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-30 is a flexible document that allows an experiment in 
independence and justice that is long overdue.  It is also an 
example of what can be achieved when communities and governments 
put aside their differences and work in the collective interest 
because it is only when the collective is healthy that 
individuals can thrive.  Perhaps that is the ultimate lesson 
which this debate will teach this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a truism to say that it is easier to destroy than to 
create, but it is a truism worth restating.  I hope that all 
members of this House will take inspiration from this small act 
of creation and take pride in having voted to create a better 
future for at least a few thousand citizens of this great 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to the debate here this evening and I thought it was 
fairly even-handed, except perhaps for a few points which were 
made by a couple of members.  I would certainly like to 
congratulate the government for introducing this bill and for 
steering it through the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the bill.  As the Progressive Conservative critic 
for the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, it 
has been a pleasure to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to recognize all of the 
members of parliament and the DIAND committee who worked on this 
bill and who participated in debate.  I think most of them had 
valid points.  Sometimes we do not always agree in committee, but 
hopefully instead of spending a lot of time trying to point out 
everyone else's mistakes in this House we can also recognize that 
because we do not agree it offers better debate and better 
answers at the end of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, without question, will improve education on reserve 
in Nova Scotia.  Without question there are a number of Mi'kmaq 
and First Nations people in Nova Scotia who should be recognized, 
but certainly above all Lindsay Marshall, the chief of Chapel 
Island, of Cape Breton Island, which is known in the Mi'kmaq 
language as Unama'ki.  He certainly deserves recognition.  He 
stands out in his field and deserves to be congratulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken several times on this issue.  It is not my intent 
to stand here tonight and take the time of the House.  I 
congratulate the Mi'kmaq people and the Mi'kmaq Nation in coming 
forth with this themselves, with pursuing this through parliament 
and with keeping the political pressure on the government and on 
all members of the opposition to support the bill. 
They deserve credit.  It shows political leadership in the 
Mi'kmaq Nation in Nova Scotia.  It shows their political 
leadership as citizens of this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The analogy that the hon. parliamentary secretary used when he 
was speaking tonight was interesting because I wrote down exactly 
the same analogy in my own words, except that I added a little 
more flavour to it than he did.  He used the analogy of education 
being the key to success.  I will read what I wrote down.  I 
smiled when he was giving his analogy because I wrote: “If 
education is the key to the door of the future, then surely this 
36th Parliament has helped to open that door for the Mi'kmaq 
people of Nova Scotia”.  I think that is true. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
raise an issue which is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the speech of the member of the NDP party and, 
very frankly, and I say this as gently as I can, it hurts me 
deeply when they make accusations against me which are not 
accurate.  They accuse me of having attitudes toward natives 
which are just plain false.  I do not like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative member just gave a good speech which was 
supportive of the legislation, and yet the Conservatives have on 
their website a bunch of stuff which is really very negative 
toward me as a Reformer and as a person.  I wonder whether he 
would want to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we need to come to the place where as Canadians we work 
together and we do the Canadian thing.  We care for each other. 
We look after each other.  We make sure that all of these issues 
are properly dealt with.  I would like to see an end to this kind 
of shooting of arrows that is only meant to harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in all honesty it is very 
difficult for me to respond to those comments.  I am not aware of 
what is on the Progressive Conservative website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I can say with a clear conscience, knowing our party's 
positions, our stance, our reputation and our history for 
even-handed and clear policy, that I would hope the member is 
mistaken.  I would assume that he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to say that I noted that all members in 
the debate on the Mi'kmaq bill, which is what we are discussing, 
offered clear debate.  We were not always in agreement and 
probably will not always be in agreement.  However, we have to 
listen to other sides of the argument if we want to come up with 
an answer at the end of the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today with my colleagues to address the Mi'kmaq education 
bill.  We are now at third reading and still I find myself in the 
position of being unable to support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was pointed out, all members in committee made positive 
contributions in the spirit of co-operation and respectfully 
hearing one another out.  There was not this bitter attitude that 
seems to creep into this place all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we did not manage to have the important amendment 
adopted that my party and I thought was necessary to offer 
support to the bill, which we would have liked to have supported 
had our amendment been adopted, is regrettable, but that is the 
way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would implement an agreement signed by the Government 
of Canada and 9 of the 13 Mi'kmaq communities in Nova Scotia.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Its purpose is to set up a corporation that has no share capital 
called Mi'kmaw Kina'matnewey. It exercises control over primary 
and secondary education.  It is in effect more or less a school 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the corporation is to support delivery of 
educational programs and services under the proposed act.  The 
members of the board will be the chiefs of the nine participating 
communities and are elected ex officio by virtue of their office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They together will constitute the board of directors and will 
ultimately be responsible for management and conduct of the 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party cannot put its support behind this bill because 
we have one major problem with the bill. The chiefs themselves 
are automatically the members of Mi'kmaw Kina'matnewey 
established by this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous speech on this I explained that we wanted to see 
the bill changed in order that we may offer our support to it. We 
wanted it amended so rather than the chiefs of the nine signatory 
communities ex officio members of the board, they would be 
nominated and possibly elected if that was the purpose of the 
members of those communities.  We wanted to open it up to other 
people as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no problem with the view that chiefs are politicians. It 
is their job to be visionaries, to see a position they can push 
to improve the life of their communities.  In this case control 
of education for their communities was their vision.  For that we 
commend them, that they should want to move control over 
education into the community.  After all, it is their job to 
promote, to protect and to provide a legislative framework for 
things to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view also that politicians themselves probably should 
not be involved in the daily delivery of programs, the delivery 
of their own product.  It just does not work that way in other 
areas.  Why in this one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel this board could be consisting of qualified 
professionals, experienced people who want to run for the board 
who have an interest in education, who want to make a positive 
contribution to their communities.  This would be one way of 
doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be housewives, businessmen or workers who want to make a 
positive contribution as grassroots people in their communities. 
They are denied unless they run for chief with all the additional 
responsibilities that being a chief implies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the chiefs being ex officio members, because they are 
dealing with millions and millions of dollars to manage the 
affairs of the board, it is another paycheque.  We want to see 
economic activity spread around. There is concentration of 
paycheque.  There is concentration of responsibilities on top of 
an already busy job and in an area in which the chiefs maybe are 
not necessarily expert. They will be involved in the delivery of 
educational products and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may result in overall poor management and results even if 
the chiefs put in good will and hard work.  It also makes sense 
that the members of the education board should have to be dealt 
with at the polls on the matter of education only and not on a 
wide variety of topics unrelated to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the voter have to decide on an issue that is 
unrelated to their performance as chief whether or not they are 
returned?  Certainly the chiefs I met are good people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say when we got to this standing committee meeting we had 
quite a chorus of leaders from the participating communities. 
They were all chiefs or people who worked with chiefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An elected board dedicated to one purpose we believe is in the 
best interests of the people, in this case the people of the 
community themselves. 
They would want to deal with education boards on the basis of 
education.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief's have a broader outlook.  It was their vision, as 
those people elected to lead their bands, that developed a police 
force and the education board. They should raise their sights to 
other things important to their communities and maintain contact 
with people on those issues. They should leave behind the 
management of the things which they have established by their 
hard work, initiative and vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that it concentrates too much power and too much work in 
the hands of the chiefs.  That is why we want to see this bill 
amended.  Obviously it is not going to be amended but that was 
our desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our support on this bill was contingent on having this basic and 
fundamental amendment passed. We know what happened in committee. 
The Liberals voted it down.  They lined up against it, as did 
members of other parties who do not have the strong democratic 
tradition the Reform Party is developing in this country and 
which is attracting voters from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked why would they vote against such a common sense 
amendment. They do not have the democratic and accountability 
tradition that comes with being a Reformer and growing a party 
based on those principles that the Reform Party is based on and 
grew from. They would like things to continue the way they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of other problems with the bill. It does not 
have the full backing of all the communities.  Four of the 
thirteen bands in the province did not sign on to the agreement. 
During the committee stage these people came forward as witnesses 
and expressed some serious concerns regarding this bill. It was 
the grassroots people from the communities who expressed 
reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chiefs and their people who were fully on side.  There was a 
major concern with the Nova Scotia board of education.  It would 
have liked to see this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Band members who are not in leadership in a band gave a much 
different point of view.  There was a concern with consultation. 
People did not understand the implications of the bill that was 
being put forward to them.  Their concern also was too much power 
in the hands of a small group of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not what democracy is about, giving power to the people, 
the people at the bottom end, the people who require and receive 
the services on a daily basis for their quality of life?  The 
people who are affected are not certain they will receive the 
benefits of the education programs the board will administer. 
They do not want to see the chiefs constitute the members of the 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen these cases before.  Funding is put in at the top 
but it does not seem to get down to the people who need it.  We 
do not have to look very far to see that happen. I am not saying 
it will happen in this case but the potential is there because of 
the concentration of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it would be wise for the government to pull back on 
pushing this bill through and take time to investigate properly 
some democratic amendments and see if they cannot be made to 
work.  The issue was raised in the House and in committee that 
people will not listen to an elected person who does not happen 
to be a chief.  But we all know that if a chief did not seek 
re-election or did not get elected he would not lose all his 
standing in the community by that one simple election.  He would 
be considered an elder in his community forever.  He would have a 
lot of standing and a lot of status and people would look to him 
for leadership, although not in a legislative sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We reject the premise that the people would not listen or care 
what was said by an elected board.  We believe there are enough 
people in these communities who can provide leadership and are 
willing to provide leadership, capable people who could take up 
the leadership available to them if this bill is amended to 
provide for an elected board of education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In this party we are great advocates of the equality of all 
citizens and our ultimate goal is that all aboriginal people 
fully participate in society, their own included, that they would 
not be denied because they were not chiefs of a band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party regretfully does not support this bill because it 
grants special powers and rights to the chiefs rather than 
spreading it out throughout the band.  We have expressed concern 
that the people who are served by the bill could be separated 
further from mainstream Canadian society by retreating into an 
education system set up particularly for native people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think all Nova Scotians should have the opportunity to hear 
how the Mi'kmaq governed themselves, how they lived before we 
came here, how they live now, how they have evolved in their 
society, their governing structures, their families.  All the 
things that matter to Canadians and to Nova Scotians and to the 
Mi'kmaq should be available to them through the regular school 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not opposed to the entire concept of the Mi'kmaq's having 
control over their education. We just want to see that control 
diffused a bit, not so concentrated in one group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been referred to on occasions by the department of 
Indian affairs and the Assembly of First Nations as important and 
historic.  Those words are important to burn into our 
consciousness, this important and historic piece of legislation 
that will establish a new relationship between aboriginal people 
and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is brand new there cannot be any excuse for rushing it 
through to royal assent.  We need to take the full time and if 
people are raising legitimate concerns, we need to hear them.  If 
they said they had not properly involved themselves in the 
consultation process, it is their responsibility to get there but 
it is our responsibility to ensure they get there and that they 
raise their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this is important and historic is this is a blueprint 
for further action by other bands.  It will not be the end of the 
road for this bill.  While it was stated that this bill is sure 
to increase educational opportunities for Mi'kmaq, it is really 
only as we have concrete evidence that it makes a difference, 
that we will be able to make those assertions.  Otherwise they 
are merely educated guesses at best and the proof will be found 
out only when we have gone several years down this road.  It is a 
road that we cannot come back from, so I urge the government to 
put some more thought into this thing and not rush ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get it right the first time and not have to go back and 
try to figure out a way to amend a bill that we see is flawed in 
such a fundamental way.

find it extremely interesting to hear the views of the hon. 
member, views which represent the Reform Party's position on this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also found it very interesting that the hon. member mentioned 
other parties are supporting this bill because those other 
parties do not have the strong democratic beliefs Reform Party 
has.  Yet the views expressed to me seem so contrary to 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a situation in this bill where aboriginal people 
have spoken out as to what they want, what they would like to 
have, and yet we have a party saying “what we say is much 
better, it should not be your chiefs, as you have decided, it 
should be your populace in general”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about democracy, we have nine bands agreeing to it 
and four that are not.  We know one principle of democracy is 
that majority rules.  I do not know what kind of votes the Reform 
Party takes when it exercises democracy, but certainly to me nine 
out of thirteen is a majority.  The fact that the other four 
still have the option to opt in is a very important point as 
well.  We have to question the views surrounding the objection to 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also hear questions and commentaries, and this is a 
commentary.  The hon. member indicated that he was afraid this 
system would separate aboriginal people from the mainstream of 
society.  How much more separated can aboriginal people become 
from the mainstream of society under their own system of 
education and their own sense of control than has been the case 
over the many years we have tried to make aboriginal people 
similar to everybody else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried to “civilize”.  We have tried to “assimilate”. 
Efforts have been made by the Canadian government over the years 
to do what it felt was right for aboriginal people rather than 
allow aboriginal people to create for themselves what they know 
to be in their best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the same attitudes are coming forward again: unless it is 
done our way it is not right.  I find this to be very disturbing. 
I urge very strongly members who promote that view to stop and 
look in a mirror and have a second thought about what they are 
actually saying.  I urge hon. members in the House not to be 
swayed by those arguments as we debate and as we consider the 
passage of what is truly historic and important legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding the name 
of the party of the hon. member who just spoke, we do not think 
it is as democratic as its name might imply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that there did not seem to be the level of consultation 
necessary for a bill termed important and historic.  Nobody is 
denying that we can move power down particularly from the government 
to the people.  We want enough people to have a say and express 
their opinions to be sure that is the direction in which they 
want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to whether or not the current system has worked, in places it 
does and in places it does not.  A number of chiefs, their 
executive assistants and education people appeared before us. 
They were well educated, well spoken individuals under the 
current system.  To think that we could put all the people into a 
basket and say they are poorly educated because they were 
educated under a system that is foreign to what we experienced in 
our past is ridiculous.  People will flourish under a 
multiplicity of systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one that may work very well for these people.  When 
something is as important and historic as the bill—and it may 
well prove to be one of the more important ones when it comes to 
how an entire generation is raised—it is surely not too much to 
expect real consultation so that we are sure we have democracy.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK277">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 8 consideration of the motion in 
relation to the amendments made by the Senate to Bill C-4, an act 
to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, despite the late hour it is a pleasure to rise tonight 
to address the Senate amendments to Bill C-4, an act to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the thrust of the Senate amendments I would 
like to address the process by which we find ourselves at this 
point this evening.  I feel very strongly that it is a faulty 
process.  We have seen that despite the pleas of western Canadian 
grain farmers upon which the bill will impact tremendously their 
concerns have largely gone unheeded by the government.  The 
process by which the legislation has moved through parliament is 
very faulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back to the early days of the 36th Parliament we find 
a commitment by the hon. minister for the Canadian Wheat Board 
and Natural Resources to bring forward the bill very early in the 
new mandate following the last election, and he did so.  I think 
the bill came in, in early October.  With the new process it 
moved directly to committee stage rather than having second 
reading debate, despite the fact that the majority of the 
opposition members in the House of Commons received a substantial 
amount of correspondence from western Canadian grain farmers 
about their concerns with the legislation.  Despite that the 
government moved it directly to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That process in itself is supposedly to allow more time at 
committee, more time in which to consider substantive amendments, 
more time in which to receive witnesses' testimony, more time in 
which members of all the various parties can cross-examine 
witnesses at committee stage.  Yet what we found was an 
accelerated process even at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government with its majority on the standing committee for 
agriculture moved the bill very rapidly through the committee 
stage and back to the House for report stage.  Sensing this, the 
opposition parties held back their amendments rather than put 
them forward at committee stage and see them voted down with very 
little attention paid to them and put forward at report stage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2055"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unbeknownst to us what we saw, unfortunately for western 
Canadian farmers, was that the government moved very quickly once 
it came back to the House for report stage and brought in time 
allocation to shut down further debate despite the fact that we 
had not had substantive debate at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a process that is deeply flawed and the government is not 
listening to concerns of farmers.  Despite the fact that there 
were some 48 amendments brought by the four opposition parties at 
report stage in the House of Commons, of which about 30 were from 
the official opposition, they were voted down.  They received 
very little time in debate because of the government's move to 
bring in time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw very substantive amendments such as Motion No. 1 which 
would have amended the preamble to the bill to ensure that the 
newly structured Canadian Wheat Board would act and govern itself 
in the best interest of farmers.  We saw amendments such as the 
one put forward that would have removed references to the 
president as a member of the board of directors so that the board 
of directors would have the power to hire and fire the president 
and CEO rather than that power resting with the minister as it 
currently does in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw amendments to make the 15 member board of directors fully 
elected rather than the existing 10 of 15 elected with the other 
5 appointed by the minister voted down by the government.  The 
list goes on.  Substantive amendments were brought forward not 
only by the official opposition, by the Reform Party, but by all 
opposition parties.  It was noted at the time during the 
abbreviated debate that probably nowhere else in the history of 
agricultural legislation had a government managed to anger 
everyone across the full spectrum dealing with the Canadian Wheat 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw people from every aspect who were deeply upset with the 
legislation and the fact that the government was not listening to 
the concerns of farmers and forging ahead with it despite their 
wish to see amendments brought forward.  The amendments that were 
put forward by the opposition were in direct reply to the 
concerns we heard expressed both at committee and in 
correspondence and direct communication with farm groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the presentation of the member for Brandon—Souris on 
Monday evening when Bill C-4 was before the House he expressed 
his opinion that the Reform Party and I had contradicted 
ourselves by criticizing the Senate amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at what these amendments are to accomplish.  The 
official opposition as well as all opposition members as soon as 
Bill C-4 went from the House of Commons to the Senate encouraged 
the Senate to hold hearings in western Canada to hear directly 
from western Canadian farmers about their concerns with the 
legislation.  The Senate to its credit did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was criticizing the Senate for the end result I was not 
criticizing the fact that it undertook the process of at least 
going out to hear from farmers.  Unfortunately it did not listen 
to them and bring forward the amendments that farmers are deeply 
seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the single biggest flaw in the legislation over 
and over again.  It is the lack of freedom of choice.  Under Bill 
C-4 farmers will continue to be heavily fined or even thrown in 
jail if they cross the U.S. border to market their grain.  This 
is unlike options that will soon be available to Ontario grain 
producers.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must question why the double standard.  Reformers have been 
doing that consistently and certainly western Canadian farmers 
have been doing that consistently.  Why is there one set of rules 
for Ontario grain farmers and a totally different one for western 
grain farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fundamental flaw with this legislation and with the 
operation of the Canadian Wheat Board will result in the 
divisiveness continuing.  The elections this bill will put in 
place for those 10 producer positions on the board of directors 
will end up simply in a battle between producers who are pro 
single desk selling, favour the present mandatory system, the 
status quo, and those producers who favour greater freedom of 
choice, democracy and a fully voluntary wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will end up having elections whereby farmers probably will be 
casting their ballots not for the candidate they believe brings 
the greatest skills and expertise to managing a $6 billion a year 
enterprise but rather for a single issue.  Are they in favour of 
maintaining the single desk selling structure of the Canadian 
Wheat Board or are they in favour of greater freedom of choice 
and looking at options that will allow farmers to market some or 
all their grain outside of the Canadian Wheat Board?  I think it 
is unfortunate that farmers will have to make that choice when 
they go to the ballot boxes, likely this fall, and vote for these 
10 producer positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing Senate committee on agriculture and forestry tabled 
its report on Bill C-4 on Thursday, May 21 after spending 
thousands of taxpayer  dollars travelling across western Canada 
to hear what farmers thought of the legislation.  I have referred 
to that and I actually applaud the Senate's initiative to get 
that feedback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It became very clear throughout the hearings, even to some 
senators, that the majority of farmers were unhappy with the 
legislation.  Farmers told senators they wanted more marketing 
options outside the Canadian Wheat Board and that the inclusion 
clause allowing for more grains to come under the Canadian Wheat 
Board's jurisdiction had to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some farmers were optimistic that the Senate would propose 
substantial changes to reflect this testimony, the Senate proved 
yet again that it is simply a puppet controlled by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend later in my presentation to move some subamendments to 
the five Senate amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the Senate amendments brought forward the first amendment is 
consequential to the second and the second will really require 
that the minister consult with the board of directors on the 
appointment of the president and CEO.  The minister still retains 
the power to arbitrarily appoint the president for the first year 
after the changes come into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe, and we made these amendments when the bill was 
before the House before, that it should be the board of directors 
with total control of appointing or ultimately have the power to 
fire the CEO and president if that person is not doing their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be proposing a subamendment to this that would turn this 
thing around and ensure that it is the board of directors that 
has that power and that it must consult with the minister before 
it appoints the CEO, not the other way around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third Senate amendment deals with the auditor general.  This 
too was an amendment brought forward by the Reform Party to open 
up the Canadian Wheat Board to audits by the auditor general and 
to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have repeatedly demanded that the Canadian Wheat Board open 
its books to the auditor general.  We applaud this as a tentative 
first step.  Here too there are some great deficiencies in what 
actually has taken place with the way this amendment is worded. 
This amendment does not stipulate that the auditor general must 
make his findings public.  A report made simply to the minister 
is ineffective and inadequate. This is a one time opportunity. No 
further audits are stipulated.  In addition, the amendment does 
not specify which year or years of the Canadian Wheat Board 
operations the auditor general is to audit. Conceivably the focus 
of the audit could be 20 years ago and nothing more recent.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When consulted by opposition MPs about this amendment the 
auditor general's office wrote a letter to the minister for the 
Canadian Wheat Board outlining his concerns with this amendment. 
Legal counsel at the auditor general's office were uncertain how 
this amendment would actually fit into the mandate and 
legislation governing the operations of the auditor general.  The 
letter expressed concern that the apparent intent of the 
amendment as drafted would not provide a great deal of value for 
the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too will be presenting a subamendment which will if passed 
ensure that the auditor general has an ongoing role to play in 
auditing the Canadian Wheat Board and ensure that he has the 
greatest amount of flexibility in how he conducts those audits, 
and ensure further that he reports as he should and as he does in 
other cases to parliament and not simply to the corporation and 
to the minister responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last two amendments the Senate brought forward deal with the 
exclusion and inclusion clauses.  The fourth amendment is with 
the exclusion and the fifth the inclusion, and they are 
consequential with one another.  Here too what we see is the 
Senate has merely reverted to basically the status quo and added 
one small hurdle where the minister would have to consult and 
hold a plebiscite were he to include any new grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already heard over and over again how farmers feel about 
this prospect, as slim as it might be, that there would be 
additional inclusion of other commodities under the Canadian 
Wheat Board's mandate. It is simply unacceptable. Once again I 
will be moving a subamendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on to talk about some recommendations that the Senate 
made in addition to these amendments, but I do not have the time. 
Therefore I will get to my subamendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations are not binding whatsoever on the government 
or on the minister. That is a great flaw as well.  I think some 
of the recommendations have some merit and I have said that 
publicly. But they are merely that, recommendations.  They are 
not amendments.  Farmers in particular in western Canada should 
clearly understand that.  The recommendations dealing with the 
electoral process for dividing up the election of the directors 
is on a geographic basis and the amendments dealing with the 
contingency fund cap are just recommendations.  They may or may 
not be acted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to moving my subamendments.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK279">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following: “a message be sent 
to the Senate to acquaint their honours that this House agrees to 
amendments number 1 and 4, made by the Senate to Bill C-4, an act 
to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act, and this House agrees with 
the principles set out in amendments number 2, 3 and 5, but would 
propose the following amendment: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendment 2 be amended by replacing all the words in section 
3.09(1) with the words “The president is appointed by the 
governor in council on the recommendation of the board of the 
directors and holds office during pleasure for the term that the 
board of directors may determine.” and by replacing the word 
“Minister” in section 3.09(2) and 3.09(2)(a) with the word 
“board” and replace the word “board” in section 3.09(2)(a) 
with the word “Minister”; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendment 3 be amended by replacing all the words in the first 
paragraph with the words “Within two years after the day this 
section comes into force, the Auditor General of Canada shall 
commence auditing the accounts, financial transactions, 
information management systems and management practices of the 
corporation for such fiscal years as the auditor general 
considers appropriate and reports of those audits shall be made 
to the corporation, the minister and parliament”; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendment 5 is amended by adding to section 5 the following: 
“(c) producer participation in the Canadian Wheat Board is 
voluntary”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, amendment No. 5 would not pass and it would not 
be allowed under any circumstances to include more commodities 
under the Canadian Wheat Board until such time as the Canadian 
Wheat Board is voluntary.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to speak to the Senate amendments.  I 
spoke in favour and somewhat reluctantly to the Senate 
amendments.  Frankly, a lot of the amendments put forward by the 
Senate were debated and discussed among the opposition members 
during committee.  I give the Senate credit for being able to put 
a better piece of legislation forward.  It is not the best piece 
of legislation by any stretch of the imagination but it is a 
better piece of legislation because it deals with a number of 
very sensitive areas.  It has assisted in putting forward some 
not terribly major or substantive changes but minor changes that 
would assist in this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all recognize, the government is the government and it 
will pass this legislation in some fashion.  It is unfortunately 
a fashion that will not solve any of the problems in western 
Canada.  When the legislation passes it will probably exacerbate 
the issues and the problems now faced by western Canadian 
producers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact I would suspect that with the faces in the House now, it 
may well mean we will be dealing with this legislation before the 
36th parliament is adjourned for good.  I think it will come back 
before the House within the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak to the amendments that were put forward.  The 
Progressive Conservative Party will be supportive of the 
amendments that were put forward for the simple reason that we 
have in general terms put these amendments forward ourselves in 
the House and certainly at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment, which is the president appointed by the 
board, is not a new amendment.  That has been discussed ad 
infinitum and is the right way to perform governance in any 
corporation.  When the CEO and president is responsible for the 
board of directors, it is an organization that is accountable. 
When the CEO is appointed by a third party then there is no 
accountability by the board of directors to that individual and 
quite frankly, the responsibility and accountability of that 
individual is compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that I finally have an audience.  It is nice to see, 
after a little bit of a faux pas, that the whip of the Liberal 
Party does have a bigger whip now than he perhaps had previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment is with respect to the auditor general but 
it is not something new.  This particular amendment was put 
forward previously.  The auditor general is the check and balance 
that the public have, but in this particular case it is a check 
and balance that the owners of the Canadian Wheat Board, who are 
the producers, want.  We are continually told that the ownership 
of the Canadian Wheat Board is the producers but unfortunately 
the producers do not have the opportunity of actually finding out 
what it is they do own and how the Canadian Wheat Board is being 
operated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate amendment that came forward is a better change to the 
act than there was previously.  Now at least the government has 
agreed that the auditor general should play a role in the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  However, it did not go far enough.  I 
spoke to this and the amendment does take it to another level 
which is a much better level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general should have the opportunity and right to 
audit the Canadian Wheat Board.  The Canadian public and the 
owners of the Canadian Wheat Board, the producers, should have a 
right to have access to what the auditor general says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general goes into government departments and tells 
them they are doing the job wrong and tells them how they can do 
the job better.  It is an operational audit, not just a financial 
balance sheet audit which producers are now receiving from the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment is a legitimate and solid amendment.  It would 
make that particular organization much more accountable to the 
people who own the organization, the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have discussed inclusion and exclusion ad nauseam, not just 
ad infinitum, that this is the most dangerous clause in this 
particular piece of legislation.  I stand on record in this House 
in saying that if the government got rid of the inclusion clause, 
we would reluctantly accept the legislation that came forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Senate change to the inclusion clause, which is a minor 
change, it does have a protection and a check and balance.  It 
always deals with plebiscite even in the original legislation. 
However, this now says that it is not just simply a decision of a 
minister, of the board of directors, the plebiscite, but the 
final resolution will have to come back to this House and be 
passed as legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure members that if there was a piece of legislation 
that hit the floor of this House that was going to include 
another commodity in the Canadian Wheat Board, there would be 
riots in the streets in western Canada.  The producers would not 
allow themselves to be put in a position where they were forced 
to sell other commodities on a non-voluntary basis through the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good amendment and I congratulate the member from 
Peace River.  It is a good amendment where it states that no 
inclusion clause should take place until producer participation 
in the Canadian Wheat Board is voluntary.  It makes sense.  We 
should not add any more commodities until it is a voluntary 
organization.  However, add the commodities when it does become 
voluntary so that the organization can compete on a fair market 
basis with other competitors that are in the marketplace right 
now.  It makes sense.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate to say it, it is the first time that the hon. member has 
really made sense with the four very good amendments.  However, 
we will support the amendments as put forward.  Unfortunately I 
believe, and I am sure the hon. member from Peace River also 
agrees, that these amendments, although very logical and will 
make a better piece of legislation, will not be approved.  It is 
very difficult to stand and say that because they would make it 
better they are still not going to be approved by this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the life of me, I do not know why the government will not 
approve these amendments.  It will not.  A couple of members over 
there are going to speak to it.  They will tell us exactly why it 
is such terrible thing to give people a choice; it is a terrible 
thing to make an organization accountable; it is a terrible thing 
that the chief executive officer should be responsible to the 
board of directors.  They are going to tell us why it is so awful 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry that these amendments will not go any further than 
the vote tomorrow.  These amendments, which have been tabled by 
almost every member of the opposition with the exception of the 
NDP, will come back to this House.  We may not be here to deal 
with them, but they will come back because this legislation is 
flawed.  It is not going to solve the problems that are out there 
in the marketplace.  It is going to exacerbate the problem.  The 
day after this legislation is proclaimed we are still going to 
have the problems that exist today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In saying that, I will also say that with the Senate amendments 
and the legislation that will come forward, reluctantly we will 
support Bill C-4.  I would much prefer to have it supported as 
amended but unfortunately, I do not think that is not going to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a very useful exercise.  I know the hon. member 
from Peace River has given us the process, as have a number of 
other speakers, as to how this legislation got to the floor of 
this House.  Even in that, I am a little disappointed that the 
government did not listen more to the producers that this 
affects. 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue of the 
Canadian Wheat Board and the amendments proposed is a very 
serious one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The memory of the member for Prince George—Peace River seems to 
be short in terms of what happened and how we got from where we 
were in the hearings to these amendments today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were very extensive hearings in western Canada by the 
previous Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. Members 
of this House, myself included, attended hearings where extensive 
information was put forward by farmers.  It is too bad the member 
was not there.  He was in his own area.  The standing committee 
put forward quite a number of amendments to the bill in terms of 
adopting what the producers wanted.  They made the board more 
powerful from a farmer's point of view and catered to what 
farmers asked us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said many times that without question the Canadian Wheat 
Board is an agency that is respected around the world.  It is 
respected by Canadian farmers. It has done well for Canadian 
farmers since its institution in 1935. During difficult years in 
the grain industry it has been able to maximize returns back to 
producers.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we compare our returns in net to those of the United States 
producers, we have usually and nearly always done better in 
maximizing net returns back to primary producers.  It is not just 
taking a spot market here or a spot market there, but what is 
actually put back into the pocketbooks of farmers.  The Canadian 
Wheat Board has been able to do well for farmers over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a moment about some tactics by the opposition 
party and what it is really doing.  The opposition members, 
especially those from the Reform Party, are playing into the 
hands of the major grain companies. In essence with the 
amendments they put forward today that is what they are doing. 
They would have the impact of weakening the marketing tools that 
western grain producers have available to them in terms of 
maximizing returns to themselves.  They are really playing into 
the hands of the likes of Cargill grain and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to travel to the United States 
extensively in my experience over the years.  It is interesting 
to talk to American farmers. Many of them wish they had an agency 
like the Canadian Wheat Board to give them the power that the 
Canadian Wheat Board has given to Canadian producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote what Robert Carlson of the United States 
national farmers union had to say before the House of 
Representatives agriculture committee: “From a competing 
farmers' perspective, we in the United States do not have a 
vehicle like the Canadian Wheat Board to create producer 
marketing power in the international grain trade.  We basically 
sell for the best price among our local elevator companies and 
lose our interest in our grain after that point. Our export trade 
is dominated by a few—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They get higher prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  If the member would listen, he would 
realize from a competing farmer's point of view what the mistakes 
of the amendments the Reform Party is proposing would do to 
Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying “Our export trade is dominated by a few large 
corporations who were interested in buying low and selling 
high”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the members in the Reform Party just do not understand 
that it is the lowest price that sets the price.  It is the 
lowest seller who sets the price in the international market. If 
there is one primary producer from Canada wanting to sell low, it 
brings down the price structure for the country as a whole. What 
the Canadian Wheat Board does by selling through a single desk is 
it tries to hold that price up and see that there is not negative 
competition undermining the Canadian price structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Carlson goes on to say “Our export trade is dominated by a 
few large corporations who are interested in buying low and 
selling high to enhance the earnings of their owners who are not 
generally the same people who produce the grain traded.  The 
stated goal of free trade proponents in agriculture is to have a 
grain trade without national borders, without internal subsidies, 
without quota or tariffs and without pooling or price enhancing 
mechanisms like STEs.  This would be a great world for grain 
buyers but a grim world for producers who would be fully at risk 
economically”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He concludes by saying “If we destroy”—and this is what the 
Reform Party is trying to do through its amendments—“the 
various institutions that farmers in many countries have built to 
help themselves survive economically, we will have nothing left 
but producers standing bare among the ruins of structures that 
once empowered and protected them in a marketplace dominated by 
giants”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where it is at.  The Canadian Wheat Board does give us 
considerable power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me come to the audit for a moment. Those members talk about 
wanting the auditor general to audit the books. The fact of the 
matter is that the Canadian Wheat Board's duly appointed external 
auditor chosen from the private sector is the well-respected 
accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche.  Fully audited financial 
statements appear in every Canadian Wheat Board annual report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-4 the producer controlled board of directors would 
have the power to create their own internal audit committee just 
like any other private company. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate approved an amendment to Bill C-4 which would 
authorize the auditor general to conduct a one-time audit of the 
accounts and financial transactions of the corporation and to 
report back to the board of directors, which has a two-thirds 
majority of farmers, and the minister.  That should be all that 
is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is, this is the annual report, audited, 
as I said, by a respected auditing firm.  It is 84 pages of 
financial transactions and information on the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  Do we have that information on Cargill Grain?  Certainly 
not.  Do we have that transparency with some of the major grain 
companies?  Certainly not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is reported in the introduction to the 1995-96 annual report 
of the Canadian Wheat Board that there was a performance 
evaluation done on the Canadian Wheat Board.  The performance 
evaluation conducted during the 1995-96 crop year showed that 
Canada ranks highly with its customers in such areas as quality 
of product, customer service, technical support and dependability 
of supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another study conducted by three economists showed that the 
Canadian Wheat Board's single desk generates an additional $265 
million per year in wheat revenue for farmers, thereby enhancing 
Canada's competitiveness and, in fact, putting more money in 
producers' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  You have made that point before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  The member said that I had made that 
point before.  Yes, certainly I have.  The value of the Canadian 
Wheat Board does not seem to have sunk in with the member for 
Lakeland because he continues to attack it.  He continues to talk 
about dual marketing, and there is no such thing.  We cannot have 
single desk selling and an open market working at the same time. 
They are a contradiction in terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a dual market we have an open market system and the 
open market system will undermine the very essence of what the 
single desk selling system is trying to do, which is to maximize 
returns to producers by preventing the negative competition that 
obviously the member for Prince George—Peace River supports.  He 
obviously must support lower prices for grain producers because 
that is what his amendment would mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board has worked on three pillars of 
strength:  single desk selling, price pooling and a partnership 
with the federal government which guarantees borrowings and 
initial prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Prince George—Peace River was putting forward an 
amendment, I believe, to go to a full board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the key question is, would the board of directors under 
this new board have real power?  I personally support an elected 
commission.  They have done well over the years.  We have 
appointed commissioners for their expertise in marketing.  They 
have done a great sales job in China and in other countries.  As 
I said earlier, the figures they have returned to producers are 
some $265 million per year over and above what they would have 
got if they did not have that board.  I supported that system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I clearly heard producers saying they wanted more 
control on the board.  Now they are going to have that control 
with 10 or 15 directors.  Will they have any real power?  The 
answer is clearly yes.  Contrary to what members opposite are 
saying, they will have real power.  As in any modern day 
corporation, all of the powers of the Canadian Wheat Board will 
be placed in the hands of the directors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation clearly states that directors “shall direct and 
manage the business and affairs of the corporation and are vested 
with all the powers of the corporation”.  That is what the 
legislation says.  They are vested with the powers of the 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would certainly carry a heavy load of responsibility being 
in charge of a $6 billion enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite asks “What about the CEO?”  The fact of 
the matter is, the directors will select one of their own to be 
chairperson.  The Reform Party claims that the board should select 
the chief executive officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is tremendous financial support from the taxpayers of 
Canada, from the Government of Canada, to western Canadian grain 
farmers through the Canadian Wheat Board, so certainly we have to 
have some say in terms of the appointment of the CEO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was backstopped last year to the tune of about $60 million, 
in terms of guarantees on borrowings and initial prices.  That is 
a heavy financial commitment for Canadian taxpayers and we want 
to ensure that we have some say in terms of who is appointed CEO. 
But we also ensure in the legislation that the board will have a 
lot to say and will be consulted in terms of the CEO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the directors will select one of their own to be 
chairperson.  They will be consulted on the appointment of the 
president and will determine the remuneration of the president, 
the chair and the directors.  If they do not like the CEO, they 
just lessen the remuneration.  It is that simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will oversee the Canadian Wheat Board's management and 
control and strategic direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the directors were not satisfied with any aspect of the 
Canadian Wheat Board operations, they would be able to make the 
necessary changes.  They would also be responsible for the 
introduction of new marketing tools such as cash trading, 
expedited adjustment payments and early pool cash outs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments put forward by the member for Prince 
George—Peace River would undermine this powerful marketing tool 
for western Canadian grain farmers.  On this side of the House we 
want to stand by western Canadian grain producers.  We want to 
ensure their prosperity in the future and one of the tools that 
they will have at their disposal is the new arrangements, the new 
powers, the new procedures granted to them by Bill C-4 which we 
are putting forward with the confidence that it will do the job 
we expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On questions and 
comments, the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River.  I 
would ask him to keep his intervention short. 
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know how anybody could keep their comments 
short after listening to that socialist rant from the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For any of the farmers who happen to be watching the debate 
tonight, and I am sure there are some, that type of nonsense is 
the very thing that people have struggled with and fought against 
to ensure their freedoms throughout history.  Throughout history 
people have had to struggle and fight to get freedoms because of 
that type of attitude.  That is the simple fact of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because my time is short I will just address one issue, the 
issue of dual marketing, the issue of freedom of choice, the 
issue of a voluntary wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that Ontario farmers have a fully elected board of 
farmers to run the Ontario Wheat Marketing Board?  They have a 
fully elected board, not two-thirds.  They are going to be able 
to market their grain directly out of the country themselves. 
They will not have to go through the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that what is fair and right and works in Ontario for 
some reason cannot work in western Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not at all stung by 
being called a socialist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  That is because you are one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  I do not know about my colleagues, but

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have three short questions.  I would like the hon. member to know 
that I have been on the phone with a number of farmers in my 
riding who are watching CPAC tonight and they have asked me to 
ask these three questions and they want to hear the member's 
answer tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 1:  There is an 82 year old grain farmer in my 
riding who says “I fought for freedom.  Why have I lost it?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 2:  One farmer says “Occasionally over the years 
Revenue Canada has sent in auditors to audit my books that were 
done by a private company.  Why can't we send in the auditor 
general occasionally to confirm this private company?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 3:  The last question is from a young farmer who 
would like to know “Why aren't the Ontario and Quebec farmers 
rushing to get on board this wonderful Canadian Wheat Board?  Why 
aren't they rushing to sign up if it is such a good deal?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in response to the 
question the member for Wild Rose had with regard to the 82 year 
old farmer who claims he fought for freedom, that is true and 
that is, in fact, why we are having this debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is freedom under the Canadian Wheat Board.  There is 
freedom in this country.  We had the Canadian Wheat Board 
advisory committee which was elected to advise the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  In all the recent elections to that board the 
pro-Canadian Wheat Board candidates won.  That is clearly showing 
that support is there from the farm community in the west in 
terms of electing pro-wheat board producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked a question about Revenue Canada.  In fact the 
Senate amendment deals with that.  I personally do not see it as 
being necessary.  As I said, the Canadian Wheat Board puts out an 
annual report with audited financial statements.  It is very 
transparent, not like the Cargill grain company and other 
companies.  All the facts are very visible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote a portion of what farmers are saying in the west. 
The president of the National Farmer's Union is Nettie Wiebe.  I 
believe some members know her.  She had this to say:  “The vast 
majority of farmers want to see the Canadian Wheat Board 
strengthened and expanded.  They want to see it safeguarded in 
the upcoming 1999 round of World Trade Organization talks”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
cover later some of the comments the member made.  My question to 
the member for Malpeque is quite simple and straightforward. How 
is it that he, a dairy farmer from Prince Edward Island, thinks 
he knows better than farmers of Ontario who have opted clearly 
for a voluntary and accountable wheat board? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, at least the member for 
Lakeland is getting a little closer.  The last time I stood in 
this House he called me a potato producer and now he is getting a 
little closer to the industry.  I know what is going on in 
western Canada.  I spent 17 years organizing in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in more farm kitchens and town halls across western 
Canada than he ever has. I stood in the streets demonstrating to 
strengthen the Canadian Wheat Board powers over the years when 
some governments tried to undermine it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a former minister of the Canadian Wheat Board, Charlie 
Mayer, tried to undermine the authority of the Canadian Wheat 
Board by taking barley out from under it illegally, I stood in 
the streets and fought for it. Where the heck was he when we 
needed to do that?  I have every right as a Canadian and former 
farm leader to stand in this House and express my opinions and 
the opinions I know very well of western Canadian farmers in 
their support for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nettie Wiebe, president of the farmers union said: “The vast 
majority of farmers want to see the Canadian Wheat Board 
strengthened and expanded in this country”.  The amendments put 
forward by the member for Prince George—Peace River would 
undermine the very authority that farmers want strengthened and 
expanded. 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member 
for Lakeland said a few minutes ago that it is an old speech he 
had from the member for Malpeque.  If new content were required 
for all these speeches we would have been mute on this point 
about October 15 because there has been nothing new on this 
debate since about the first week of the debate.  It has been 
downhill every since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here tonight again in part because of the amendments that 
have been brought forward by the member for Prince George—Peace 
River.  The Senate has pronounced on Bill C-4.  Following 
hearings in western Canada earlier this spring senators have 
proposed three amendments and made two recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process as amended by the Senate has now returned to the 
House.  That the government is introducing it into the House 
means it approves the bill as amended or that it at least accepts 
its provisions otherwise it would have chosen not to reintroduce 
it.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill as amended will be debated in a package, one debate, no 
splitting off to discuss and vote on each amendment separately. 
There will be one vote only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the vote passes, and the government will ensure it does, the 
bill will then be ready for royal assent.  It will not return to 
the other place for a further vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate amendments include the deletion of the existing 
inclusion and exclusion clause.  There remains a mechanism for 
having the inclusion or exclusion of a grain but the reality is 
that it leaves the initial decision in the hands of the minister. 
In the bill's earlier stage the decision to include to exclude 
would have been triggered by a farm group or groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one more indication for us that the bill does not do what 
the minister has been saying constantly that it was going to do 
which was to put grain farmers in the driver's seat. Every time 
they get into a narrow corner they say they have to give the 
control back to the government or in this case the minister. 
Instead of putting them in the driver's seat, as the minister 
responsible for the wheat board has been saying, it really puts 
grain farmers further into the back seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has to consult with the board of directors and hold 
a producer vote on inclusion-exclusion.  In addition, parliament 
will now have to pass specific legislation to include or exclude 
a grain.  We believe that essentially this is a capitulation of 
the business and the right wing farm lobby which wanted both 
clauses to be deleted from the bill.  It did not really want the 
exclusion clause deleted, but we are prepared to take that in 
order to get rid of the inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our point of view the inclusion clause was one of the only 
redeeming features of the bill from the point of some wheat board 
supporters, including the NFU as has been noted by the previous 
speaker and the wheat board advisory committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to point two of the Senate recommendations, the 
Senate amendments stipulate that the minister consult with the 
board before appointing a president.  The minister did not have 
to do this under Bill C-4 but said he would have anyway so in 
reality it is not a big win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the auditor general and access to information point, the 
amendment from the Senate says that within two years of the bill 
coming into force the auditor general should commence an audit of 
the corporation.  The question of the wheat board's transparency 
was a big issue for the Reform Party and wheat board opponents. 
The minister responsible for the board was reluctant to allow the 
auditor general in but has now obviously agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senators do not suggest that the board be open to access to 
information laws.  They say the new members of the board will 
have access to all relevant information and they should decide 
what is and what is not made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to those three Senate amendments there are two 
recommendations.  Of the ten elected members of the board of 
directors, Saskatchewan would have five, Alberta three and 
Manitoba two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the regulations stipulate the contingency fund will be 
no larger than $30 million.  This is a small step in the right 
direction but the CEO of the wheat board thought that the 
contingency fund could be as high as $575 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is that the contingency fund be separated into three 
accounts defined by their uses, guaranteeing initial payments, 
providing for losses from pool accounts, and providing for 
potential losses from cash trading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate also observed that farmers should vote for directors 
on a one farmer, one vote basis rather than on the basis of 
volume of grain delivered, which was a suggestion from the Reform 
Party last fall. There should be spending limits in elections but 
the senators came up with no suggestion as to what that should 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senators noted the intense and bitter debate around dual 
marketing.  They took no position but said that the new board of 
directors could make decisions on this in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our part, the federal NDP caucus opposed the bill even with 
the inclusion clause.  We will oppose the bill with these 
amendments which essentially removes this clause.  We would 
oppose the further recommendations we have heard tonight made by 
the member for Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus opposes Bill C-4 because it does undermine the 
integrity of the wheat board and will continue to undermine 
farmer confidence in it.  We believe farmers cannot afford the 
contingency fund is in the bill and they do not want it. 
The senators have accepted the contingency fund although they 
recommend it be limited to $30 million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the few positive clauses from our point of view was the 
possibility for the board to either add or delete grains from its 
mandate.  The decision to include or exclude a grain would have 
been triggered by requests from farm groups but would have 
required a vote by all the farmers affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A coalition that included the Winnipeg Commodities Exchange and 
other corporate groups lobbied hard against the inclusion clause. 
To achieve their end they said both inclusion and exclusion 
should be dropped and the senators have capitulated to this 
aggressive lobby.  In place of a democratic process to include or 
exclude the senators offer an alternative that would make it 
almost impossible to ever add a grain or delete one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion clause was one of the few redeeming features of 
Bill C-4 and it has now been gutted.  We in this caucus have 
always been strong supporters of the wheat board because it works 
in the best interests of farmers. We must work together to make 
sure that the wheat board has a healthy future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this whole business of secrecy about the wheat board I agree 
very much with the comments made by the member for Malpeque.  We 
are talking about a $6 billion a year operation.  I has been 
accountable to parliament.  Parliament has required that an 
external independent auditor scrutinize the wheat board's books. 
The auditor is Deloitte & Touche and each year the report is 
filed with parliament.  The last audit I saw was the 1996 audit. 
That well recognized, well respected accounting company found the 
wheat board's books to be in fine shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the wheat board is exempt from provisions of the 
Access to Information Act and we feel that the overriding reason 
for that is customer confidentiality and the conduct of the wheat 
board's commercial activities.  If customers big and small cannot 
be assured that their business dealings with the board are held 
in confidence they will go elsewhere with their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the same groups that frequently claim 
that the wheat board does not get a good enough price for grain 
would now like to undercut the board's ability to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board is probably the best grain marketing 
organization in the world and it has served western farmers well 
for more than 60 years.  It is a great Canadian success story and 
it is accountable to the people of Canada through parliament and 
through an external audit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this caucus have always supported the wheat board because 
we believe, as I have said, that it works in the best interests 
of farmers.  We oppose Bill C-4 because it is flawed legislation 
and will only serve to undermine the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform opposes Bill C-4 because Reformers do not think it goes 
far enough, quickly enough to destroy the board faster.  We are 
not in support of Bill C-4 and we are certainly not in support of 
the amendments presented tonight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I 
will comment on in my presentation are the amendment presented by 
the Reform agriculture critic under three headings, the ending of 
the wheat board monopoly, more transparency within the board, and 
the accountability to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to comment on some of the things that have been said by 
members from other political parties.  I will start with the 
member from the Conservative Party who spoke earlier. He said he 
would reluctantly support these amendments even though he agreed 
with them wholeheartedly.  I wonder why that would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the reason is that member has Conservative comrades in 
the Senate and those Conservative senators may be pulling his 
string a bit.  They are kind of saying support what they said.  I 
give the member some credit that he is not just going to have his 
strings jerked completely by the Senate. I thought I would make 
that comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to make some comments about what the member for Malpeque 
said, and he is a dairy farmer, not a grain farmer.  We have in 
the Reform Party over 20 farmers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I have been accused of not being a grain producer. 
Besides being a dairy producer and a beef producer I also grow 
grain.  I have also grown barley, wheat and oats.  How I wish we 
had a Canadian Wheat Board in P.E.I.— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As you know, mares 
eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy.  It is now 
time for the hon. member for Lakeland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  My apologies, Mr. Speaker.  I did not 
realize the member had grown any grain, but I do know he does not 
market any of it through the wheat board.  I wonder why that is. 
I have not heard the member lobbying for the wheat board 
jurisdiction to be expanded into his province.  If he did he 
would not last long as the member for Malpeque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about how he was a spokesperson for a farm 
group.  He was.  I remember well something he said about 17 years 
as a member of the National Farmers Union.  I would like to ask 
him a question. I know he cannot reply, which is good.  I know 
the answer anyway. How did membership of the National Farmers 
Union change under his presidency and beyond?  The answer is that 
it declined steadily, to the point that it moved from a fairly 
substantial farm group to a very small farm group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member sings the praises of the Canadian Wheat Board.  I 
want to make a message very clear once again, which I have done I 
do not know how many times, because it seems like the hon. member 
for Malpeque and some of his comrades in the Liberal Party did 
not get the message.  The message is that the issue never has 
been whether or not the wheat board functions well in terms of 
providing a service for farmers.  I do not think that has ever 
been the key issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key issue has been that the wheat board functions as a 
monopoly and farmers have no choice.  That is by far the most 
important issue that has been taking up the debate regarding the 
wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again and again, in spite of my having clarified it dozens of 
times in the House even while the member for Malpeque was here, 
he still tries to say that the debate is about getting rid of the 
wheat board.  It is not about getting rid of the wheat board.  It 
is about giving farmers the choice either to market through the 
board or somewhere other than through the board.  That is the 
issue.  I wish he would not try to distort it.  The issue is 
choice, that it be a voluntary board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is someone who claims that he supports the wheat board.  How 
on earth can he go against the original principle of the wheat 
board which was to be a voluntary organization?  That was only 
changed in 1942-43 under the War Measures Act when the monopoly 
was put in place.  It is interesting how the member conveniently 
forgets that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about the three issues I mentioned before.  The 
first is the key issue, the issue of putting an end to the wheat 
board monopoly.  That is what the debate has been about for some 
time in western Canada and in Ontario.  It was fortunate enough 
to have a vote on it and choose to sweep the monopoly aside and 
give farmers a choice.  That is what there will be in Ontario as 
a result of the changes made. Why that cannot happen in western 
Canada, why that vote will never be allowed, as is apparent under 
the government, I cannot answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to end the monopoly to give farmers the freedom to 
choose, to put in place a dual market or an opt out clause or 
some mechanism to give them a choice.  That is what the Reform 
agriculture critic, the member for Prince George—Peace River, 
stated in his amendment.  It is crucial and it is in the 
amendment.  For that reason alone the amendment should be 
supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to whether that is what farmers want is not an issue of 
debate any more.  We have had the polls and we have indication 
after indication in every province in western Canada and in my 
constituency that says farmers want a choice.  It is not an issue 
any more. 
I do not know why the member for Malpeque keeps saying that is 
somehow the issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue is more transparency within the board.  I say 
within the board because I believe probably a majority of western 
Canadian farmers want the wheat board to continue to exist.  That 
is not the issue.   Most farmers would say they want the wheat 
board.  They think it is a useful body. They think they would use 
it sometimes but would like the option not to use it if they so 
choose.  We need change within the board that will make it more 
transparent and more accountable.  I wish members would listen to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Prince George—Peace River, the Reform 
agriculture critic, dealt with the issue of transparency and 
accountability in his amendment, two more good reasons to support 
the amendment.  The Conservative Party which has not exactly been 
supportive of Reform is to support these amendments.  The member 
who spoke knows that western farmers want these changes.  He has 
no doubt about it, just as I do not and just as the other 20 plus 
Reformers who are and have been farmers know these changes are 
wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate proposed to have the auditor general look at the 
books.  There are a few things wrong with that.  First, we do not 
know that the auditor general would have access to everything he 
wanted access to.  Second, would he report to parliament?  No. He 
would report to the minister or to the board of directors which 
is partly appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are waiting for a ruling on what the auditor general said, 
that it may not be legal.  This amendment the Senate has proposed 
and we support may not be legal.  It may be outside what the 
auditor general is legally mandated to do.  That is another 
concern.  Parliament gets a limited report from the auditor 
general which is not made public, and what have we gained?  I 
suggest probably not very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue of accountability to farmers is to have a 
completely farmer elected board of directors with real control. 
If that is combined with a voluntary board as it originally 
operated in western Canada and transparency so we know what is 
going on inside the board, we will have a wheat board that will 
be supported by western farmers.  A vast majority of western 
farmers would support and use the wheat board under the 
conditions that it is voluntary, transparent and more 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the comments.  We are going through this debate again. 
I do not think there is any need for me to comment further.  I 
look forward to questions from members of the other parties. 
<P><A NAME="LINK287"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  It is a pleasure to 
speak probably for the last time to this issue.  I will speak 
directly to you, Mr. Speaker.  Being from the great province of 
Alberta you will realize that what I am saying is absolutely 
correct in the eyes and in the minds of the farmers, particularly 
those from Wild Rose with whom I have become the most familiar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make one comment in regard to the speech given by the 
Conservative Party member.  It was sort of a half-baked speech in 
which the member overwhelmingly supported this or that but will 
reluctantly vote.  I am not sure what he meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to know that I am quite proud of two 
colleagues in my caucus, one from Prince George—Peace River and 
the other from Portage—Lisgar.  They were debating this issue a 
long time before this member ever reached the House.  In fact 
there were only two members in the Conservative Party at that 
time.  I guarantee the fellow from Sherwood did not know the 
first thing about a wheat board like most members on that side. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2210"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am as concerned as many farmers in Wild Rose with whom I have 
been speaking on the phone for the last two or three hours. They 
would like to know if the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
campaigned on supporting the wheat board in his riding.  I am 
sure the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration campaigned hard 
on the wheat board issue in her riding.  I am sure that all the 
Ontario MPs campaigned very hard in their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They support the bill but it does not reflect on their 
constituents one iota.  It reflects on western farmers and they 
do not care about western farmers.  If they did care they would 
have recognized, as I recognize, that not too long ago in a very 
legal referendum in the province of Alberta 66% of barley 
producers voted in favour of a dual marketing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other two Liberal members from Edmonton remember it.  They 
sure have a funny way of showing it when it comes to voting in 
the House of Commons.  They do not care about what the western 
farmer is going through.  They only care about what their 
almighty front row bench tells them to do.  The whip cracks and 
they will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through you, Mr. Speaker, I will speak to the fellows who I know 
are watching on TV tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  I apologize to them for the noises 
across the way.  They do not know any better.  I hope my fellow 
farmers will forgive them.  They cannot help what they do.  It is 
getting awfully close to summer and it is nice to direct my 
comments to someone I know is alive, sober and doing well.  I 
will not pay any attention to what is going on across the way.  I 
want the farmers in western Canada to remember that it was the 
voters in this Liberal group who have forced this issue upon 
them.  None of their constituents are affected by what happens 
with the wheat board bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked on the phone tonight to a farmer from Cremona whose 
name is Gordon Reid.  I know Liberals are not interested in 
hearing what he said but I want to quote him.  He would welcome a 
phone call from any of the experts opposite.  With unity being a 
major issue in the country, he asked why we are treated like 
second class citizens.  His number is 403-637-2193.  They should 
write it down.  He would welcome a call from them any time.  He 
has a few things to say to them on behalf of a lot of farmers.  I 
hope they call him up right this minute to say hello. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also they would like to know what it takes to get an effective 
Senate.  The Senate went into the western part of the country and 
talked to the farmers. I heard what farmers had to say.  I took 
in some of the sessions. All my staff took in the sessions, 
recorded them, took all the information.  Only a bit of what we 
heard from farmers in western Canada is shown in the amendments 
from the Senate.  They are concerned about the Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is a brave fellow like he thinks he is, I will 
take him out back here and we will call him together.  I would 
not want him to lose the number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We are not going to 
have another word about heart attacks from this side. We are not 
going to have another word about going out back. Stay on the 
topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was just going to 
where the phones are.  We do not have phones in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I don't think they understand much.  Maybe if a guy went over 
and gave them a shot in the head they would understand something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has been in the views of these farmers a failure to 
them.  They feel that the Senate is supposed to represent the 
regions of the land and that they should not be exploited by the 
bigger regions.  They feel that is what has happened in this 
case, and they are extremely disappointed with this government 
for allowing it to happen.  They feel they have been exploited by 
the larger populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the new member from British Columbia would finish yawning and 
listen to what goes on out west, he would know what I say is 
true.  I would advise him to pay close attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I wish you a good summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. Obviously the member for Wild Rose has had a 
few minutes of wild times.  Last night in our debate the member 
for Wild Rose at 9.45 stood up in the House of Commons and not 
only on the record but off the record called us liars.  A number 
of my colleagues, including the member for Wentworth—Burlington, 
heard him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Ottawa Centre approached the Chair a little earlier on this. It 
had been brought up earlier. This is the first opportunity that 
he has had when the member for Wild Rose was in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing the member for Wild Rose, as we all do, and knowing what 
happens sometimes in the heat of debate, the member for Ottawa 
Centre has indicated that if the member for Wild Rose would have 
the courtesy to remove any suggestion of calling that member a 
liar, it would be appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  First of all, I called no individual 
a liar.  That is false.  I said it is too bad that people have to 
lie to try to make a point.  I never talked about any individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an individual says that I take children and hold them by 
the heels and whip them, I have to say something about that.  Any 
member who would make a comment like that should apologize to me. 
I will not take back anything I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The word “lie” is 
recorded in <I>Hansard</I>.  It is not a word that is used in this 
Chamber.  The hon. member for Wild Rose has had his say.  As far 
as I am concerned, the matter is over now.  Questions and 
comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened intently to the member for Wild Rose, and I want to 
correct something that I am sure he did not intend to say but 
said it nevertheless. 
He talked about the fact that 66% of Alberta farmers voted 
against the barley vote in 1997, which is correct. But without a 
blush he segued that 66% of Alberta vote into a vote by western 
farmers against the barley vote when we all know that the overall 
vote in western Canada was 62% in favour of retaining barley 
under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Wheat Board.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member for Wild Rose would acknowledge those are 
the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is correct 
because the vote he is referring to was an all or nothing vote. 
That is not what the Alberta farmers voted on initially.  The 
Alberta farmers want dual marketing. Members should get that 
through their heads.  They want dual marketing, end of comment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK289"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
never seen anybody who stretches the imagination as much as the 
member for Wild Rose.   We have somebody here from the New 
Democratic Party who has shown once again how the member for Wild 
Rose has stretched the truth to the limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member refused to stand up tonight in order to apologize to 
the House.  He has disgraced the House one more time.  If he has 
the audacity and the true honour of a member of the House he 
would apologize not to me but to the House of Commons and to the 
taxpayers of this city and this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The member cannot 
answer since he is not in his seat. 
<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a couple of 
evenings ago there was a dearth of Liberals in the House, in fact 
an embarrassing dearth, and we all know the consequences of that. 
I think that may be preferred over the drunken brawling group we 
have over there this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I would ask the hon. 
member for Elk Island to withdraw that last remark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, out of sheer respect for the 
Chair I withdraw that remark unequivocally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is all this shouting, this disrespect for an issue that is 
very important to western Canadians, to Canadian farmers in the 
prairies and in British Columbia.  It is absolutely incredible to 
me that there is in the House a group of parliamentarians who 
think that it is within their purview to impose on western 
Canadians a system of marketing their grain which they themselves 
do not subscribe to and which the farmers in the west do not 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that they can come up with this plebiscite that was held. 
But as my colleague just said a few minutes ago, that plebiscite 
was do you want the whole wheat board basically the way it is or 
do you want it scrapped.  Obviously I would vote in favour of 
keeping the wheat board because there are a lot of small farmers 
who do not have the ability or the capacity to get into marketing 
their own grain and finding the best market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, there are now literally hundreds of farmers 
who are very well able and who meet many opportunities.  I appeal 
to these members who have a power here which they are abusing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By a democratic system there are more Liberals in the House than 
other members.  That is true.  I acknowledge that. The fact is 
they got 38% of the vote across the country and they got around 
20% of the votes in my province. They do not represent the wishes 
of those people out there.  It is that simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this as carefully as I can.  I do not even like using this 
term but there is a degree of arrogance.  From 3,000 miles away 
or whatever it is, it is a very great error to say that we here 
know better than those out there what is best for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us reverse it.  I am going to deal with the dairy business 
right now.  There are marketing boards.  There are quota systems 
and all that in the dairy.  Let us just for a moment say the 
system was reversed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that parliament was in Alberta.  Let us say that all 
the wheat farmers in Alberta decided that the dairy farmers only 
in Ontario and Quebec and in the Atlantic provinces could no 
longer get their best prices for their dairy products. Most of 
them sell the raw milk. They could no longer sell to that buyer 
who gave them the best price.  In all instances they had to sell 
to someone else who gave them between 20% and 25% less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the members can now see what would happen to them.  They 
would say that is not right, that is not fair for those western 
farmers out there to impose on us at a financial loss something 
that we do not want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening here and that is why this is such a 
serious issue.  It is a very serious issue.  We ask the farmers 
in a fair question would they like to keep the wheat board the 
way it is, would they like the wheat board reformed, would they 
like the democratic right if an opportunity came to sell some of 
the grain they raised at their expense on their own land. If an 
opportunity came to sell a couple of truckloads at 25% higher 
than what they can get through the wheat board, they would want 
that right. The farmers are saying that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are prevented from exercising that right because of a law 
made here in distant Ottawa.  What I am doing right now is simply 
appealing to this government. I know the whole democratic system 
is skewed here.  The minister for the wheat board who makes the 
final decision and who gives the whip the instruction on how all 
the other MPs are to vote on command, I do not know if that 
minister is now hearing my appeal. I do not know whether he is 
able to get to a television or whether he is going to hear this 
appeal.  He is the one who makes the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way I might as well be debating with empty chairs since the 
ones who are filling the chairs here tonight are unable to really 
respond to what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have to vote according to the party line.  Here we have 
very fine subamendments from the member for Prince George—Peace 
River that would correct at least some of the errors in the 
present legislation and make it palatable to western farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet what we are getting is resistance.  What we are getting is a 
lot of laughter and disrespect.  Not anymore.  I want to be 
honest here.  They are paying great attention.  I appreciate 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These subamendments which my colleague has brought forward 
accurately reflect at least some of the changes farmers in the 
west are pleading for. I appeal to members to talk to the 
minister, get together, do what is right and pass these 
subamendments.  If this bill goes through in its present form 
with these subamendments, maybe in the future we can make more 
adjustments.  I believe the prerogative of parliament is to make 
amendments to laws from time to time.  That is what we are here 
for.  It really should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not, there has been a failure of this government to 
respond to the basic freedoms which these western farmers 
deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have used the following example before, but per chance some of 
the members here tonight were not here when I gave it previously 
or perhaps have not read every page of <I>Hansard</I> since we got 
here. I would like to refer to this one example of a farmer I 
talked to who said a federal government agency, the Farm Credit 
Corporation, is putting pressure on him. It wants cash.  It is 
threatening to foreclose.  This was a couple of years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile he has his granaries full of grain, the finest grain 
in the world because this farmer is a very meticulous farmer.  He 
farms well.  He has excellent quality grain.  It is the most 
desirable durum wheat in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wanted to sell that grain but the wheat board at that time 
was not issuing a quota, so the grain sat in the bins.  He could 
have put that grain on a truck and sold it because he knew 
somebody who was ready to buy it, not only to buy it and give him 
the cash so that he could make the payment which was being 
demanded, but he could actually get in this instance around 25% 
more than he could have expected to have received from the wheat 
board even with the final payments.  But the law prevented him 
from doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So he had to go to the bank, get on his knees and say please 
wait until the wheat board gives him the freedom to market my 
grain.  The bank said it would put more liens on his property, 
take all the buildings, take all the land, take all the grain in 
the bins, his animals in the barn, all as security while it waits 
for the wheat board to sell his wheat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying by this that the wheat board does not sell 
wheat.  It sells a lot of wheat.  There are a lot of farmers who 
are well served by the wheat board.  There are a lot of farmers 
who do not get into these crunches.  But when a farmer does hit 
the wall like this and that farmer is able to find a solution to 
the problem and is prevented by law from actually implementing a 
totally obvious solution, taking the grain which he owns and 
selling it to a person who is willing to buy it for a reasonable 
price, surely that should not be against the law in this country. 
It is a drastic limitation of one's personal freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to members sincerely on behalf of western farmers to do 
what is right for a change.  I will not even say for a change.  I 
do not want to insult them.  Do what is right in this case.  Make 
the decision to accept these subamendments.  Make the 
corrections.  Let us look to the future.  Our western farmers are 
the backbone of agriculture production in the country, the wheat 
basket of the world.  We need to respond.  We need to do what is 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government should not be standing in the way of 
keeping farmers in business successfully.  It should not be the 
case.  So I appeal for more freedom.  Let us work toward it, 
accept the amendments now, and then we will change more later on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to clear up a couple of misperceptions 
communicated by the member for Malpeque earlier in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first deals with the subamendment I put forward that would 
grant the auditor general greater flexibility in how he would 
conduct the audit of the Canadian Wheat Board.  The hon. member 
for Malpeque has suggested that this Senate amendment which calls 
for this one time audit by the auditor general would satisfy 
those farmers who are seeking greater transparency and 
accountability on the part of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to the fact that the very reputable auditing firm 
Deloitte & Touche currently does the auditing for the Canadian 
Wheat Board and I recognize that fact.  The simple fact that the 
member does not recognize and never has recognized in all the 
debates that we have had on this subject is that the auditor 
general goes far beyond a financial audit.  He goes far beyond 
just counting the beans, as it were, which another auditing firm 
does, which accountants do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows that.  For him to suggest anything 
different is ridiculous.  One amendment I put forward, the 
subamendment to the Senate amendments, deals with giving the 
auditor general far greater flexibility in how he would conduct 
his audit so that he would look at the actual efficiency of how 
the Canadian Wheat Board markets wheat and barley in western 
Canada and also ensure that he reports back to parliament, not 
simply to the minister and to the board of the directors of the 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to clear that up and ask for some comments from the 
hon. member for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the hon. member for Malpeque suggested that this new 
board of directors that will be comprised of 10 producer 
representatives of the 15 will have lots of power to control the 
operation of the Canadian Wheat Board. That is built into the 
bill, he suggested. He went so far as to reiterate and echo the 
remarks made by the hon. minister for the Canadian Wheat Board 
which that minister has often made that the board could always 
reduce the remuneration of the CEO and thereby have control of 
the CEO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether the member for Malpeque has ever heard of 
wrongful dismissal, but if the board of directors were to do that 
I would suggest that the board of directors would be taken to 
court by that CEO very quickly because it would be a breach of 
contract. I am sure that would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member for Elk Island to comment on that 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague raises these very 
important issues and accountability is certainly one of them.  As 
we all know, the auditor general does more than just balance the 
books.  He also looks at whether the Canadian taxpayer is getting 
value for his dollar, is the organization strong and properly 
run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has a wider scope in doing the audits and I 
agree 100% with what my hon. colleague said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have this smoke and mirrors thing with the board.  There 
are some elected members and some appointed members. It is 
wonderful for the farmers to be able to elect some of their 
members but it should be, as has been mentioned by my colleague 
and also is contained in one of the subamendments, the 
prerogative of an elected board to choose its CEO.  It should not 
be a political thing again from distant Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe very strongly that western farmers are well able to 
run their own organization. They are well able to hold it 
accountable.  There is no reason in the world why that board 
cannot have the primary say, the initiation of the choice of the 
CEO.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
a question for the hon. member for Elk Island but first I would 
like to clear up an inaccuracy that has been perpetrated by the 
New Democratic Party and the governing party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that the member for Wild Rose in answer to a question 
gave some incorrect facts.  They are wrong.  The numbers given by 
the hon. member for Wild Rose are accurate.  When the member said 
that 66% of farmers from Alberta supported giving freedom of 
choice in barley, he was correct.  When he said a majority in 
western Canada support freedom of choice, he was correct.  There 
was a poll done by the Saskatchewan government, which supports 
the wheat board monopoly wholeheartedly, which showed that more 
than 50% of Saskatchewan farmers support freedom of choice.  That 
is clearly supportive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to me that through this whole debate the 
minister responsible for the wheat board has not been in this 
House for one minute.  He has not listened to a thing that was 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I concur with the statement on 
the statistics.  But I see the minister is here now and we can no 
longer say the minister has not been here for one second.  He has 
been here now for six.  It is great to see him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very important when we have a debate such as this 
that we hear each other.  It is not sufficient to simply schedule 
time until 4 o'clock in the morning to make speeches. We must 
also have people here hearing the arguments and who are open to 
change because of those arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I made a statement earlier that the minister responsible 
for the wheat board was not in the House. In fact, he is not 
again.  But he was for about 30 seconds— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  All members know 
that we do not refer to the presence or absence of other members 
in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really should 
have answered the questions from the member for Prince 
George—Peace River because his comments were not directed to the 
member for Elk Island, they were more directed at me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the audit I have a question for the member for Elk 
Island.  The member for Prince George—Peace River in his 
questioning the member for Elk Island talked about the audit.  My 
points still stand regarding what I said earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member for Elk Island could explain to us the 
procedure the Canadian Wheat Board goes through currently to 
explain what is happening at the board in terms of its financial 
affairs and in terms of its marketing.  It puts out its annual 
report. It has endless district meetings where it has a question 
and answer period.  In 11 districts across western Canada the 
commissioners themselves go out— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Elk Island has one minute and thirty seconds to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course the question is one 
of accountability.  The way it looks right now, the auditor 
general will have a one shot opportunity and then after that we 
will have the commercial auditors.  This is not sufficient.  We 
are calling for the auditor general to look at this as a 
government crown agency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that I think is so important is that farmers are 
actually paying the bill and have the greatest vested interest in 
the success of the wheat board.  They should have the information 
available to them.  It is incredible that though they pay the 
bill they cannot even find out how much is paid to board members 
or to the staff an individual basis.  That is not right and not 
fair and should be corrected.  I urge the government to correct 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am astounded at the amount of publicity I am getting 
here tonight.  There is a demand for me to speak.  I thought I 
had said everything the other day but I will oblige them and make 
a few remarks on the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the press is incorrect on some of the rumours that I have 
been reading lately.  I know we have no western Canadian wheat 
farmers on the Liberal benches but we still have the wheat board 
minister at least from the west.  I hear rumours now that he is 
to be moved to a different portfolio.  I surely to God hope they 
will not do that because we will miss him on the flight back to 
Ottawa.  We like to meet and greet each other sometimes even when 
we are on conflicting sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make clear, and I want to be corrected on it if I am 
wrong, the position of the Liberals on the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Just before the last election in Manitoba they organized a 
committee to save the wheat board.  I attended this meeting and 
later a rally was held in front of the wheat board buildings.  I 
saw at least five Liberal MPs standing on the platform and saying 
they were the protectors of the Canadian Wheat Board and that 
they would save single desk selling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal convention was held just prior to the election 
the workshops brought out different resolutions to put on the 
floor.  One was brought forward by the former MP from 
Dauphin—Swan River, Marlene Cowling, a very well respected lady 
in the agriculture community.  She proposed a resolution that 
they support very strongly the maintenance of single desk selling 
in the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another resolution was brought forward on behalf of agriculture 
that stated we should legalize the growing of hemp.  There was 
only one resolution allowed on the floor for debate.  Which one 
did the Liberal government supported?  It was the one for 
legalizing the growing of hemp. Where did its commitment to the 
Canadian Wheat Board evaporate to?  Am I wrong?  Is that what 
happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You are wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  I am wrong.  What was the 
difference?  That was the way the press reported it.  The motion 
to support the wheat board never got on the floor for debate 
because it would be too divisive in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the election we saw what happened.  I was surprised this 
evening when the member for Malpeque started speaking.  He made 
the comment that the government had held extensive hearings.  I 
thought that tonight we were finally going to hear something good 
from the member for Malpeque.  I thought we would get kernels of 
truth and facts, but that is where it stopped.  The next thing he 
talked about was maximizing the profits.  That kernel of truth 
turned into ergots.  Does anyone know what this is?  We call it 
smut in the grain industry.  That is the way the speech went from 
top to bottom.  The kernel of truth turned into smut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House exactly why.  It was the maximization of 
profits.  I do not have to tell the gentlemen on the other side 
that when we held hearings I wanted the chief commissioner of the 
Canadian Wheat Board to explain to us what his mandate was.  I 
was shut down.  I was told I was out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The court case was going on at the time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2250"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  The court case has been settled. 
The appeal board had ruled that the Canadian Wheat Board had no 
mandate to sell grain for the best price.  The only mandate it 
had was to orderly market my grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Whatever that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Whatever that means.  I was 
prepared and I have sunk thousands of dollars into it to get the 
truth out of that court case.  We are still battling over trying 
to get it before a judge so he can decide what the facts are.  It 
is to be appealed again, and the minister knows it.  That 
stubborn farmer from western Canada does not give up so easy.  He 
wants the truth.  Farmers want the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member for Malpeque say that the farmers were 
playing into the hands of the major grain companies, those bad 
rascals, those wolves or whatever they are.  I have grown special 
crops since 1957.  I do not know for what reason but these 
terrible grain companies, these terrible special crops 
industries. have always made me more money than wheat board 
grains.  If I had not grown the special crops I would have been 
bankrupt in the first 10 years.  If these terrible grain 
companies are that miserable toward farmers, why are they getting 
more instead of less acres every year?  Why are they selling a 
bigger portion of western Canadian farmers' products than they 
ever have before? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the price of canola today when we grew record 
acres last year, it is still close to $9 a bushel.  What would 
people on the other side do if we did not have special crops? 
They would be sending out subsidies to no end if they wanted to 
keep the farmers on the land.  They should realize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just talked to the minister a few minutes ago to see whether 
he received the phone call I received yesterday.  About 10 
o'clock when I was waiting to debate in the House the phone rang 
and it was a gentleman from the States.  According to the wheat 
board minister the call was probably from Pennsylvania. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The caller needed three truckloads of organic white, hard wheat. 
He said he had to have it because that wheat was not available 
in Montana or Washington.  When it comes into production it is 
not the quality of wheat that we grow in Saskatchewan and 
Alberta.  He could not get it because the producer would not go 
to the wheat board for an export permit because it wants an extra 
70 cents to $1 a bushel to put in the pool, and it does 
absolutely nothing with it.  He is fed up with this malarkey. The 
wheat board will not buy it, move it or market it, but it wants a 
$1 a bushel for saying it is the wheat board. Does that make any 
sense?  It does not make sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking money out of the western economy, money that could 
be coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  If the member does not want to 
believe it, he can talk to every farmer from the Ontario-Manitoba 
border to British Columbia.  They will tell him that they will 
need more funds. They cannot make ends meet.  If we do not do 
something to increase the prices of grain or the income of 
farmers, the government will have a catastrophe on its hands like 
it has never seen before.  Why not let them market their grain if 
they can get a better price? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am astounded that as politicians we cannot listen to people 
when they tell us what is wrong.  We have been across western 
Canada twice listening to the farmers.  The Senate has been 
across western Canada.  The farmers want a choice.  I can 
guarantee the House that if it were a voluntary wheat board and 
there was trust in the wheat board it would market more wheat 
board grains than it would probably market special crops grains. 
It has been proven in other areas.  They do not have 
accountability or trust.  They do not want to listen to what 
farmers tell them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the wheat board did the job like it is claiming to do, it 
should have absolutely no objection to the auditor general 
looking at the books.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is nothing to hide why are we fighting tooth and nail 
to allow the auditor general to audit the books?  To me there is 
something wrong.  If Revenue Canada does not trust me it can 
audit my books.  Since I started criticizing the wheat board and 
demanding accountability I have not had a five year audit but an 
audit every year.  Is that not strange?  All my life I was never 
audited until I started objecting to the practices of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  Tell me what is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Revenue Canada found out that I had violated the law I would 
expect it to prosecute.  Is that why the wheat board is hesitant 
to allow anybody to look into its books?  If it is honest and if 
its books are in order it should have no problem with them being 
audited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What did Deloitte & Touche do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Deloitte & Touche legs eggs and we 
know what happened to what lays golden eggs.  Who killed it?  Who 
killed the goose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deloitte & Touche is a tremendous firm.  Nobody said that 
Deloitte & Touche was not doing its job, but it can only audit 
what it is given to audit. I would like to ask the hon. member 
why, if Deloitte & Touche has done such a tremendous job, the 
trading activities under the commodity exchanges were not listed 
in that report?  Why are they not in the report?  For years the 
Canadian Wheat Board has denied that it uses commodity exchanges. 
I can show all sorts of records.  There is no gambling or 
speculating.  That is too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden we hear testimony before the Senate hearings 
saying that it is the biggest player on the Minneapolis Grain 
Exchange. It plays as much as we can.  It will not allow farmers 
to do it.  Why is that not recorded in its accounts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote the commissioner a letter asking for the annual 
statement of the trading activities of the wheat board.  I also 
asked the minister for it.  I have not received it yet. I would 
like to see it.  There are all kinds of speculation that things 
are not quite on the level.  The problem is that the suspicion is 
there and farmers will not deal with suspicion any more.  They 
want facts and guarantees because they are not making enough 
money from wheat board grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another little story about the last couple of months. 
Farmers have been thrown in jail for exporting grain without 
export permits.  Suddenly last winter I got complaints left and 
right that the Canadian grain companies were buying and milling 
wheat as off board feed wheat and that it was disappearing.  I 
said that I could not do anything, that I needed facts, figures 
and documents.  One farmer came forward with documents in black 
and white.  There was a dollar a bushel premium for off board 
feed wheat compared with ordinary off board feed wheat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that was illegal.  That was not just breaking the wheat 
board act but the Canadian Grain Commission Act.  It cannot 
distort grains.  It has to pay the price at which it is graded. I 
said “Now I have something”.   Then I got a phone call from a 
farmer who said “Jake, please don't use the information”. I 
asked him why.  I told him that we could tackle the problem. He 
said “I don't know what my neighbours are going to do to me. 
They will burn me out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took it to the assistant commissioner of the RCMP whom I had 
contracted as a consultant and asked what I should do with it.  I 
told him the guy did not want to give me the information to use 
and asked what I should do.  He said that I had information to 
start a criminal prosecution and then they would have to look at 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What should I do?  This is what grain companies are doing and 
what farmers are being thrown in jail for.  That is something. 
That is the problem we have in our economy today.  It is wrong if 
you do it and right if I do it.  That is why the country is in 
such terrible shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>White collar crime in organizations is unbelievable as are the 
tax dollars we lose in government.  Nobody is willing to do 
something about it.  We are all covering our own butts so we do 
not have to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That system has to change or we will go the same route as the 
former Soviet Union and the other countries that have done it. 
Let us look at what has happened in the Philippines, Indonesia 
and other countries where white collar has taken over the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want that in our country we can sit quiet, do nothing and 
let things be.  That is not why I was sent to the House.  I was 
sent to the House to keep the laws and to make sure they were 
enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see things going on today in the business world it 
astounds me that we are still running as a country because that 
is not the basis on which the country was built.  The country was 
built on honesty, integrity and hard work.  Today it is a matter 
of how we do business and in what fashion we can rip off the next 
guy for the most dollars.  That is not my idea of a true economy. 
I will fight tooth and nail to get rid of it because my children, 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren will have to pay for it 
some day.  I do not want to be held accountable for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not a warning I do not know what else I can do to 
warn the House.  I have done what I thought was right.  When I 
get a phone call in the middle of the night telling me I will be 
dead in half an hour, I get fed up.  The RCMP cannot touch it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on?  I am not fooling when I say I will get to the 
bottom of it one way or another.  Those type of phone calls are 
not made by drunks.  Those type of phone calls are made by people 
who want to intimidate and destroy.  I ain't going to leave this 
place on that basis.  They will have to put a bullet in me before 
I will leave.  I hope they take that seriously because I am 
finished yet.  I hope the minister understands that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you and God bless during the holidays.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
sat patiently listening to the debate tonight.  I am not a grain 
farmer at all, but it struck me we have in the House a group of 
people on that side with 38% of the votes in the 1997 election 
and 100% of the power to impose their will upon the people.  In 
western Canada they had maybe less than 20% of the vote and they 
still have 100% of the power to impose their will upon unwilling 
recipients of their favours, shall we say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of the early 1980s when Francis Fox, another 
minister who used to sit on that side, tried to impose his will 
on the people of Canada when people were trying to install 
satellite dishes to pick up free choice in television signals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Francis Fox condoned the seizure of those dishes.  In the 
Vancouver area they went around seizing satellite dishes off 
apartment buildings.  In the end that minister lost the battle 
because although he had 100% of the power initially the group he 
was fighting was too big.  That group wanted more choice than he 
could prevent.  In the end he lost that battle and we got the 
freedom of satellite dishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indirectly I relate that to what the Liberal government is doing 
today.  It has this compelling urge to impose its will upon 
people who do not want that will imposed upon them.  As I said, I 
am a person who is not a grain farmer. 
There are no western grain farmers on that side of the House.  I 
heard a group of western grain farmers on this side of the House 
saying they want a choice like the people in the 1980s wanted a 
choice in satellite transmission of their television signals.  I 
do not understand is why that group opposite wants to impose 
something different upon them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member who just finished his speech. 
What does he feel is driving these people on the other side of 
the House to impose their will upon unwilling grain farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for that question.  I cannot figure it.  I do not know why. 
Politically what is being done is dumb.  The Liberal caucus will 
not gain any votes by doing what it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some day it would be very wise, as I have said before, to have 
free votes on some of these issues.  They would understand 
better.  The Liberal MPs from Ontario do not object to Ontario 
farmers having a totally elected board and having the option of 
selling some or all of their grain to the export market in the 
United States.  They want it.  Western farmers want it.  Why do 
they not give it to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they can declare the Canadian Wheat Board voluntary its 
business would pick up.  It would handle more grain.  Over the 35 
years I have farmed people always supported the wheat board 
regardless of whether or not they made money.  They felt it was 
an agency that could be trusted.  All of a sudden they lost trust 
in the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the farmers came to me I started looking into the 
irregularities.  I never expected in all my life that I would 
have to deal with that issue as my first issue as an MP.  I never 
dreamt of it.  The more we looked into it and the more 
documentation we looked at, we found something was wrong.  When 
one farmer gets $1 to a $1.10 more than another farmer for the 
same quality wheat something is wrong in the pooling system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not happen to strangers.  It happened in my family.  It 
happened to two of my brothers.  They farmed 10 miles apart.  One 
actually had better quality wheat.  He got a $1.10 less a bushel 
than the other brother who had poor quality fusarium wheat.  It 
was because there was competition between elevators in one place 
and in the other place there was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To all members on that side and to the minister I say to me that 
is not honesty and not what the pooling system was set up for. 
That is why I think these people cannot understand.  We have 101 
seats in Ontario.  They satisfy their farmers but they are not 
willing to give the same opportunities to farmers in western 
Canada.  It will backfire. 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have to make a comment because the member just said 
that in essence what was wrong with the government's position of 
this excellent bill was that we were not trying to earn votes. 
This was precisely what killed the Conservative Party.  It was 
always introducing legislation and establishing policy that would 
gain it votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government introduces legislation that is responsible, 
legislation that is right and legislation that is good for all 
Canadians.  That is what democracy is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree completely 
with the gentleman.  The only thing I do not agree with is that 
they are not buying votes in Ontario by giving farmers a 
marketing choice.  They have the votes in Ontario and they are 
desperately trying to hand on to them.  That is why they are 
allowing their farmers to have these options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want some votes in western Canada they better come clean 
and give us the same opportunities, or they will divide the 
country more than they have so far.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is 11.10 in the evening and there is a considerable 
gallery of hecklers across the way who seem to be having grand 
time contributing little to the debate, I might note, but a lot 
in the sense of heckling members who are trying to debate a very 
important western Canadian issue.  Despite all this I would like 
to get back to what my hon. colleague from North Vancouver was 
asking the member earlier.  Why is the government imposing the 
bill upon western Canadian farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of that I am pleased the minister responsible for the 
Canadian Wheat Board is in the Chamber this evening at 11.10. I 
would certainly welcome his comments on why they are doing that 
if he would choose to rise following my colleague's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am running out of 
answers.  The questions are coming fast and furious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would put it this way.  I have given my viewpoint as strongly 
as I can and I think my colleagues have done the same.  I must 
say we have become very successful in this debate.  Look at the 
audience we have on the Liberal side.  Look at the ministers 
putting in some work or listening.  After all it is close to 
midnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing something right on this side.  I will turn it over 
to the minister and ask him whether he would like to respond to 
that question too.  I would like to ask unanimous consent from 
the House to have him reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Part of the order 
that we made earlier for this debate precludes any unanimous 
consent motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> There being no 
further members rising on debate, pursuant to order made Tuesday, 
June 9, 1998, the question on the amendment now before the House 
is deemed to have been put and a recorded division deemed 
demanded and deferred until Thursday, June 11, 1998 at 1 p.m.
