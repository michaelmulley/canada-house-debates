</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise in debate at third and final reading of 
Bill C-49, the first nations land management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been following this debate very carefully.  As a result, 
there are a couple of things that I would like to talk about 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to ensure that the House appreciates the 
context in which Bill C-49 finds itself.  I want the House to 
appreciate how significant— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please. I am 
sorry that I must interrupt the hon. minister, however, on the 
first 40 minute time slot we have to have consent to split the 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there consent that the time on the first 40 minute slot be 
split? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I apologize for the 
interruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate and thank my 
colleagues for their consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, it is important from my point of view to put into 
context the importance of Bill C-49 and the contribution that it 
will make to ensuring a commitment which this government has to 
work with first nations to build self-reliance and to provide 
first nations the opportunity to have the social and economic 
control that they need to have to better their lives within the 
community and the lives of their community members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if I have the time I would like to explore some of the 
issues that have been raised in the last few days with respect to 
Bill C-49.  I anticipate that I will be able to do that.  If not, 
I know my parliamentary secretary will speak to some of those 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, let us consider the context in which Bill 
C-49 finds itself.  In this regard I would like to remind the 
House about the fact that the primary relationship that I as 
minister of Indian affairs and the Government of Canada has with 
first nations is through the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of the last couple of years, as I have 
appreciated my role as minister of Indian affairs, I have found 
the Indian Act to be paternalistic, or maternalistic in the sense 
that I am the minister currently.  The way this legislation 
overlays first nations is quite extraordinary.  I have the 
responsibility to tell first nations how to develop their lands, 
what they can do with their reserve lands, these lands which have 
been set aside for them.  I have to approve whether there can be 
economic development, who can build where, what conservation 
opportunities can be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Indian Act I am the one who decides and approves the will 
of individual first nations.  I am the one, in providing funds to 
first nations, who says “Yes, you can have so much money for 
this particular undertaking.  You can have so much money for 
that.  You can have so much money for this”.  The minister of 
Indian affairs has considerable and complete control over the 
activities that occur on first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me it is inappropriate.  It is antiquated.  It is not 
allowing the communities to use the resources that are truly 
theirs for the benefit of the people in those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask:  Why do we not change the Indian Act?  I remind 
the House that my predecessor attempted to do that.  He attempted 
to amend the Indian Act in a very substantive way.  But first 
nations resisted.  They resisted it as a unilateral action made 
on the part of the crown to interfere with the existing 
relationship, despite the fact that they knew the Indian Act was 
so controlling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we explore why that was the reaction, we come to understand 
that first nations see the Indian Act really as their structural 
relationship, which goes back to the fundamental issue of 
aboriginal rights.  All in this House appreciate, I know, that in 
section 35 of our Constitution, the highest law of our land, 
aboriginal rights are identified and protected.  These are rights 
that are not better than yours or mine as non-aboriginal people, 
but they are different and fundamentally go back to our belief 
that the first people of this nation have rights that are theirs 
by virtue of the fact that they predated us in this great 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For first nations they see that connection to those rights 
which, quite frankly, we have resisted, over and over again over 
the course of our relationship, in clarifying or at least somehow 
protecting through the Indian Act, this paternalistic piece of 
legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more on this side of the House we are explaining and 
encouraging our support for aboriginal rights.  We are seeing 
those aboriginal rights reconciled in a modern Canada through 
such things as the negotiation of the treaty in the Nisga'a lands 
in northwestern British Columbia and in other undertakings. 
There is an easing and an increasing interest and demand from 
first nations to deal with the Indian Act and to find ways and 
means of allowing first nations the authority they need to have 
as legitimate entities to make decisions in their communities on 
behalf of the people of their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 is one tool which allows us to take some small steps 
in this regard.  Bill C-49 is a product of over 10 years of work. 
It has developed into a partnership among 14 first nations and 
the Government of Canada to explore, in one particular area of 
the Indian Act, the aspect of land management, how we could 
restore jurisdiction to first nations.  Working together, those 
14 first nations and the Government of Canada have prepared 
legislation that will allow me to relinquish the authorities that 
I have under the Indian Act to control the lands of those 14 
first nations and to give it to them in a legitimate, organized 
and controlled fashion.  It is called Bill C-49 and it is 
tremendously important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of Bill C-49, 14 first nations in the provinces 
of British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick will 
have the authority to make decisions on how their land is 
developed, how their land is conserved, how their land is 
protected, how their land is used and how their land is 
administered at the community level.  For those people who say 
that government should get out of the face of the people, what is 
wrong with having decisions made locally, within a community, in 
the context and the milieu in which the community finds itself? 
I do not think there is anything wrong with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 is a step in that direction, a step which allows us, 
at least for those 14 first nations, to start to break apart this 
paternalistic relationship, not in a holus-bolus, free wheeling 
way, but in a controlled way as outlined in the bill, which will 
take us a certain degree and allow us the opportunity to test 
this.  We have to review the bill after four years to see how 
progress is being made before we can extend it to other first 
nations which also want to be considered.  It is a legitimate 
step that will help us make progress.  To me this is fundamental 
in the commitment that I have to work with first nations and to 
find ways and means of allowing them the opportunity they need to 
really do what is most important, and that is to change the 
social reality of their demographics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Indian Act that has created and sustained that 
cyclical welfare relationship, that one way relationship that has 
kept aboriginal people from engaging fully in the wealth, 
resources and strength that we know to be ours in Canada.  I 
encourage and ask hon. members to consider this bill in the 
context of that and to see that these are important first steps 
which will truly make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak to some of the specific issues that have been 
raised over the course of the last few days.  Let us look at the 
issue of matrimonial property.  Yes, we are talking about lands. 
Yes, women have to have an opportunity to have access to those 
lands after a marital breakdown.  I remind the House that Bill 
C-75 which was presented previously in this parliament was the 
first nations land management act.  That bill did not pass.  When 
I became Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
women came to talk to me about the importance of including 
matrimonial property.  I believed they were right.  I would 
remind the House that there is nothing in the Indian Act which 
accommodates matrimonial property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-49 we have included the requirement that the land 
codes must include the opportunity and the reality in the 
provisions for matrimonial property to implemented. 
This will happen in consultation within the communities.  The 
code has to be developed in consultation.  It has to be ratified 
and verified before it can be proclaimed.  There is a system.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives the first opportunity for women at least in those 14 
first nations to have access to legislation that will allow for 
matrimonial property to be considered.  Women would like that to 
be more broadly spread, for us to deal with it in the context of 
the Indian Act. In addition, what we have said we will do is 
appoint a fact finder to talk with interested parties, make 
recommendations to myself, to first nations and to the women of 
first nations about how we might be able to include in the 
broader context of the Indian Act ways and means of providing for 
property in the unfortunate circumstance of marital breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this bill, in those 14 first nations women will 
have provisions for property at the point of a marital breakdown. 
They also have my commitment to work with them to explore ways to 
broadly deal with that issue in the context of other first 
nations and the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that has been drawn to our attention is this tool 
that all governments have when managing lands, called 
expropriation.  It is very unfortunate that in the mainstream 
press people are talking about the sweeping expropriation 
authorities.  They are not sweeping at all.  They are not any 
different than the authorities which exist now in my power as the 
minister of Indian affairs for action in first nations. In fact 
there is more control than the expropriation powers that exist 
for municipalities, provincial governments, hospitals and 
schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expropriation is a tool that all legitimate governments need to 
have at their disposal.  It cannot be used without great care. In 
this bill it cannot be used without a significant process being 
undertaken.  This includes the identification of the need for 
expropriation only for community based interests such as schools, 
roads and hospitals, and that compensation be paid if indeed 
expropriation must occur in the context of the federal 
Expropriation Act which is referenced in the bill.  The code of 
implementation has to be verified externally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing here that is sweeping and broad.  There is 
nothing here that is not offered to any other legitimate 
government.  I cannot see how we can exclude this tool from use 
by first nations.  It is just common sense to provide it but to 
provide it in a very controlled and regulated context, which is 
what happens in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area is the issue of consultation.  We have heard 
particularly from British Columbia that the municipalities want 
to ensure that their neighbouring first nations will consult with 
them as they decide how to manage their lands.  The first nations 
will do that.  In fact consultation has already begun with the 
Union of British Columbia Municipalities to develop a reciprocal 
agreement, a protocol, on how first nations and municipalities 
will consult, share information and proceed in the area of land 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who say that the provisions in the bill must be 
more specific, that the legislation must require that 
consultation will occur.  I am not sure one can legislate quality 
consultation.  If we legislate it we might get a letter, but if 
we build the partnership between a first nation and its 
surrounding municipalities, we build a community, a 
neighbourhood. We build a partnership where both communities can 
benefit.  That is the focus here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have been so impressed by my colleague, the member 
from Coquitlam who has said, “I am going to go out there and 
bring the municipalities and the first nations together to make 
sure that they are communicating, connecting and building that 
partnership”.  As one community thrives, so does another. That 
is how we build a strong British Columbia and a strong Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my experience that across Canada too many times we 
find instances where municipalities and first nations who are 
neighbours and use the same resources, the same water and the 
same community services, do not know each other. 
The mayor and council do not know the chief and council.  When 
there are issues, they do not know who to turn to, or who to talk 
to.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tremendously important role for members of parliament 
to play in bringing those communities together and ensuring that 
their constituents, whether they be first nations or not, know 
each other and work together.  That is a challenge we have right 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own community that was the circumstance with the largest 
first nation in Canada, Six Nations.  The chief and council did 
not know the mayor and council.  The process engaged in was one 
that was dysfunctional.  If the city decided to do something and 
the first nations did not like it, there were protests and 
roadblocks.  That is not how this country should work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we brought the communities together and a protocol was 
written, because of mutual interests, mutual respect and 
recognition and a commitment to strengthen that part of 
southwestern Ontario which is broadly populated by both 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people alike, we have got a 
tremendously exciting circumstance happening.  Communications are 
going back and forth.  The mayor and council are inviting the 
chief and council to events in the city and vice-versa. Economic 
development which is happening in one community or the other is 
being shared by both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is the right approach.  It is fair.  It is open. 
It is democratic.  It builds on the traditional and real values 
of Canada which are that we are a diverse country.  We celebrate 
our diversity and we appreciate the strength it gives us as a 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first people of this country have every right to be part of 
this nation, to have the authorities that the rest of us have to 
build our communities at the local level without the imposed 
wisdom or lack of it that I might provide as the current Minister 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, all this is part and parcel of Bill C-49.  The issues 
that have been raised can be responded to.  The responses exist 
within the bill and with the commitment of the chiefs of those 14 
first nations, all of them and specifically those who have worked 
so long and hard on this as members of the First Nations Land 
Management Board. I congratulate them for their courage, for 
their energy and for the commitment to their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind it is in the best interests of all members of the 
House to support them.  They show the leadership that we know we 
need to have in the 21st century if we are going to ensure that 
as we stand up as proud Canadians and say we live in the best 
country in the world, that we know it is true for all Canadians, 
and especially for our first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the privilege of the minister making comments here 
today which speak to the very core of the concerns that people 
have with this bill. As she is here in the House, I would seek 
the unanimous consent of the House to have a short period of 
questions and comments for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As the House knows, 
the first two slots are without questions and comments, but it is 
obvious that we can ask for unanimous consent to have a specified 
period.  Does the hon. member wish to specify a specific 
timeframe? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, whatever the House would 
agree to, but I think 10 minutes would be sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Skeena has requested that the House give its unanimous consent in 
this instance for the minister to respond to questions for five 
minutes.  A change has been made to five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent of the House to extend the period for 
five minutes of questions and comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will 
have five minutes of questions and comments to the minister.  We 
will start with the hon. member and if anyone else rises we will 
try to get to them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
House for agreeing to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spoke about two of the areas of serious concern 
with Bill C-49.  One is the disposition of marital property in 
the event of a marital breakdown. 
She has indicated her willingness and her concern in this area. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is so concerned, why are the provisions not in 
the legislation to provide that protection for aboriginal women? 
Many aboriginal women have contacted not only the official 
opposition but also the minister and government members to 
express those concerns. Why are those provisions not in the 
legislation?  Why did the government choose not to support Bloc 
amendments which would have gone a long way toward providing 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that the expropriation provisions are not as 
sweeping and as broad as some have painted them to be.  How would 
the minister respond to a real estate agent's letter to a client 
in Vancouver where he advised his client to take his property 
which is currently located on the Musqueam reserve off the market 
because Bill C-49 is hanging as a sword over the property owner's 
head?  There is absolutely no possibility of marketing the 
property on leased land which a couple of years ago was valued at 
$700,000.  That does not square with what the minister is saying 
at all.  This is an independent, unbiased real estate agent's 
expressed opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I direct those two questions to the minister and ask her to 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond. 
Let us look first at the issue of matrimonial property. Let me 
convey again how significant it is that the recognition that the 
14 chiefs, which include women I would point out, have agreed 
that it is highly important for them in their land codes to 
include provisions for matrimonial property or the disposition of 
property that effectively recognizes the impact on women, 
particularly at the point of marital breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my mind, as we look across the provincial jurisdictions which 
have authorities in the area of matrimonial property, we have 
seen different approaches province by province.  It is my 
expectation that the strength of these provisions will be 
developed in the context of the community in which they are 
found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge we have in providing services to citizens and 
responding to their needs is best met in the context of 
recognizing legitimacy in this particular case of the first 
nations government to work with its community in order to find 
the provisions that work for them. Those provisions and those 
land codes have to be developed in consultation with the 
community.  They have to be ratified by the community.  They have 
to be verified by an external verifier who looks at all the 
aspects and the intentions to ensure that they are legitimate and 
will provide what the community wants and what is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives us the first tangible opportunity to say to women who 
live in first nations communities that they will be part of this 
undertaking.  They will for the first time have the opportunity 
to have this very important and essential aspect of their lives, 
the issue of property, managed effectively in the context of 
legislation and their land codes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question raised by the hon. member was on the issue 
of expropriation.  I would first say that that real estate agent 
should look carefully at the bill.  I am afraid he is giving his 
client an opinion that is not based on fact. In a very 
unfortunate way it serves to escalate, heighten and encourage 
difficult relationships between and among people in that 
particular part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There never has been and never will be the intention that lands 
can be expropriated willy-nilly.  In this context lands can only 
be expropriated in the way in which lands can be expropriated 
through any other legitimate government, for the purposes of 
specific benefits to the community.  That is absolutely clear and 
so this what I view to be a red herring on the issue of 
expropriation is an inappropriate one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided by 
unanimous consent for questions and comments has expired.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are really privileged to have the minister in the House today. 
I am sure she would like to remain for a little while longer to 
clear up some of the many questions for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to once again ask for unanimous consent so that 
maybe we could extend the question and comment period a little 
more so some of the very important questions could be asked and 
the minister could have a great opportunity to respond.  I am 
sure she would go along with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Does the hon. member 
for Prince George—Bulkley Valley have a specific period of time 
in mind? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Ten minutes, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Prince George—Bulkley Valley has asked that the time for 
questions and comments be extended a further 10 minutes.  Is 
there unanimous consent?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be in agreement, on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, to respect custom and proceed in 
the usual way, that is speaking for ten minutes.  We have 
already used up five, and I think another five could be allowed, 
perhaps. We would agree with that, but we would not want the 
Reform member jumping up each time and having everything go 
until noon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we will have opportunities in questions and answers throughout 
the day to debate parts of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-49 was introduced on June 11 in the House.  During 
parliamentary debate and review by standing committee the 
government has continued to put forward the benefits of the bill. 
However, the official opposition has repeatedly tried to seek to 
scuttle the bill, even today.  It has continually tried to 
misrepresent the real intentions of the first nations by way of 
misinformation and fearmongering, as evidenced today by the 
comments with respect to real estate agents making very unhelpful 
comments to the leaseholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have tried to confuse the citizenry of the country by 
trying to raise the fears of average Canadians with respect to 
the development of first nations and their legitimate desire to 
take control over their lands and to manage those that are held 
in trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I would like to set the record straight on these 
matters.  I am sure that when I am finished the real story will 
be before the House and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has expounded quite well on questions of 
expropriation, but let me reiterate some of the most important 
points of this portion of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the official opposition would like everyone to 
believe that this power is an extreme power in the hands of first 
nations and one which they believe would be abused to the 
detriment of existing interest holders on first nations land. 
There are supreme court decisions which make this impossible to 
happen.  This is nothing more than fearmongering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House know, the power of expropriation is a 
power available to all levels of government and one which all 
governments take seriously with care and great caution.  It must 
be first noted that the exercise of this power by any of the 
first nations is optional.  In other words, although the bill 
would provide the power to expropriate, the community would have 
to decide whether to exercise that legitimate power.  It is a 
community decision, as I said, one that is not taken lightly.  In 
their codes these first nations must decide whether or not they 
wish to include the power of expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliament knows, three first nations have already ratified 
their codes.  Of these, two have opted not to exercise this 
expropriation power.  The third, the Muskoday First Nation, has 
spelled out in detail the extent to which it will exercise those 
expropriation powers.  It was done with care and proper due 
diligence to its neighbours and indeed to the community itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for North Vancouver specifically referenced the 
Muskoday land code in his remarks of the other day as being a 
model for other first nations to follow.  Of the three land codes 
now in preparation in the communities, one wishes not to exercise 
expropriation powers and the other two are following the Muskoday 
model. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the exercise of this power the first nations must establish 
the rules and procedures.  In addition, these are based on rules 
and procedures found in the Canadian Expropriation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indian reserve lands are currently subject to expropriation by 
British Columbia with the consent of the governor in council. 
There are at least 19 statutes where expropriation powers might 
be exercised in the lower mainland of British Columbia today. Any 
expropriation power that the first nations in B.C. may wish to 
exercise is not unique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to respond to specific concerns raised in debates 
concerning the matter of the 30 day expropriation time limit. 
This has been raised a number of times in debate as a threat to 
the security of interest holders on first nations land.  It 
should be noted that this period is similar to the time set out 
in the 19 statutes to which I just referred.  Under these sample 
statutes, the 19 B.C. statutes, the timeframe can be as little as 
10 days or, in limited situations, no notice.  The Railway Act 
statute is an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultation has again been repeatedly raised.  Apparently some 
members of the House would like us to believe that the 14 
signatory first nations to the bill do not talk to their 
neighbours.  In fact, it has been implied that no first nations 
consult with their non-aboriginal neighbours.  This is completely 
and categorically false and strongly needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In direct relation to Bill C-49, the five first nations from 
B.C. have entered into a consultation process with the Union of 
British Columbia Municipalities to establish a consultation 
protocol with all the affected municipal governments. In fact, in 
British Columbia alone there are over 100 service agreements 
between first nations and their non-aboriginal neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to refer to a letter that was tabled by the 
chair of the Union of British Columbia Municipalities aboriginal 
affairs committee.  The letter supports the discussion paper on a 
consultative protocol with the five B.C. first nations and touts 
the benefits of working in a partnership with first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that entering into preliminary dialogue with the (five 
B.C. first nations) on principles for reciprocal consultation as 
set out in the attached discussion paper at this time is what the 
UBCM has been working towards in consultation with first nations 
over the past two years and may pay back dividends in the future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, at a regular meeting of the district of Squamish 
held on February 15, 1999, the council passed the following 
motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That council support the amended draft discussion paper on 
reciprocal consultation between first nations governments and 
municipalities on land use planning and related issues. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point that I would like to address.  Numerous 
members opposite have continually raised the notion that 
municipalities must consult with first nations.  In their 
discussions they cite the B.C. municipal act as setting out a 
mandatory consultation process which first nations would be 
legislated to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that the so-called requirement for B.C. 
municipalities to consult with first nations is not a requirement 
at all that is imposed on the municipalities.  It does not apply 
when the land and other developments are proposed in those 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that the B.C. municipal act imposes the requirement 
to consult with first nations is spurious and categorically 
inaccurate.  It is a myth.  It does not exist as a requirement in 
the B.C. municipal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact there is no statutory requirement for municipalities in 
B.C. to consult with first nations with respect to land 
development.  The municipal act provisions for consultations only 
arises when a regional district board proposes a development 
strategy. 
Therefore the cities of west and north Vancouver, which are not 
the district board, have no obligation to consult with first 
nations.  There are no laws in the other five provinces where 
nine of the fourteen land management first nations are located 
that make any provision at all for consultation with first 
nations in respect of land development or servicing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief of the Squamish nation has written to me and has 
indicated other examples of how the member for North Vancouver 
has misinformed the residents of British Columbia.  I would like 
to quote from the chief's letter when he says that he would like 
to formally go on the record to say that the comments of the 
member for North Vancouver are outright fabrications and, 
further, that he should have to resign his position as a Reform 
Party representative from British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, certain members opposite would have us believe that 
the municipalities would automatically have to provide services 
to the first nations.  The truth is that if the first nations 
want municipal services provided the two parties must negotiate 
those agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly believe that the bill and the framework agreement 
will pave the way for a better understanding of partnerships 
between the first nations and their municipalities.  I think it 
is worth mentioning that 500 of these service agreements now 
exist across the country, with 100 existing in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote excerpts from the Snake Island Cottagers 
Association located in southern Ontario which represents a few 
hundred cottage owners, if I am not mistaken, who feel that Bill 
C-49 is a way for them to protect their relationship with the 
first nations people: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We strongly support the Chippewas Band's quest for 
self-government and feel that the swift passage of Bill C-49 will 
facilitate a new leasing arrangement between our members and the 
Chippewas band.  SICA and the Chippewas Band have over the years 
developed a friendly working relationship and we look forward to 
dealing directly with the Band.  The time for self-government is 
now.  Please do not delay the passage of Bill C-49 any longer. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister spoke extensively and very well and thoroughly to 
the question of matrimonial property, but I will touch on it very 
briefly to reinforce and reiterate what she has just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very complex issue because the provincial land laws 
respecting the division of matrimonial property upon marital 
breakdown do not apply on reserves.  That is clear.  Why? Reserve 
lands are unique because they are held by Her Majesty for the use 
and benefit of the band, not by or for individuals.  In other 
words, it is communal land.  Provincial laws cannot be replicated 
in their entirety to reserve lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House is aware, the 14 first nations that signed the 
agreement are anxious to spell out these rules.  As the minister 
said, many of the signatories of those 14 bands are women chiefs, 
elected ostensibly by the men in their communities as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us and the agreement spell out that the 
signatories must establish a community process.  It is also 
important to put on record that the equality section of the 
charter of rights and freedoms will apply, that there will be no 
discrimination based on sex under sections 28 and 35 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill before us the legislation requires that 
first nations solicit the input of all on and off reserve members 
of their communities, including aboriginal women.  Nothing 
precludes a community from addressing the issue at the beginning 
of the land code development process.  The important point here 
is that the community decides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal officials through our minister are now working to 
establish the fact finding process.  Letters of invitation have 
been sent to the aboriginal partners to participate in a meeting 
where the terms of reference for the fact finding process will be 
discussed.  The minister will make further announcements on this 
initiative in the near future. 
Finally, during the recent debates I have raised a number of 
comments of which the hon. member for Skeena challenged the 
accuracy.  I would like at this time to respond to this challenge 
with some important facts. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Musqueam tenants were indeed approach by the Musqueam 
Nation regarding prepaid leases.  I am reading from a copy of a 
letter dated May 14, 1980, sent to all the tenants: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your lease is based on fixed rental payments until June 7, 1995 
with reviews of rental for the three succeeding twenty year periods 
and one final nine year period.  For a number of reasons, we see 
merit in considering “conversion” to a prepaid basis for this 
lease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We make it absolutely clear that participation in the prepaid 
rental proposal will be entirely your own choice.  Having said 
this we have to also mentioned that the perhaps obvious fact 
that, unless at least half of you show positive interest, there 
will be no point in going ahead.  If at least half of you do show 
positive interest in the proposal, it is our intention to retain 
a professional appraiser to advise us upon the present value of 
the right to receive the flow of income provided for in your 
lease. Once that is finalized, we will face the task of agreement 
with you a mutually satisfactory prepayment figure. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the House the results of this offer of the 
Musqueam band for the sake of the member for Skeena.  A total of 
38 of the 76 tenants were required to respond positively for this 
to proceed. The response was as follows.  Ten were in favour, 
nine were undecided and required more information and eight were 
opposed to a new lease agreement. The possible 19 in favour was 
far short of the required 38 or 50% and I would like to inform 
the House that approximately 40% of the tenants residing at 
Musqueam today were residents at the time of this letter in 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important facts, along with the other fact that was 
raised as an inaccuracy about arrears.  I am told by the band and 
through its documents that 15% of the leaseholders are still in 
arrears to the tune of $334,000.  I say this to clear up the 
record because I did receive a letter from the member for Skeena 
addressed to me with very strong and somewhat personalized 
language.  I feel it is my obligation to respond to that letter 
and to the House with the facts of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this in concluding my comments with all due respect to the 
leaseholders of the Musqueam leasehold land who have had a very 
difficult and trying time over the past number of months.  I say 
to them it is the wish of the first nations, it is the wish of 
the government and I believe the House on vote on concurrence of 
171 to 35 just the other evening on this bill that we as 
Canadians, the House of Commons and our first nations people work 
together to resolve these issues in a compassionate, fair and 
equitable way so that our communities can live together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my wish.  I know is the expressed wish of the minister 
in her role as minister responsible for first nations people. She 
has advocated for that repeatedly and this is one that we 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a good bill.  It is a great opportunity to move 
forward in a new relationship where first nations people have the 
opportunity to seize control of their own lands, to do business 
with other first nations people or non-aboriginal people if they 
wish, to proceed beyond the 100 years, beyond the dark past of 
subjugation where first nations people were unable to leave their 
small plots of land on reserve in which they find themselves able 
to participate more broadly in Canadian society.  This is what 
they have asked for.  This is what we are trying to accomplish 
within the framework and broad underlying principles of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not to drive a wedge between Canadian people and first 
nations people, that we have disruptions and we become the 
international embarrassment that Canada is viewed in the United 
Nations and globally as treating unfairly its most vulnerable 
citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would agree on the

this.  I was unclear whether you had agreed to the Bloc proposal 
of 10 minutes of questions and answers and what precisely we were 
agreeing to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I was pointing out 
that in the first two debate periods in this debate there is no 
provision for questions and comments.  On the minister's debate, 
through unanimous consent, there was a provision for a five 
minute extension.  All we are asking to do is split time, not to 
extend debate.  There are no questions and comments in this

Skeena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the outset I would like 
to address some comments with respect to the issue the 
parliamentary secretary raised and his comments in the House of 
Commons a couple of weeks ago in debate which not only elicited a 
strong response from me, as he pointed out, but I am aware of a 
very strong response from a lot of residents on the Musqueam 
reserve, leasehold residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary made statements that were erroneous 
and not based on facts. He was challenged to come outside the 
House and make those same statements.  That would have been the 
democratic test of whether the veracity of what he said was there 
but the parliamentary secretary chose not to do so.  He has 
chosen not to apologize to the Musqueam residents and has chosen 
to ignore my letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is really unfortunate because when he talks about 
driving a wedge between people, I can assure him that his 
comments served nothing more than to drive a wedge between 
Musqueam residents, the Musqueam band and the Government of 
Canada.  I can assure him that was the effect of his comments. It 
is really unfortunate that he sees fit not to apologize for 
those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go on to address some of the issues the minister raised.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She rightly identifies the Indian Act as a major obstacle for 
aboriginal people in Canada to get ahead.  In that regard we 
agree with her completely.  We also agree with the principle and 
the notion of decentralizing decision making especially with 
respect to reserve based land.  As the minister knows and as 
members in the House know, reserve land does not even belong to 
the band.  It belongs to the crown in right of the Queen. 
Obviously this is wrong and it needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought we were in the process of having an arrangement 
whereby we could support Bill C-49 earlier in the year and late 
last year.  That was based on agreement to have some amendments 
made to provide for property rights for aboriginal women, to 
provide for consultation between municipalities and to provide 
for expropriation provisions that would be seen to be fair to 
leaseholders on reserve land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that on the issue of leaseholders we are focused 
right now on the Musqueam because there is an obvious problem. 
What is not yet widely known across Canada is that there are some 
60,000 leaseholders on reserve land in Ontario.  There are some 
20,000 leaseholders on reserve land in British Columbia.  There 
are tens of thousands of leasehold interests on other reserves 
across Canada.  We think that this is a sign of progress and that 
this is a good thing.  We do not say it is bad.  What we are 
saying is in the government's attempt to decentralize decision 
making some principles have to be followed like the principle 
that we do not take tens of thousands of people who have a 
leasehold interest on reserve land and let them twist in the 
wind.  There must be provisions to protect those interests built 
into the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is beyond me why the minister is not willing to consider 
those amendments.  For the minister's benefit I point out that 
the member for Vancouver Quadra, a Liberal, was recently quoted 
in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> saying: “The bill in my view needs 
corrections and I want them made”.  This is a very well 
respected Liberal member of parliament.  He is a lawyer and is 
recognized as a constitutional expert.  He goes on to say a 
number of other things.  He says Bill C-49 was poorly drafted. 
He supports concerns expressed by another Liberal member of 
parliament and B.C. Liberal leader Gordon Campbell who say that 
the expropriation rights for Indian bands are excessive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the very point the minister was addressing and she said 
they were not excessive.  Her colleague who is a recognized 
constitutional and legal expert says they are.  He cites the 
bill's lack of protection for native women who often loose the 
right to marital property after a divorce and the omission of any 
mechanism requiring consultation with surrounding municipalities 
on development matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member, but he will have 15 minutes left in 
his dissertation when we get back to debate.

cave with ten dwarfs who were bound in servitude to him.  The 
fattest was called Ontariette, and the prettiest, Québequine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reward them for their loyalty, the ogre gave each of them 100

reduce their annual stipend from 100 to 50 crowns each. 
Soon forced to feed her children nothing but bread and water, 
Québequine made known her indignation, but her sisters submitted 
without complaint.  That, of course, was because they loved the 
ogre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day, tired of the protests of Québequine, the ogre announced 
that the dwarfs' stipend would now be 70 crowns.  “See how kind 
I am”, he said, trying to look sincere.  “Seventy crowns?”, 
exclaimed Québequine.  “You are a thief and a robber.  I want my 
100 crowns”.  “Ungrateful wretch”, shouted the ogre.  “I give 
you an extra 20 crowns and you cannot even say thank you”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express concern regarding the future 
of the shrimp fishery in Nova Scotia.  Seafreez Foods Inc. has 
requested, along with the Canso Trawlerman's Association, an 
immediate increase in shrimp stock quotas off the Strait of 
Canso, Nova Scotia.  A similar request was made by the ACS plant 
in Mulgrave.  Both have made straightforward requests for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After meeting with the minister and bringing this matter to his 
attention several times over the past few months, I am confident 
that he too understands the importance and significance of the 
much needed quota for the small fishing communities of Canso and 
Mulgrave, Nova Scotia.  Given the dire situation that these 
communities find themselves in, such proposals make absolute 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the minister to review these proposals with fairness and 
equity and answer favourably the plea for quota.  These two 
communities are among the most economically stricken areas of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hardships experienced since the downturn of the fishery have 
been staggering.  If the requests are denied, as was the case 
with the turbot quota, devastation to the people in these 
communities is guaranteed.  The premier of Nova Scotia has proven 
to be an ineffective voice for these communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, for a week now we have been asking a basic question. Why 
do single income, two parent families pay considerably more tax 
than two income families?  The government's responses fall into 
three categories.  Either the Liberals avoid the question and 
puff up what little they have done for families, they avoid the 
question and attack any Reformers who dare ask it, or they avoid 
the question and attack and insult stay at home parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the finance minister to answer the question.  Why is he 
allowing this clear discrimination to continue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately the preamble to the hon. member's question 
simply does not bear any relationship to reality.  What we have 
done is certainly outline the number of measures which we have 
taken to help those families raising children, whether it be the 
child tax credit, the community action program for children or 
the prenatal nutrition program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in every case is that we have pointed out to 
the Reform Party that despite its rhetoric in the House it has 
voted against every one of those issues which will help children. 
That is the basic debate, how to help children, how to help 
families raising children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has brought forth a series of measures and the 
question is why does the reality of the Reform Party's votes 
contradict its rhetoric? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I guess that falls into the category of avoid the 
question and attack the questioner.  The minister knows very well 
that the measures he is speaking of to help families were 
embedded in a budget where taxes on families were jacked up time 
and time again.  Of course we did not support his budgets and we 
will not until there is tax fairness in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, will the minister even acknowledge that there is systemic 
discrimination in his own budgets against two parent families 
with only one income? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, again the hon. member simply does not seem to get it. In 
the last budget by raising the threshold by $675 and the $300 
million that went into the child tax benefit, the tax burden on 
Canadian families was substantially reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic issue is the Reform Party is saying, and if not would 
the hon. member explain the contradiction, that it would tax 
somebody at $25,000 at a higher rate than it would tax somebody 
at $50,000.  That simply does not make any sense.  That is why we 
have a progressive tax—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this problem will never be fixed if the minister will 
not even acknowledge it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, and he knows this very well being the finance 
minister, that single income, two parent families pay about 
$4,000 more in taxes even though they have less net income. They 
have a difficult time under this minister's budget. What will the 
minister do to address this problem? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have made it very clear that, just as we have brought 
in through previous budgets measures to help families, we would 
like to see the House of Commons finance committee look at the 
whole issue as to how best government can help Canadian families 
raise their children. We have already said that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we are debating here is whether the Reform Party is in 
favour of progressive taxation. Is the Reform Party in favour of 
individual taxation versus family taxation?  If it is, how does 
it gibe its approval of that with its questions?  The real fact 
of the matter is that the Reform Party is against progressive 
taxation.  It is against individual taxation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
all this bafflegab about progressive taxation is really quite 
galling from a minister who brought in a clawback on his much 
vaunted child tax benefit of 70% for low income families.  The 
C.D. Howe Institute calculates that families between $25,000 and 
$35,000 in income are facing as high as 70% marginal rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister talks about progressivity our objection to the 
inequities for single income families relates to the child care 
tax deduction which they cannot claim if they raise their 
children at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister defend the continued discriminatory effect 
of the child care tax deduction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have said this matter should be referred to the House 
of Commons finance committee.  Now that we are in a surplus 
position it makes an enormous amount of sense to us to look at 
one of the beneficial ways we can improve the tax code to benefit 
Canadian families. The hon. member ought to be prepared to 
participate in that process on a constructive basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is why the hon. member is arguing against 
individual taxation. Why does he believe that higher income 
Canadians should be taxed at a lower rate than lower income 
Canadians?  That is the issue. Why does he not answer the 
question? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
if the minister wants to talk about progressive taxation then he 
has to explain to $30,000 income families why they are facing a 
70% marginal rate with his vicious clawback of the renamed family 
allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the figures in his own budget which say that a family 
with $35,000 with a single earner is paying $1,700 in taxes, 
$2,200 more than what a dual earner family would play. That is a 
low income family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies are fine.  Talk is cheap.  When will the government act? 
When will it address the concerns of single income families and 
provide the kind of equity they have been demanding for years? 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the example the member raised was a $30,000 family. The 
fact is we did act.  We increased the child tax benefit and as a 
result that family will now pay no federal income tax.

there is very large scale funding going from the federal

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK193">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-49, an 
act providing for the ratification and the bringing into effect 
of the framework agreement on first nation land management, be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the outset 
of my continuing intervention I must point out, as I tried to do 
on a point of order immediately after question period, that the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development during 
question period, and at other times, incorrectly stated that 
members of the Reform Party supported Bill C-49 at second 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, I have a copy of the vote that was taken on 
December 1, 1998 when the bill was being voted upon at second 
reading.  The results of that vote were:  yeas, 199; nays, 38, 
the 38 comprising all of the Reform members who were present in 
the House for the vote that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the minister addressed her remarks specifically to 
me.  I would also point out that I was here for that vote and 
that I in fact voted against Bill C-49, which is in direct 
contravention to the minister's statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this goes to the heart of the problem.  The government, 
the minister and the parliamentary secretary continue to put out 
misleading and erroneous information on a regular basis on this 
bill.  They have, as a result of that, undermined the confidence 
of people, particularly in British Columbia but across Canada, as 
to the intent of Bill C-49.  I suggest they have done themselves 
no favours by doing this.  The parliamentary secretary was 
talking about driving wedges.  There is nothing worse in terms of 
driving wedges between people than putting out information which 
is incorrect, which is deliberately done and which is done to try 
to leave people with a false impression of what actually has 
taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to Christmas, as a result of lobbying by a number of 
different people, including aboriginal leaders who stand to be 
affected by Bill C-49, we agreed to sit down to see if there was 
a way that we could support Bill C-49 with amendments, because we 
certainly agreed with the principle inculcated in the bill, that 
decision making should be taken out of Ottawa and put into the 
hands of people in local areas. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were led to believe by the government and by some of the 
people we were dealing with that these amendments would be 
possible, but it turned out at the end of the day that the 
government was not prepared to entertain these amendments.  For 
that reason, regrettably—and I say regrettably very sincerely— 
we could not support Bill C-49.  To have done so would have been 
to really let down the people across Canada who have been asking 
us to stand up for these amendments and to make sure the bill was 
fixed prior to being adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to discussing the expropriation powers in the 
bill, which is where I left off prior to question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary and the minister deny that the 
expropriation powers in Bill C-49 are broad and sweeping.  The 
parliamentary secretary said that the federal Expropriation Act 
would actually confine aboriginal bands to that particular 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out for the people watching and for the parliamentary 
secretary that the bill specifically states that in the event of 
a conflict between Bill C-49 and the federal Expropriation Act, 
Bill C-49 would take precedence.  Clearly that means that the 
federal Expropriation Act, in effect, does not have any real 
influence over how expropriations might take place on reserve 
land in the future.  The expropriation powers are not only a 
concern to people on leasehold land on reserves across Canada, 
they are also very much a concern to band members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we have had great difficulty in supporting 
Bill C-49 is this.  I have personally met with some of the chiefs 
who have been trying to get this legislation passed and trying to 
get Reform's support for it.  They indicated that their band 
members were in support of it.  In fact, in the case of the 
Squamish band, regrettably, we found out after the fact that most 
of the people on that reserve were not consulted about Bill C-49. 
We have a petition signed by some 230 members of the band saying 
that they were not consulted, that they are opposed to the bill 
and that they want it to be changed.  They are very concerned 
about their rights as band members.  They say very clearly that 
up until a very short while ago—the end of January—they were 
never consulted and they were not even aware that the band 
council was working with the government to have Bill C-49 brought 
into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These band members are equally concerned, just as those who have 
leasehold interests on reserve land are concerned, about being 
expropriated.  They feel that the chief and council will have 
altogether too much power and too much ability.  They do not want 
to rely on a land code which may come into effect down the road 
to grant the protection they are looking for.  They want it to be 
enshrined in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for the life of me understand why the government, the 
minister and the parliamentary secretary are standing in 
opposition to that.  I cannot understand why they want to deny 
these people having their protection and their rights enshrined 
in this legislation.  It is not a difficult matter for that to be 
accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that the concerns about expropriation are 
overblown.  However, a real estate agent wrote a letter to a 
client on the Musqueam reserve, advising him to take his house 
off the market because in his professional opinion as a real 
estate agent that house currently has no market value.  The 
parliamentary secretary and the minister can argue with Reform, 
but they certainly cannot argue with the marketplace.  I can 
assure the House that right now—and this is a very clear 
situation—the marketability of homes on the Musqueam reserve 
is at zero. 
They cannot sell their homes.  These are homes that were often 
valued at several hundred thousand dollars each a couple of short 
years ago.  Many of the people who are living in them are at or 
near retirement and living on fixed incomes.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fellow who first contacted me about the inability to market 
his home, and the letter that he had received from the real 
estate agent advising him of that, does not live on the Musqueam 
reserve.  He in fact lives in Calgary; he has retired to Calgary. 
He wants to sell his home to get his equity out it.  The sale of 
his home was a big part of what he was counting on to retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see how people have been dramatically affected by not 
only Bill C-49 but by other moves the government has been making 
with respect to the disposition of lands on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large part of the problem on the Musqueam reserve arose 
because federal governments over a long period of time have made 
changes without disclosing to the people who lived on those 
reserves that they had made those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 the Liberal minister of Indian affairs, John Munro, 
signed a discretionary letter that he was authorized to sign 
under section 53 of the Indian Act, transferring his authority to 
the Musqueam Band Council in terms of dealing with the leases. 
That was done without any notice and without any consultation 
with the people who live in those houses, the leaseholders.  They 
had absolutely no knowledge that this had taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in 1991 another minister of Indian affairs, Tom 
Siddon, signed a further agreement which gave the band taxation 
authority over those leaseholders.  This was contrary to what the 
people had been led to believe when they entered into the leases 
in 1965 through 1973.  The deal at that point was that the city 
of Vancouver would be providing the services and would be 
collecting the property taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, once that transfer was done the property taxes 
rose dramatically, two to three times.  A large portion of those 
property taxes have been for school taxes because we know that in 
Canada property taxes are levied in most municipalities for 
municipal services and there is a separate component for schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The band has collected, according to news reports, about $6 
million in school taxes since 1991.  Yet not one penny has 
actually gone toward school or education.  Not one penny was 
transferred to the provincial government in aid of education. 
There has been absolutely no school services provided by the 
Musqueam band to the leaseholders that have been paying these 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of flaws which leave people very uncertain 
and very concerned about the kinds of sweeping changes Bill C-49 
contemplates.  For the life of me, I do not understand why the 
government and the minister are not prepared, if they want to get 
the bill passed, to look at amendments that would provide 
protection and give people a level of comfort so that they would 
be willing to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that by and large Canadians are decent, fair minded 
people.  I have met personally with virtually all the Musqueam 
residents.  I know they are decent, fair minded people.  I know 
they are not opposed to the aspirations of the band.  They just 
want to be treated fairly.  At the present time they feel they 
have been treated extremely unfairly, not only by the band but 
also by the government because the government has chosen to 
proceed with major changes without any consultation and without 
any notice to the leaseholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going further and talking about marital property rights, in the 
minister's intervention she talked about the fact that she as 
minister and previous ministers for the past 130-odd years had 
been making decisions on behalf of bands for the disposition of 
reserve lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly agree with her that it is completely inappropriate 
that these decisions be made in Ottawa.  We certainly agree with 
the principle of devolving that decision making power. 
However, where the government is in error and where the minister 
is in error goes back to the whole notion of collective property

act providing for the ratification and the bringing into effect 
of the Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management, be 
read the third time and passed; and of the amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill C-49, the First Nation Land 
Management Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally the kings of Britain owned and taxed everything.  The 
nobles got fed up with that and forced the king to back off on 
what he had previously owned.  He had been able to tax and to 
decide who could use land, when and how.  The nobles forced some 
changes.  After the nobles finally had their say for a number of 
years, the commoners stepped in and had their say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not yet have full ownership of land.  We have something 
called an estate in land and the estate most Canadians have is an 
estate in fee simple.  Fee common is not as common as one might 
think.  It has finally come to the stage where Canada's Indians 
will perhaps get a stab at having an interest in land which the 
government does not control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evolution of ownership has been accompanied by armies of 
lawyers and consultants who have taken fees for their opinions. 
If we follow it all the way through, we get to Bill C-49 which 
purports to allow first nations to manage their lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody watching the debate is aware that the official 
opposition has some very grave concerns about Bill C-49. It is 
not only our concerns.  These concerns have been raised by a 
number of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petitions have been filed.  People have called talk shows and 
written letters to editors. Personal representations have been 
made to members of parliament, particularly from the west coast. 
Now they are coming in from the east coast where people are 
concerned about what Bill C-49 will do, what powers band councils 
will have and what will be the limits of their powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the B.C. Liberal member for Vancouver Quadra has not 
spoken in the House in opposition to the bill, he has expressed 
opposition as reported in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> on March 3. 
The article indicated that he “voted with the government Monday 
but said he is working behind the scenes to ensure there is a 
thorough Senate committee study, including public hearings and 
possible amendments”.  It went on to indicate: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“No, I don't” support the bill, the MP for Vancouver Quadra 
said on Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Some concerns that had been felt by B.C. MPs on the fast track 
procedure are being resolved by what's emerging as an 
understanding that the Senate will study and hold public hearings 
and will possibly consider amendments and changes for the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The details will be worked out in the next few days”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It further indicated that the member said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the bill, along with media coverage of a 7,000% rent increase 
imposed on non-natives living in Musqueam Park in Vancouver, is 
fuelling more public concern over broader and more crucial native 
issues such as the $490 million Nisga'a treaty. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That treaty is also under attack because it is perceived to be 
granting far more power and lack of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver Quadra has stated that Bill C-49 was 
poorly drafted.  He supported concerns expressed by others who 
said that expropriation rights for Indian bands were excessive. 
There is a lack of protection for native women who often use 
their right to marital property after divorce and the omission of 
any mechanism requiring consultation with surrounding 
municipalities on development matters.  He said “The public's 
concern is correctly focused on it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another government member plans to vote against Bill C-49.  He 
said the bill was excessive and criticized the government for 
imposing closure to limit debate in the House of Commons.  He 
accused the minister of intentionally trying to avoid public 
consultation on land claims and self-government matters across 
Canada.  He stated that their position was to keep the dummies in 
the dark.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government members raise those kinds of concerns, the 
government should be listening.  It is not just us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I asked a question about the government shutting down 
debate on Bill C-49.  I am going to quote what a respected 
academic elder at the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College said, 
“The problem with entrusting band councils to help develop 
divorce laws is that traditional customs are vague”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has refused to deal with an issue that is going 
to create a mosaic of rights across Canada as bands write their 
own laws in respect to divorce.  Does it seem fair when a woman 
from one reserve marries a man from another reserve and finds out 
that she has a different set of rights than she was born with? 
This is Canada, one country.  Surely this country will respect 
equality at least between men and women.  This is not too much to 
expect at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak for a moment on the expropriation 
provisions in this bill.   Clause 28 of the bill, a very short 
section, talks about expropriation which allows a band to write 
its own expropriate act.  Subclause 5 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A first nation shall pay fair compensation to the holder of an 
expropriated interest and, in determining that compensation, the 
first nation shall take into account the rules set out in the 
Expropriation Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking into account is not the same as being bound by.  I am not 
a lawyer and do not claim to understand all the legalese, but I 
am sure that we are going to see judges beginning the process, 
after this bill is passed, if it is passed unamended here or by 
the Senate, of determining what it would mean to take into 
account the provisions of the Expropriation Act which is a 
federal act. The federal act lays out in very clear stages what 
the mechanisms and timelines are for recourse with respect to 
dispute resolution at arbitration in the event there is a 
conflict over expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier on in the debate, getting control over land is 
a process that has taken centuries.  It has gone from the kings 
to the nobles to the commoners and it is finally getting down to 
the Indian bands.  However, let us not leave out the people who 
are affected by it.  It is not always the leaders.  It is the 
people who are governed by the leaders.  We want to ensure that 
they are not unfairly left out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expropriation does not necessarily have to be natives over 
non-natives.  It can be natives over natives.  Whoever owns an 
interest can have that interest ended by expropriation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A municipal expropriation act will talk about the compensation 
proposed.  It might talk about the description of the land, what 
is the extent of the land required, the reasons for doing it and 
those types of things.  If people do not agree, they have 
recourse.  Provincial legislation sets up all of the conciliation 
and arbitration boards to determine how compensation is paid.  It 
is always in the interest of a municipality to have a mechanism 
to obtain land for public purposes but the owner of the interest 
has to be protected.  We certainly do not want the courts to be 
involved early on in every dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that introducing a simple motion calling for the 
clauses in the federal Expropriation Act to be binding is not too 
much.  We want to see development on Indian land, but if people 
are concerned that they may not have their interests safely held, 
we will not find people investing.  One thing investors look for 
is certainty of profit and certainty of a continuing profit and 
that it will not end. 
If people own a home they want to ensure that they hold it now 
and in the future.  They do not want it taken away without proper 
compensation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is deficient in that way.  It is in the interest of the 
signatory bands to put those amendments in place.  It is not in 
our interest.  It does not matter to me.  I do not live on band 
land.  I have a home that is held in fee simple in the town of 
Nipawin.  Consequently, I have nothing to gain in this but the 
bands have something to gain and those who hold interest in the 
land have something to gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I do have something to gain.  When the Reform Party 
forms the next government, I do not want to be back here having 
to deal with Bill C-49.  I want to be able to move on to new 
legislation the government will have on its agenda at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are all good reasons that we should not rush ahead on this 
bill.  It is the government's role to write legislation and to 
get it right the first time.  If the government does not do this, 
it has to be willing to make the necessary amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not our role to write the legislation but to ensure it 
goes through the House in correct form.  It is our role to make 
it perfectly clear to the public that a bill is deficient and 
that the government will have to do something about it.  That is 
what we are doing. I hate to think we are going to send a bill 
that originated here to the Senate of all places asking that it 
make the amendments we refused to make. That is a ridiculous 
thing to expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we say about the matrimonial home?  The children live 
in the home, the mother lives in the home, the father should be 
staying in the home.  We want to see the family as a unit but 
realistically, families break down.  The B.C. Native Women's 
Society has raised a concern as have native women across Canada 
and the national native women's organizations.  Why has that not 
rung a bell with the government?  Why is the minister simply 
saying that they are consulting?  Why not get the consultation 
done first and then come to the House with a bill that is 
complete in its current form? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read earlier about Mr. Cuthand, a respected elder who was a 
priest in the Anglican church.  Why are the concerns of men like 
him not listened to?  The government has rushed ahead and allowed 
this to go on the back burner for who knows how long.  There will 
surely be court cases, payouts and domestic tragedies because the 
government has refused to accept that it has a responsibility not 
only to chiefs and councils but to the people they govern as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the issue of ratepayers on reserves which I do 
not believe has been raised today.  They have no vote.  Prior to 
the American revolution some protesters dressed up as Indians and 
threw a load of tea overboard from a ship docked in Boston 
harbour.  Why?  Because they did not want to be taxed without 
representation.  What we have here is taxation without 
representation.  Many cottage owners have raised the concern that 
they are going to be taxed but they are not going to be 
represented.  Does the government consider this fair? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indians have been kept down in the past but overwaiting is not 
any better.  It still creates conflict and hardship.  It is a 
major concern to everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of public knowledge about this bill is coming to light. 
There is a newspaper article that talks about women from the 
Saint Mary's reserve near Fredericton.  A woman in the article is 
demanding equality, an honest and responsible government, and she 
is against the mismanagement of funds.  She is concerned about 
Bill C-49.  She says that it will give up control over management 
of reserve land.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that every reserve has a government that is 
irresponsible and unresponsive, but they are there.  Certainly we 
want people to have the power to hold the members of the council 
to account.  We do not see that with Bill C-49 going through in 
its current form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the government to vote in favour of the amendment my 
colleague from Skeena put forward today.  Send the bill back to 
committee to address these valid concerns and then bring the bill 
back to the House, not so that anybody's rights are diminished, 
not that what they intend is diminished, but that the bill be 
made sufficient and not be passed in this deficient form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard convincing arguments earlier that there existed a high 
level of support for the bill by members of the reserves and all 
the communities surrounding them, but in January events overtook 
that testimony. Concerns were expressed, as I said before, in 
letters to the editor, talk shows and letters to MPs, all of 
these things.  Municipal councils raised concerns. Constituents 
raised their concerns.  They all stated that they had concerns 
with Bill C-49 in its current form.  Consequently we are required 
as members of parliament to bring these concerns to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal women and children living on reserves do not enjoy 
the protection of property division laws that are available to 
every other Canadian woman.  There is no protection whatsoever 
regarding the use, occupation and possession of land when a 
marriage breaks down with each band devising its own land code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A band of 200 people here, a band of 200 members over there, a 
band of 1,000 people over here, what kind of legislation will 
result from individual bands as different pressure groups push to 
have their interests represented?  Why not do it here in our 
national parliament where all sides of the debate from all 
reserves can be heard. We can come up with a fair and equitable 
law allowing for the division of the matrimonial home and other 
property.  It just is not right to do it the way it is being 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the band councils probably wish the best, but do 
they know what is best?  Do they know the laws?  Do they have 
access to the expertise to write these codes?  Do they have the 
expertise to write property division acts?  Do they have the 
expertise on expropriation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about Bill C-49, which has been developed by 
the Government of Canada.  We are going back to the individual 
reserves, many of which are already under stress where their 
finances are concerned.  They are being asked to put more money 
into developing parts of a land code that could be adopted right 
here in the House of Commons.  They could simply apply it. Judges 
could take it and understand it. Then one judgment where there 
was possible alternative application would be binding rather than 
having every band's land code subject to judicial interpretation. 
It just does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end with a clear call to the government to reconsider 
forcing this legislation through.  It is denying the legitimate 
expressed concerns of band members, municipalities and other 
interested persons.  Not only have they said it to the official 
opposition, but we know they have expressed these concerns to the 
government as well.  They want us to get the bill right in the 
House the first time so that we do not see all kinds of 
amendments going through at the Senate study of the bill.  We 
know it is going to come back for amendment.

at the request of my colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Jean 
and Bloc Quebecois critic on aboriginal affairs, I am pleased to 
speak to Bill C-49, an act providing for the ratification and the 
bringing into effect of the framework agreement on first nation 
land management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw attention to the excellent work done by our 
colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Jean, who was unable to be 
here today.  He has done excellent work on aboriginal issues 
since 1993, first of all by lending an attentive ear to the 
first nations, and also by raising awareness of the aboriginal 
reality in Quebec and in the rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This framework agreement was signed by 14 chiefs of Canada's 
first nations, and the federal government, in February 1996. 
The bill was introduced just before the dissolution of 
parliament in June 1997, as Bill C-75, dying on the Order Paper 
when the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal groups concerned by this bill worked very hard to get 
it back on the legislative agenda as soon as possible.  They did 
an excellent job of lobbying the government and opposition 
critics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois lent them a hand in getting the bill back on 
the legislative agenda as soon as possible.  I should point out 
that the 14 signatory first nations are dispersed throughout 
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and 
New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Columbia first nations concerned are the Westbank, 
the Musqueam, the Squamish, the Lheidli T'enneh and the 
N'Quatqua. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask any aboriginal people listening to excuse my 
pronunciation.  I lack my colleague from St-Jean's familiarity 
with these names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The signatory in Alberta is the Siksika, while there are two 
first nations signatories in Saskatchewan, the Cowessess and the 
Muskoday.

Nipissing, the Mississaugas of Scugog Island, the Chippewas of 
Mnjikaning, and the Chippewas of Georgina Island.  Finally, in 
New Brunswick, it is the first nation of Saint Mary's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One  of the key objectives of this bill for the 14 first nations 
is to allow them to establish their own system for administering 
their land and natural resources.  It will allow them to manage 
the land and natural resources on their reserves. 
Land management will no longer come under the Indian Act.  The 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development will 
therefore no longer have discretionary powers in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill makes provision for the 14 first nations to draw up a 
land code through a process of community approval.  This land 
code will be used to resolve issues such as the use, possession 
and occupation of lands.  Provision should also be made for the 
division of matrimonial property in the case of marriage 
breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is in agreement with the bill's underlying 
principles. 
My colleague, the critic for native affairs, has said in the 
House and in committee that he supports the spirit of the bill, 
which gives the 14 first nations the necessary tools to control 
their lands and thus ensure their economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is therefore one more step towards greater native 
autonomy.  This principle of autonomy is consistent, moreover, 
with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples.  Bill C-49 will therefore give the 14 first nations 
greater control over their lands and their economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development has been studying the economic development 
of the first nations since last year. 
The members of the standing committee are trying to identify the 
obstacles to aboriginals' economic development, and there are 
many such obstacles, of which the worst is the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is paternalistic.  It treats aboriginals like 
children and is a major impediment to their economic 
participation in their communities.  This bill will mean that 
the 14 first nations can break free of the paternalistic clauses 
in the Indian Act and finally develop economically.  The chiefs 
who appeared before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs 
and Northern Development on December 3 all spoke of this 
economic impact of Bill C-49 on their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Robert Louie, head of the transitional land 
management commission, Bill C-49 will give first nations control 
over their resources and lands.  They will be able to assume the 
responsibilities inherent in this control. 
It is a way of putting an end to the archaic and paternalistic 
attitude of the Indian Act and the federal government's power to 
administer their lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Austin Bear of the Muskoday first nation of British 
Columbia told the members of the standing committee at this same 
session that his community, and many others, had missed out on 
opportunities for economic development because of the 
restrictive and paternalistic nature of the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke about an American manufacturing company that had shown 
an interest in locating in their community.  When told of the 
procedure that had to be followed, obtaining the approval of the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and going through all manner of red 
tape, their response was that they did not have time for that; 
it was too slow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, the Muskoday first nation is also seeking 
to develop its tourism potential in partnership with others.  If 
there is one thing Chief Austin Bear does not want, it is to 
miss out again on an opportunity to do business with an 
interested partner because the Indian Act deprives them of 
control over their resources and land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very much aware that aboriginal people have a different 
concept than us about community, land and resources.  The Bloc 
Quebecois aboriginal affairs critic has referred to this on more 
than one occasion here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief William McCue of the Georgina Island first nation in 
Ontario also touched briefly on the economic issues relating to 
this bill when he appeared before the standing committee on 
aboriginal affairs on December 3.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Georgina Island community is located on three islands in 
Lake Simcoe, 60 miles north of Toronto.  Its main source of 
revenue is the rental of 500 cottages, and the leases of most of 
these terminate on March 31, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents $1 million in revenue, which is used to finance 
various programs, including housing and community maintenance 
and infrastructures.  Cottage rentals are therefore a source of 
operating income for the community, and create and maintain a 
number of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief William McCue raised one interesting point about the 
economic dynamics in his community. 
Most of those responsible for leases and therefore the 
management of the cottages on Georgina Island are women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these positive aspects of the bill, the Bloc Quebecois 
not only had reservations, it presented amendments.  The Bloc 
Quebecois believes the native women will not have legal 
protection during the transition period leading to the signing 
of the land code in the reserve in the case of marriage 
breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To better understand the sense of the Bloc Quebecois amendments, 
we must recall the legal context of native women.  Currently, 
they face a legal void, because the Indian Act contains no 
provision for distributing matrimonial property in the event of 
the breakdown of marriages between native men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native women cannot claim the same rights as Canadian women, who 
are governed by provincial laws. 
This situation causes concern to associations of native women in 
Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer specifically to the British Columbia Native Women's 
Society, the Native Women's Association of Canada and the 
Association des femmes auchtotones du Québec, which have made 
representations to the native affairs critic and the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois expressing their concerns in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They convinced us to introduce amendments to protect native 
women legally during the transition period, the 12 months in 
which the land code comes into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that at the start of Bill C-49's parliamentary 
journey, the Bloc Quebecois put a lot of stock in the 
independent inquiry initiated by the minister of Indian affairs 
at first reading of Bill C-49 last June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this inquiry was to find solutions to the legal 
vacuum in which native women find themselves.  But since the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has been 
dragging her feet, the inquiry has not even begun. The Bloc 
Quebecois had no choice but to move amendments concerning the 
claims of the native women of Quebec and of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An inquiry is a good way to examine the problem of the legal 
status of native women generally, for, in our view, the problem 
goes well beyond the scope of Bill C-49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, what is required is a complete overhaul of the Indian 
Act, an outmoded piece of legislation from the last century, 
which completely ignores gender dynamics on the reserves. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois believe that this reform is necessary 
so that legislation such as Bill C-49 can be enacted quickly, 
with prejudice to no one.  In this case, it is native women who 
are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add, however, that this reform of the Indian Act should 
not take place unless there is genuine consultation with all 
native groups in Canada.  Only then would the legislation truly 
reflect native concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the inquiry into the legal status of native women is 
stalled, the Bloc Quebecois has moved four amendments at report 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments are necessary because of the foot-dragging of 
the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development on this 
issue, for which she was strongly criticized by the native 
affairs critic at the time the amendments were moved. 
All these amendments are therefore based on the provision in the 
bill on environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Bloc Quebecois wanted to ensure that there are 
minimal standards for the protection of aboriginal women with 
respect to matrimonial property in the case of marriage 
breakdown.  This protection is based on the existing legislation 
in this regard, that is, provincial statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments, which were rejected, amended clauses 17 and 20 
in order to establish the minimal protection necessary during 
the transition period of 12 months following the taking effect 
of the land code, in which the 14 first nations are asked to 
include general rules and procedures, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—in cases of breakdown of marriage, respecting the use, 
occupation and possession of first nation land—

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK206">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ)</B> moved that Bill 
C-299, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act, 1997 
(premiums and Employment Insurance Account) be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-299, an act 
to amend the Employment Insurance Act as regards the premium 
rate setting and the employment insurance account, which was 
tabled in this House in December 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first remind members of the context in which this bill 
was introduced, along with five other bills on employment 
insurance that were introduced by Bloc Quebecois members, namely 
the hon. members for Frontenac—Mégantic, Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, 
Québec, Repentigny, and Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1990, the federal government has imposed four employment 
insurance reforms to fight the deficit. The federal obsession 
with the elimination of the deficit at any cost was prevalent 
under both the Conservatives and the Liberals. With each of 
these reforms, the government changed the rules with the obvious 
goals of excluding claimants, of reducing the amount of 
benefits, and of shortening the period during which these 
benefits are paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can, therefore, be stated clearly and unequivocally that the 
deficit is being overcome at the expense of the unemployed. 
Even if the federal budget is balanced, moreover, the government 
is sticking with the same policies and showing no hesitation in 
o misappropriating the surplus in the fund for its own use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years ago, in 1989 before these reforms were introduced, 
four out of five unemployed people were entitled to benefits.  A 
drop from 80% to 20% may well be impressive,  but mostly it is 
disgusting, that now two out of five unemployed people draw 
benefits.  At the same time, the government is getting its hands 
on the sizeable surplus in the employment insurance fund.  At 
the moment, this surplus is estimated at close to $20 billion, 
and it is expected to exceed $25 billion by the end of 1999.  I 
will come back to the matter of the surplus later on in my 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-299 was therefore introduced in December of 1997, in order 
to improve two aspects of employment insurance, the setting of 
contribution rates and the employment insurance account.  The 
first clause therefore addresses the way decisions are made on 
premium levels.  At present, it is the governor in council who 
does so, on the recommendation of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. 
Judging from past experience, hon. members will agree with me 
that this is not very reassuring. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back over the events of last fall, we had to keep on 
asking questions of the two ministers until December, before 
finding out what would be happening to the contribution rate in 
the coming year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it the government has so much power to determine 
contribution levels, when, since 1990, it has not contributed a 
cent to the employment insurance fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money in this fund comes entirely from workers and 
employers.  It is absurd that they have no say in contribution 
levels and have no choice but to pay, without a word, but 
smiling all the while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the amendment we propose to clause 1 of our bill is 
intended to give full powers to the Employment Insurance 
Commission to establish contributions.  It must be said that 
this commission is tripartite and comprises representatives of 
employers, workers and the government.  Initially, the 
commission would have the power to establish levels of 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make the process more transparent, since at the moment it is 
particularly obscure, Bill C-299 provides that every two years 
the Commission will hold at least one session to hear the 
observations of parties interested in making their opinions on 
the establishment of contribution levels known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within 60 days of the session, the commission must publish an 
opinion in at least five major francophone papers and five major 
anglophone papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill therefore makes the process much 
more transparent and much more democratic, because it will 
enable interested members of the public and organizations to 
have their observations on contribution rates heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision gives power back to those who should have it: the 
contributors, employees and employers. 
This is all the more important because the government is using 
the premiums as it pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiums paid by workers are currently set at $2.55 per 
$100, while those paid by the employers are at $3.57. Of that 
$6.12, the government is spending $1.28 for purposes not related 
to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This looks a lot more like a tax on employment than an insurance 
in case of a loss of employment. The government is deliberately 
altering the basic purpose of the employment insurance fund. 
This type of behaviour is not acceptable in a country that 
prides itself on being the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the bill seeks to separate the employment 
insurance account from the government operations account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why clause 2 of Bill C-299 provides that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—on September 1, in each and every, there shall be credited to 
the employment insurance account and charged to the consolidated 
revenue fund an amount equal to the amount calculated in 
accordance with the following formula: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A - B 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will no doubt want to know what A and B stand for. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—where A represents all amounts paid into the consolidated 
revenue fund or obtained by it pursuant to this act in the 
preceding financial year; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B represents the total amounts 
used by the consolidated revenue fund to meet its obligations 
under this act that have been credited to the employment 
insurance account in the preceding financial year. 
</UL></UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of this amendment would be that, on September 1 of 
each year, we would know exactly where we stood with the EI 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, even though these surpluses are close to $20 
billion for 1998, they could be said to be virtual, because they 
are part of the consolidated revenue fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amending the legislation in this manner would create a separate 
account for the EI fund.  This surplus should obviously be used 
exclusively for the purpose of administering the EI regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so shocking right now is that the EI surplus is melting 
away like snow on a warm day, particularly when we recall the 
repeated assurances of the Minister of Finance that the EI 
surpluses were a good thing because they represented a hedge 
against periods of lower employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discrepancy between what the Minister of Finance says and 
what he does is very troubling.  In 1997, 64% of premiums paid 
into the EI fund went towards paying benefits to unemployed 
workers.  The remaining 36%, approximately $7 billion, was used 
by the Minister of Finance to eliminate the deficit, pay down 
the debt and finance the federal government's forays onto 
provincial turf.  According to the 1999 budget, the Minister of 
Finance will be helping himself to $5 billion from the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, employers and employees, the only contributors to 
this fund, have paid the government's share, have wiped out the 
$6 billion deficit in the fund, and have built up the surplus of 
$20 billion.  It is clear that the government does not want to 
change the rules of the game one iota, because the employment 
insurance fund is a real milk cow for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has done away with the deficit with the money of the workers 
and employers, and has started to pay down the debt.  He is also 
using these funds to interfere in education via the millennium 
scholarships, which have been criticized by Quebec, and is using 
it as well to interfere in the health system of Quebec and the 
other provinces.  These costly duplications have been funded 
with this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, then, is the context that justifies Bill C-299. 
The employment insurance program is based on a consensus among 
the population that everyone needs to be assured of a decent 
income when temporarily out of work.  This is the very purpose 
of having such a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen, however, the Liberal government has completely 
altered the nature of this plan by tightening up the rules for 
eligibility so that a large number of people are excluded, 
particularly women, youth and seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government is using the fund as if it were an 
employment tax, as if it were deficit insurance.  The employment 
insurance fund no longer serves workers; it is there to serve 
the government, and the Minister of Finance in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-299 is, therefore, to give more power to 
contributors as far as setting premium levels is concerned, and 
to differentiate between the employment insurance fund and the 
Treasury.  These amendments would add transparency to the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope, therefore, that all parties in this House will support 
the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-299 would give the Employment Insurance Commission the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission would be required to hold hearings every two 
years as the basis for establishing the rates and it would credit 
any surplus of premiums over benefits to the EI account and 
presumably leave that money there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal is seriously flawed, however, and would not at all 
serve the interests of workers or the general Canadian public. 
Let me explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, a totally independent commission would be 
accountable only to its constituents, in this case workers and 
employers.  As it now stands, the commission makes 
recommendations to the government which is accountable to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely because the government is accountable to all 
Canadians that we have taken steps to ensure that employment 
insurance offers unemployed Canadians more than just income 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current system, EI provides for $2.1 billion a year in 
active employment measures to help unemployed Canadians get the 
skills and experience needed to find work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Bloc's proposed amendments to the act, there would be 
no assurance that such an active system would have been 
established or would be maintained by the proposed commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, neither Bill C-299 nor the later Bloc proposal states 
whether the proposed commission would be given responsibility for 
establishing EI benefit levels or for policy and regulation of 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a recession, increased numbers of unemployed could place 
greater demands on the fund, necessitating higher premium rates. 
This would happen at the very time when sound fiscal policy would 
keep premiums stable rather than raising them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely only a single body responsible for both premiums and 
benefits and accountable to all Canadians could effectively deal 
with such a situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the Employment Insurance Act is set up the way 
it is for very good reasons.  The act sets out the process for 
determining premium rates and the existing commission is bound by 
that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission includes one representative for workers, one for 
employers and the deputy minister and associate deputy minister 
of Human Resources Development Canada.  It sets premium rates 
which the Minister of Human Resources Development and the 
Minister of Finance recommend to the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1986 the EI account has been integrated with the accounts 
of Canada on the advice of the auditor general because it is, 
after all, the Government of Canada which establishes EI policy 
and legislation and it is the Government of Canada which makes up 
any deficit in the account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current system, accumulated surpluses are used 
temporarily by the government which credits interest to the 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also under the current system, premium rates are set at a level 
that responds to the needs of workers and employers, but they are 
also established with the broader perspective of the account's 
role as an economic stabilizer.  In fact, our government has 
reduced premium rates in each of the past five years from $3.07 
per $100 earned in 1994 to $2.55 in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our intention is to continue to reduce rates at a gradual pace 
as long as economic conditions permit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis, the greatest flaw of Bill C-299 lies in 
what it does not address.  The bill is largely beside the point 
in that it completely ignores the conditions that led up to 
redesigning the old unemployment insurance program in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current employment insurance program is a response to the 
very different labour market we have today compared to when 
unemployment insurance was first introduced.  Certainly we still 
need a sound income support program to assist people who find 
themselves temporarily out of work.  However, nowadays we need 
much more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, one of the objectives of the new employment insurance 
program is to reduce regular dependence on EI by giving people 
the tools they need to get back to work.  In today's labour 
market very few people start a job straight out of high school 
and keep at it for a lifetime. 
They now change jobs quite often.  Many work short term or on 
contract.  Many are self-employed.  Many young people juggle 
several part time or short term jobs to gain experience and the 
skills they need to get a job.  Many people need different types 
of help:  people with disabilities, young people trying to get 
their first job, aboriginal people and others trying to adjust to 
changing working conditions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving people a little income support while keeping them on the 
economic sidelines will never make a real improvement in their 
lives.  What we have to do is give them the tools they need to 
get and keep good jobs.  That is the purpose of part II of the 
employment insurance regime, an array of active measures beyond 
mere income support.  Those measures fit into a much broader plan 
of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, through the EI system Canadians invest 
$2.1 billion a year in active measures to help unemployed 
Canadians get the skills and experience needed to find 
employment, be it through wage subsidies, job partnerships, 
self-employment assistance or earning supplements.  Every year 
hundreds of thousands of unemployed Canadians benefit from these 
measures paid through the EI account to get the experience they 
need to get good jobs.  Furthermore, much of these measures are 
delivered by the provinces and territories in an effort to ensure 
that they are tailored to meet the needs of Canadians wherever 
they live and work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the ways in which we can really help the unemployed, 
ways that work and can address the problems of the unemployed. 
But it is unclear if such efforts could be maintained through the 
EI account if parliament adopted the legislation proposed by the 
hon. member across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the new system seems to be working as it should.  It is 
too soon to tell if further amendments to the EI program are 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of the reasons I have just mentioned, the House should 
oppose the bill proposed by the hon. member from the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to speak to my colleague's bill, 
a private member's bill, brought forward not from the government 
or a government department, but from a member of the House.  As 
such, I have great respect for members who take advantage and 
work within this very important opportunity that we as members of 
parliament have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find myself very impressed by the fact that this bill was 
drafted and entered into the system in 1997.  That was before the 
true magnitude of the concern regarding how government was 
misusing the EI surplus became a strong issue.  This member was 
very far-sighted.  She looked ahead and saw a real issue before a 
number of other people did and I congratulate her for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What she is attempting to do in this bill is, first, to get 
government hands off the EI money and, second, to separate this 
money to make it more accountable and transparent in the way it 
is handled by crediting moneys collected under the Employment 
Insurance Act to an employment insurance account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point concerns the employment insurance commission 
setting premium rates and generally having a more independent 
role in the management of this fund.  The government member who 
just spoke said that this should not be handled by a commission 
accountable to workers and employees, but by the government which 
is accountable to all Canadians.  Sitting in opposition, I see a 
woeful lack of accountability on the part of this government to 
Canadians, so I would oppose his arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns that workers and employees have is that the 
commission is not really accountable to them. 
It is a body that is not chosen from workers and employees.  It 
has a very strong government influence.  The strong hand of 
government is very evident in the workings of the commission. 
Far from this commission being accountable to workers and 
employees, in my opinion it needs to be strengthened in that 
direction.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wishes to pursue this issue in another bill, since 
this one is not votable, I would suggest that strengthening the 
accountability of the commission to the people whose money is 
involved and who this program is supposed to serve would be 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind government members that this is supposed to be 
unemployment insurance.  If it is really insurance, surely the 
insured, the people who pay the premiums and have to live or die 
with the benefits, should have a say about how their program 
program that they pay for and which they rely on in times of 
unemployment should be structured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the cabinet to use this program for its own political 
purposes is not appropriate. It is definitely not appropriate for 
the government to use the premiums of this insurance program for 
its own purposes, its own slush fund or pot of money to do with 
it as it will. That is the second part of the member's bill.  It 
attempts to separate the moneys paid into the employment 
insurance account from the general revenue of the government.  I 
think even the member would acknowledge that this provision in 
her bill is not as strong as she would like to see it.  I would 
certainly like to see a stronger provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it talks about moneys being credited to the employment 
insurance account, it does not specify explicitly that this 
account would be separate from the general revenue fund and that 
government could not spend money from the fund on other purposes. 
Clarification and strengthening of that provision in light of 
the government's insistence and anxiety to use these moneys for 
other purposes would be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government speaker talked about the fact that there had been 
reductions to EI premiums.  I would point out that these are 
minuscule reductions.  We have had debates on this before in the 
House. I do not need to belabour the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief actuary of the fund says that premiums could be 
reduced by fully a third and still leave a very prudent, even a 
very generous surplus in the fund against a time when for some 
reason there may be more withdrawals from the fund than there 
presently are. The fund's own actuary is saying that the 
reductions the government has made are minuscule, that they do 
not really get the fund to a reasonable level.  Of course the 
government is using the enormous overpayment from Canadian 
workers for other purposes, and particularly to make itself look 
good on the deficit side.  It is a kind of borrowing from an 
insurance fund of Canadians for other purposes. That is not the 
way this fund should be run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about skills training.  Most members in 
the House if not all would agree that with our changing 
technology and our changing economic circumstances and the 
information boom in recent years, training and retraining are 
very important components of workplace effectiveness.  These are 
things that Canadian workers need.  There has not been an 
adequate debate about the extent to which the insurance fund, the 
insurance against unemployment, should be a legitimate funder of 
those programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested if the member proposing this bill is so 
inclined, to hear how she feels the fund should be used in this 
regard.  How would workers and employers themselves feel about 
not only paying for some of this training and retraining but then 
having those programs overseen by government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member has had people come to her office, as have 
I, workers who have taken training or retraining programs under 
the EI system which are administered and run by government.  They 
are very disappointed in many cases. Some programs give virtually 
no skills at all.  Even though workers diligently perform 
everything that has been asked of them, they go back into the 
workforce and find that they have not received any substantial 
training or benefit, or the training has been for jobs that do 
not exist. If there is going to be a retraining effort for 
workers, it should be directed much more by what they themselves 
feel they need and what the labour force is looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very worthwhile effort on the part of the member.  It 
is a bill which we all know is needed and which is moving in the 
right direction.  I applaud the member and support her efforts 
wholeheartedly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B> Mr.  Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak in favour of Bill C-299 presented 
by the Bloc Quebecois member for Laval Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-299 proposes to amend the Employment Insurance Act in two 
ways.  First, it proposes that the Employment Insurance 
Commission set the UI premium rates.  Second, Bill C-299 would 
create a separate UI account to ensure the unemployment insurance 
fund is used to help unemployed workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask why these measures are necessary.  We would think 
that the unemployment insurance premiums we all pay are used 
exclusively to help unemployed workers while they are looking for 
a job.  Unfortunately this is not exactly the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last five years the unemployment insurance fund has been 
collecting huge surpluses. That is not necessarily a bad thing, 
if the money was being spent to help the unemployed. 
Unfortunately these surpluses have been used by the Liberal 
government as a slush fund to eliminate the deficit on the backs 
of the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Bill C-299 is important.  By having the Employment 
Insurance Commission set the UI premium rates, we are 
guaranteeing that political motivations do not become a factor in 
setting the premium rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP would go even further and create an independent UI 
commission.  We recommend that this commission be comprised of 
one workers representative, one employers representative and a 
president who would be chosen following consultations with the 
representatives of workers and employers. The commission should 
also be comprised of five part time worker commissioners and five 
part time employer commissioners. It should be gender balanced 
and reflect the regional diversity of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having the commission set premiums and creating an independent 
UI commission are important steps in guaranteeing the integrity 
of the UI program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-299 also proposes the creation of a separate UI account. 
This addresses the concerns of many Canadians who refuse to 
accept that the UI fund has become a slush fund for the Liberal 
government.  Unemployment insurance is a trust fund, not a slush 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to read a few comments of 
working Canadians who oppose the use of the UI surplus for 
purposes of other than helping Canada's unemployed.  These 
comments were gathered by my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst who 
visited 20 cities from coast to coast to coast listening to what 
Canadians have to say about the changes in the unemployment 
insurance system and the theft of the UI fund by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A worker from the Acadian Peninsula had this to say about the 
government's dependence on the UI fund:  “The government is 
wrong when it says that workers become dependent on unemployment 
insurance. 
It is rather the Minister of Finance who is dependent on the 
unemployment insurance fund, because without it, the deficit 
would still be there, and his budget would show a deficit, not a 
surplus”.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has justified its changes to unemployment 
insurance by stating that it wants to prevent dependence.  It has 
failed.  This government has become so dependent on the UI 
surplus that it could not have balanced the budget without it. 
For all of the Minister of Finance's boasting of having balanced 
the budget, he forgets to mention that were it not for Canadian 
workers and employers, we would have no budgetary surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gary White had a very good question when he attended an event 
during the NDP's UI tour.  Mr. White said “If someone steals 
from a store and gets caught, they are arrested and have a 
criminal record.  How is it that this government can steal the 
money from the workers' premiums without being investigated?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is an excellent question.  How can this 
government take the money of workers and employers out of the UI 
fund?  Since this government clearly has no qualms about 
balancing the budget on the backs of the unemployed, we need to 
create a separate UI fund to stop this nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently only 32% of unemployed workers qualify for UI 
benefits.  Over 800,000 unemployed Canadians who have paid into 
the UI system are unable to get benefits. Meanwhile there is a 
$20 billion surplus in the UI account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This insanity has to stop.  This government is hurting 
unemployed Canadians and the small and medium size businesses 
that they are no longer able to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women have also been hard hit by the government UI cuts.  Fewer 
women qualify for maternity benefits. Only 11% of women under 25 
who lose their jobs qualify for benefits.  Eleven percent. Why is 
that?  Where is the equity in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's changes in UI are hurting women, as well as 
young people, as well as seasonal workers.  The government's 
changes in UI are hurting entire communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Dartmouth, for example, has lost $20 million a year 
in UI benefit payments.  Nova Scotia has lost $716 million 
between 1993 and 1997.  That is a lot of money taken out of our 
economy, taken out of small and medium size businesses and taken 
out of unemployed workers' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment insurance program needs to be reformed to 
respond to the realities of the current labour market.  Bill 
C-299 is a first step in ensuring that the unemployment insurance 
fund addresses the preoccupation of Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge members of this House to support this very 
important initiative put forward by the member for Laval Centre. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak on Bill C-299. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payroll taxes are one of the most significant impediments to job 
growth in Canada.  By directly increasing the cost of labour, we 
ultimately decrease the demand for labour.  That is one of the 
reasons Canada's unemployment rate continues to be stubbornly 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has stubbornly clung to unrealistically high EI 
premiums in order to pay down the deficit.  While we laud the 
efforts to pay down the deficit, effectively the government 
through its policies, by paying down the deficit, by raising and 
maintaining unnecessarily high taxes and at the same time cutting 
spending on programs like the EI, has put the government in the 
black and perversely Canadians in the red. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You cannot pay down the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  An hon. member from the Reform Party is 
saying that the government has not paid down the deficit. 
Perhaps as a member of the House of Commons finance committee he 
should consider that there is a difference between deficit and 
debt.  I think the member means the government has not paid down 
the debt.  The member does not understand the difference between 
deficit and debt, but that is all right.  I guess one does not 
have to understand economics to be in the House of Commons or on 
the finance committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance issue is fundamental for a number of 
reasons.  First, labour market flexibility is extraordinarily 
important in the new economy.  I commend the hon. member for this 
piece of legislation.  It has the potential by creating a new 
independent commission to set rates separate from politics and 
separate from the finance minister and the government in power. 
Labour and management in small business can set rates which best 
reflect the realities of the market in a particular area of the 
country at a particular time.  That is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour market flexibility depends largely on employment 
insurance programs and training.  One of the failures of the 
government in terms of the slashing of EI benefits has been its 
complete abdication of responsibility for training.  There has 
been an offloading to the provinces in the area of training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fundamentally wrong that in order to qualify for training 
someone actually has to be on employment insurance and in order 
to get employment insurance has to be laid off.  Many small and 
medium size companies across the country would like to have their 
employees participate in training but currently they do not 
benefit from it.  The training components are failing on a 
national level and the cuts to EI have been a significant part of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission should have the ability to determine both the 
premiums rates and the nature of programs.  I feel an autonomous 
commission could better determine how premiums could be spent 
through the programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the shifts I would like to see in EI is from almost pure 
income support to a focus on training.  We could develop a 
mandate that recognizes the importance not just of income support 
but also of training such that people are able to access the 
levers of the new economy and of an economy that will be changing 
at an ever-increasing pace in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of seasonal work is another issue the government has 
largely ignored.  It has punished Canadians who are involved in 
seasonal work.  Many sectors in Atlantic Canada, including 
agriculture, the fisheries and small business, have over a period 
of years developed along the lines of seasonal employment.  The 
government cut EI premiums, particularly challenging those 
involved in seasonal employment, without providing any structural 
alternative to those programs for those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers in Atlantic Canada were hit extraordinarily 
hard.  I heard the hon. member for Dartmouth say earlier that 
there was a $716 million loss to Nova Scotians.  I would posit 
that loss was largely felt by those involved in seasonal 
employment:  people working for farms in the Annapolis Valley, 
people working in the fisheries, people working for small 
business.  Small businesses, farms, fish processors and other 
employees bore the brunt of those cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government create a new agency or co-ordinating body to 
help co-ordinate seasonal work such that seasonal workers like 
people involved in agriculture in the summer could potentially 
participate in forestry work in the winter? No, it did not do 
anything.  It effectively cut the money but did not replace it 
with vision or with a commitment to new and visionary programs 
and better government.  Instead it reduced the size of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not all about the size of government.  Sometimes we have 
to talk about the role of government and the effectiveness of 
government.  One of the areas in which the government could have 
played a more active role and could still play a more active role 
in is the creation of a pilot program in Atlantic Canada aimed at 
creating an agency that effectively co-ordinates seasonal workers 
so that those employed in such sectors as agriculture in the 
summer could have an opportunity to participate in other types of 
seasonal work like the forestry in the winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be able to effectively take those people who have been 
treated shoddily by the draconian cuts to the program and provide 
them with a sense of hope and a sense of opportunity by helping 
them focus their efforts on participating in the economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people with mortgages in my constituency who are 
trying to raise families, in many cases two or three children. 
They have effectively seen their incomes halved by the changes 
the government made to EI.  They are struggling with $6,000 or 
$7,000 per year or less.  That is a reality.  That exists in many 
areas of Canada, not just in inner cities but in poor rural 
communities.  It is a significant challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a party have a fundamental belief in the free market 
economy, but a free market economy is not sustainable unless all 
members of society have access to the levers of that economy and 
equality of opportunity.  If the EI program were properly 
structured, it could help provide access to those levers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a separate commission would be a great step 
forward.  Ultimately the decision making powers would be with 
those people affected most by the EI fund.  We would assert that 
the employers and the employees are the correct proprietors of 
that fund.  It would deny governments of any political stripe the 
opportunity to use the fund for politically motivated purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when there will be change in the workplace and change 
in the economy it would provide, for instance, opportunities for 
the EI fund to be focused on new and exciting areas, including 
providing Canadians with an opportunity to train and retrain 
throughout their lives.  Those are the types of changes that are 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not confident the government will make those types of 
changes.  As long as it keeps EI premiums unnecessarily and 
offensively high and reduces benefits significantly without 
replacing them with any type of vision for the future, I do not 
think the government will ever engage in creative policy 
development focused on achieving the full potential of the EI 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope all members of the House consider the legislation 
very carefully and its potential in the long term. The government 
has taken $19 billion from the EI fund over the past several 
years to pad its own books. The past is the past.  It is hard to 
change that now, but we do have an opportunity where we are 
emerging into a post-deficit situation where we can focus on 
doing the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-299 would be one of the first steps toward making the 
right decisions in the future to ensure that all Canadians and 
employers and employees benefit from the good public policy that 
we developed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
brief.  The member from the PC Party chided me for not knowing 
the difference between debt and deficit.  It is my contention 
that he is the one who does not understand.  He and members on 
the Liberal side frequently talk about paying off the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By definition it cannot be done.  The deficit is an amount that 
one borrows.  The best one can do is to reduce the amount of 
borrowing or to stop borrowing.  One cannot pay off a deficit 
since it is intangible.  It is simply the amount borrowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I objected to the use of the terminology because many people do 
not understand it.  It confuses them into thinking that we are 
paying off or have paid off the debt which still stands at close 
to $600 billion.  I just wanted to correct that point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
these five minutes are very important to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to express my gratitude that all the parties in 
this House considered it worthwhile to intervene on Bill C-299. 
The people who had the time to watch us on television saw very 
clearly where the heart of this House lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I face you, Mr. Speaker, it seems that it lies to the right 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank my colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill who 
recognized my perception. 
I would like to say to her, and to all the members sharing this 
emotion—and most of them are on this side, although I am sure 
there are some on the other side too—that it was not hard to be 
perceptive.  Everyone knows that the past often foretells the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my colleague from Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia 
praise the absolutely extraordinary reductions in contributions. 
I would remind him that these reductions boasted about by the 
Minister of Finance and so extraordinarily praised by him, came 
nowhere near to satisfying employers and workers.  They did not 
satisfy the auditor general any more.  They were not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That money could have been given back to workers and employers 
to be reinvested in businesses because, as we know, they need 
these funds in the context of globalization. However, that was 
not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone agrees that the poor were totally ignored in the last 
federal budget. The government ignored the unemployed and the 
needy. Yesterday, I was sitting on our committee and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development came to testify. He had 
no choice but to recognize there was nothing in that budget for 
handicapped children. Where is the compassion? Where is the 
heart? I wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, unemployment is going down somewhat in Canada. This 
is great, but that trend does not at all reflect the surge in 
the economy. This has been the case for several years. The 
economy is doing well, but the unemployment rate has not come 
down as much as it should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment is on the decrease and the poor are still with us, 
and in some cases their poverty is the direct result of EI cuts. 
While 80% of unemployed workers used to qualify for benefits, 
now only 40% do.  One might well wonder what became of the other 
40%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were they coddled for all these years?  Did they receive 
government handouts?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding could be described as relatively well off, but even it 
has its young people who have no jobs, or who manage to find 
only insignificant jobs that will never give them the required 
number of hours. It is high time this government gave a signal 
to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give it an opportunity.  Despite my years, I am still a 
bit naïve.  I will give it an opportunity. 
I am seeking the unanimous consent of the House to make Bill 
C-299 votable.  We must show compassion as well as reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore call for unanimous consent.

Laval Centre has requested unanimous consent of the House to have

consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.15 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
