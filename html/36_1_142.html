<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FISHERS' BILL OF RIGHTS 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 4 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-302, an act to establish the rights of fishers including 
the right to be involved in the process of fisheries stock 
assessment, fish conservation, setting of fishing quotas, fishing 
licensing and the public right to fish and establish the right of 
fishers to be informed of decisions affecting fishing as a 
livelihood in advance and the right to compensation if other 
rights are abrogated unfairly, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
certainly is a privilege today to join with my colleagues in the 
House to debate the motion of my colleague, the hon. member for 
New Brunswick Southwest, who represents a riding that is very 
much involved with the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only about a week ago our provincial newspaper had a very 
lengthy article on the tremendous resource that we have in the 
Bay of Fundy.  I am sure that the member, who is from that area, 
is very much concerned about the future and the longevity of the 
fishery for all of us in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is curious today that we are talking about a so-called 
fishers' bill of rights.  If we go back, historically, we find 
that in the last 200 years rights have been developed for a very 
significant group of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the original bill of rights and the work that was 
done by the American colonists when the United States was set up 
as a new country in this hemisphere.  Then, of course, with the 
French revolution we had the declaration of the rights of man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also this week we have to reflect upon the stamp that came out 
only this past month recognizing a fellow New Brunswicker, John 
Humphreys, who was instrumental in writing the special human 
rights declaration for the United Nations.  I am sure New 
Brunswickers are proud that the stamp was issued.  We are 
certainly proud that a New Brunswicker received international 
recognition for his work on human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, of course, we have our own human rights legislation. 
However I question the necessity for a fishers' bill of rights 
because across this country there are many different sectors of 
the economy.  If this House is going to try to develop bills of 
rights, maybe there should be one farmers.  They probably deserve 
a bill of rights because one of the first occupations on this 
earth was agriculture.  Maybe some of our friends from that 
sector could have a farmers' bill of rights.  We could go on and 
on to identify different groups that should certainly have 
rights.  I think of animal rights.  Maybe the member opposite 
should be thinking of a fish bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 25 years fish have had a very difficult time on our 
globe.  As a very good source of protein, we find that many 
emerging nations or nations in difficulty have looked upon the 
waters of this earth as supplying protein for their people. As a 
result, the fishing industry, and fish in particular, have been 
under great stress.  In the 1980s Atlantic Canada suffered great 
difficulties with the decline of the groundfishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the west coast might worry about coho salmon. 
They too might need to have their rights protected. If we do not 
have some protection for these species soon our entire economy in 
terms of the fishery will be in difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have certain concerns with the bill in terms of this group of 
people.  I know that fisher people are a very important part of 
our economy.  As a government we have attempted to regulate and 
to show fisher people that they have a responsibility to sustain 
their industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through regulation and hopefully co-operation the various fisher 
people can work along with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
to ensure that our fishery has a future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should also recognize that with the decline of the 
east coast fishery and the problems on the west coast we have 
developed programs to assist those areas.  The fisher people who 
have difficulties will have an opportunity to take part in 
programs to get assistance with training and to improve habitat, 
as we have done on the west coast with the salmon fishery.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the east coast, as the member opposite from Halifax would 
certainly agree, we have developed good programs to make sure 
that people in the fishing industry can receive some assistance 
when fish become scarce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the fishery in the great province of Newfoundland 
we find that today the resource from the sea is bringing more 
money to that province than it did during the best years of the 
groundfishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at alternate species.  The fishermen may develop 
other aspects of fishing and sales for those fish, which will 
enable them to continue in their home communities.  However, we 
have to be concerned with what has happened to the good people on 
the east coast and those who have encountered serious 
difficulties as a result of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that fish have traditionally been very 
available.  However, today we have to be concerned with the fact 
that we have to sustain the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the member is a bit off base in terms of 
trying to develop a charter of rights for fisher people.  The 
minister has brought forward a committee to look at partnerships 
in fishing, to try to develop a co-operative venture between 
those who are out on the water and those sitting in offices 
trying to regulate the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that fish are a public, not a private 
resource, and the Government of Canada has a definite 
responsibility to see it continue as a satisfactory industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Miramichi the first minister of marine and 
fisheries in the original Government of Canada in 1867 was Peter 
Mitchell.  We have watched over the years what has happened with 
the fishery since the time of Peter Mitchell.  We have to be 
concerned with what our responsibilities are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member who brought forward this bill is concerned 
with his own area.  He is very much involved with the area of 
southern New Brunswick.  He needs to see that DFO and the fisher 
people work co-operatively to continue the fishery there.  But I 
think we have to be more concerned as members of this government 
and people, in general, about our responsibilities to the fishery 
so that it can continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chairman of the fisheries committee I would not support a 
bill for a particular charter of rights for one particular group. 
I would be more concerned with supporting the concept that we 
have responsibilities as a government to see that the fishery 
works well, that it works co-operatively and that it works in the 
best interests of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
when we speak to a bill such as Bill C-302, proposed by the 
member for New Brunswick Southwest, there are commonalties all 
across the country and on all coasts.  However I will be talking 
about this bill from a west coast perspective, as the member 
opposite said that we might have concerns in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill describes a bill of rights for fishermen.  This bill 
has multiple rationales and essentially would be a good 
counter-balance to the dominance of decision making on fisheries 
fronts by an overly centralized bureaucracy that we all know as 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  This bill is not 
responsive enough to local communities, to local fishermen or 
in fact to the recreational sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is clear in stating that people who fish for their 
livelihood should be involved in decisions regarding the 
protection, development and harvesting of fish.  This is good for 
two reasons.  First, the fishermen have important local knowledge 
of the kind we cannot afford to prove scientifically, but which 
has stood the test of time.  Second, if we do not involve the 
fishermen we do not get a buy-in with new policy directions and 
new management proposals.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a primary way to develop volunteerism which is so 
critical in the development of fish stocks, whether through fish 
hatcheries, the development of riparian zones or developing a 
conservation ethic in children's or citizen's watch on poaching. 
Any number of things contribute to the good citizen aspect of 
looking after our resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably the most controversial aspect of the bill deals with 
the right of compensation to those whose rights were taken away 
or abrogated by the federal government through unilateral or 
actions which exclude affected fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and DFO bureaucracy will fight this clause tooth 
and nail because it attempts to make them accountable for 
decisions they make about people affected by their decisions.  It 
is far easier for bureaucrats or ministers to sit ensconced, 
buffered and unchallenged and be securely protected from the 
results of their decisions.  These people do not have 
repercussions from their bad policy decisions.  Given a choice 
they would prefer not to deal with people affected by their 
decisions because plainly it is uncomfortable for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the crux of the bill, the strongest part of the bill. It 
is an attempt to bring accountability to the bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all this I have some concerns about the bill which I 
discussed with the member for Vancouver Island North who spoke to 
the bill in debate on June 4 this year. Here are our concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not establish a process to provide for fishermen's 
involvement or representation prior to the decision making 
process.  There is nothing to say that the fishermen's 
representations have to be heeded.  Nor does it give any 
meaningful decision making power to those affected.  There is a 
prohibition against any decisions being made until all the 
hearings are exhausted.  This could render the system too 
cumbersome when quick decisions are needed for conservation or 
other purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, clause 5(a) of the bill mentions fishing rights but 
this term is not defined.  Licence holders who are active and who 
continue to invest in vessels, gear and so on, should have a 
right to renewal of that licence year after year.  However this 
is not set out in the bill.  It would also be useful to see that 
the minister could not create new licences without consultation 
and support from all existing licence holders of all categories 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the definition of the public right to fish in clause 2 is 
not consistent with the general law that extends this right to 
the commercial sector.  This misdefining of the public right to 
fish could be taken as an abolition by parliament of the public 
right to fish in any area beyond the areas defined specifically 
in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the west coast the public right to fish, the common law right 
that dates back to the Magna Carta, is a public right of access 
that in the commercial and recreation sector is tempered by 
limited entry licences and other restrictions, but this public 
right is still the overriding check on the predominant powers of 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Removal of this public right would essentially give the minister 
the power to allocate fisheries quotas to anyone, any group, 
institution or person.  This is the crux of the debate over the 
ethnic based aboriginal fisheries strategy, a pilot sales program 
which the federal government implemented in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians oppose a separate commercial fishery based on 
race.  Ongoing polarization and division have been created by 
natives and non-natives on the issue every since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the public protest against this fishery included native 
commercial fishermen in the all Canadian commercial fishery who 
also opposed the separate fishery but are now fully prepared to 
go public with their concerns.  All legal challenges to this 
fishery have succeeded.  Yet the government and the minister 
persist in pursuing this policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal rights protest has gone on since 1992 which has 
detracted from focused management of the fisheries.  It has 
focused people's energies on divisive issues instead of allowing 
them to look at the big picture and conservation issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is that clauses 4 and 5 of the bill extend into 
areas covered by provincial legislation. 
These clauses are probably unconstitutional.  If something is 
validly authorized by provincial legislation it is beyond the 
reach of federal legislation.  Given the exclusive nature of the 
division of powers under our Constitution, I feel it should be 
left that way and these clauses should not be left in the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in the House to support Bill C-302. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who make their living from the sea have always been 
central to the culture, economy and social life of the maritimes 
and certainly of my riding of Halifax West.  For the many people 
who work to sustain themselves, their families and communities 
today, dating back to the very first aboriginal inhabitants of 
our region, fishing has been a way of life in the deepest sense 
of the word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For untold generations people have challenged themselves and the 
elements to sustain their livelihood and that of their families 
from the wealth of resources beneath the waves.  From their own 
successes and mistakes people have learned about fishing.  They 
have become knowledgeable about tides, seasonal variations, fish 
stocks, the winds, equipment, and all that is necessary to learn 
and develop the profession of fishing.  Fishers have been taught 
by their parents and by their communities as a whole.  They have 
also learned from other communities and increasingly from fishers 
in other countries.  There have been times when even government 
efforts and research have proven useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Halifax West who make or hope once again to make 
their living from the sea face a growing danger.  This danger has 
caused thousands of people to lose their livelihood and equal 
numbers of families to lose any security for their children's 
future.  This peril is responsible for the unbelievable event of 
entire fish stocks being wiped out.  This danger is the federal 
government's mishandling of fisheries issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the right of fishers to be involved in every aspect of 
decision making and the implementation of those decisions that 
affect their livelihood.  Who else has the knowledge to craft the 
best answers about fish stock assessments, fish conservation, the 
setting of fish quotas and fishing licences?  Certainly not the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans bureaucrats living in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It boggles the mind that the Liberal government has chosen not 
to involve those who make their day to day living in the fishing 
industry as part and parcel of the decisions that in turn will 
directly affect and often threaten their livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decisions made by the roughly 800 DFO bureaucrats in Ottawa 
are based on what knowledge?  Is it by studying and analysing the 
movement of fish in the Rideau River in Ottawa or by consulting 
the occasional ice fisher on the Ottawa River?  It is certainly 
not by working on a day to day basis with those in the industry, 
armed with the experience and skills to assist the government in 
making decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be sure that the government consults very closely with 
top executives of big banks about decisions that might affect 
their billions of dollars or with top multinational corporate 
executives about decisions the government might implement that 
would affect their operations.  However the government treats 
fishers as the uneducated and insignificant.  It is a crime.  The 
cost of that crime is a mismanaged government department making 
bad and often absurd decisions.  It hurts people who make their 
livelihood from fishing in St. Margaret's Bay and throughout my 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is the announcement early this year that fish 
quotas for Nova Scotia would be 5 fish per person or 25 fish per 
boat for non-commercial fishers.  We could hear the laughter of 
fishers in response to this in my riding all the way from Herring 
Cove to Black Point.  Just who would those supposedly enforcing 
this regulation charge if there were a number of people in a boat 
and too many fish?  Would it be the one in the boat closest to 
the shore or the tallest one?  Who?  This decision is absurd and 
unenforceable because the decision was made in Ottawa without the 
proper input of those who do the fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's mishandling of TAGS and the post-TAGS program 
has condemned thousands to poverty and helplessness.  There are 
over 40,000 fishers out of work.  The government has spent over 
$3.4 billion in income support.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately decisions made by Ottawa bureaucrats about the 
livelihood of those living over 1,000 kilometres away pits people 
against people and community against community.  Fishers should 
be consulted about the allocation of quotas as the bill 
recommends and about proper gear and equipment.  Fishers should 
be consulted about fish stocks.  We all know fishers were warning 
about the cod stocks long before the government in its too 
little, too late fashion slammed the door shut on an entire 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in my riding who make their living from the sea are 
not millionaires.  The people who fish or want to fish in Sambro, 
Ketch Harbour, Portuguese Cove and East and West Pennant cannot 
easily weather huge losses due to bad federal government 
decisions.  However they have to, time and time again, simply 
because people who fish are not considered by the Liberal 
government to be key players in decisions about the fishing 
industry.  With the fisheries dying the last budget of the 
government did nothing for those in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-302 which sets out to ensure fishers are central to 
decisions affecting the fisheries is nothing more than plain 
sense.  Everybody would win.  The bill should certainly be sent 
to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans for study, 
improvement and support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example of the government's fisheries minister hiding his 
head in the sand is the current serious dispute in the lobster 
fisheries in southwestern Nova Scotia.  This dispute involves 
commercial, aboriginal and non-aboriginal lobster fishers.  Did 
the government play a leadership role with the long term security 
of this fish stock and the livelihoods of these people at the 
forefront?  No.  Once again it has hidden its head in the sand 
and refused to sit down and talk with those in the industry about 
the best and most reasonable long term solution for all involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems everybody but the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and 
the Ottawa top bureaucrats is able to reach an agreement on the 
threat posed to this industry by the government's refusal to 
centrally involve fishers in every step of decision making and 
implementation.  The Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans 
was able to produce two reports unanimously agreed to by five 
different federal parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the government respond?  It was by yanking the member 
for Gander—Grand Falls out of the committee chair spot.  This 
committee did its best to base its efforts on what it has learned 
from people in the industry, and that is what may have upset the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It only makes sense for those who fish for their living and 
those in fisheries industries to participate in a meaningful way 
in federal government decision making.  I fully support the bill 
and challenge every government member to support it.  The people 
who make their living or hope to make their living from the 
fisheries in my riding of Halifax West deserve no less.  All 
those in similar positions across the country deserve no less.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate today in debate on Bill 
C-302, an act to establish the rights of fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to the hon. member who just 
concluded.   How can anyone stand in his or her place and be 
against involving fishers or fishermen in stock assessment, fish 
conservation, the setting of fish quotas and fishing licences? 
How can anyone be against that consultation and involvement 
process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well I listened with interest to the hon. member for 
Miramichi when he talked about a fish bill of rights.  I could 
not help but wonder, as the member made that suggestion, if he 
had consulted with the fish and what response he got back.  I 
wonder if the fish are positive to his view that there should be 
a fish bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that in a light manner because what we are talking about 
in Bill C-302 is involving those people directly in the 
harvesting of fish, in stock assessments, in licensing and in the 
setting of quotas and so on.  As my my hon. colleague who spoke 
before me said, for years in Atlantic Canada people involved in 
the fishing industry, the harvesters, warned the federal 
governments of the day that we were heading for a crisis in our 
groundfish stock, particularly our cod stocks.  Year after year 
the federal government ignored those people, and we all know the 
consequences now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of our rural communities are on the verge of 
extinction.  There is no employment in those communities because 
there is no fish to harvest and consequently no fish to process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague for bringing forward this fishers bill of 
rights.  It is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak for a moment about the public right to fish.  My 
hon. colleague who spoke just before me mentioned what we call 
the food fishery in Newfoundland and Labrador.  He talked about 
five fish a day and so many people in a boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland and Labrador for all of our lives we have been 
allowed to go out and catch a fish for supper.  That has all 
changed in the last four or five years.  We cannot get in our 
boats and go out and fish any more.  We have to wait for the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to inform us if he is going to 
allow us to catch a fish and then he sets the date.  Over the 
last couple of years he has given us one weekend to fish.  He 
basically has given us three days to fish for our food fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia, P.E.I, New Brunswick and parts of Quebec get a 
68-day food fishery.  We get three days.  It is something we were 
allowed to do all of our lives, and now we can only fish if the 
minister allows us to fish and for a maximum of three days.  That 
is very difficult for Newfoundlanders and Labradorians to accept. 
We are catching the same fish that the people in Nova Scotia, 
New Brunswick and Quebec are catching.  They are the same fish 
stocks.  They swim back and forth.  These are the fish that Nova 
Scotians catch, and we catch and so on. Somehow the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans and his parliamentary secretary, who I see 
shaking his head in disapproval, do not understand that fish 
swim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we not be allowed to fish for 68 days for a food 
fishery.  If the parliamentary secretary can fish for 68 days in 
Prince Edward Island, why can we not do it?  It is the same fish. 
What he is allowing people in Nova Scotia to fish for 68 days is 
the same fish stock we can fish for three days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If only some of them over there knew a little bit about fish, 
what a relief it would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They swim around the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Yes, they swim around the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other troublesome point is that fishermen for years warned 
the federal government of the impending disaster. On the west 
coast of Canada, British Columbia, fish harvesters are warning 
the federal government of the same problems.  The government is 
ignoring what is happening in British Columbia and the problems 
are increasing and getting bigger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the bill to include fish harvesters in conservation, 
in licensing and in fish stock assessments.  How can anyone argue 
against it?  How can anyone be against those who are directly 
involved in the harvesting of fish resources having more 
involvement?  Have the Department of Fisheries and Oceans listen 
to them and take into account what they are telling it, then 
weigh that in the decision making process so that wiser decisions 
are made in the future than have been made in the past.  God 
knows if there is one federal government department that has made 
unwise decisions over the years, it has been the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the bill.  I commend my colleague for bringing it 
forward. I commend those who have stood in their place today to 
support this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we involve those people in a more meaningful fashion, it will 
mean that we will make better decisions.  We will have greater 
fish resources for the future.  We will not go through the crisis 
in Atlantic Canada and the west coast of Canada that we are going 
through today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are unemployed.  Out-migration is staggering. The survival 
of rural Canada is seriously threatened today. When I go through 
my riding of Burin—St. George's it is difficult to find anyone 
left in those communities who is under 45 years of age.  What 
future is there for people?  This has been forced upon people 
because there is no employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada mismanaged our fish resources.  It has 
to take responsibility.  All we are asking is that the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans and the federal government involve the 
people who harvest those fish resources.  Include their 
assessments in decision making and make wiser decisions for the 
fish resources so that people who depend on those resources will 
be better off in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou  Sekora (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the bill before the House is 
impractical and unnecessary and as such should not become law. It 
is unnecessary for many reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons is that the participatory role it seeks for 
fishermen is already becoming a standard practice.  Procedures 
and processes for ongoing consultations with stakeholders are in 
place as a matter of policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, fishermen are already involved in stock assessment 
and conservation issues on the east coast through their 
participation in the fisheries resources conservation council. 
Last month the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced the 
formation of a similar council on the west coast, the Pacific 
resource conservation council chaired by Hon. John Fraser. In 
addition co-management arrangements are in place in a number of 
fisheries that give fishermen an expanded role in the decision 
making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is also impractical because it would tie the minister's 
hands and prevent him or her from making decisions to protect the 
fisheries at a time when this protection is urgently required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the bill would require that fishermen be 
represented on or be heard by a body involved in the process 
intended to produce a division or recommendation respecting 
fisheries stock assessment, fish conservation, the setting of 
fishing quotas, fishing licensing or the public right to fish or, 
in the case of an order to be made by the governor in council, to 
have the opportunity to comment on every proposed order before it 
is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member must know that the minister issues many such 
orders in response to changing conditions in the fisheries. 
Sometimes these orders must be made on an emergency basis.  This 
clause would institute a cumbersome and time consuming review 
process that would delay the implementation of any decisions 
until all appeals had been exhausted.  It would bring fisheries 
management in Canada to a standstill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is impractical for another reason, its potential cost 
to the taxpayers.  The bill would require that every fisher who 
suffers a loss as a result of the abrogation of fishing rights 
other than as a result of a process that would involve fishermen 
shall be entitled to compensation for a loss.  This could create 
a huge financial obligation for the government.  Where does the 
hon. member think this money would come from? It is fine to be 
free with the taxpayers' money but we have spent five years 
sacrificing to bring the country's deficit under control.  Now is 
not the time to be incurring substantial obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the double bind that this would create for the minister 
and his officials.  Suppose they were faced with making a 
decision to protect a specific stock but to do so would mean 
paying a huge sum of compensation. Is the intent of this bill to 
discourage the minister from taking needed measures to protect 
the fisheries, or is the intent to load the taxpayers up with new 
financial burdens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not precise in its wording and focus, touching on 
many legal issues, including some that are outside federal 
jurisdiction and would be impossible to implement in any 
effective manner.  The wording is so vague as to be open to 
multiple interpretations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take our pick of phrases but let us take this one:  the 
consideration of the effect of fishing on traditional lifestyles 
including but not restricted to aboriginal traditional 
lifestyles.  What exactly does this mean?  Leaving aside the 
ambiguity of “the effect that fishing on traditional 
lifestyles”, how much consideration would the bill require? 
Whose traditional lifestyle?  How do we distinguish traditional 
lifestyle versus a non-traditional one?  The bill does not say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is both unnecessary and unworkable.  Worse still, it 
misses entirely what should be the focus of our attention: 
protecting the ocean and its resources.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just Canada that has seen the consequences of 
overfishing.  Other nations from New Zealand to Norway have all 
seen fish stocks damaged by overfishing.  We all now recognize 
that the survival of some of these stocks hangs by a thread and 
that if we do not take action now, it may be too late. That is 
why the focus of government policy must be and is on conserving 
and protecting the fish stocks.  This bill would do nothing to 
advance those goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need are effective conservation based management 
policies, policies that balance the competing demands we make on 
the oceans with their ability to sustain their demands.  This 
government is putting those policies in place.  It continues to 
work through the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, NAFO, 
to implement mechanisms to stop overfishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month we saw the formal adoption of 100% observation 
coverage for all fish vessels in the NAFO regulatory area.  The 
decision meets one of the most important conservation objectives 
advanced by Canada at the NAFO annual meeting held in Lisbon in 
September.  NAFO has acknowledged the success of the pilot 
program for 100% observation coverage and has noted that the 
apparent infringements of its rules have declined by over 80% 
since the pilot program was implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations fisheries agreement, the result of a Canadian 
initiative, provides the means to strengthen international 
arrangements such as NAFO.  Parties to this agreement will help 
to create a new enforcement system for the high seas. This system 
will provide for the protection of straddling and migratory fish 
stocks on the high seas.  It will provide a binding and 
compulsory settlement for fishing disputes among states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is in the process of developing an oceans strategy that 
will set the course for management of our ocean resources into 
the next century.  This strategy has three principles: 
sustainable development; integrating the management of human 
activity in estuaries, coastal and marine waters; and the 
precautionary approach, a commitment to err on the side of 
caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy is based on the premise that everyone with a stake 
in the future health of the oceans must work together to preserve 
and protect them.  This is the thrust of the government policy 
with regard to the oceans and their resources, and it is both 
appropriate and effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than focusing on creating rights for any particular 
group, we must concentrate on protecting the oceans and the 
conservation of their resources for all Canadians because without 
them, there will be no fishermen and fishing communities, 
traditional or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to reject this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the fundamental protection for fishermen against 
arbitrary action by the government is found in the public right 
to fish.  The fishers bill of rights introduced by my colleague 
from Charlotte recognizes the importance to fishermen of this 
right. It is for this reason I stand today to offer my support 
for this bill of rights for fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ancient public right, a right for all citizens, until 
recently was so ingrained in our law making that it was not often 
spoken of.  As of late it has become fashionable for ministers of 
fisheries to trumpet the importance of the creation of exclusive 
or private fisheries.  Sometimes well meaning but weak ministers 
have been tempted by the idea that they could buy peace on the 
water and end lawlessness through the creation of private 
fisheries. This happened in British Columbia in 1992 with the 
creation of the exclusive native commercial salmon fishery on the 
Fraser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another insidious trend is just as great a threat to the fishery 
as the attempt to buy peace through the creation of private 
fisheries.  That is the turning of a fishery over to a large 
corporation, to the rich and the powerful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the rush to create these private fisheries, our policy makers 
have forgotten our history and our fisheries law in regard to the 
public right to fish.  The legal principles underpinning the 
public right were not arrived at overnight or in some great 
economic think tank.  The public right is not the preserve of the 
right of economists on the right or the left. 
The public right knows neither left nor right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has stood the test of time.  When we tinker with the public 
fishery we can do great harm unless we have understood what the 
public right is and its proven utility over hundreds of years, 
that it has given all citizens access to the public fishery, rich 
or poor, large or small, native or non-native.  That equality of 
access deserves careful tending in a fast changing world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many of our legal and political conventions the public 
right developed in English law, but from the earliest days of 
settlement found root in Canada.  The public right to fish has 
been a recognized feature of our law since the reception of English 
law into what is now Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It became codified in 1215 when it was set down in provision 47 
of the Magna Carta.  It was designed to address a public 
grievance caused by the practice of the king in those times to 
clear the public off the fishing grounds whenever he wished to go 
fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1215 it has been accepted in English law that the king 
does not own the fisheries in tidal waters.  They are public. 
The king has no power to transfer such public fisheries to an 
exclusive group.  All members of the public are equally entitled 
to access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the public right to fish has an ancient basis, it is 
sometimes asked by those not familiar with fisheries or marine 
law if it still has any basis in law in Canada. The courts and 
the law officers of the crown have from the earliest days in 
Canada recognized the public right to fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Supreme Court of Canada in deciding Van der Peet, 
Gladstone and NTC Smokehouse, fisheries cases from British 
Columbia, relied on the legal principle often referred to as the 
public right to fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ancient right has stood the test of time and is very much 
alive today.  It guarantees the public right of access in public 
waters. Fish in navigable or tidal waters are not owned by the 
crown. Rather, the crown is the guardian or trustee for the 
public in this right of access to a fishery in public waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court's 1996 decision in Gladstone relied on the 
position our courts and law officers have been taking for the 
past 150 years.  The court in Gladstone relied on and restated 
the decision in the 1913 British Columbia fisheries reference: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the time of the Magna Carta, there has been a common law 
right to fish in tidal waters that only can be abrogated by the

officers of the crown and the courts has been to remind ministers 
that their job is to protect the public right.  They are its 
trustee, its guarantor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this bill of rights for fishermen because it acts to 
remind the minister of his responsibility as trustee of the 
public right to fish in public waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to the attention of the House another area of arbitrary 
action by the minister of fisheries where fishermen are in need 
of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer at a time when American Fisheries Society scientists 
had named at least 214 coho stocks in B.C. at a high risk of 
extinction, the department's chief spokesman on fisheries 
management told fishermen that of the 900 individual coho stocks 
in B.C., only two were threatened with extinction and that 
efforts would be made to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 19 the minister stated: “In order to meet my coho 
conservation objectives announced on May 21, all areas on the 
coast will be defined as either red zones where there is an 
objective of zero fishing mortality or yellow zones where fishing 
will be allowed if and when the risk of coho bycatch mortality is 
minimal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it came to putting in practice the notion of protecting 
fish, the minister was nowhere to be seen.  In fact, he allowed 
fishing in a red zone area around the Queen Charlotte Islands, an 
area where coho stocks were at high risk of extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John Disney, a respected fishermen from Masset in the Queen 
Charlotte Islands, tells me that in the last cycle year 
commercial gill net fishermen in that area killed only 1,038 coho 
as bycatch for the whole season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister allowed sports fishermen, in particular his friend, 
the owner of the Oak Bay Marine Group, to conduct a sport fishery 
in that area which Mr. Disney estimates was killing 900 coho per 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fishers bill of rights as proposed by my friend from Charlotte 
would have prevented this arbitrary transfer of allocation 
designed to profit a rich friend of the minister and would have 
offered protection to the resource. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to address private member's Bill C-302 by 
the member for Charlotte. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians and all members of this House want to see a 
healthy fishery into the coming century, one that provides a good 
living to independent professional owner-operators and employees, 
one that supports flourishing fishing communities along the 
nation's coastlines that is sustainable and supports a flexible, 
versatile and self-reliant industry largely self-regulating and 
operating without subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may argue how to achieve it but few would disagree with this 
goal.  How to best realize this goal is where we differ. Is it by 
adopting the legislation before the House or by instituting a 
so-called fishers bill of rights?  I do not believe so.  This is 
not the way to achieve this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passing this bill could actually be counterproductive, harming 
not only the resource but also the very communities the bill is 
intended to help.  Let me explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us first take a look at what the honourable member wants to 
achieve.  In presenting the bill, he said it is an act to 
establish the rights of fishermen, including the right to be 
involved in the process of fisheries stock assessment, fish 
conservation, setting of fishing quotas, fishing licensing and 
the public right to fish and establish the right of fishermen to 
be informed of decisions affecting fishing as a livelihood in 
advance and the right to compensation if other rights are 
abrogated unfairly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member must know that fishermen already participate in 
most if not all these activities and that in practice they are 
actively involved in stock assessment, fish conservation and 
monitoring.  Fishermen participate through consultation along 
with other stakeholders in the development of integrated fishery 
management plans and the setting of fishery quotas.  Many 
fishermen are already involved directly in managing fisheries 
through the co-management approach or joint project agreements 
with DFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO developed the co-management approach as a way to give the 
people who work in the fishery more say in how it is managed. An 
example of the co-management approach in the maritimes is the 
Cape Breton snow crab fishery where fishermen have entered into a 
multiyear joint project agreement with DFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other examples of co-management include shrimp on the Scotian 
shelf and exploratory fisheries in skate, monkfish, rock crab and 
red crab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-management works well as a voluntary approach that increases 
the participation of fishermen in decision making.  The 
government is planning to introduce a new fishers act that would 
allow individuals and communities more say over decisions 
affecting their lives and the capacity to do longer term 
planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishermen and others in the industry have said repeatedly that 
they want government out of the daily operations of the 
fisheries.  The government has listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House today is unnecessary.  There are other 
reasons for rejecting this bill, among which is it would be 
impossible to put into practice.  Let me give an example of why 
this approach is impractical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires that decisions not be implemented until all 
appeals have been exhausted and reasonable notice has been given 
to the fishermen involved.  In 1995 the west coast groundfish 
trawl fishery exceeded its TACs for many species so the minister 
of fisheries ordered the fishery closed early in the season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did this not to deprive fishermen of their rights 
but to exercise his responsibility to protect the fishery.  How 
would that situation have been handled under this bill?  Would 
overfishing have continued while consultations dragged on and on 
until everyone was satisfied that perhaps the fishery should be 
closed?  What condition would the stocks have been in by then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes we need a person in charge with the authority to act. 
Those with a stake in the fishery should be consulted and they 
are.  But to tie the minister's hands so that essential decisions 
cannot be made when they must be made would be folly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of fisheries is the member of cabinet responsible 
for fisheries.  It is up to him or her to set policy to decide 
when to fish, where to fish and what to fish.  If the policy does 
not work the minister can decide to change it, usually after 
consulting with those affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But to mandate a legislated requirement to consult while the 
health of the stocks hangs in the balance fetters the minister's 
ability to act quickly in the interest of conserving the 
resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the intention behind this bill is not to frustrate 
conservation efforts,  not now when some fish stocks require 
extremely careful management and not when we have already made 
progress in adopting responsible and co-operative management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The west coast groundfish trawl fishery now operates under an 
innovative management regime.  This regime includes individual 
quotas that establish individual accountability for the harvest 
limits.  Community representatives actively contribute to the 
management of the fishery through the groundfish development 
authority which was established jointly by the federal and 
provincial governments in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Change is happening and not just in the case of groundfish. 
Management of the west coast herring fishery is also changing in 
response to recommendations from the industry.  Many shell fish 
fisheries are managed under co-operative agreements with 
fishermen who are contributing to innovative monitoring and 
observer programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the west coast salmon fishery has also undergone 
major changes.  Last June the government announced a major 
restructuring of the Pacific salmon fishery.  It was a momentous 
decision and was taken only after extensive study and 
consultation with fishermen and others in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This consultation is continuing.  After the government announced 
conservation measures last May to protect and restore coho salmon 
stocks, 23 community meetings took place throughout that 
province.  More than 1,450 British Columbians attended these 
meetings and their ideas were taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the June 19 announcement of $400 million in federal 
funding the government held extensive discussions with fishermen 
and other stakeholders on program design.  They discussed licence 
retirement, incentives for new selective harvesting techniques, 
options for diversifying fishing income and opportunities and the 
impact of changes on coastal communities. It is interesting to 
note that many stakeholders requested more activity and less 
consultation. The government has continued to consult with 
fishermen on how the licence retirement program should be set up 
and run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that fisheries management in this country is 
undergoing a transformation.  It is this transformation that has 
been long sought by fishermen.  We can see that fishermen and 
others with a stake in the fishery have a greater role today in 
managing the fishery than ever before, and that role is growing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, it is essential that the minister retain the 
ultimate responsibility for conserving and managing the resource 
for the benefit of all Canadians.  After all, it is important to 
remember that Canada's fish resources are managed for the benefit 
of all Canadians.  Fishermen receive from the minister the 
privilege of exploiting these resources and we must remember that 
conservation is the government's first priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are no fish there can be no fishers.  If we are to 
ensure that the fishery is there for our children and for their 
children we must conserve the resource.  The bill before the 
House does nothing for conservation.  As for giving fishermen 
more say in the management of the fishery, that process is 
already well established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well for us to talk about rights, but with those rights, 
particularly in the area of fishing, as in all other rights, as 
citizens of this country we bear a responsibility to the 
resource, in particular as we look at conserving that resource 
for generations to come.  It is my hope, as we anticipate further 
discussion on this bill and as we anticipate the vote, that we 
will consider the impact of those rights and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a drafting perspective this bill is vague.  It touches on 
many legal issues, including some that are outside federal 
jurisdiction.  That is very clear.  Given its vagueness this 
legislation would be impossible, in all likelihood, to implement 
in any effective manner.  It is for these reasons and others 
which I have not mentioned this morning that I urge my colleagues 
in the House to reject Bill C-302 when it finally comes to a 
vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam  Speaker, 
I know we only have about two minutes left in today's debate, but 
I want to make a few preliminary comments before concluding my 
comments at a future date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to commend the member for New Brunswick Southwest 
for bringing in an excellent bill which would protect the rights 
of people who are involved in the traditional fishery all across 
Canada.  In the 500 year history of the fishery in Newfoundland, 
never has there been as great a need to have the rights of 
fishermen protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the member wanted to do when he talked about the rights of 
fishermen was to make sure that fishers have access to and are 
involved in the process of fisheries stock assessment, fish 
conservation, the setting of fishing quotas, fishing licences and 
the public right to fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If fishers are not allowed to be involved in that process then 
there is something very seriously wrong.  Never has the need been 
as great as it is this day.  We saw what happened in this House 
in the last month or so.  The Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans, which had probably the best chairman that committee ever 
had, the Liberal member for Gander—Grand Falls, along with eight 
other Liberals on the committee, made a series of recommendations 
which were agreed to and passed by the committee.  However, when 
those changes came before the House of Commons, none of them were 
allowed to vote in favour of their own recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will say today that we do not need someone to 
protect the rights of fishers.  Perhaps what I should do is bring 
in another bill to protect Liberals on standing committees. That 
bill would include a special provision to allow them to make all 
kinds of very serious recommendations and then allow them to come 
to the House of Commons and vote against their own 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second provision of the bill might be to replace the nine 
members on the standing committee with nine codfish who would say 
more about what is wrong with the fishery than certainly the 
Liberal members on the standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must now interrupt 
the hon. member.  He will have approximately seven minutes left 
when the bill is brought back before the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I thank you for letting me address the 
motion I am tabling today. I will share my time with the hon. 
member for Burin—St. George's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the motion before us today is to invite the 
government to correct in a permanent fashion the flaws in the 
Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that some parliamentarians know very little about the 
employment insurance small weeks adjustment projects. Yet, it is 
an initiative that applies to 29 regions of Canada where the 
unemployment rate exceeds 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, regions of Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and the four 
Atlantic provinces have participated in adjustment projects. It 
is an issue that affects tens of thousands of Canadians, and 
this is why it is important to discuss it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a moment to look at the context that made it 
necessary to resort to small weeks employment projects. In 1996, 
the federal government adopted Bill C-12, which included a major 
reform of the employment insurance program. The changes made 
included using eligibility criteria that were no longer based on 
the work week, but on the hours of work, and calculating 
benefits by taking into account every week of employment in the 
previous 26 weeks, including the weeks with few hours of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This last point was a problematical one, because including the 
income from these small weeks in the calculation can 
significantly lower benefits, and this discourages workers from 
accepting short work weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toward the end of January 1997, or a few weeks after total 
implementation of the new provisions in the act, three Liberal 
MPs were mandated to propose solutions to the short weeks 
problem to the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Following up on their recommendations, the minister announced 
his small weeks adjustment projects on March 5, 1997   What is 
rather unfortunate about all this is that the government had 
been aware of this problem for close to a year already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-12 was being debated, in fact, Conservative Senator 
Orville Phillips proposed an amendment intended to remove weeks 
of less than 15 hours from the calculation of benefits. 
Otherwise, the senator felt, EI recipients were at risk of 
drawing reduced benefits if they had worked only a few hours in 
a given week.  Unfortunately, that amendment was given the 
heave-ho by the Liberal majority in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same problem was also recognized and brought to the 
government's attention by a number of other stakeholders.  For 
instance, Mathilda Blanchard, a well-known union figure in New 
Brunswick, was quoted on November 4, 1996 in <I>L'Acadie Nouvelle</I> 
as saying “I really cannot see why this matter does not seem to 
get picked up in this region.  The 26-week factor will do a great 
deal of harm in a region like ours, which is characterized by 
seasonal work.  Plenty of people will end up having to get 
through the winter with nothing but a cheque for $60 or so a 
week coming in. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying earlier, despite warnings about this weakness in 
the EI act, the government took almost a year to offer some form 
of correction to the inequity. 
In fact, the Liberal response seemed to anger some business 
representatives who feared election politics were behind the 
small weeks adjustment projects since the announcement was made 
only a few months before the federal election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion the government has the opportunity to prove 
that the small weeks adjustment projects were not a mere 
electoral ploy, but an attempt in good faith to help workers 
accept as many hours of work as they possibly can.  In my view, 
and in the view of my caucus colleagues, the small weeks 
adjustment projects have been very useful and successful.  The 
preliminary aim of the adjustment projects was to ensure that 
every hour of work counts toward eligibility for the benefits and 
encourages people to take all available work without fear of 
having their benefits reduced by working small weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government adopted two approaches to the adjustment 
projects to evaluate and compare results.  As I said earlier, 29 
economic regions across Canada where the unemployment rate is 
consistently above 10% are participating in the program. Eighteen 
regions in Quebec and the eastern provinces are part of the 
bundling project.  Bundling small weeks means to bundle the 
earnings in small weeks to meet the average earnings of the big 
weeks plus any small week needed to meet the minimum divisor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eleven regions in Ontario and the western provinces are 
participating in the excluding project.  Excluding small weeks 
means that all small weeks not required to meet the minimum 
divisor will be ignored for the purpose of calculating benefit 
levels.  They still count toward eligibility and duration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These adjustment projects are slated to end on November 15, 
1998, a mere three weeks away.  We do not know the fate of this 
valuable program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most importantly, Canadian workers in the toughest employment 
areas of the country are still kept guessing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program has cost the government roughly $130 million a 
year, a mere drop in the bucket when we consider the $7 billion 
yearly surplus in the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Progressive Conservative Party have 
constantly argued since 1996 that the EI surplus belongs to 
Canadian workers and employers.  It does not belong to the 
Liberal cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have argued for cuts in EI premiums.  In fact the chief 
actuary has concluded that the EI program could be sustained at a 
premium of $1.90.  Therefore, continuing the small weeks 
adjustment projects would in no way preclude a substantial 
decrease in EI premiums as well.  All in all, continuing the 
small weeks adjustment projects would be a positive step toward 
eliminating disincentives to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back when the projects were announced in 1997, many Liberal 
members stood in this House to praise the value of these 
projects.  The member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges had this to say: 
“The adjustments announced yesterday to the Employment Insurance 
Act confirm that our primary concern is to encourage people who 
are out of work to return to the workforce”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diane Brushett, the former member for Cumberland—Colchester, 
said the following:  “This will ensure that workers in every 
region of the country are able to take full advantage of all 
available work without having their benefits lowered”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general issued this warning:  “In recent days we 
have heard a great deal about the small weeks anomaly in the 
employment insurance program.  Make no mistake, it is a serious 
problem that must be fixed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Hillsborough was of this opinion:  “The solution 
will work.  Small weeks are counted for eligibility but are 
bundled for calculating benefits.  This change gives claimants 
the best of both worlds.  I doubt there are many who would argue 
that reforms were not needed”.

the federal government wants them back at work and that all work, 
whether it is five hours a week or forty hours a week, should be 
equally considered.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to put a question to the 
member for Madawaska—Restigouche.  First of all, I can tell him 
that the Bloc Quebecois is 100% in favour of the Conservative 
Party motion.  The riding of Madawaska—Restigouche is next door 
to mine and I know very well that the member's constituents are 
experiencing the same problems as mine with respect to this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI benefits have been substantially reduced throughout the 
eastern Quebec and maritime regions. 
As soon as it introduced its reform, the present Liberal 
government realized that there was a terrible problem and that a 
pilot project was needed to correct a situation which was 
leaving people with completely unacceptable benefits, lower even 
than welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, as we know, this government introduced a pilot 
project that will come to an end in three weeks.  But it is not 
on November 15 that people will start suffering.  They have 
already been suffering for two weeks, three weeks, one month, 
two months, five months.  All those who worked this summer still 
do not know whether they will be receiving reasonable benefits 
on November 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could this not be pointed out to the minister?  I am looking for 
arguments that would convince him. 
I would like to hear what the member for Madawaska—Restigouche 
thinks could be done.  His motion is a timely one, particularly 
as it also proposes making the projects a permanent feature of 
the legislation so that people from our regions no longer have 
to beg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason why people should be forced to beg for every 
little morsel of the EI fund.  Could the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche provide the whole picture so that the 
government majority will finally understand and so that members, 
particularly Liberal members from the maritimes, will support us 
on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there are only three weeks left before the end of this 
project.  The government also knew, two years before, that there 
were problems with the employment insurance reform.  At my first 
meeting of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, I requested a 
thorough study of the employment insurance reform.  This reform 
affected a number of regions in Canada, and the poorest 
Canadians were affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we have to equip our young people with the tools they 
need to compete on the global market. Obviously, we are 
referring to education.  Families are not even capable of paying 
for their children's education, which is essential today, 
because of the lack of employment and the lack of income.  Today 
we see that only three weeks are left before the end of this 
project.  The government should perhaps have announced its 
intention two months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance reform was a mistake from the outset. 
The government made these changes only a few weeks before the 
election.  So, if there were problems three weeks before the 
federal election, I am sure there are still problems today. 
Canadians from coast to coast are waiting to see what the 
Minister of Human Resources Development recommends.

hoping for comments and a response from the Minister of Human

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin—St. George's, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I commend my colleague from Madawaska—Restigouche for 
putting the motion forward today for debate in the House.  It is 
a matter that is of great concern to many of us who represent 
areas of high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was great public debate throughout the country when the 
government reformed the EI regulations.  There are still many 
people who do not fully understand the impact of the changes to 
the EI Act and the EI regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten days ago I met with five union leaders from my riding who 
were very concerned about changes to the EI regulations and about 
the employment insurance small weeks adjustment program.  I am 
very pleased to see that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is listening.  I look forward to the minister's 
involvement in the debate later today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us in the House of Commons cannot identify with what 
$40, $50 or $80 a week means to many low income families. It 
means that they are able to send their children to school fed, to 
buy some books and clothing, and to heat their homes.  To some of 
us this amount of money does not seem like a lot, but to many 
people in high unemployment areas it is bread and butter on the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adjustment programs and projects have been very positive.  We 
should go out and about in our ridings to talk to people who 
through no fault of their own cannot get full time work, get 
called in for 20 or 25 hours a week and in many cases get paid 
the minimum wage.  If it was not for the adjustment programs 
their EI rates would be severely cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go on record as saying that adjustment programs have been very 
positive.  I have written the minister and discussed the issue 
with him as late as Friday.  Because we are running out of time 
quickly I am hoping the minister will bring in his evaluation of 
the two adjustment programs and make a decision that is positive 
for the thousands and thousands of workers throughout Canada who 
are relying or counting on the minister to make the right 
decision, to continue with the adjustment projects and to make 
them permanent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not have to come back here in 18 or 24 months and face 
another deadline because another temporary measure will be 
running out.  As a result of adjustment programs and the 
minister's evaluation we need some permanency in those programs. 
Workers should not have to go another 12, 18 or 24 months and be 
faced with the same deadline, not knowing if the bundling of 
small weeks or the elimination of small weeks, whichever the 
minister chooses, will be upon them again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the minister to move quickly, to make a positive 
decision and to make the decision permanent.  It is very 
important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know Atlantic Canada best.  Ridings such as Burin—St. 
George's have been devastated because of a downturn in the 
groundfish industry as a result of the collapse of cod stocks. 
People who have worked 12 months of the year for most of their 
lives are striving today to get enough weeks of work to qualify 
for EI.  It has an effect on me, having grown up and worked with 
those people, to see what they are going through today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then people in corner stores and retail outlets are clawed back 
and get only 15 or 20 hours a week because the primary industry. 
the fishery, is pretty much gone.  They rely very heavily on an 
adjustment program.  If they happen to get 12 full weeks of work 
and make $250 the employer can only pull them into work for six 
or seven weeks more and they make less than $150 a week. It is 
very important that the weekly earnings average not be decreased, 
and that is what those projects do.  They are very positive for 
those people.  They keep their weekly earnings average up and 
consequently keep their EI benefits rate up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my meeting with union people about 10 days ago there were 
people sitting around the table who worked in fish plants and in 
stores.  They know the impact of this program.  They told me that 
without adjustment projects, without the bundling of small weeks, 
their EI benefits would be so significantly reduced they would 
not be able to maintain their households.  That is what it means. 
That is the implication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague introduced his motion very well.  He explained the 
criteria of the projects very well.  I go on record as supporting 
the motion.  I appeal to the minister.  In a discussion with him 
on Friday he told me that he was working hard on this program.  I 
respect and appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have about three weeks left.  I hope we will get the 
minister's evaluation very soon.  I hope we will get a positive 
decision very soon so that the thousands of people out and about 
the country will take some comfort in knowing there will be some 
stability and permanency in the minister's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the bundling of small weeks or the elimination of 
small weeks as in Ontario and out west, both adjustment programs 
have been very positive.  It comes down to which one the minister 
chooses.  Will he choose the bundling of small weeks or will he 
choose the elimination of small weeks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister will participate in the debate later and we 
will get some sense of where he is coming from.  I am looking 
forward to the participation of members on all sides of the House 
in the debate.  Most of us represent people who are benefiting 
from adjustment programs.  We all have some people in our ridings 
that have benefited from this adjustment program.  I look forward 
to their speaking in support of the motion as I do.  I move:

</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked very much in general terms.  To make a proper decision 
the government needs to deal with specifics in terms of how the 
pilot projects are working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little surprised that both speakers on this amendment 
never in their initial remarks would congratulate the government 
for having seen in the beginning there was a problem with short 
weeks and for having fixed that problem and for having coming up 
with some adjustment projects to look after it.  They should 
stand and say thank you to the government on this side of the 
House for having made that great move in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for Burin—St. 
George's give us some specific examples of how people in his 
riding are benefiting by these adjustment measures?  So that we 
can get down to some concrete action, could he tell us which of 
the pilot programs he favours?  Is it the bundling or is it the 
excluding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for some reason the 
parliamentary secretary wants to burn me. He wants to call it 
Burn—St. George's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a serious note I did say that it was a positive initiative. 
They have been positive adjustment programs.  We only hope the 
government in its wisdom continues with one form or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say to the parliamentary secretary, it basically means 
that if someone has 14 weeks of $300 earnings and six weeks or 
seven weeks of less than $150 earnings, then the bundling of 
small weeks which applies in Atlantic Canada keeps the average 
weekly earnings up.  Consequently the EI rate keeps up and they 
get a higher benefit.  Without the bundling of weeks adjustment 
program, the average weekly income would drop. Consequently they 
would get lower EI.  That is the positive. Those are the 
specifics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the parliamentary secretary that in Burin—St. 
George's thousands and thousands of people have found the 
bundling of small weeks to be very positive.  It is beneficial to 
them and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current surplus in the EI fund is there in part because the 
government reduced the EI benefits across the board.  The 
government cannot use the argument that the money is not there to 
continue with the adjustment programs.  There is a surplus in the 
EI account.  It is a surplus that has been contributed to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Sackville—Eastern Shore. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I put on the desk of the member for Burin—St. George's 
a copy of an EI statement that I received from someone on a 
recent visit to Canso, Nova Scotia.  It is quite simple.  The EI 
benefit for a person who is single with minimum weeks and without 
this program in place is $25 a week.  If they are lucky and are 
married with children, they get $31 a week.   These are actual 
statements from people whom I recently met in Canso. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment.  If the bundling which I 
agree with on a personal note is not allowed to help those people 
that find it difficult to get permanent work with full time 
benefits and good salaries, in areas of the country such as where 
I come from in Atlantic Canada, what should they do?  What should 
those people who make $25, or $31 for those who are married with 
children, on EI do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comment and question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious what people in those situations must do. With 
weekly incomes of these amounts, they cannot send their children 
to school fed.  If they cannot find a job and the EI rates are 
$25 or $31 a week, then it is a sad reflection and a sad thing to 
have to say there is only one recourse.  That is for them to go 
down to see the welfare officer at the social assistance office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my opening remarks, for some of us who are 
fortunate, and that is almost all of us that sit in this chamber, 
we cannot identify with what $40, $50, $70 or $80 more a week 
really means to the people this provision helps. There is only 
once recourse for those people, which is to go and see the 
welfare officer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to 
speak on the motion presented this morning by the hon. member 
for Madawaska-Restigouche on employment insurance and small weeks 
adjustment projects. About 18 months ago, in my capacity as the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, I had the pleasure of 
moving these projects, which have helped resolve a problem we 
had identified according to the government's wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the member recognizes the value of some 
of the important changes we had to make to the employment 
insurance system. As the member already knows, the old 
unemployment insurance system was 25 years old. 
It simply no longer met the needs of today's new workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old system did nothing for those who worked part time, and 
there are many such people. The old system did not recognize the 
long hours put in by seasonal workers and did nothing to help 
people get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we took on the difficult task of modernizing the 
employment insurance system in this country. We have put in 
place a completely new system—it was the first major 
structural reform in 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective was to find a balance between giving workers the 
temporary income support they need when they lose their job and 
giving them the tools they need to get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, the new EI program is having some success. 
Over 31,000 new jobs have been created in areas of high 
unemployment through the transitional jobs fund program. 
Canadians are benefiting from the $2 billion we invested in 
active employment measures and most of those who lost their job 
or quit with a good reason are getting income support. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the size of this reform, we also put in place a 
monitoring system to help us assess the impact of the reforms and 
address any potential issues that could arise. Soon after the 
reform took effect, we identified the small weeks problem. One of 
the major objectives of the reform was to make every hour of work 
count toward eligibility for employment insurance benefits and to 
encourage people to take all available work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It soon became evident that there was an anomaly in the system 
that was causing a disincentive for some workers to accept small 
weeks of work as it lowered their benefit levels.  We therefore 
announced a series of adjustment projects targeting 29 high 
unemployment regions across Canada.  The small weeks adjustment 
projects were put in place to address the disincentive identified 
by employers and workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We decided to test two types of adjustment projects.  One type 
included the bundling of small weeks in Atlantic Canada and 
Quebec. The other excluded the small weeks in other provinces and 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An assessment of the two types of small weeks projects is 
currently under way.  The collection of data is now being 
completed.  The findings will permit the government to determine 
the degree to which a disincentive to accept small weeks of work 
exists.  A decision on what action may be required over the long 
run will be made this fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the time being my department continues to process claims as 
if the program were to be continued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the fact that we do not have all the information 
required, I am afraid that we cannot support the member's motion, 
but we do recognize his good intentions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member knows, we are also continuing to monitor the 
impact of the whole reform on individuals and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new EI legislation, we are committed to tabling an EI 
monitoring and assessment report before Parliament every year 
for five years. We take this commitment very seriously.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it is important to fully understand the impact of the 
reform and we want to ensure that the program meets the needs of 
all Canadians. The second EI monitoring and assessment report 
should be released next spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the EI program inevitably leads me to want to 
discuss the beneficiaries to unemployed or BU ratio report my 
department released last week. The opposition, and the 
spokesperson for the branch office of the PQ in this parliament 
in particular, have tried to confuse and frighten workers with 
their brilliant interpretation of the information contained in 
this report. 
The beneficiaries to unemployed ratio report is full of concrete 
figures and statistics on unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition has repeatedly tried to mix and match figures to 
suit their purposes while refusing to look at the true 
conclusions of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the main issues the BU report tried to address were: 
Whether the BU ratio was a good tool to measure the 
effectiveness of the employment insurance program and whether 
the employment insurance program was meeting its objective of 
providing temporary income support to Canadians who were between 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study concluded that the BU ratio is not a good indicator to 
measure the effectiveness of the EI system. It also concluded 
that the EI system is meeting its objective of providing 
temporary income support to Canadians who have an attachment to 
the labour force. 
In fact, 78% of Canadians who have lost their jobs, or quit with 
just cause, are eligible for EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that the BU ratio does not effectively measure the 
effectiveness of the EI system is because the BU ratio includes 
all unemployed Canadians. But not all unemployed Canadians are 
automatically covered by EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the opposition's logic, what the Bloc would have us do 
is pay EI benefits to people who have never worked a day in 
their lives. Obviously, someone who never worked a day in his or 
her life is not covered under the EI system. 
But we have other programs to help this person enter the 
workforce, one of which is the youth employment strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone decides to quit his or her job to go back to school 
entitled to EI? Of course not, but we have other programs, 
including the Canadian opportunities strategy, to help this 
person go back to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Self-employed workers do not pay EI premiums and are therefore 
not entitled to EI. Someone who is being paid severance pay is 
not entitled to EI until this severance pay has been exhausted. 
It seems perfectly obvious to me, but the people across the way 
do not want to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is there for unemployed Canadians who are not 
eligible for EI but who need help. We have a variety of EI 
supporting programs, such as the youth employment strategy, 
which helps youth with the transition from school to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the Canadian opportunities strategy, which gives 
Canadians access to a good education so they can get better 
jobs. We also have the transitional jobs fund, which is creating 
jobs in areas of high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the post-TAGS program to help affected fishers and 
communities move on with their lives. We have active employment 
measures helping people get the skills they need to re-enter the 
labour market. 
Furthermore, we have the new hires program, which is helping 
employers hire more young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI program is there to meet the needs of Canadian workers 
who are between jobs. Our government will continue to monitor 
closely the impact of our system and reform. We remain open to 
resolving problems that arise, like shorts weeks. When this 
problem was brought to our attention, we found interesting 
solutions, which the opposition has now approved, and I thank 
them for appreciating the amount of work we have put into this.

local branch plant, as he likes to call us, who looked at the 
situation and made false statements. He should be reminded that, 
last week, Donald Charette wrote an editorial in <I>Le Soleil</I> in 
which he said “the first of the two methods, that is the one 
rightly used by the media, shows that, over the past eight 
years, the percentage of unemployed who are entitled to a cheque 
has fallen from 83% to 42%”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Charette adds that “the number of those who qualify has 
significantly decreased, while the fund has increased at the 
expense of contributors”. He goes on to say that “thousands of 
people are thus excluded from a program that should protect them 
and these people probably become prime candidates for social 
assistance”. 
Mr. Charette rightly concludes by saying that “if Minister 
Pettigrew does not have the authority to impose his views, a 
standing committee of the Senate and the House of Commons will 
have to look at the issue and restore some justice through 
redistribution”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These comments were not made by separatists. They are found in 
editorials across Canada, from the maritimes to British 
Columbia. Everyone says that the minister is stealing the 
employment insurance surplus— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me 
the opportunity to reply— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was not done with my comments. It 
is the minister who made some kind of claim. We did not hear 
what he said, but I would like to be allowed to conclude my 
remarks. I listened to him when he had the floor earlier. Now, 
it is his turn to listen to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I understand, but five 
minutes are allocated for two questions and two replies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I object to the 
unparliamentary language of the Parti Quebecois member, who is 
always pushing a very specific agenda that has nothing to do 
with helping people improve their situation and working with us 
constructively, because the worse things get, the happier he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these people are trying to prove is that the country is not 
in very good shape, and he knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the opposition member's logic, people who have 
never worked or paid EI premiums in their life are entitled to 
EI benefits.  The way the member sees it, we should be paying EI 
benefits to people who have received severance pay.  He wants us 
to pay— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Excuse me, with 
counsel, I was assured that the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques did not say 
anything unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we know, this bundling 
project and exclusion project affects 29 regions in Canada.  It 
is not only for the Atlantic provinces.  It affects Ontario, 
Quebec, British Columbia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Yukon, 
Northwest Territories and the four Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister assure the House today and all the people in 
those 29 regions that the EI applications will be continued to be 
processed after the expiration on November 15? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my 
intervention earlier, we are presently looking into the findings. 
The collection of data is being completed.  The findings will 
permit the government to determine the degree to which a 
disincentive to accept small weeks of work exists.  A decision on 
what action will be required over the long run will be made this 
fall. 
But as I said, for the time being my department continues to 
process claims as if the programs were to be continued.  I would 
like once again to recognize the very good intentions of the 
member for Madawaska—Restigouche who really tries to do 
constructive work in this House as this parliament can elevate 
itself to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will be resuming 
debate with the hon. member for Medicine Hat, but over the last 
couple of weeks the word “stolen” has crept in from time to 
time in debate and in question period.  It is a very grey area. 
If the word is used in a way that is not attached to a specific 
person but is in general, then it is not bad but it is on the 
cusp.  I would feel much more comfortable if we did not get into 
that grey area.  But if anyone were to use that pejorative word 
directed to another member directly, that would without question 
be unparliamentary.  It is not just the word, it is the form and 
the context in which the word is used. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to address the motion by the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very sympathetic to some of the points the hon. member has 
made.  I think he has made an excellent case for some of the 
flaws in some of the reforms that have occurred under this 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned and I must criticize the government in the 
strongest possible terms because here we are three weeks away 
from the expiry of this program and we have absolutely no 
evidence at all as to what the impacts are of the program.  It is 
a big program.  We have spent somewhere in the range of $230 
million so far on the program.  Yet we have no evidence and every 
year we get criticism from the auditor general coming forward 
saying programs lack clear measurably objectives, there are no 
ways to measure whether they are effective. Now we are in a 
situation where the program is coming to an end. My colleagues 
across the way are arguing that it is a good program.  Others 
like me are saying we just do not know.  We do not have any 
evidence.  If we had some evidence it would make it a lot easier 
to support the member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a position where the member I trust wants us to 
support his motion but on the other hand we have absolutely no 
evidence.  I think it is unreasonable to ask us to support it 
when it is a sizeable amount of money, $230 million to $260 
million, somewhere in that range, without any evidence at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I appreciate the arguments the member has 
made, but to make a decision to support the motion at this point 
would be imprudent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the need for fundamental reform of 
employment insurance.  I am glad that this topic has come up 
today because I think it needs to be discussed. As members know, 
the opposition parties have spoken jointly for the need for 
fundamental reform of employment insurance.  We have spoken about 
the need to have employers and employees get together and run 
this fund by themselves. We feel it is crazy to allow the 
government to take this huge employment insurance fund and 
essentially use it for whatever it wants to use it for.  We think 
it is dangerous to have a pool of capital that large with 
government using it for whatever mischievous purposes it wants to 
use it for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying let us take that fund, let us hive it off, let us 
let employers and employees run the fund.  Let us let them set 
the benefits and set the premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were one of the people on that board the first thing I 
would do is argue for experience rating.  Government members may 
recall that the Minister of Finance asked Professor Jack Mintz to 
produce a report on taxation on business in this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things he talked about was the need for reform of 
employment insurance premiums.  He talked about experience rating 
which has substantial merit.  Essentially what this is, if we use 
the model of the United States, is an insurance scheme that would 
penalize all those companies that lay people off more than their 
industry average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about areas where we have a lot of seasonal work 
such as in New Brunswick where the mover of this motion comes 
from.   In a situation where we have a lot of seasonal 
industries, such as the forestry industry, a pulp and paper 
outfit that lays people off more than other pulp and paper 
companies in that region would see its premiums go up. This would 
then create disincentive to lay people off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an excellent documentary on television a few years ago 
about how experience rating works and works extraordinarily well 
in the state of Maine.  They used the local Wal-Mart store as an 
example where a number of people are hired on just before 
Christmas but instead of letting them go after Christmas it keeps 
them on and gets them to stock shelves, do painting or fix up the 
store in various ways.  If these people were let go then it would 
have to face higher premiums.  There is a real positive incentive 
to keep people on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time this government started to explore some of these more 
fundamental reforms which would go a long way to solving some of 
the perverse incentives or disincentives we have in our 
employment insurance system today.  I really believe it is time 
to look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about the other big employment insurance 
problem we have today.  As members know, we have a situation 
where we have about a $7 billion overpayment currently sitting in 
the employment insurance fund, a fund that in my judgment and in 
the judgment of workers and employers belongs to the people who 
contributed the money in the first place.  I am talking here 
about workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the government speculating that it may decide to 
take that money and spend it.  I submit that money does not 
belong to the government.  It belongs to the workers, to the 
employers, to small businesses and to businesses in general, 95% 
of which are small businesses.  I condemn this government for 
talking about taking that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me it is unconscionable that the government would sit there 
for a number of years and allow that fund to balance its budget 
and then, when workers have balanced the budget, to say as thanks 
that it is going to take that $7 billion overpayment that comes 
in every year and keep it for itself. That is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the government why it does not just obey the law and do 
what the law is saying it should do which is to reduce the 
premiums and give it back to workers and small business.  A $350 
rebate in the form of lower premiums to somebody who is making 
$39,000 a year is helpful, especially with Christmas coming up. 
Five hundred dollars a year per employee going back to a small 
business is helpful.  It allows those people to withstand this 
economic downturn the minister has been talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not just be fair?  What is wrong with that?  Why do we 
not just give people back the money we have taken from them?  Not 
only are the four opposition parties in agreement on this issue, 
we also know that the provinces agree with this.  We also know 
businesses and labour agree with this.  Is it not time that the 
government yielded and forgot about its foolhardy pride and did 
the right and fair thing by giving the money back? It is 
unconscionable that this government is contemplating a $7 billion 
raid on the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says the government is not just going to take the 
money, it is going to have a debate on it.  What a joke. When we 
had the minister before the finance committee recently to give 
his economic statement he was making an argument about having 
this big debate. I said if there were really going to be a debate 
then why is the $7 billion overpayment already showing up in the 
projections for next year.  I also asked him why he has already 
taken for granted that the $7 billion will go into the government 
coffers.  He had no answer.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit, if this money really does belong to the government 
instead of to the workers, why does the government pay interest 
on that fund?  Why does it pay interest if it is just to itself? 
Is the government paying interest to itself?  I do not think so. 
It is paying it because it understands intuitively that the money 
does not belong to it.  It belongs to workers and to employers. 
Therefore, the government has a moral obligation to give that 
money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members cannot continue to say “We are going to have 
a debate.  We have decided that we know better than workers and 
employers how to use that money and, therefore, we are going to 
confiscate it”.  That is so fundamentally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It points to the increasing arrogance that we see from this 
government.  It seems like no law is unbridgeable by this 
government whether it is pepper-spraying students or whether it 
is taking $7 billion from employers and employees.  It points to 
a very ugly trend that we see in this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my hon. colleagues will join me in condemning the 
government for what it is proposing to do and ask for a more 
fundamental debate about employment insurance, one in which we 
will have the chance to hold this government accountable for its 
confiscation of the hard-earned premiums of workers and 
employers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I too 
come from a riding that is very hard hit by unemployment.  I see 
the negative impact and the ramifications that high unemployment 
has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a letter from an owner-operator of a quick service 
restaurant who told me that he has to pay EI premiums on 
employees' hours from day one, yet these young people cannot 
claim EI.  That creates a surplus in the fund that the employer 
cannot ask for in return.  I see this as just another problem 
that is created by this whole system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times I have had the opportunity to say that the Reform 
Party is not a national party or a true national party.  When the 
hon. member says that he is not prepared to support the motion 
put forth by my hon. colleague from Madawaska—Restigouche, once 
more I see that Reformers are ignoring the maritimes and the 
Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, all I can say to my 
hon. friend is that he cannot have it both ways.  We just had the 
member for Madawaska—Restigouche say that this program affects 
the entire country.  Now he is saying it is all about maritimers. 
He cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, I would submit that the Reform Party is a 
national party.  I was in Nova Scotia this weekend, talking to 
people there.  In fact, I see the hon. member down the way whose 
riding I was in.  I talked to people there and I can say they are 
profoundly unhappy with the choices of the traditional parties, 
which is why I was invited to go there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If bigger social programs were the solution to the problems of 
the people in Atlantic Canada, New Brunswickers, Nova Scotians, 
people in Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, then those 
people would be extraordinarily well off.  I do not think it has 
worked that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a new program to create jobs.  The best social program 
in the world is a permanent, good job, not tinkering with the 
current system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend should consider that perhaps after 30 years the way he 
and his party have gone simply has not worked.  Maybe it is time 
for a new approach for all Canadians, in particular for the 
people of Atlantic Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened intently to the member's debate.  We are talking about 
the surpluses we have had in the EI account for the last several 
years.  However, the thing that seems to be missing is that the 
history of the plan has been deficits.  There were years in which 
there were deficits and during those periods the Canadian 
taxpayer had to top up the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, they were not the workers and the businesses 
that he is talking about.  In fact, the average taxpayer had to 
reach into their pockets and pay money into that program.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member says “Give that money back to whom it 
belongs”, has he taken into account the reality that taxpayers 
have paid money to support the plan over the years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, in my province of Ontario the premier and his party 
are making a lot of the fact that Ontario has a net outflow to 
support the employment insurance system.  He thinks this is a bad 
thing.  I suppose within his own province he can also find shifts 
between industries.  In my riding, General Motors, for instance, 
argues that it only gets 60 cents on the dollar in the employment 
insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his province of Alberta, does the member also support the 
idea that we should balkanize the plan and try to make it 
sustainable within provincial boundaries, or is there a 
realization that there is more to this country than just 
individual provincial concerns? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, the first point I would 
make is that employers and employees have kicked in $19 billion 
more than they have drawn out in employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that of course we need to hide this fund off so 
that we are not in a situation where either the government has to 
kick money in or employers have to kick money in to bail out the 
government.  The fact is that this government pays $711 million 
in interest on the fund as it is right now.  I do not think that 
helps anybody, certainly not taxpayers in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would make is that we believe that employers 
and employees should set the benefits and the premiums.  That is 
the way to handle this problem and that would not balkanize 
Canadians.  I would argue that it would probably go a long way in 
de-politicizing EI and would make the program a lot more 
effective.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to speak today to the motion 
presented by the member for Madawaska—Restigouche, whom I 
congratulate on his choice of topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot say the same for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, a technocrat who basically lets the federal 
bureaucracy order him around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pilot project to correct a glaring oversight in the EI reform 
was introduced in March 1997, a mere two months after the reform 
first took effect.  The reform took effect January 1, 1997 and 
in March the government realized there was a glaring oversight. 
No one in the government had anticipated it. 
A pilot project, which will end on November 15 of this year, was 
put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, this pilot project allows an individual who has been 
employed for 20 weeks at $450 a week and six small weeks at $60 
a week, to receive benefits of $245 a week.  Without the pilot 
project, he would receive $198 a week.  This is not a huge 
salary.  The annual salary of someone earning $450 a week is 
$23,400.  If he works full time, members can imagine the impact 
of $50 a week less on his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now only three weeks to go in the pilot project and 
the minister is still unable to tell us if his department has 
evaluated the situation properly, if it will extend the pilot 
project, terminate it or come up with something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is wrong, because it is not the day after November 15 that 
this is going to hit people. 
It is already happening.  People are already busy calculating 
how much they are going to have to manage on for the winter, and 
they do not know today whether the program will counteract the 
negative effect of the small weeks, whether it will have a heavy 
impact on their budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we want to say in today's motion.  We want to tell 
the government “Everybody is saying the surplus in the EI fund 
is excessive”.  They say there is a $20 billion surplus in the 
fund.  The present pilot project costs between $100 and $125 
million yearly, more or less.  It takes about one-half of 1% of 
the $20 billion surplus to ensure people have the minimum income 
required for them and their families to be able to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are facing a situation where a government is accumulating a 
surplus at the expense of those who earn the least, because the 
$20 billion surplus was built up while the small weeks projects 
were in place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministerial greediness behind this method of calculation is 
obvious, that of the Minister of Finance in particular.  The 
Minister of Human Resources Development does not seem in the 
least anxious to defend his people.  Instead, he seems totally 
dependent on what the Minister of Finance decides on his behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government still wants to take another $100 million on top 
of the $20 billion; always a little bit more, but Canada's 
social protection is being destroyed and that is where the 
danger lies.  This is a situation that needs to be remedied. 
This pilot project has been in place for two years.  It has been 
in operation, and there are masses of public servants to 
evaluate it. 
We are three weeks away from the end of the pilot project.  The 
member for Madawaska—Restigouche wants to know from the 
minister “Will the project be extended or not?”  He is unable to 
give us an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that officials will continue to calculate things as they 
have been doing.  It is this sort of attitude and behaviour I 
find unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are not administering their own money, they are 
administering money workers and employers pay into the 
employment insurance plan.  The issue is the fact that people 
must no longer be forced to beg to collect their own money. 
Behind this motion is the question of dignity.  This is why it 
is vital the government look very seriously at this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the Liberal members particularly those 
from the maritimes, of something.  They are going to have to 
vote this evening. 
When you vote on this motion, remember the people like Francis 
LeBlanc and Doug Young who, here in this House, defended the 
government's unacceptable positions, on the very issue of 
unemployment insurance reform.  Today, they no longer sit here, 
because they were sent a very clear message by the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be doing a favour to the current Liberal 
members, especially those from the maritimes, but those from 
everywhere else in Canada too, because the small weeks plan 
exists for everyone.  Its impact is felt not only in regions 
where there are seasonal workers.  Its impact is felt in 
Montreal, in the west and throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening we will have to decide whether the plan will 
continue.  We will have to decide whether it will continue and 
be incorporated in the law.  These two decisions will have to be 
made at the end of the day.  All members in this House will have 
to vote. 
They will have to decide whether the person I referred to 
earlier, who earns $450 a week during 20 weeks, should be 
entitled to keep receiving this $50 or have his or her benefits 
cut by $50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People like us make a decent income; we make good money, we can 
get by. But after a vote has been taken and we have left this 
House, we must remember that voting against this motion means 
taking $50 a week from workers who earn $20,000, $25,000 or 
$30,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the government were ultimately to extend the program, 
the citizens, workers and employers of this country deserve a 
minimum of respect. This government must absolutely wake up and 
put forward a proposal, saying “We agree to extend the small 
weeks program, at least until the consequences are known. We 
cannot tell if it is really effective, but we do know a few 
things”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know it costs between $100 million and $125 million a year to 
operate, out of a $20 billion surplus in the EI fund. We also 
know that it helps low income workers. Seasonal workers are the 
ones who are affected the most. We know that poverty has 
increased tremendously across Canada in recent years. The middle 
class is disappearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is over the EI system that the federal government has the 
greatest control. The provinces are not necessarily the ones 
that should act on this. Money should be put back into transfer 
payments, but there are actions that could taken directly from 
here. 
The decision can be made to put an end to this escalating 
poverty, to at least let people retain their same level of 
income  Most particularly, they can be allowed to retain their 
dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what dignity means?  It means that, when a worker 
earns a salary and is entitled to insurance, at the end of the 
day, that insurance program will be respected, and the rules 
will not be changed part way through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone who worked in seasonal employment this summer was 
covered by a system that included this program. 
For weeks we have been asking the government, particularly the 
Liberal minister—and clearly he is not a spokesperson for the 
Parti Quebecois, nor are we, but he is I am sure the 
spokesperson for all of the bureaucrats in his department—to tell 
us whether he is capable of putting on the table positions like 
those set out this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has said that the calculations would continue as before but 
that he could not tell us whether the program would be extended, 
whether the legislation would be changed.  He cannot tell us 
anything.  What point is there in having a Minister of Human 
Resources Development if he is incapable of managing his main 
area of responsibility, employment insurance?

stimulating the economy and ensuring that consumption will 
continue.  The federal government has a tool available to it. 
Now that there are problems with international demand and we can 
no longer be sure there will be a market in Asia for our 
products, let us at least use the tools we have available to us, 
let us cut employment insurance contributions, let us give 
people a program that at least gives families a decent income.

this morning on television, when a CBC reporter from the east 
coast asked when he would be going to New Brunswick. 
The minister's response: “I tried to go there in June, but I 
have not found the time yet”.

of explaining to them why decisions are made, should no longer 
be minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening, when all the members vote on the motion, they 
should also show their courage.  I think it is important that 
they think about all the people in their ridings who will be 
affected.  Those members who do not understand the impact can 
call the people in their ridings to find out.  They can call the 
community groups in their ridings to find out whether people 
will be going to soup kitchens because of the choice that will 
be made this evening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to the opposition day motion put forward by 
the Progressive Conservatives.  Our caucus is pleased to support 
the motion for a variety of reasons.  We are critical that the 
motion does not go nearly far enough.  We would much rather 
debate the EI Act and argue for its reform.  It is clearly 
dysfunctional and broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI system is supposed to provide income maintenance for 
unemployed workers.  It is pretty straightforward.  That is the 
deal.  That is the pact most working people understand.  When 
they have something deducted from their paycheques for a specific 
reason, there is a reasonable expectation that they should be 
allowed to collect income maintenance should they find themselves 
unfortunate enough to become unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We approve of other designated uses.  We find there is merit to 
the motion.  We believe the small weeks pilot project was 
necessary and that it had to take place.  Obviously too many 
people were being penalized by the divisor rule which was put in 
place with the Liberal amendments to the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The divisor rule is patently unfair in that it brings down the 
benefit for the unemployed worker by averaging all the weeks 
leading up to the layoff and not just the weeks in which they 
worked.  In other words, dead weeks or small earning weeks were 
being folded into the package which brought down the average. Not 
only do less than 40% of unemployed people qualify for any 
benefit at all, but those who are lucky enough to qualify for 
some benefit get less money and for a shorter period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Minister for Human Resources Development tried to argue 
that those figures were not accurate.  He referred to an analysis 
on employment insurance benefit coverage recently commissioned 
and released by HRDC.  Holding the report as proof he made the 
argument that 78% of all unemployed workers actually qualified 
for EI.  Nobody believes that.  The media do not believe it. 
Recent editorials do not believe it.  It simply is not true.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made the allegation that opposition critics in this 
area were reading the report too selectively, misquoting and 
taking things out of context.  In actual fact the minister is 
taking things out of context.  The report clearly states as a 
summary of the study that the regular EI beneficiaries to 
unemployment ratio or the BU ratio—some people call it the BS 
ratio—had declined by almost 50% in the 1990s, falling from a 
level of 83% in 1989 to 42% in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the figure we hear most commonly quoted in the media and 
in our own criticisms.  Critics from labour and all different 
groups say that approximately 40% of unemployed workers qualify 
for EI.  Clearly the system is dysfunctional and broken.  It is 
no wonder there is a huge surplus.  It is not hard to develop a 
surplus when nobody qualifies any more and the few people who do 
qualify are getting reduced benefits and for a shorter period of 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that huge surplus—and I am glad other speakers raised it 
as an issue—we are hearing all kinds of creative ideas on how to 
spend money that clearly is not theirs to spend. Some people 
argue we should be spending it on health and social programs. 
Some of the premiers of the provinces are even saying that.  Some 
people say we should use it for deficit reduction, which is what 
the Minister of Finance has used the surplus for. Almost 
unbelievably the Business Council on National Issues is calling 
for tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some sort of perverse version of Sherwood Forest we have the 
BCNI advocating that we rob from the poor to give the rich yet 
another tax cut.  It is almost incomprehensible.  Shear 
perversity is what I call it.  Fortunately that idea has not 
caught on in any meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have people advocating that we should be cutting 
premiums with the surplus.  A common theme in the business 
community is that it should be returned to business and employees 
through premium cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except for my caucus no one seems to be raising the issue of 
increasing the benefits and lowering the bar for eligibility so 
that more people qualify.  What could be more simple?  The money 
is deducted from our paycheques every week.  To use it for 
anything but income maintenance would be a breach of trust at the 
very least and out and out theft in the worst case scenario.  To 
take money from a person's cheque for a specific purpose and to 
use it for something completely different is fundamentally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about the $20 billion surplus, an almost 
inconceivable amount of money in most people's minds, obviously 
it should be used to provide income maintenance.  It should be 
put it in the pockets of working people when they find themselves 
unfortunate enough to be unemployed.  They will spend the money 
in the community.  It has the multiplier effect and residual 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point has not come up.  Many of the changes to EI were 
quite insignificant when we look at the bigger picture of how few 
people qualify.  One of the changes that went by almost unnoticed 
was that of people serving their apprenticeship training in a 
community college.  There is now a two week waiting period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a journeyman carpenter I served my time as an apprentice. 
When I went to community college there was no waiting period for 
the EI to kick in.  Now people are laid off from their job to go 
to school for eight weeks, six weeks or whatever their trade 
dictates, and there is a two week period where they do not get 
any income at all.  The result has been that many apprentices are 
simply choosing not to take their in-school component.  They are 
not going to school because they cannot go for two weeks without 
earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total savings to the EI system for reinstating this waiting 
period for students was $10 million per year.  The fund is 
showing a surplus of $500 million per month and the 
apprenticeship system has been gutted for the sake of $10 million 
per year.  That kind of logic simply was not thought out well and 
should be reversed immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually the building trades unions making this argument have a 
variety of good recommendations for how we can fix the EI system. 
One of the things they point to is that all the changes have not 
even kicked in yet.  It will actually get worse in the next year. 
I guess in the government's mind it will get better because the 
surplus will be even bigger.  One of the changes that will kick 
in next year is the clawback or the threshold people reach before 
their EI benefits are clawed back.  It used to be $63,000 a year. 
Those making more than $63,000 a year would start losing their 
benefits.  They would be clawed back.  Everybody agreed that was 
fair, that anyone making $60,000 a year should not be collecting 
EI and should be able to put some money away.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this set of changes it was reduced to $48,750.  I guess we 
could argue whether or not that is fair.  As of next year it will 
be $39,000.  People making more than $39,000 will have their EI 
benefits clawed back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the building trades.  A journey person might make 
$20 or $25 an hour.  If they are lucky to get eight or nine 
months of work in, they might make $39,000 a year.  Hopefully 
they will. However they still have three months without earnings. 
That $39,000 a year is not a huge amount of money.  They are in a 
very high tax bracket.  They do not get to keep the whole 
$39,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I argue that they should not penalized for collecting what is 
rightfully theirs for the three or four months they need it to 
span that period of unemployment.  It is to everybody's benefit 
if we can keep people in those occupations during slow times so 
that they are available when the industry needs them the next 
spring.  Otherwise they will find some other kind of work, leave 
town or move.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main criticism of the opposition day motion is that I wish it 
went a lot further so that we could have a substantial debate 
about EI reform.  I can only think the reason it was limited to 
such a narrow scope was that perhaps they were snookered by the 
government.  Maybe there was some optimism that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development would see the logic in what they were 
saying and would announce today that the small weeks program is a 
good idea, is necessary, and that they should be maintaining it 
after November 15.  Maybe that was the optimism which motivated 
the people who moved the opposition day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact I think they have been hoodwinked.  The Minister 
of Human Resources Development just stood and said that they were 
not interested in extending the small weeks program.  He was not 
interested in jeopardizing the windfall of $7 billion a year that 
they pull out of the EI program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to my colleague's speech with 
interest.  I would like him to comment on the position the 
minister took earlier.  He said that, as Quebec's  sovereignist 
representatives, all we want to do is raise doubts about the 
Canadian system.  I would like the member, to expose the 
credibility of this issue, to remind the House that there are 
national concerns, but there are also social issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago, the opposition parties unanimously proposed to 
the government that management of the employment insurance fund 
be given to an independent commission.  The other opposition 
parties did not hide behind the fact that we might be 
sovereignists. 
They listened to and weighed the merits of this proposal, which 
received the support of the Canadian Labour Congress, Quebec's 
labour unions, a number of business associations, and especially 
representatives of small and medium sized businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell the minister that, in this matter, it 
is not our intention to give the government a hard time, but to 
ensure that the law works properly and to close the loophole 
created by the inclusion of small weeks in the calculation of EI 
benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell this House that people today want 
nothing more than to be sure people will not be getting $200 a 
week instead of $250, when they need it to live, and that we are 
awaiting the government's decision to continue the program? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
remarks.  He is quite right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very disappointed to hear the Minister of Human Resources 
Development try to trivialize this argument by taking a cheap 
shot, questioning the motives and the sincerity of the speakers 
from the Bloc Quebecois.  Frankly the minister of HRD represents 
a riding that has one of the highest unemployment and poverty 
rates in the country.  Representing unemployed people in the 
province of Quebec should be a huge priority for him. 
He certainly should not question the sincerity of other 
representatives from the province of Quebec who are sincerely 
concerned about the failure of the EI system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised another interesting point which I wish I 
had time to comment on.  He is quite right that all four 
opposition parties joined together in their demand for an 
independent fund. We want the EI fund to be unique and fully 
separate from general revenues.  This is the only way we can be 
sure that future finance ministers are not tempted to put their 
hand in the cookie jar and grab money that clearly is not theirs 
to use it for purposes not designated by the fund.  It is 
something on which we should keep the pressure.  The general 
public understands why this is necessary.  Business, labour and 
all four opposition parties will continue to call for that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
question is for the member for Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, while I am on my feet I would like to congratulate the 
member for Madawaska—Restigouche for presenting this motion 
today and express my incredulity at Reform members and the fact 
that they dare to state in the House that they would not support 
this motion. Give your head a shake, boys.  Give your head a 
shake. Think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is not about trying to find EI for someone who is 
not working. This motion is not about some type of giveaway. 
This motion is about bundling of weeks for people who already 
work, to allow them to actually benefit from the EI program. That 
is the type of thing we are supposed to support in this House as 
the Parliament of Canada, to look out for those people who need 
some assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to qualify a few statistics and take the fishery as 
an example.  Less than one year ago there were 34,000 workers out 
of work in the east coast fishery.  Seventy-three per cent of 
them had no high school education and 67%— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The time has run out. 
The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre on a quick response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, in reaction to the 
comments made by the member, he is being critical of the Reform 
Party for failing to vote in favour of this motion. Frankly the 
motion as I pointed out really does not go to the heart of the 
issue.  Perhaps that is the reservation some of the members of 
the Reform Party have with the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish it went much further in calling for substantial EI 
reform.  I wish the Progressive Conservatives had taken the 
opportunity with this opposition day motion to call for an 
independent fund. Then I think they would get unanimity on the 
opposition side. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, first I 
want to thank my colleague from Madawaska—Restigouche for 
putting forth the motion before us today.  Also, I want to inform 
you, Madam Speaker, that I will be splitting my time with my 
colleague, the hon. member for Chicoutimi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the last round of employment insurance changes was being 
proposed by this government, I spoke out against aspects of the 
legislation that would penalize people who want to work, but this 
government did not listen.  My party pointed out then that the 
effect of some parts of Bill C-12, the Employment Insurance Act, 
would encourage some to say no to part time work because they 
would be worse off if they said yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there are less than 40% of the unemployed who qualify, 
whereas before under the other system 80% were eligible. Everyone 
in this House should stop and think about those men and women who 
have children they want to feed, educate and care for and they do 
not have any money for food or clothes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at the finance committee meeting in Saint John, New 
Brunswick last Monday, a week ago today, on the prebudget debate. 
A gentleman had flown in from Newfoundland. 
I never heard such a heart-rending report in my life about what 
was happening in Newfoundland and how those people were 
suffering.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues from Nova Scotia started to speak about the 
fishermen.  It is a serious matter and I get very disturbed when 
I hear someone from the Reform Party say that it was my party 
that did this to the Atlantic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say this.  My riding of Saint John, New Brunswick had one 
of the lowest unemployment rates that we had had in many years. 
Things were great.  The shipyard was going full blast. Do we have 
a national shipbuilding policy now?  No.  The shipyard in Quebec 
is down.  The shipyard in Saint John is down. Most of the 
shipyards in all of Atlantic Canada are down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be some compassion on the government side.  The 
government has to start thinking about those people. It really 
hurts when I men come to my office.  Never in the 25 years that I 
have been involved both locally and here in Ottawa up until this 
past year has a man come to my office crying “Please, I will 
sweep the streets. I do not care what it is.  I just want to look 
after my children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party tried to improve the EI 
legislation in the Senate in the last parliament.  Our amendments 
were rejected by the Liberal majority in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been pointed out that a Progressive Conservative senator 
proposed in May 1996 that weeks with less than 15 hours of 
insurable earnings should not be counted as weeks of work when 
calculating an individual's EI benefit rate.  The senator argued 
that otherwise claimants could end up with lower benefits if they 
worked just a few hours in one week thereby discouraging these 
individuals to take part time work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year later this disincentive to work in the EI legislation was 
confirmed. Pilot projects were launched to look into addressing 
the “small weeks issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government engaged in its so-called social policy 
review in 1994, I spoke in the House about the need to reform our 
social safety net.  Canada's income security programs had been 
designed at a time when unemployment was a brief condition 
between jobs, when the one income, two parent family was the rule 
and when child poverty was not measured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke back then about the need for reforms that would reorient 
passive income support programs to an active investment in 
people, reforms that would remove barriers that prevent many from 
becoming active members of the labour force and reforms that 
would replace disjointed programs with a coherent system. Instead 
of adhering to these principles, some of the EI reforms proposed 
and passed by this Liberal government actually discourage people 
to go to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have pointed out before and I say again that there are people 
in parts of Atlantic Canada who are considered frequent users of 
EI.  It is not because they are lazy or because they are abusing 
the system.  It is because some parts of the economy are highly 
seasonal.  I know there are people both on the opposition and 
government sides that do not understand about the seasonal 
system.  That is why they need programs that will allow them to 
adjust and move with the changing times. These people do not need 
programs that cut them off at the knees.  They are people who 
want to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance as helpful as it is does not bring the same 
return both financially and spiritually that a job does.  That is 
why we have proposed the motion we are debating today.  That is 
why we are urging that this House on both sides, everyone, be 
allowed to consider amending the EI act, allow workers either to 
eliminate small weeks of work from the calculation of benefits or 
bundle those small weeks together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good public policy encourages work, self-sufficiency, fairness 
and dignity.  The small weeks provision in the EI act does not do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1994 social policy review, I also spoke out against 
raising taxes.  I said then and I maintain today that the 
challenge is to use money already in the system to make programs 
as flexible as possible so recipients can receive the benefits 
that help them become self-reliant and meet their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is also why I have been asking the government to lower the 
excessive EI premiums since 1996. 
The government is gouging the Canadian workers who are already 
overtaxed and it is stifling job creation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has been overtaxing Canadian workers and 
employers through excessive employment insurance premiums to pad 
his deficit numbers.  He has said as much.  I hope all of my 
colleagues on the government side remember when the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance stated that these high taxes 
make us lose jobs, that jobs cannot be created, that people in 
the business community will not expand when they have high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and their colleagues 
want to use the surplus in the fund to pay for programs that the 
fund is not meant to finance.  The money in the EI fund is 
designed to provide temporary income support to unemployed 
Canadians.  That money belongs to Canadian workers and their 
employers.  It does not belong to the finance minister or any 
other minister of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1994 the finance minister told Canadians in his 
first budget that, as I have stated, payroll taxes are a barrier 
to jobs.  They truly are.  All Canadians know that there have 
been about 40 tax hikes since this government came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My little daughter-in-law said to me the other day “Mother, I 
do not know what has happened.  I always put money away at the 
end of the month for Lindsay's and Matthew's education but we do 
not have any money any more”.  I said “Dear, it is because of 
the taxes you have to pay.  It is because of what they have done 
to you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult.  Back when the finance minister talked about 
the barrier to jobs that payroll taxes were, his context was a 
set of employment insurance benefit cuts proposed by the Liberals 
that were supposed to allow for lower EI premiums, not a cash 
grab at the expense of Canadians to fund projects unrelated to 
the objectives of the EI legislation, for short term political 
gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are really concerned.  We are concerned about what is 
happening with the EI fund.  The auditor general has stated 
himself that he has concerns about what is happening with this 
government. I hope the government does not fire him. Every time 
someone speaks out, they are gone the next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsible governments recognize when bad public policy 
decisions hurt Canadians and they take action to correct their 
mistakes.  I urge this government to recognize the mistakes that 
are there.  I urge this government and all members of the Liberal 
government to do the right thing for those people out there. 
Have the needed compassion.  Reach out to those people who need 
help.  Do not hurt them any more.  The government is taking away 
their dignity. We want to give them their dignity back. Do not 
make them plead.

listened intently to the member's very impassioned plea for the 
people in Atlantic Canada. I must say I was somewhat moved by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if she is aware of the fact that payroll taxes in 
Canada are one of the lowest in the industrialized world.  The 
way she talked about them made it sound like they were about the 
highest.  In fact, they are one of the lowest, which makes us a 
competitive place in which to do business.

system as being an unfair transfer from the province of Ontario 
essentially to Atlantic Canada.  He is saying “We already pay

through the EI system to support places like Atlantic Canada”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member that everybody in this House needs to 
have a history lesson on the role played by Atlantic Canada, 
particularly my city which is Canada's first incorporated city by 
royal charter, in building this whole country from coast to 
coast.  Everybody, particularly our friends out west and those in 
Ontario, need to travel this country to find out exactly what our 
people are like. Two weeks ago a person from Vancouver came to me 
and told me that my city was the nicest city in the whole of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as Atlantic Canadians go, we get hurt when we hear people 
from Ontario and out west refer to us as Atlantica and a drag on 
society.  All our people want is their dignity.  If we had a 
government that was going to look at keeping those adjustments in 
place then we could tell Atlantic Canadians that this government 
also cares for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking members to speak to the minister.  I am asking 
members to speak out for our people.  I am asking members on the 
government side to fight for our people to make sure they have 
their dignity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
compliment the member for Saint John on her remarks. She made 
some excellent points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one question I have for her is somewhat in response to a 
question that was asked earlier by a Liberal member.  Is it not a 
fact that if we went into a recession tomorrow the government 
would be forced to borrow the $19 billion that it would have to 
pay out to unemployed Canadians?  Is it not true that it would be 
a lot better to have that money in a separate fund where the 
government could not get its hands on it to misuse for all kinds 
of political ends? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, we have already taken a 
stand.  We have already said that there should be a commission 
for the employers and employees that looks after the surplus. 
This commission should dictate how that surplus is used.  It 
should be independent of the government.  We have taken that 
stand.  We all agree on this side of the House.  I am just 
waiting for that side of the House to agree as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, let me remind the member for Saint John about a little 
history.  It was the Conservative government in 1986 that passed 
legislation which permitted the funds to be used as they are 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also remind the member that this Liberal government has 
spent the last five years fixing the problems we inherited. For 
example, in 1993 the EI was pegged at $3.30 per $100.  We have 
since been bringing it down to what it is today which is $2.70. 
If the member really wants to talk to her granddaughter she 
should be telling her the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, in the last year of the 
former PC government EI premiums were frozen at $3.00 per $100 of 
insurable earnings.  In 1994 the Liberals raised the level to 
$3.07 which I think the member forgot about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should take a look at history and what Trudeau did 
and the mess he left this country in when we took over.

congratulate our acting leader, who is doing an extraordinary 
job for our party. She just demonstrated it again by defending 
some really important causes for the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I want to thank the hon. member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche for tabling a motion that shows great 
sensitivity on his part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I heard a Reform Party member say that the motion was 
too narrow. Go ask children in families where the difference in 
terms of survival, adequate clothing and food is often a mere 
$25, $30, $40 or $50 what they think about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member who suggested that today's motion is too 
narrow, that he should go and repeat his comment to his 
constituents. I am convinced he would not get a very positive 
reaction.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Conservative member who rises in this House always gets the 
same reaction: “Under the Conservatives—”. I think we should also 
talk about the current government's track record in terms of 
public finance. So here is an excerpt from an editorial written 
by Mr. Murray in <I>Le Droit</I>, following the last budget: “It took 
all these years for the unpopular measures taken by the 
Conservatives to produce the conclusive results that we are 
witnessing today”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we rise in this House, we are regularly told “you 
Conservatives should be ashamed. Everything you did was wrong”. 
I am pleased to have been around when the growing debt was 
brought under control. 
I want to take a minute to talk about this, because it is 
important. We must put the 1974-1984 period in its proper 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period, the Liberals increased the debt from $18 
billion to $200 billion. The important thing here is the rate of 
increase. Under the Liberals, the debt grew elevenfold in a 
decade. Under the Conservatives, it increased twofold over a 
period of nine years. However, let us not forget that we also 
took important measures, including the signing of the free trade 
agreement that allowed us, among other things, to double our 
exports to the American market. The GST also helped the 
government reduce the deficit. The purpose of all these 
initiatives was to alleviate the burden of Canadian taxpayers. 
All these measures could not have been in effect for just one 
year. They had to be implemented over a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the royal commissions, the standing committees and so 
forth, the Liberals always voted against these measures that 
were essentially good for the future of our country.  They 
always voted against them.  I am definitely not about to go on a 
guilt trip here.  According to the Reform and Liberal parties, 
the motion my colleague is proposing today is not a structural 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most certainly a structural measure for the families of 
this country.  It is a structural measure for the poor people of 
Quebec, the maritimes, western Canada, Ontario and elsewhere. 
But the government does not seem to want to take it seriously. 
I repeat, as my colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, pointed out a few 
minutes ago, for the vast majority of Canadian families, $25, 
$40, $50 is the difference between surviving and not surviving. 
“mesure étroite”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should try telling single parents that asking for an 
extension of the small weeks project is too limited an approach, 
as one of our Reform Party colleagues was saying, when we know 
very well that some people are having trouble just surviving. 
Young people are going to school in the morning on an empty 
stomach.  There are serious problems of poverty in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am on the topic, I would like to make another point.  I 
was part of a government with a very substantial agenda in all 
areas, including regional development, the environment and acid 
rain—I was present at the signing—trade and tax reform.  Right 
now, none of these items are on the government's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would propose one item for the government and this country to 
tackle: the fight against poverty, which is the number one 
problem in the country right now. 
I read an article in which Michel Vastel said “Elected 
representatives are not listening to anyone any more”. That is 
serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, a motion was proposed to help the poorest of the poor in 
our country. While I have nothing against deputy ministers or 
senior government officials, the Parliament of Canada is paying 
closer attention to what senior officers say than to what the 
poor are saying, when it is a well-known fact that the taxpayers 
see millions and billions taken out of their pockets without 
benefiting from any return on their investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to ask all my colleagues in this House to 
support this extremely important measure proposed by one of our 
colleagues from a riding that is not among the richest in the 
country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not resolve the whole issue of employment insurance, of 
course, but at least it is a small step that could immediately 
benefit every Canadian family whose extremely low income is not 
enough to ensure adequate subsistence for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bear in mind that the government is not a private 
insurance company. Overcontributions like those currently being 
paid by every worker and employer in Canada are inequitable and 
cannot be allowed to continue. 
A start must be made with a little measure such as we are 
requesting today.  It is about paying attention to Canada's 
poorest citizens.  It does not mean establishing a structural 
measure, but it does give us the opportunity to propose a 
solution to the surplus in the employment insurance fund.  It 
would at least enable us to ensure the survival of the poorest 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also understand that, for the minister, it is difficult to 
travel across the country.  He is having a really hard time 
convincing himself to visit the maritimes.  Clearly, a 
politician needs to be able to remember some things.  We know 
about that.  It is true in Quebec and it is true in all the 
regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politicians have to choose.  In opposition, it is a legitimate 
question to ask the government whether it should be more 
attentive to the wealthier element in our society, that is 
senior public servants.  I have nothing against them, but the 
salary increases given federal government deputy ministers are 
worth a look.  When you put those figures before people who have 
a hard time surviving, it is not much of a balance sheet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will have the support of all of the members in 
opposition in support of this measure, which at least sends a 
signal to parliament.  It is possible to listen to those who are 
the most disadvantaged.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today I would like to raise awareness about EB.  EB 
refers to epidermolysis bullosa, a group of rare and devastating 
genetic diseases characterized by extremely fragile skin and 
recurrent painful blisters.  To date there is no cure for EB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the physical limitations that can be caused by EB there 
is no impairment of intelligence.  Many EB sufferers excel at 
work and in the classroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association of 
Canada, also known as DEBRA, is seeking to develop a national 
registry of EB sufferers, raise awareness of the disease and 
encourage Canadian research into EB.  Many of the problems of EB 
sufferers can be overcome with the support of a well informed and 
caring community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason I seek to bring attention to EB and encourage 
research and efforts to care for those who suffer from this 
devastating disease.

message is clear.  Sexual harassment will not be tolerated,

of Defence Staff General Baril recently stated that harassment is 
particularly appalling when it occurs in our military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a system where chivalry, honour, protection of the weakest 
and respect for all should be guiding principles, General Baril 
is demanding a higher standard of conduct for members in uniform, 
as are Canadians, as am I.  There are no excuses for this 
unacceptable behaviour, and those who do not comply can expect to 
pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the military for taking a hard line against sexual 
harassment.  It will help to eradicate such inappropriate conduct 
in the Canadian forces as well as send a clear and unequivocal 
statement to society that sexual harassment and sexual misconduct 
in any form are intolerable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what 
to do with the $7 billion EI surplus is a question of fundamental 
fairness that every Canadian understands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister says he wants to debate the issue but the 
fact is that the money is not his to spend.  It belongs to the 
workers and employers who were forced to pay an extra $7 billion 
into the plan because they have been overcharged for their EI 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means the average worker is asked to pay $350 too much into 
this fund every year.  It means the employer who hired him pays 
$500 too much into this fund every year.  It means that the 
finance minister skims billions of extra taxes from the pockets 
of those least able to afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister chooses fairness he will give this money back to 
the people it belongs to.  If he chooses political expediency he 
will confiscate the money to get around the law and pad his 
political slush fund.  I hope he chooses fairness.

in the Quebec election, but unfortunately he shot at his own 
foot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By saying that Quebec's demands have already been filled and 
that the Constitution is not a general store the Prime Minister 
gave the impression that Canadian federalism is not open to 
change.

for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the list of changes in the last years is quite 
impressive and it is certainly the will of the Prime Minister and 
the government to go ahead and improve this federation for the 
good of the federation of Canadians, including Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the list.  I will indicate some changes that have been 
made during the last years.  For instance, the use of federal 
spending powers, and the reduced conditions of the main federal 
transfers to the provinces with the creation of the CHST.  The 
list is long. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the changes that are impressive to Quebec are demands 
for change outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration, the premiers' proposals for improving 
the social union, the official opposition's new Canada act and 
the Alberta Senate election all represent healthy demands from 
outside Quebec to change the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By telling Quebeckers that reform of the federation is not an 
option, is the Prime Minister slamming the door on all of these 
other initiatives for change?

federation is not an option.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

over the weekend was that the federation is not open to change.

there is a positive demand for change outside Quebec and that 
Quebeckers do not have to decide between the status quo and 
sovereignty.

police and it's possible that he did.  I hope he did.  I don't

if that is the case, perhaps the solicitor general can explain to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision was taken as a result of a study done by the

this region alone, private health care businesses are on the rise

over a year ago this government announced that the era of cuts to 
health care was over.  Last year one of the first things we did 
as we emerged from the deficit of the past was to reinvest in 
health care by restoring $1.5 billion to the transfer payments. 
The commitment of this government to the public single funder 
system of health care is unequivocal.  That is why the Prime 
Minister has said clearly that health will be the subject of our 
next major reinvestment, and it will be.

Speaker, I have the honour to present a petition which is signed 
by hundreds of residents of the constituency I have the honour of

in health care is becoming increasingly curtailed and further

any substance other than food.  They go on with a number of other 
proposed changes to the Food and Drug Act.

very efficient work done by our colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques on related issues. 
Any issue touched on by Human Resources Development Canada is a 
social issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the time being, it is extremely important that the small 
weeks program be extended, as this extension is anxiously 
awaited by some people. As part of a more comprehensive reform, 
looking into everything that concerns the absolutely 
disproportionate surpluses in the EI fund, perhaps extending 
this program should be considered, if only to show a little more 
sensitivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read an article, dated September 23, in which Michel Vastel 
said “Elected representatives show an increasingly appalling 
insensitivity to the demands of ordinary citizens”. I agree with 
our colleague's comments. There is an extraordinary difference 
between what he said and the remarks made by the Reform Party 
member, who considered this measure to be completely superficial 
and unproductive, while knowing full well that some families 
could use a few dozen dollars more to have decent living 
conditions, not perfect ones, just enough to live at subsistence 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important to act quickly on extending this 
program and to do so as part of a comprehensive reform.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr.

would the member not agree this is just an insidious example of 
this Liberal government's downsizing its responsibility on to the 
backs of the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of that is that as of September 1, after the TAGS 
program, close to 9,000 people in Atlantic Canada and Quebec had 
to apply for social welfare because the EI premiums were either 
very insignificant or none at all. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Madam Speaker, our number one goal in this 
country should be to eliminate poverty, a situation for which 
the federal government is responsible. This same government 
enjoys a $20 billion EI surplus that is the result of measures 
that, as I said earlier, were taken by the previous government, 
measures like the GST, free trade and tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should take corrective measures to fight 
poverty. Instead of apologizing, we must put more pressure on 
the government to inject additional funds into everything that 
impacts on poverty, including health care, social programs and, 
of course, employment insurance.

intentions of the member for Madawaska—Restigouche when putting 
forward this motion.

important changes this government has made in terms of the 
previous unemployment insurance legislation, in particular as 
related to what was called the short week issue.

under the guidance and the hard work of the member for 
Kenora—Rainy River in his previous capacity as parliamentary

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the earlier speeches concern me.  The acting leader of 
the fifth party said “There has to be compassion” and tried to 
leave the impression that the EI changes brought about by this 
government lacked compassion.  The hon. member is flatly wrong. 
In fact this motion highlights one of the better examples of how 
we have been flexible and innovative in reforming the old UI 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be useful to examine how the small weeks became an 
issue in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the old system of UI weekly benefits depended on earnings 
in the most recent 12 to 20 insurable week periods; that is, the 
weeks with more than 15 hours or $150 in earnings.  That was over 
the last year or 52 weeks.  Depending on the work patterns under 
the old UI system an individual's benefit could equal up to 146% 
of insured earnings from work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the original new EI legislation was to base 
benefits on earnings from work within a continuous period.  This 
design ensured that benefit levels were more reflective of the 
normal flow of earnings from employment and there was incentive 
to work even small weeks as every hour at work would count toward 
eligibility, duration and benefit level.  It was, however, seen 
as harshly impacting on individuals with gaps in their 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most illustrative examples of this happens on a 
potato farm where an individual works in the spring for an 
extended period of time, with long hours, for about six weeks. 
They have a fairly slack period during the summer months and then 
again have heavy employment in the fall during harvest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What clearly was happening was that an individual would be 
called back for a half day to grade potatoes for four hours.  As 
a result of coming back for those four hours of work, the gap 
created a short week, which created a very serious reduction in 
the individual's benefit level.  Certainly the individuals did 
not want to go to work with this serious impact.  The employers 
found themselves with the problem of getting workers to come in 
for the very short period of time.  That was not the intention of 
the EI act.  The intention was that every hour would count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the earlier gap issue, the legislation was 
amended to enable individuals to ignore up to 12 weeks of no 
earnings within a 26 week period when calculating their benefit 
levels. However, that improvement, ignoring weeks of no earnings, 
resulted in a disincentive to accept a small week.  That is, in 
some instances it was better to have a week of no earnings versus 
a small week with low earnings because it would have an impact on 
future benefit returns.  If a week with low earnings was included 
in earnings, the individual's average earnings and thus benefit 
level would fall and that worked against our stated purpose in 
terms of the employment insurance legislation of having every 
hour count.  Therefore, fixing the gaps issue created the small 
weeks issue which we then brought in the fix for.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased with the way we on this side of the House 
responded.  When the problem came to light, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development asked a group of Atlantic MPs, of which I 
happen to be one, to talk to Canadians and to find solutions.  We 
decided to pilot test a system whereby small weeks could be 
bundled together or where they could be excluded in the 
calculation of average weekly earnings in the determination of 
the EI benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the results have been encouraging.  About 130,000 
claimants have benefited from these pilot programs, including a 
high proportion of women.  Together their benefits have increased 
by about $19 per week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These projects are well received and effective.  However, they 
are slated to expire next month, which brings us to the following 
questions.  Do we extend the pilot projects?  If so, which 
project?  Do we extend the exclusion pilot which is in place in 
western Canada or do we extend the bundling project which is in 
place in eastern Canada?  The bottom line in both pilot projects 
is the same.  The benefit levels for EI participants are the same 
under both projects.  I can see how someone would want to make 
sure the program continues, especially when that program is 
delivering and being helpful, as has already been proven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to wait for the facts.  Once we have all the facts and 
we have sifted through the evidence we will all be in a better 
position to say whether or not these pilot projects have 
accomplished what they were intended to accomplish in the 
beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I come back to the question of whether there are 
so-called good intentions on the other side in terms of proposing 
this motion today.  From my position I say that this program is 
needed and it needs to be continued.  However, today may not be 
the day to make that decision.  There were a lot of changes in 
terms of the EI legislation.  There are other areas where there 
has been injury and there are other areas where there has been 
improvement.  We need to monitor all of those aspects.  We cannot 
just come to a quick, hasty fix.  We have seen the kinds of Tory 
fixes in the past under the old UI legislation.  When we came in 
we had to reconfigure, change and improve upon those quick fixes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take some time.  We need to be very careful and 
cautious.  We need to make sure the evidence is there in terms of 
what needs to be done, in terms of which program should be kept, 
how it should be done, and in terms of what other measures we 
should improve before we get into opening up the Employment 
Insurance Act.

had the pleasure of visiting the riding of the member for 
Malpeque, who is also Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans. His riding is similar to mine in many 
respects, with a rather high unemployment rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have his comments as the representative of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. A former BC Mine worker 
from my riding came to see me. 
During the period when he received EI benefits, he worked as a 
pallbearer at the funeral home, earning $22 each time. So he had 
10 small weeks with $22 in income, one with $44 in income since 
he did it twice that week, and another with $66 in income since 
he did it three times that week. When he applied for EI benefits 
for the second time, the department took the last 26 weeks with 
earnings, which meant 12 small weeks and 14 weeks when he was 
working as a miner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Louis-Philippe Roy, from Black Lake, earned $375 as a pallbearer, 
and his EI benefits were cut by $1,734. He lost $102 a week. 
Therefore, because this unemployed miner earned $375, he lost 
$1,359. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that Louis-Philippe Roy contributed, involuntarily of 
course, $1,359 to the $20 billion in accumulated surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the unemployment rate exceeds 10% in the riding of my 
distinguished colleague from Malpeque, small weeks can be 
adjusted into one single week, but this cannot be done in 
Thetford or in Black Lake because these communities are part of 
the greater Chaudière-Appalaches region, which includes the 
Beauce region where the unemployment rate is very low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to draw to the attention of the House the flagrant 
injustice of which Louis-Philippe Roy was a victim. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
question of the hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic.  However, I 
cannot on the floor of the House of Commons get into the 
specifics of an individual's case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His point illustrates why we need to take a little more time to 
look at this.  I think what he is suggesting is that the small 
weeks pilot applies to only 29 of the HRD regions for employment 
insurance.  The area he is talking about may be an area where the 
small weeks pilot does not apply.  If that is the case, then that 
is evidence to show how useful the small weeks pilot is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member that he bring the specifics of that case 
to the Parliamentary Secretary for Human Resources Development. 
Then we could look at it and use it as evidence in terms of this 
monitoring. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have the highest regard for the Parliamentary 
Secretary for Fisheries and Oceans who comes from the beautiful 
riding of Malpeque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, one of his comments greatly disturbs me.  Earlier today 
I presented to him an EI statement from somebody in Nova Scotia 
who got $25 a week EI, and if a person was married with children 
they got $31 a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to respond to the interim leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party who indicated that we must have 
compassion in our rules and changes.  Where is the compassion 
when somebody who has worked most of their life gets $25 a week 
or $31 a week?  Where is the compassion from the government 
there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Madam Speaker, again we are dealing 
with a specific case and we do not know all of the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did this individual and his family only manage to get two weeks 
of work last year?  Is the result that the divisor was 12 or 14? 
Is that the reason the employment insurance is so low?  I do not 
know because I do not have the full details of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell him that we are working in other areas.  The minister 
spoke very eloquently in his speeches about some of the other 
programs that we are working on.  It is not just an employment 
insurance pilot project situation that we are dealing with, it is 
the total situation in terms of job employment measures and 
labour market training.  Those areas we have to grapple with as 
well.  We on this side of the House will improve those areas so 
that these individuals will not find themselves in this kind of 
situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member for Malpeque gave us a great cross-section of the small 
weeks problem and how we are trying to resolve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During an earlier interchange the member for Saint John said 
that some people in the House need a history lesson with regard 
to their attitudes toward Atlantic Canada.  She was responding to a 
question of mine.  I was basically asking why the premier of 
Ontario was questioning whether that province should continue 
utilizing the employment insurance system to the extent that it 
does.  He has often pointed out that Ontario, cash flow wise, is 
a net loser through the employment insurance system. 
It is certainly not the feeling of the government or Liberal 
members, but it certainly was seemingly odd that the leader of 
the Progressive Conservative Party here was taking major 
exception to the premier of Ontario whose very view that is.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us understand the importance of underpinning our economy 
wherever it is, whether it is in Oshawa, Durham, the maritimes, 
Sydney and so forth.  These are very important aspects.  I was 
interested, because I thought the history lesson should be 
directed at Mike Harris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today says “in order to make adjustment 
projects a permanent feature of the Employment Insurance Act”. 
These pilot projects which are under way are to address the issue 
of small weeks. Most of us can see it is some kind of 
idiosyncrasy of the legislation that was written.  This happens 
in many things. I worked on another issue, the Canada-U.S. tax 
treaty.  It is amazing how many times things are written down 
with good intentions and when they actually get out in the public 
domain, they seem to have some unintended results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This appears to be one of those very areas where it is possible 
that we discourage people from seeking employment because they 
have less than full weeks of employment. The result is that it 
reduces the average.  Therefore in small ways they are better off 
not working at all than working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the intention of the EI reforms was to make it a major 
incentive to gain that extra hour of employment. That is what the 
average Canadian would like to do.  Rather than sit at home, he 
or she would like to be employed even if it is only part time, 
which is a positive thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to deal with this issue. However the 
order today simply talks about extending it, enshrining it. I am 
concerned about that because here in Ottawa we do not do enough 
program evaluation and accountability. These two projects, while 
they are coming to fruition and cycling out of the system, if you 
will, up until November 15, it is clear we have not had the time 
to sit down and actually evaluate what impacts those two 
solutions to the problem are having. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A theory among columnists and maybe even social engineers is 
that people are totally conscious about how government programs 
affect them economically and therefore they will always react in 
their best economic interests.  There is some concern that in 
fact that does not actually happen and it is really the intention 
of the government to ensure that those people continue to have 
the incentive to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well intentioned as the motion by the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche may be, I believe it is premature.  We 
have not had the time to evaluate that program. We have to go 
through that process before we consider any concept of extending 
it indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the EI reforms tried to encourage the productivity of 
the Canadian labour force.  This is something that is hard for 
people to measure.  Canada's productivity vis-à-vis many of our 
trading partners is significantly lower.  Some blame the 
unemployment insurance system; some blame other processes and 
some of our cultural differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that Canada's productivity has been increasing 
since this act has been changed.  It is on that issue which I 
think it is very important that we get it right and in such a way 
that we do the evaluation and our homework and we ensure that we 
continue to be on the right course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the minister has realized there is a problem. It is an 
unintended one.  Obviously we do not want people to sit at home 
rather than work.  Clearly there are some objectives we are 
trying to seek.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people look at the value of our dollar. Sometimes the value 
of our dollar is underpinned somewhat with the labour 
productivity factor.  If our labour productivity factor does not 
improve, the Canadian dollar will continue to go down. This is 
the way international currency equates productivity.  If we are 
less productive, it means that the value of our dollar is less 
vis-à-vis other currencies where the labour factors are more 
productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to that issue I think these reforms are attempting to 
address themselves.  It is why we have to make sure we get them 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within that legislation were a number of ingenious concepts. One 
was the new hires program which the minister mentioned this 
morning in his lead off debate. My riding of Durham has a 
tremendous impact from the automotive sector and others.  That 
program has been a great incentive for young people to get work 
experience because the first year of the employment insurance 
premiums are negated.  We talk about the great surplus and so 
forth but right there are some people who are not paying into the 
premium system and it is a major bonus.  By the way, it is small 
business week and we should be talking about that too. It is a 
great incentive for our small business community but it is also a 
great incentive for those young people to get some work 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also do the same thing in our summer youth employment 
program.  That is something which is taken advantage of by the 
young people in my riding to get that little bit of work 
experience so that they can access the labour market. I am sure 
most people in Durham and the rest of Canada want to work.  They 
want to find the up ramp to the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small weeks provision attempts to address the issue. The 
realization is that, although we are not sure, it may cause a 
disincentive for people to seek some employment rather than none 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the members, especially in the NDP, have raised the 
concern about the deviation between unemployment insurance 
reductions and tax cuts and why somehow these reductions should 
go back to the people who actually put the money into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Invariably tax cuts are assumed somehow to be benefits for the 
wealthy.  The reality is that our country has a problem, which 
has been raised by other members, called bracket creep. In fact, 
the people being hit by an inflationary spiral are in the lower 
and middle income brackets, the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be a policy of this government to take some of that 
surplus and direct it to people who make $20,000 or $40,000 worth 
of income.  I am talking about the working poor. Some of these 
people hit marginal rates of tax in excess of 50% or 60% by 
moving from $18,000 to $20,000 worth of income. What does that 
do?  It creates a barrier. People cannot get out of poverty. They 
cannot get out of that cycle of low income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would it not be a great thing to shift that surplus from 
corporations to some extent to assist those people by giving them 
back the indexing of the income tax system.  It would help them 
increase their disposable income. That is a lot more beneficial 
than some of the programs we talk about simply giving it back to 
the corporations which paid 60% of the employment insurance 
premiums in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as well intended as it may be, I believe this 
motion is premature.  The motion should be rejected because we 
need to do our homework before making any decisions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I was listening with great attention to the member for 
Durham.  I have a clarification on a reference he made to the 
member for Saint John.  I know there were little questions and 
responses between the two of them earlier in the day. I think I 
know what the member for Saint John was talking about in 
reference to Ontario and the premier of Ontario.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the premier of Ontario is rightly upset because 
Ontario's economy is very robust and we do not question that.  I 
understand that the member comes from an area where the economy 
is going along very nicely, thank you very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Ontario was concerned that not very many people 
in Ontario collect unemployment insurance in relation to the rest 
of the country.  Ontario constitutes about 40% of the Canadian 
economy.  It is the lowest area in the country for benefits in 
terms of unemployed workers receiving benefits.  The premier has 
a right to be concerned about that as they are paying in but not 
reaping the rewards.  It is not that they want to because 
obviously it is better to have people working than not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics speak for themselves.  I will quote statistics 
released by the Department of Human Resources Development about a 
week ago.  The statistics will bear this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario fewer than 30% of the unemployed get unemployment 
insurance, the lowest rate in the country. In comparing the 10 
provinces and 50 U.S. states, Ontario is between Montana and 
Missouri and just below the average for the United States as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of the point the member for Saint John was making 
and probably the member for Durham as well.  What we are looking 
at and the premier is saying is let us look at what we are doing 
with the surplus because the surplus does not exist.  Premier 
Harris is saying “You are taking more out of my workers and my 
employers than you have to”.  The federal government is applying 
that surplus in the EI account against general revenues.  It 
simply disappears.  There is no account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the EI surplus I would like to hear what the member 
for Durham has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, you cannot suck and 
blow at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that within the province of Ontario we have the 
same kinds of things.  There are certain areas in the province 
where there is high unemployment and there are net beneficiaries 
of the unemployment system.  In other areas, for instance in my 
own riding, General Motors says that it puts in a buck and gets 
60 cents back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of the matter is that as a country we are bigger than 
the province of Ontario.  The Progressive Conservative premier in 
the province of Ontario is clearly saying that we should amend 
the unemployment insurance system so we do not share that money 
with Atlantic Canada.  So the coffee is cooking.  Realize that 
for what he is saying.  The Progressive Conservative leader in 
the province of Ontario is saying to hell with you guys.  It is 
not something we believe in.  We believe this is a bigger country 
than the province of Ontario but that is not the viewpoint of the 
premier of Ontario.

Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Calgary Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to the supply day motion put forward by 
the fifth party in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the members preceding me have gone through the details 
of the program.  I would like to talk to a few points which cause 
our party some concern.  The first concern is that this program 
which is due to expire on November 15 of this year still is 
without any type of evaluation.  While the supply day motion may 
have some merit, I think it is quite premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member opposite talked about accountability.  I know 
members of the government tend to choke on that word but we will 
accept the fact that the member was sincere in his comments. 
The SW program is probably one of those programs that should be 
evaluated before we decide to make it a permanent fixture.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House would have been well served if the fifth party would 
have put forward a motion that tried to cure the illness rather 
than simply provide some medicine to look after the symptoms.  We 
should be demanding from the government that it create an 
environment in Atlantic Canada where people can actually go to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI programs are fine and the benefits are fine for those who 
are temporarily out of work, but must we always be focusing on 
benefit programs?  I believe the motion focuses on the wrong 
subject.  We should be talking about what it takes to create 
jobs. That should be what the government and all of us in the 
House are paying attention to and not benefits.  Let us get these 
people back to work again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are talking about Atlantic Canada let us talk about the 
failure of the government, the Tory government before it and the 
Liberal government before that, and how they sold out the 
interests of the Atlantic Canada fishermen.  Some years ago 
someone on this side of the House decided it would be a good idea 
to allow foreign boats to fish the waters off Atlantic Canada and 
reap the harvests.  There was a bountiful harvest back then 
sometimes.   They thought it would be a good idea to trade the 
interests of the Atlantic fishermen and Atlantic Canada in order 
for the provinces of Ontario and Quebec to sell manufactured 
goods in return to those European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone got shafted in that deal, and who was it?  It was the 
Atlantic provinces and the maritimes.  To boost the interests of 
Ontario and Quebec those governments simply sold Atlantic Canada 
down the tube by allowing this massive overfishing by foreign 
interests in order that they could sell manufactured goods from 
Ontario and Quebec in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a tragedy.  The results of that tragedy, of that insane 
decision, are still going on today.  That is why we are talking 
about how we provide benefits for Atlantic Canadians who have no 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus of the government should be jobs, jobs, jobs.  Jobs 
are created by allowing the private sector to operate in an 
environment that is conducive to establishing a buoyant economy. 
They should be provided with low tax levels.  There should be 
incentives for investors and business people to start new 
businesses and to expand their existing businesses.  There should 
be some tax relief for employees of those companies from the 
massive burden heaped upon them by these governments.  That would 
put more money in the hands of consumers which would allow them 
to spend the money within the economy and as a consumer driven 
economy it would grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus is wrong here.  We should be talking about the 
obligation of government to create an environment that would 
allow the economy to become more buoyant and that would allow 
more jobs to be created in Atlantic Canada.  That is where we 
should be focusing our attention.  We should not be trying to 
simply put a band-aid fix on a very serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are on the subject of employment insurance programs I 
must talk about the massive raids the Minister of Finance and the 
Liberal government are embarking on in relation to the current 
surplus in the EI program.  There will exist approximately $22 
billion in the EI surplus. 
I am not saying that money is there.  As a matter of fact there 
is nothing there but an IOU from our finance minister because he 
has already scooped it all.

enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister is about to pilfer that fund to the tune of 
about $7 billion simply because he wants the money.  He will 
change the law to get his hands on money that rightfully belongs 
to Canadian employers and employees.  If that money were turned 
back in the form of reduced EI premiums, as the EI commission has 
clearly said and as the finance minister's own actuary and 
advisors have clearly said, massive jobs would be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister is not hearing anything about that.  He 
wants to get his hands on that money, plain and simple, so that 
he can continue Liberal government overspending.  Incidentally 
the government overspent its spending budget by some $3 billion 
last year despite all the crowing it did about balancing the 
budget and maybe having a surplus.  In times like this that is 
atrocious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even worse is that most of that overspending went to 
build a millennium monument for our Prime Minister who will 
probably be gone after the year 2000.  He wants to leave behind 
this millennium project legacy which the government says will 
benefit post-secondary education.  Billions of dollars will be 
spent to benefit only about 5%, if that, of all post-secondary 
education students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister wants to scoop that $7 billion to make a 
legacy for his Prime Minister.  He wants to build an election 
slush fund leading up to the next election so he can miraculously 
open the dikes and let the cash flow out.  This is just a farce. 
I think members opposite realize what the finance minister is 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  As much as I enjoy listening to the member, it is my 
understanding that we are in 10 minute speeches and he is 
splitting his time with his colleague next door.  I am hoping 
that we could hear from his colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member still 
has 49 seconds left in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am sure the hon. member 
from the fifth party would love to hear me speak all day about 
how mismanaged the government is under the Liberals.  Eventually 
I would have to get to the performance of the Tory government 
that preceded it.  Probably I should wrap up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get back to my main point.  Although the motion may be an 
apple pie motion, it is premature.  The program has not been 
properly evaluated and that has to be done before we would 
consider supporting the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Since there is a lot 
of interest in asking questions I would ask that members 
co-operate and keep their questions and answers short.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, this will not 
take long.  The member should be congratulating us on foreign 
fishing.  Whereas it was 350,000 tonnes in the late 1970s, it is 
down to 2,000 tonne per year now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Prince—George Bulkley Valley has demonstrated 
that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  He must have been 
down there with the finance committee.  That is what it 
demonstrates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member suggesting that the EI fund should be used for tax 
reductions rather than for employment measures? 
Is that what he is suggesting?

terms of creation of jobs through the transitional job fund, the 
Canadian opportunities strategy, the youth employment strategy, 
new hires programs and others? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to respond 
to the hon. member across by reminding him that he knows very 
well the best possible employment measure we can take is to 
reduce the taxation burden on Canadian businesses and workers. 
That is how to build a buoyant economy.  That, contrary to what 
the Liberals say, is backed up by mountains and mountains of 
historical evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find that almost every country with a very reasonable tax 
regime has a buoyant economy.  We only have to look to the 
province of Ontario where the Premier of Ontario has reduced 
personal income taxes by 30%.  As a result, did Ontario bring in 
less taxes?  No.  Overall it brought in 10% more in taxes and the 
employers, the workers and everyone are far happier.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
when the Liberal government agreed to bundle small weeks to have 
more acceptable weeks, it agreed to do it in only 29 regions 
where the unemployment rates were the highest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the unemployment rate is 10.5% in one area and 9.4% in the 
neighbouring one, this does not mean poverty and hardship do not 
exist there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my distinguished colleague whether he would support 
a motion asking the government to extend the program to every 
region in Canada where small weeks could be bundled to have more 
acceptable weeks so that a former miner at the BC Mine, 
Louis-Philippe Roy, is not penalized for having been of service 
by acting as a pallbearer for the funeral parlour. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member raises an 
excellent point that I did not have time to mention in my 
presentation.  As a matter of fact what we have here is regional 
inequality.  If we are to give something to one part of the 
country, why on earth would we not give it to the rest of the 
family? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have 17% unemployment in my home town of Prince George.  We do 
not have access to a program like this one.   If this program 
after evaluation has been determined to have some merit, to give 
it to one section of the country, one small section only, is 
basically saying to the rest of the country that it just does not 
count. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has been doing this to Canada as long as 
it has been in power, as have the Tories before it.  It favours 
one part of the country over another.  It has fostered in the 
nation everything that has given rise to differences, to dividing 
the country through its policies.  It is about time the 
government started treating Canada like a family and treating 
everyone equally. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the remarks of my esteemed colleague and want to touch 
on a few key comments as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might cause some confusion for those who are listening to 
hear about small weeks, big weeks, and the difference between one 
week and another.  The motion deals with the unemployment 
insurance adjustment program which allows individuals who have 
worked only a portion of a week, perhaps part time or that kind 
of thing, to combine this work and apply it to their overall 
income to derive benefits from the EI plan. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT63"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT63"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1615

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the face of it there is some good rationale for that kind of 
initiative to encourage people to continue to work, even if it is 
only part time, and not be penalized by reduced benefits.  It 
sounds like a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what is a key element here is that the motion is perhaps 
premature today because we have spent $230 million on this 
program.  There has been a $230 million increase in expenses 
because of this change.  I guess the member opposite pointed out 
that this is a sign that the program is working.  This is clearly 
a program that is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to ask ourselves, now that we have spent $230 
million, is has that actually encouraged people to work as 
opposed to not working and collecting a higher premium when it 
comes to the part time or short week type of work?  Has it 
actually achieved the result of encouraging people to take on 
this part time or seasonal work?  We do not have the answers to 
those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fundamental issue that is at play.  I want to speak to 
this today because I see so many of the initiatives that are 
taken by governments, the government across the way in 
particular, and governments right across the land where there is 
no evaluation.  I mean a third party evaluation, not an 
evaluation done by the government itself.  Those kinds of 
evaluations are subject to political bias and possibly moving 
dollars in the way that will derive votes and support.  I do not 
like to make those kinds of accusations, but I have seen enough 
to make me skeptical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that there has been absolutely no evaluation.  I 
came from a business background and if we were to spend $230 
million on anything along the way there would be assessments.  Is 
this actually reaching the target?  Are we encouraging people to 
continue to work?  Are we achieving our goals?  If not, shut it 
down and come up with something better.  If we are, try to find 
ways to score more toward the goal to derive more benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have today?  We have a motion that says “Keep it 
going.  Keep spending the money.  Somebody is collecting the 
money, therefore, it must be working”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fundamental problem with the Liberal government in the 
way it approaches these types of issues.  We have an auditor 
general who evaluates the government and I have read many of his 
recommendations.  I think he often makes some very good 
recommendations that point out shortcomings.  A third party 
evaluation of the money spent.  Unfortunately it does not seem 
that the Liberal government acts on too many of the auditor 
general's recommendations.  If it does it is very slow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key thing is that we must have some assessment of whether or 
not these tax dollars are actually deriving the stated benefit. 
If in fact they are, then perhaps we can improve on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague said, why just Atlantic Canada?  Why not 
other parts of Canada?  In my own riding there are people who are 
unemployed.  Do they have any less trauma by being unemployed or 
any less of a challenge in making it day to day than someone in 
Atlantic Canada?  I would say not.  Why do they not have access 
to it if in fact it is working? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another benefit of evaluation is that we might come up with some 
better ideas, for Atlantic Canada particularly.  In this day and 
age, with the information age, there are many new challenges in 
gaining new skills and that $230 million could retrain 23,000 
workers at $10,000 a worker.  There are a lot of potential 
abilities and a lot of new markets that those people could move 
into.  If it was set up as a loan program we could benefit three 
to four times that many people with new training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not question these things when we do not properly evaluate 
these programs.  Someone is collecting.  Just keep it rolling. 
There is no accountability at the end of the day with respect to 
where those tax dollars are going.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But again, is this so unusual?  Tragically no.  The government 
has treated the EI fund, basically, I am afraid to say, as a cash 
cow.  It is not really being treated as a benefit program for 
workers.  We have accumulated a $19 billion surplus.  It is 
accumulating at $7 billion a year.  There is room for a 33% 
reduction in the premiums that workers and employers pay and we 
would still have some left over for that rainy day.  Yet we do 
not see it happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my riding the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices 
Association.  Those people lobby me and talk to me on a regular 
basis.  I have many restaurant owners in my riding and they have 
continually come to me and said “Please put pressure on the 
finance minister to roll back the EI premiums that we are forced 
to pay”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an industry that employs many young people.  It is their 
first step into the workplace.  This group of small business 
people point out to me that this is the worst thing that the 
finance minister can do.  We all applaud and praise small 
business as the engine of the economy, yet we skewer them with 
higher taxes, particularly payroll taxes.  These payroll taxes 
must be rolled back, but we are not seeing that and I think it is 
tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are issues that I believe are even more important than the 
one we are debating today.  It surprised me that this was 
actually the motion the Progressive Conservative Party felt 
needed to be debated here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it likely that we would actually see the Liberal Party roll 
back these EI payroll taxes?  I would suggest that it is not.  I 
would point to the budget debate last spring when the Liberals 
said that they wanted to spend any surplus.  The official 
opposition at the time proposed broad based tax relief for 
Atlantic Canadians totalling over $900 per year.  That is really 
what is needed.  We do not need more in the way of strengthened 
social programs.  People get self-esteem and fulfilment from a 
job and we should be working toward providing jobs to Atlantic 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not the only one saying this.  Let me quote Fred McMahon, a 
senior policy analyst with the Atlantic Institute for Market 
Studies.  He says that the EI merry-go-round seems like a good 
idea for Atlantic Canada, but it is often not working.  He goes 
on to say that the EI system has undermined Atlantic Canada's 
growth prospects.  It has marginalized thousands of workers and 
even helped destroy our fish.  Now, this is not me, this is Fred 
McMahon, senior policy analyst with the Atlantic Institute for 
Market Studies.  It has not been good for Atlantic Canada by any 
measure.  These are people who have studied the situation and 
they are saying that this is not the way to go in the best 
interests of Atlantic Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out again that if we had followed the reducing taxes and 
paying down debt approach in Atlantic Canada long advocated by 
the Reform Party as opposed to holding on to these high payroll 
taxes through the employment insurance program, if we had gone 
instead with our proposals, we would see a grand total of over $1 
billion a year in the pockets of long suffering Atlantic 
taxpayers, money which could be spent and invested not by 
bureaucrats and politicians but by Atlantic Canadians themselves 
to improve their own lives and future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
know that across this country we have a lot of different 
interests and a lot of different concerns.  However, it amazes me 
sometimes that some of us in one area of the country can become 
such experts on someplace else.  It is one of the facts in the 
House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the hon. member.  I appreciate his 
sincerity in trying to deal with these issues.  As with the 
previous speaker, I support the concept that we have of 
attempting to put together what I call small weeks or grouping of 
hours in areas of high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada, in particular, we have a good number of 
industries that rely upon workers for very short periods of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was home during Thanksgiving week and it rained every day of 
that week.  Fishing boats go out to sea, but sometimes they 
cannot harvest fish every day of the week.  If we want our fish 
factories and our smaller firms to work in Atlantic Canada we 
have to provide an opportunity for people to put their hours 
together to constitute weeks for unemployment insurance purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware of this problem and the concerns that we 
have?  I point out to him that it was not the workers who came to 
us in the Atlantic caucus asking for small weeks or days to be 
put together, rather it was the industries in Atlantic Canada 
that were having difficulty providing 40 hours of employment for 
<I>X</I> number of weeks for their workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he could relate to the House his concept of this problem 
and how he and his party would deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
question.  We should all be aware that we are all Canadians from 
one side of the country to the other.  The approach of saying 
that what works in one part of the country will not work in 
another is what underlies a lot of the policies of the Liberal 
government that have caused division in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members that there is seasonal work in my province. 
There is seasonal work in my riding.  The people who experience 
seasonal work have the same challenges, the same problems, the 
same concerns as people in Atlantic Canada.  To say that the 
Canadian in Atlantic Canada who is in this situation is different 
than the Canadian in Calgary who feels that same set of 
challenges works against the whole coming together of Canada and 
making a stronger nation.  I think the premise of his question is 
incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the short weeks program is concerned, we have stated 
that it sounds like a good idea.  It could be beneficial.  We are 
not necessarily against it.  What we are against is extending 
additional dollars to a program that has not been thoroughly 
evaluated to see if it is actually encouraging people to get out 
and work and to work part time as opposed to staying off EI 
benefits.  That is the crux of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian in Calgary, in our estimation, is no different from a 
Canadian in the Atlantic provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is interesting to hear Reform members stand to quote 
their friends in the right wing sectors of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the hon. member that the finance minister went to 
Halifax after the recent EI cuts of last year and asked the 
chamber of commerce a direct question:  “If I reduce the 
premiums by another 20%, how many jobs would you create?”  He 
asked the entire chamber of commerce that question at its 
luncheon meeting. Nobody could give an answer.  There was no 
answer.  Nobody could stand to say that they would create a job 
tomorrow if he reduced EI premiums.  Not one.  That was the 
finance minister asking the chamber of commerce that question. 
The hon. member mentioned Fred McMahon.  He was also there for 
that meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party really wants to cut taxes it should start 
working on cutting the GST and the HST in this country.  Then we 
will have a serious tax cut that will help to create jobs right 
across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther:</B>  Madam Speaker, I point out to the hon. 
member that a number of studies have been done which show that a 
1% reduction in payroll taxes in this country will create 
thousands of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that he would note the fact that the people 
this question was put to said they were not sure how many jobs it 
would create.  However, study after study shows that if we reduce 
payroll taxes people hire more people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my 
time with a colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche would like the 
government to make the small weeks pilot projects a permanent 
feature of the employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like some of my colleagues on this side of the House, I greatly 
appreciate this salutary debate on the employment insurance 
system, but I must stress that these projects are, as their name 
shows, pilot projects. They were established in March 1997 to 
test other means of calculating EI benefits for a period ending 
November 15 of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it set up the employment insurance system in 1996, 
undertaking the first major reform of the unemployment insurance 
program in 25 years, the government knew full well that it was 
facing a very complicated situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adjustment pilot projects were launched precisely to determine 
how to solve the problems faced by workers earning less than 
$150 a week. These adjustment projects were implemented in 29 
Canadian regions where the unemployment rate consistently 
exceeded 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures were taken because some thought that the new 
legislation was dissuading people from taking part time jobs. 
Some workers thought a week without income was better than a 
week with a small income that would reduce their EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government's general objective is to put unemployed 
Canadians back to work, pilot projects were created to examine 
possible solutions to this problem. Two methods of calculating 
benefits were tested. The first one was to bundle small weeks 
and the second one, to exclude them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were two different ways of solving the problem of reduced 
work weeks in high unemployment regions. But both methods had 
the same positive results for employment insurance recipients. 
It was a matter of methodology, as one can except with pilot 
projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada wanted to see which calculation method 
would work best and to determine the impact of pilot projects in 
general. It is important to remember this. 
The purpose of the pilot projects was to find solutions and to 
determine what would work best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What were the results of these pilot projects? Since their 
implementation in May and August of 1997, 130,000 benefit 
periods have been established for small work weeks. Almost 12% 
of benefit claims submitted in participating regions involved 
small weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important is that the people participating in the 
projects received benefits averaging $19 or about 10% more per 
week. I must specify that this group of recipients included more 
women—about 61%—than men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, since these projects were implemented in high unemployment 
regions, more than 51% of applications came from Quebec and 35% 
from the Atlantic provinces. 
Overall, these preliminary results are encouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these are preliminary—and I insist on this 
word—preliminary results, and the analysis has not been 
completed. After all, that is what pilot projects are for: to 
provide information that will serve as a basis for the 
development of long term policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the hon. member likes it or not, policies cannot, and 
should not, be developed without due consideration. The 
government must thoroughly review the results before taking 
action. To do otherwise would be to act hastily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House of the Parliament of Canada know how essential 
the employment insurance system is to the social fabric of this 
country. That is why small weeks projects must be put in the 
appropriate context. 
In establishing a new employment insurance system, the 
Government of Canada wanted to introduce an hour based system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, it wanted to encourage Canadians to accept the 
work that was available.  To all appearances, that is exactly 
what the new employment insurance program has enabled it to do. 
As the pilot programs have shown, the government is fully 
prepared to listen and to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, this reform is the broadest in a quarter of a 
century.  That is why the government is prepared to examine the 
effects of the reform, and to make the necessary changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this debate, much reference has been made to the 
beneficiaries to unemployed ratio. 
I must start off by pointing out that the beneficiaries to 
unemployed ratio was never established to measure the proportion 
of unemployed workers receiving employment insurance, and also 
more importantly that the it does not have a great deal to say 
about how effective the employment insurance program is at 
attaining its objectives.  Why? Because the program is not 
intended to pay benefits to unemployed persons with tenuous or 
non-existent links to the labour market, or those who have left 
their jobs without justification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance program applies to 78% of Canadians 
with links to the labour market who have lost their jobs or 
resigned for valid reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And although we have made great strides in the area of 
employment insurance, we should recognize that the plan cannot 
meet the needs of all unemployed Canadians.  Everyone must 
realize that employment insurance is only part of the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other government measures are required and are in the process of 
implementation: measures to help people with disabilities, 
including a $30 million employability assistance fund over three 
years to help them find work; the aboriginal human resources 
development strategy, spread over five years and supported by a 
board headed by the private sector aimed at improving native 
people's access to employment; the youth employment strategy to 
help young people, including those at risk, to make a successful 
transition from school to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we set up the Canadian opportunities strategy to ensure 
that all Canadians have greater access to education and to the 
skills that will enable them to find and keep a better job. 
Nevertheless, the government does not have all the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns of the unemployed must become the concerns of all 
of us in the federal and provincial governments and in the 
private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must work together to find solutions.  We must also not lose 
sight of the problems the employment insurance program was 
established to attack.  It is not enough to make the plan more 
flexible in order to resolve the problems.  That is not a 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the situation is complex and will not be 
resolved with simple solutions. 
That having been said, we must continue to assess how Canadians 
and our economy are adjusting to the new EI regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, the economic picture is improving in Canada.  We 
are achieving some success in our efforts to lower the country's 
unemployment rate.  In September, the unemployment rate was 
8.3%, the lowest it has been in eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen a 10.3% increase in the number of young people 
with jobs since the beginning of the year.  The number of jobs 
has increased by a total of 1.3 million since October 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, we are making headway.  Together, we can attain our 
common goal of helping Canadians rejoin the workforce.  As the 
statistics so clearly show, that is exactly what we are in the 
process of doing.

They apparently do not want to move too quickly because we are 
living in one of the best countries in the world.

the new reform turned out to be unfair.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are making it up as they go along.  They are 
stalling for time on this issue.  Why?  Because there is a $20 
billion surplus in the EI fund and it has come out of the 
pockets of unemployed Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague opposite to get moving.  Money is being 
slowly siphoned out of the pockets of the unemployed to plump up 
the EI fund while this government is no longer contributing 
anything at all.  This is affecting employees and employers. 
The Bloc Quebecois has introduced six bills to improve the 
system. We have to stop worrying. We are only too aware of the 
system's impact. 
In fact, we have asjed the committee to give priority to the 
whole issue of the impact of EI reform, but the government is 
not interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
her question. I clearly remember that when we were elected in 
1993, the unemployment rate—as I like to point out—was close 
to 12%. The Minister of Finance and the government put in place 
certain tax policies, with the result that the national 
unemployment rate is now at 8.3%, if I am not mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that even in Quebec, in spite of the terrible threat 
of separation that hangs over our heads, the unemployment rate 
has also gone down. I believe it is now around 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the first to admit that there is work to do, but I am 
convinced that in a few months, when a new government is in 
office in Quebec, that rate will continue to go down. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
remind my distinguished colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of National Defence, that the pilot project is 
currently being tried out in only 29 regions. The poverty to 
which we often allude in this House does not exist only in these 
29 regions of Canada. In my riding, for example, the government 
refused to recognize the region of Thetford Mines, using the 
pretext that it was part of a very large region, Region No. 13, 
Chaudière—Appalaches, and also part of the Estrie region, where 
the unemployment rate is artificially lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary whether an unfair practice is 
being used to penalize certain regions where the unemployment 
rate is high, but which have a lower unemployment rate when 
taken together. There is a reason why, within a period of four 
years, EI contributions have allowed the government to 
accumulate a surplus of $20 billion. 
If there is a $20 billion surplus, it is because there are 
people who make EI contributions, but who do not collect 
benefits. It is somewhat like being insured against fire, having 
your house burn down, and being told “You did pay premiums, but 
you were not covered, so you should have avoided that 
situation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not very bright on the government's part to make the poor 
even poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand:</B> Madam Speaker, as I said in my speech, 
these are only pilot projects, and the government will make 
adjustments according to their results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would like to point out that I do not entirely 
agree with the numbers referred to by my honourable colleague. 
According to the numbers I have, 80% of applicants receive 
benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in 
this important debate on the motion brought forward by the hon. 
member for Madawaska—Restigouche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Human Resources Development and other 
colleagues have already noted, the government is assessing the 
viability of the small weeks concept and we are closer to making 
a decision on how these projects can best serve the employment 
needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to stress that employment insurance is the most 
comprehensive reform of income support in 25 years.  It should be 
quite evident that a reform of this magnitude would require 
certain adjustments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have also expressed concern regarding the 
benefits to unemployment ratio, commonly referred to as the BU 
ratio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard the government has conducted a study on the BU 
ratio.  The study indicated that the ratio was not a good 
indicator of how well the employment insurance system is doing. 
The problem is that the ratio does not distinguish between those 
workers for whom the program was designed and those for whom the 
program was never intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the study showed is that the decline in BU ratio over the 
past 10 years is the result of a 50:50 split between the changes 
to the employment insurance program and changes in the labour 
market. The study showed 78% of unemployed workers who lost their 
jobs or quit with just cause were eligible for EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that the purpose of EI is to provide 
temporary benefits to unemployed Canadians who have an attachment 
to the labour force.  In that regard, the evidence strongly 
suggests that EI is meeting its objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not forgotten the Canadians who do not qualify for 
income benefits under the new EI system.  We are addressing the 
needs of those individuals through a number of EI related 
initiatives.  I am thinking of initiatives such as the active 
employment measures under EI, the transitional jobs fund, the 
youth employment strategy, the Canadian opportunities strategy 
and the new hires program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time let us be realistic.  EI alone will not be able 
to address the needs of all unemployed Canadians.  EI is not a 
panacea. It is simply one of several tools that Canadian workers 
can use to help return to the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members opposite are aware, the EI act calls for five annual 
monitoring and assessment reports to determine how well 
individuals and communities are adjusting to the new system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 report is the first, and naturally it gives us a 
general indication of the impact EI is having. This is to be 
expected with a new system as it encounters the real needs of 
Canadians. We know, for example, that some people are finding 
extra weeks of work before applying for unemployment insurance. 
It is terrific to see that in areas with strong economic growth 
people are finding jobs rather than having to apply for EI 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of jobs, over the past five years 1.3 million Canadians 
have found employment.  The International Monetary Fund and the 
OECD predict that this year Canada's job growth rate will be the 
fastest among the major industrialized nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we acknowledge that the unemployment rate remains a 
challenge, although it is now at the lowest level in eight years, 
no one can say we are not making progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the real measure of success for this new income support 
system, fewer unemployed, not more EI beneficiaries.  The goal 
after all is to help unemployed Canadians get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that monitoring and assessment reports 
are a crucial part of EI reform.  It is important to inform 
Canadians on the impact that reform of the income support system 
is having on individuals and their communities. Given its 
magnitude and the limited time the EI system has been in place, I 
believe this first of five annual reports indicates that we are 
moving in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said EI cannot be expected to address the needs of all 
unemployed Canadians.  That is why we have other measures that I 
have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is inclusive.  We are committed to helping Canadians 
move into the economic mainstream and become self-reliant, 
contributing members of their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure hon. members will agree that nothing fights poverty 
better than a rewarding job.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the thrust behind the transitional jobs fund which has 
helped to create 31,000 jobs in high unemployment regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the family income supplement which helps low income 
EI claimants with children.  We have contributed $190 million to 
a new federal-provincial initiative that helps people with 
disabilities to gain better access to the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we have taken steps that directly address child 
poverty. We increased the Canada child tax benefit by $850 
million in July and we will further increase it by another $850 
million in the next two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initial investments which will benefit low income families 
will increase our total investment for children to about $6.8 
billion by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche that 
Canadians told us in no uncertain terms that the old unemployment 
insurance system was out of date and badly in need of reform.  It 
was a passive system that did not encourage unemployed workers to 
return to the labour force.  EI on the other hand encourages 
workers to take all available work before applying for funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to return to the days where the UI system was 
regularly used to supplement incomes.  The government is 
monitoring the system carefully.  I encourage members opposite to 
join with us in helping Canadians find work.  For these reasons I 
cannot vote in favour of the hon. member's motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member and the speaker before him spoke of job 
creation.  I would much rather be talking about that today. The 
way to create jobs in Canada is to reduce taxes.  Until that is 
done, there are regions in Canada, not only Atlantic Canada, 
which are affected.  What do we do with these people, these 
regions?  This pilot project helps them considerably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about fiscal measures that have been put 
in place.  I would like the hon. member to please tell this House 
what measures they put in place. Was it the GST?  Was it free 
trade?  Was it the cut to transfer payments?  Was it the cuts to 
unemployment that affected these people we are talking about 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this member not think that the measures put in place after 
the reform to employment insurance helped these 29 regions 
throughout Canada?  Does the member not think the government 
should have a measure in place today, that the study should be in 
place three weeks before the deadline, and that the pilot project 
be renewed immediately? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his intervention.  Does the member not think it is 
worthwhile that the active measures are far more effective for EI 
than giving supplementary income and keeping people on the 
margin, not getting trained for a new job? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think the transitional jobs fund is not 
worthwhile by helping people get training so they can upgrade 
themselves for jobs that are available?  Does the member not 
think these employment strategies are good strategies for these 
people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  They are not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  How do you know? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Why is the employment rate so high? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  We are leading all the OECD 
countries at the moment in job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Not all regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  I agree with the member.  It is 
spotty. There is no doubt about it.  We have to target those 
regions. The member is right on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy and the new hires program 
are positive initiatives.  This is the first year through. We 
have seen it.  There are problems.  We admit that.  We have to 
address them.  I agree with the member that one of the best ways 
is to cut taxes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member mentioned that Canada is leading the G-7 in job 
creation but I wonder if the hon. member is aware that in 1986 
Canada and the U.S. were tied in terms of the employment rate at 
approximately 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 12 years in the United States the employment rate 
has grown to 63%.  Our employment rate has stayed at 60%.  If 
they had stayed at the same level we would have over one million 
more jobs in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member his statistics do not tell the whole 
story.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that if Canada were creating jobs at the same pace as 
the United States we would have virtually no unemployment today. 
While I understand why the member wants to pat himself on the 
back, it is not as clear cut as he suggests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How in the world can he justify getting up in this place today 
and saying we are not going to support the motion because we do 
not have our study done?  His party is putting together the 
study.  Three weeks away from the time when the program comes to 
and end it still does not have an assessment. How can that 
happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson:</B>  Madam Speaker, just to put the 
record straight, the International Monetary Fund and the OECD 
have predicted that Canada will lead the job growth rate in the 
industrialized nations.  We will see it this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans are by far the best off of the industrialized 
countries at the moment.  There is no doubt about that.  We are 
not trying to oversell that. At the same time if they are 
predicting right, we are catching up because we will be leading 
this year in job creation.

<P><A NAME="LINK275"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
share my time with my colleague, the member for Rosemont. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with a great deal of interest that I take part in the 
debate on the motion moved by the member of the Conservative 
Party asking the government to amend the Employment Insurance 
Act in order to permanently extend the small weeks adjustment 
projects put in place by the Minister for Human Resources 
Development in March 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know such pilot projects are being tried out in 29 
regions. We also know that they will come to an end on November 
15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the Conservative Party's motion. 
However, if it had been possible, we would have liked to move an 
amendment asking the government to make the pilot projects a 
permanent feature in the 54 EI administrative areas, and to 
address the unfairness in the current Employment Insurance Act, 
which promotes increased poverty and deprives millions of people 
from the benefits of economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that a great many people who are not eligible to EI end 
up too quickly on welfare. Last December, the Bloc Quebecois 
introduced six bills aimed at improving the lean program the 
employment insurance system has become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-296, introduced by the Bloc Quebecois, dealt among other 
things with small weeks, and was aimed at extending them to 
every region. 
We know that the level of benefits should be determined based on 
the average of the weeks with the highest earnings, rather than 
on all the weeks worked, including the small weeks, as is 
currently done in the 25 areas where the pilot projects are not 
being tried out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to this formula, the cheques for some of the unemployed 
would not be greatly reduced and those who work very few hours a 
week would not be penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a concrete example. A lady who teaches 
adults has a 26 week contract, 35 hours a week at $25 an hour. 
At the end of her contract, she signs a new one for six weeks at 
the same hourly rate, but for only three hours a week. What 
would happen? I will show how this lady is penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current legislation, in an area where there is no 
pilot project, this lady would be entitled to $327 a week, 
because the last 26 weeks are taken into account, including the 
six weeks at only three hours a week. So, she is penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the plan put forward by the Bloc Quebecois in Bill C-296, 
this lady would have been entitled to $413 a week, because the 
small weeks would not have been taken into consideration. Before 
the 1996 reform, that teacher would have got $448 a week, again 
because the small weeks did not come into play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the Bloc Quebecois has come up with a balanced 
solution between the reformed EI system as we know it now and 
what the old system provided in terms of EI benefits. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previously, maximum insurable earnings were $815 a week, 
instead of $750, as is the case today. With the small week pilot 
project, a person can receive $406 a week, in the same 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Employment Insurance Act will thus penalize this 
person by $121 a week compared to 1996 levels, by $35 a week 
compared to the Bloc's proposal and by $42 compared to the 
Conservative Party's proposal. This illustrates once again that 
the Bloc Quebecois' approach is balanced, fair and equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are a number of other unfair aspects in the 
current Employment Insurance Act and the Bloc has condemned 
several of them since the reform. 
One of these aspects is the immediate elimination of 
discrimination against some categories of unemployed on the 
basis of their so-called presence in the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that a woman who has taken care of her child from birth 
to age two and who goes back to work will have to work 30% to 
117% more hours to be eligible for the same benefits as regular 
claimants. It depends on the regional unemployment rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister says that the reform is helping women and 
young people, we can see, with figures to back us up—because we 
also have figures—that women who stay at home more than two 
years are considered as new entrants in the workforce and have 
to work 910 hours, according to the regional rate of 
unemployment, while a regular claimant will have to work between 
420 and 700 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is what the Minister of Human Resources Development 
means by adjustment to labour market realities, he is on the 
wrong track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other situations that are just absurd. For example, in 
the same region, a woman who worked 420 hours is eligible for EI 
benefits whereas if she were pregnant, she would have to work 
700 hours. Before the reform, a woman had to work 300 hours to 
be eligible for maternity benefits, and now she has to work 700 
hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some say that this reform helps women, but, on the contrary, I 
say it does not encourage women to leave their jobs, take care 
of their children for two years and then go back to work. 
Knowing how difficult it often is to re-enter the work force, a 
woman will certainly think twice before leaving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI fund surplus is another irritant. 
The government is always carrying out studies.  I just heard a 
colleague from the government side say that things must not be 
rushed, but by not rushing, billions of dollars are being 
accumulated in the employment insurance fund, at the rate of $6 
billion a year, when we know very well that the government is no 
longer putting a cent into the fund and that it comes from the 
pockets of the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois has called for a separate fund, 
one that is administered outside the control of the Minister of 
Human Resources Development.  The auditor general is very clear 
on this.  He says it would not be legal to use contributions for 
any purpose other than the one set out in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do?  It puts the money into the 
consolidated revenue fund, and we know now that those $20 
billion are more or less virtual money. 
While they are talking about their compassion for the 
unemployed, they are busy piling up the money and carrying out a 
reform that tightens up eligibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister is not saying is that fewer and fewer people 
who contribute qualify for benefits.  Now, 38% of contributors 
have access.  Since the Liberals came along, eligibility has 
eroded, and fewer and fewer people are eligible for benefits.

people in need, with seemingly no concern for what happens to 
them.  Today, we agree with the small weeks.  The pilot project 
put in place in a mad panic by this party because no thought was 
given to the impacts the reform would have on people.  This 
pilot project was inaugurated in a mad panic because too many 
people could not qualify for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want all regions to have access to this, because it is not

because some people are suffering now. We told the government 
there was a problem with the act as such. This is very clear. I 
remember very well phoning Liberal ministers and telling them 
that one hour would be equal to one insurable week. They told me 
“No, do not worry, it is not what you think”. When the act was 
implemented, some employers phoned us to ask what was going on. 
We are hurting our workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to have a government that purposely caused such 
problems to people who are laid off through no fault of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my New Democratic 
Party colleague for her remarks.  Earlier, I heard a Liberal 
member tell us that the government cannot meet all the needs. 
But, with $20 billion in the EI fund, a fund that does not 
belong to us, and only 38% of those who pay premiums qualifying, 
my thought is that this government does not want to take action 
because it suits it not to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no change in the reform.  The matter is being 
studied.  We know very well that this reform is having a 
catastrophic impact on the unemployed.  Several thousands of 
people are on welfare.  Again, the provinces must pick up the 
pieces because, in addition to not contributing to the EI fund, 
the federal government is preventing even more people from 
qualifying.  This reform is unfair and the eligibility criteria 
are too restrictive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We introduced six bills to improve the system and strike some 
sort of balance between the previous and present situations. 
The government is stalling, with answers about how things were 
before the reform, precisely so that it can rack up billions of 
dollars on the backs of the unemployed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank the member for Quebec for her very interesting comments 
and for her work on this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to remind us of the adverse effects that the EI 
reform has had on women. I would like her to repeat the example 
she gave a few moments ago and explain to us how pregnant women 
have been adversely affected by the reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like her to tell us what the Bloc Quebecois thinks 
should be done with the EI fund surplus, why that money, which 
does not belong to the government, should be returned to the 
workers and the employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation has been strongly criticized throughout Quebec 
and Canada. 
By amending the Employment Insurance Act in order to use the EI 
fund surplus for other purposes instead of reinvesting it to 
lighten the workers' heavy financial burden, the government is 
practically stealing that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to comment on that so we can better 
understand the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I would need half an hour 
to answer my hon. colleague. What I can say is that, while the 
minister's objective is to encourage people to get back to work, 
that is not what we are seeing in real life. Including small 
weeks in the calculation of benefits discourages people from 
going back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague suggested that women, for instance, be encouraged 
to stay at home to raise their kids for two years because they 
need 30% to 117% more hours to return to the labour force. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is never 
easy to speak after hearing remarks as eloquent as the ones made 
by my colleague from Quebec. I will nevertheless try to clarify 
the motion before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise to speak on the important issue of 
employment insurance reform. For more than two years, we have 
been questioning the Minister of Human Resources Development 
about the steady decline in the number of unemployed workers who 
qualify for EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this time the minister claims to be concerned by this tragic 
situation, but does not do a thing to change it. Once again, the 
minister is full of good intentions, but does not act on them. 
It is always the same thing on the government side: all talk and 
very little action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, this government is trying to divert—and that is a 
rather strong word—the $7 billion it has taken—not to say 
“stolen”, for I do not want to use unparliamentary language, 
although the choice of words is still important—from workers 
and employers to spend as it pleases. This money does not belong 
to the government but to Canadian workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Quebec said very eloquently a moment ago, 
the motion before us today concerns specifically an urgently 
needed amendment to the employment insurance plan.  It must be 
recalled that this motion by the Conservative Party reads as 
follows: “That, in the opinion of this House, the government 
should continue with the Employment Insurance Small Weeks 
Adjustment Projects and amend the legislation in order to make 
the adjustment projects a permanent feature of the Employment 
Insurance Act.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues have already said, we in the Bloc Quebecois 
support this motion.  We have in fact been calling for 
essentially the same thing for quite some time.  My colleague 
has said that a number of bills have been introduced on this 
side of the House, but, unfortunately, the government has 
repeatedly ignored them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December, we introduced Bill C-296, one of whose clauses 
provided a method for resolving the problem of the small weeks. 
Unfortunately, once again, the government has refused to deal 
with it.  The opposition has therefore been obliged to use an 
opposition day.  Yet again, the government is rejecting both the 
recommendations of the Conservative Party and Bill C-296, which 
the minister should frequently refer to.  The Liberal government 
must pass this amendment as quickly as possible in order to 
repair one of the many inequities it has caused with its reform.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first explain what the small weeks adjustment projects 
are.  Then I will explain why it is vital to make these pilot 
projects into a standard that will be universally applied. 
Finally, I will explain how the government is trying to hide 
behind a commissioned analysis in order to justify its inaction 
in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, the Employment Insurance Act includes a new method 
for calculating benefits, which penalizes claimants by 
calculating a lower benefit amount.  This method also 
discourages people from working who might otherwise be working a 
limited number of hours and weeks. 
This problem particularly affects high unemployment areas and 
some categories of workers, mainly the young and the women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe however that this motion is not explicit enough, 
since it does not specify if the areas involved would only be 
those where pilot projects are currently under way or all the 
areas in Canada. Under the current EI system, only 21 
administrative regions out of 54 are affected by the lumping or 
exclusion of the small weeks. We are convinced that the new 
formula, whether it be the lumping or the exclusion of the small 
weeks, should apply throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But first, I want to say that the government must act quickly 
because the small weeks pilot projects are coming to an end on 
November 15. As we all know, the purpose of these projects was 
to reduce some of the disincentives and devastating effects of 
the Employment Insurance Act. 
In fact, the new legislation unfairly penalizes those who agree 
to work small weeks, where they earn less than $150. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is also important to mention, because it not only 
affects the formula, that these projects were to pacify the 
employers who were complaining about being unable to find 
employees ready to work small weeks. So, for some time now, some 
workers have agreed to work small weeks, because they thought 
the program would be renewed. The minister has to set things 
straight right away and tell us what he intends to do with these 
projects. If not, he would be penalizing these workers whom he 
has kept in the dark, without telling them what he was going to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House where this program to reduce the effects 
of the federal government's drastic cuts in the EI program comes 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 5, 1997, barely two months after the coming into force 
of his new program, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
had to announce adjustment projects to mollify employers and 
workers in areas where unemployment rates were very high, 
including eastern Quebec and the maritimes. This admission of 
failure was the sign of his lack of vision and understanding of 
the impacts of a reform crafted mainly to save billions of 
dollars at the expense of the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main problem, already mentioned by the Bloc Quebecois, is 
the disincentive to work. A worker who accepts to work a few 
hours a week for a while, combining small and big workweeks, 
will probably be penalized financially the next time he puts in 
a claim. This is due to the new way benefits are calculated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose a worker in eastern Quebec works 20 big weeks at $450 a 
week, and six small weeks at $60, for a total of 26 weeks and an 
income of $9,360. Now he will have to make do on $198 a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the reform, he would have been entitled to $248 a week, 
and to $245 under the pilot project. In Quebec, 13.7%, that is 
nearly 14%, of people who lost their job have worked at least 
one small week. This rate is much higher in the maritimes and 
eastern Quebec. It is 24% in eastern Quebec and in the 
Chicoutimi—Jonquière area.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are reportedly 25,000 persons in this situation in 
Montreal, which represents 11.8%. Women are more likely to be in 
this group: 22.7% compared to 5.5% of men. Young people are also 
affected: 17.2%, or almost 18  of young people under age 30, as 
opposed to 8% of people over age 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these figures are self-explanatory. The federal 
government has tightened EI eligibility criteria to such an 
extent that it is making young people and women pay for the debt 
with premiums they pay to protect themselves from unemployment. 
This misappropriation of funds is unacceptable and the 
government must agree now with today's motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, 
once again I would like to thank my colleague from the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we listen to these speeches, we realize that what is 
happening in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, in terms of 
unemployment insurance, is much the same. I think I will call it 
by its real name, even though the name was changed to 
“employment insurance” to try to convince people they will find 
a job, despite the fact that the Liberal government will not 
make an effort to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if my colleague encounters the same 
problems as I do in his riding. I receive calls from people 
concerning their cheques. A lady called me yesterday and said “I 
think the employment centre has made an error in my calculation. 
I have worked more than 20 weeks, but it only calculated six 
weeks. My cheque is only for $60 a week; I cannot live on that. 
I think it made a mistake”. 
I told her no, it did not make a mistake. It added the famous 
divider of the 26 week period to make the calculation. I even 
received calls from people getting $32 a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if my colleague from the Bloc receives the 
same type of complaints in his region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac for her questions.  Her questions are 
always well founded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember last week's debate on APEC.  The question was very 
much to the point, and it enabled me to inform the House of the 
Canadian federation on APEC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes indeed we are getting calls at the office.  Why?  Because 
this government must understand immediately that the employment 
insurance reform and the new employment insurance legislation 
serve to exclude and to discriminate against young people and 
women, in particular.  The Bloc Quebecois considers it 
unacceptable to have contributions paid into a plan that denies 
benefits.  I think this must be said loud and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if we had paid insurance premiums, but were told “We 
will not pay you”, after a fire in the house. 
That is unacceptable.  It is an exclusion clause and a 
discriminatory clause that affects not only young people and 
women, but entire regions and thousands of Quebeckers and 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, Oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras: </B>I hear the members opposite reacting to my 
words; clearly they do not come from regions hard hit by 
unemployment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are certainly not from the regions excluded, whose

entirely with what the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac said. 
Many people in my riding have told me of the pitiful state of 
this plan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to point out something about EI that completely stunned and 
staggered me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers must pay their share to the EI fund. All businesses 
must pay. It is not only the employees who pay. The Government 
of Quebec is an employer and, as such, its share exceeds the 
real needs, so it contributes to reducing the federal deficit to 
the tune of $200 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the whole issue of the 
surpluses. I know that I do not have much time to answer, but I 
will try to do it quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers and employees contribute every year to a program, but 
cannot get benefits. For us, that is unacceptable. In the past, 
before the reform, more than 75% of young unemployed people 
could claim UI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with a question: What percentage of young 
unemployed can now claim EI benefits under the new system?  Only 
25%.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure for me to speak to this 
motion brought forward by the hon. member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will please members to no end to know that I will be sharing 
my time with the hardworking vivacious member for 
Guelph—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a speech which took me hours to prepare, but basically I 
am going to touch on a few nuances brought forward by some of the 
members opposite, in particular members of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that in the weekend's paper it was 
clearly evinced that one of the members of the Reform Party, I 
believe the member for Medicine Hat, practises some of his 
dialogue before speaking in the House of Commons. Other members 
of the Reform Party perhaps better take a look in the mirror 
before they start making disparaging remarks about this piece of 
legislation and condemn it in its entirety for the simple reason 
that they say it is isolationist and it targets one part of the 
country, which is absolutely and unequivocally a falsehood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are indulging in nothing more than verbal turpitude.  They 
are the people who want at the end of the day to speak for all 
Canadians, whereas this piece of legislation basically does 
address all Canadians.  One member said it does not reach into 
his riding because he has 17% unemployment in his riding.  If he 
has 17% unemployment in his riding and he wants to rail against 
the government, he better look inward and say perhaps there is 
something he personally should do to alleviate those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this piece of legislation when we talk about the big weeks 
and the small weeks, we are actually looking for a formula to 
address unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side do not look upon unemployment 
favourably.  We are trying to do everything we possibly can to 
ameliorate the situation and address the concerns.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the big weeks I think of the word big and my 
hon. colleague from Pontiac—Gatineau—Labelle.  He is big in 
heart and big in empathy for those who are dispossessed and those 
who are out of work.  When we look at the small weeks I think of 
the word small and the member for Frontenac—Mégantic. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<I think he is not here, but his ideas are not very great. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has a small vision of the country.  He is from the Bloc 
Quebecois Party which does not really care about the rest of the 
country.  Everyone knows that it is an isolationist party.  Dare 
I say that the opposition party, the Reform Party, in some 
instances also delves into the realm of being isolationist 
because it does not want to address the entire situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my hon. colleague opposite is a business person.  He 
knows that the best way to alleviate unemployment is to have a 
strong, vibrant economy.  I know the hon. member, the little 
fellow from Medicine Hat who has certain Thespian qualities about 
him, has said that they would create in the blue book about one 
million jobs by the year 2000.  I believe that is their mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of Canada knows that we on this side of the House have 
already reached that point.  We have created about 1.3 million 
jobs and growing, less than two years faster than the Reform 
Party suggested. Talk is cheap.  It is easy to say what one is 
going to do. We have actually done it.  We have the lowest 
unemployment rate now in about eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that is great for business and will help the 
employment picture is that we have the lowest interest rates in 
over 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a business person besides.  When I had a real job I was in 
business, until I got elected as a member of parliament.  I see 
what goes on here on occasion.  It is dreadful.  Let us face 
reality.  If there are low interest rates which we currently 
have, the lowest in over 30 years, it is very propitious for the 
job sector.  That is one of the reasons we have the lowest 
unemployment.  It is now down to about 8.4%.  When we took over 
in 1993 I believe it was something around 12.4%.  That in itself 
propagates that the unemployment picture will look better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to this piece of legislation, I agree a lot with 
what the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche has been saying, 
but I cannot say to him at this stage, today, here and now, that 
I am in complete agreement with him on this issue because it is a 
pilot project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will take a look at it on November 15.  The hon. member 
should hold his horses, or perhaps I should say to him sharpen 
his blades.  He has already told me that he is a hockey player. I 
believe he is skating on thin ice on this one.  He should get his 
skates sharpened because we on this side have sharpened our 
pencils.  That is why the employment picture is at the best it 
has been for years and years and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the fourth party, the NDP, is very concerned about the 
unemployment picture.  Its members are very eloquent 
spokespersons in that regard.  However I disagree with them.  I 
do not believe that we should have generations and generations of 
people on unemployment.  I would like to see these people get job 
retraining and upgrading.  I believe they agree with me in that 
regard, but that is where they viscerally disagree with the 
Reform Party because the Reform Party's agenda is to cut them 
off. Anybody who has come back year in and year out to the 
employment insurance fund would be arbitrarily cut off.  The NDP 
agrees with the Liberal Party in the area of job retraining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look after our students.  We have the youth employment centre 
programs which are generated with the money from employment 
insurance premiums. Everyone would like to see a reduction, but 
at what expense?  The finance minister has clearly indicated that 
we are a caring, compassionate country.  We will reach out to all 
sectors of the population to try to help them.

It goes into the general revenue fund.  That was passed in 1986. 
I was not here in 1986.  I do not know who was here then but I 
believe that is when it was passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have managed that fund remarkably well.  I remember back in 
the early 1980s when the unemployment insurance fund was running 
at a deficit of about $500 million a year.  Now, because we have 
a surplus and because we are managing it extremely well, we are 
to be penalized and we are to be looked upon in a pejorative 
manner. I emphatically state we will not apologize for managing 
that fund extremely well, better than it has been managed in 
years.

General of Canada said that, if the federal government used the 
money for anything other than unemployment, administration costs 
and training expenses, it would be illegal.  Right now, the 
federal government is receiving interest on the EI fund and it 
would illegal for it to use it elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very surprised and 
astonished at the comments of the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he think that government members are not serious minded? 
We are indeed, but you are not, because the former Bloc 
Quebecois leader said that Canada was not a real country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not real.  Your leader said that, so what are you talking 
about over there?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I saw the member getting upset just a minute ago.  I am 
a little concerned because I have to give credit where credit is 
due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Definitely the Bloc has been fighting, like the NDP has been 
fighting, to try to bring justice to this program which has been 
destroyed by the Liberal government.  The member has talked about 
how well they manage and how proud they are of what they have 
achieved.  What they have achieved is the creation of the biggest 
gap ever between the rich and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They sit there and are happy about it and so proud that they 
managed.  I can manage my finances very well at home.  I can save 
50% of my money if I want to starve my two kids.  I can be very 
proud that I have money in the bank.  I get upset when I see 
members of parliament saying that they are proud of the surplus. 
Yet they do not talk about the hardship they have created for the 
people and for the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just a seasonal worker problem.  It is a community 
problem created by the Liberal government that is so proud of 
this surplus.  I do not understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like the member 
opposite to understand this, and I will make it very clear and 
very plain to you.  We have reduced— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Make it plain to 
everybody but make it plain through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have reduced the 
employment insurance premiums not once, not twice, not thrice but 
four times.  We have managed that fund very well.  We have 
reduced unemployment from 12.4% to 8.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member opposite through you, Mr. Speaker, that 
I suffered through an NDP government in the province of Ontario, 
and let me say that it was not a pretty sight. It is a travesty 
to see that Ontario's Bob Rae was named man of the year for 
creating jobs in Buffalo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing what has to be done to alleviate the difficulties 
with employment insurance premiums.  We are doing a remarkable 
job.  I appreciate the comments of the hon. member opposite, but 
deep down where it really counts I know she agrees with our 
policy in this regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK284"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke for his eloquent comments.  I think 
they were most interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise in the House today to take part in this extremely 
important debate on the employment insurance system.  I am 
pleased the hon. member for Madawaska—Restigouche has brought 
the motion before the House.  It gives the government the 
opportunity to help Canadians understand why it was necessary to 
reform the old unemployment insurance income support system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion specifically addresses the small weeks 
adjustment projects.  These pilots have served as an added 
incentive for workers to take any employment, even for a few 
extra hours.  That is the thrust behind the new EI program to 
ensure that every hour of work counts toward eligibility for 
benefits and to encourage people to work as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is very important.  I do not have a problem with 
the small weeks adjustment projects per se.  They are an 
important means of helping seasonal and cyclical workers, a means 
of making the system a little more fair.  However, I do not think 
that small weeks adjustment projects should continue in their 
current form indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member knows, these projects are being carried out 
in 29 high unemployment regions.  While I understand the need for 
these projects in these areas, I would ask the minister to 
consider the advisability of making them less regional and 
applying them more evenly across our great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance is an important part of our social safety 
net.  I emphasis the word employment because I think the change 
from unemployment to employment insurance was an important one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program was never intended to make being jobless easy but 
rather to tide the person over between jobs and to act as a 
buffer while the person is looking for work.  The idea is to get 
unemployed workers to use EI as temporary income support while 
looking for a new job or upgrading their skills so they can 
return to the workforce as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new EI system has been restructured and redesigned to be 
more inclusive.  For example, a number of those who are taking 
part in the small weeks project also receive the family income 
supplement, a supplement introduced by this government to address 
the needs of Canadians who may be living in poverty.  A $50 floor 
on earnings also applies to low income earners so that these 
workers can earn more while still receiving EI benefits.  Workers 
with an annual income of less than $2,000 also have their premium 
payments refunded and are eligible to participate in active 
employment measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reform of the EI system has benefited many people.  EI is 
now more accessible to women.  Close to 700,000 women who work 
part time now have their EI payments refunded and because every 
paid hour of work counts the 14 hour job trap women used to find 
themselves in under UI has been lifted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small weeks adjustment project is just one example of how 
the Department of Human Resources Development is responding to 
the changing labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today very few people stay at the same job for more than 10 
years.  The average person changes careers, not just jobs, five 
times between the time they finish school and the time they 
retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have to be flexible and willing to adapt to new work 
environments and working conditions.  The good old 9 to 5 does 
not apply to every job.  Some people work 40 hours a week while 
others work at two or three part time jobs or are employed 
casually on a day by day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why small weeks adjustment projects can be so 
beneficial.  I would like to ask the minister to consider the 
advisability of seeing the project standardized and nationalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member of parliament for Guelph—Wellington, a riding 
representing a high number of construction workers, I use the 
construction industry as an example. A construction worker may 
work 40 hours one week and 20 hours another week.  Construction 
is not a 9 to 5, Monday to Friday industry.  Workers work until 
the job is done be that on a Monday, Wednesday, Saturday or any 
other day of the week. When the worker gets laid off, somewhat of 
an inevitable occurrence in this profession, and if they choose 
to apply for EI their benefits are calculated on their last 20 
weeks of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a mason who has worked 40 hours a week for 6 months 
on a construction week then during the last 20 weeks of the 
project the nature of the work changes and his hours are cut back 
to 30 years for 5 weeks and then 20 hours for the next 5 weeks. 
The amount of EI the mason is now eligible to collect will be 
considerably smaller due to those small weeks. That does not seem 
very fair to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small weeks adjustment projects were implemented for 
situations like this one, the ones we have in Guelph—Wellington. 
However, we cannot access this project.  In practice they have 
only been developed in certain regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance is part of Canada's social fabric and a 
reason why Canada is ranked number one by the United Nations in 
terms of our standard of living.  It is the Canadian way to help 
others in need.  Charity and community spirit are two identifying 
features of our national psyche. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Quebec was devastated by flooding a few years ago Canadians 
from every region responded.  Even though Quebeckers did not want 
to be a part of this country Canadians went there and responded 
because they are Canadians, Canadians who live in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year later when the Red River overflowed people in every 
province and territory reached out to the people of Manitoba. 
Just last year when the ice storm struck Ontario and Quebec 
citizens from my riding of Guelph—Wellington and communities 
like ours everywhere responded immediately to the call for help 
in Quebec again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that Bloc members are laughing because other Canadians 
responded to their needs.  I think that is a terrible thing.  It 
is very sad that the Bloc Quebecois responds by laughing and 
mocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this track record of helping our fellow citizens, no 
matter where they live, it does not make sense to help unemployed 
workers in one region of the country more than in another region.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All hon. members agree we have a responsibility to do everything 
within our power to help Canadians and their families avoid 
poverty and its traumatic effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the small weeks adjustment projects are an important 
addition to the employment insurance system.  I would like to see 
them continue, but nationally as well as regionally.  The 
government knew that some regions had higher unemployment rates 
and that EI reform would impact some communities more than 
others.  However, labour market conditions are changing 
everywhere and small weeks is a problem encountered by EI 
applicants across the country.  This is a problem that needs to 
be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the government is now analysing the 
projects to determine what action may be required.  The 
government is close to being able to make a decision on the 
future of the small weeks adjustment projects experiment.  These 
projects are scheduled to be completed on November 15.  It would 
be premature to commit to renewing them without first assessing 
their impact and the effectiveness in the regions in which they 
will be implemented, then taking a serious look at where else 
they could be of benefit to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, Canada is considered the best country in the 
world when it comes to our standard of living.  Our social safety 
net is a big reason why.  Canadians look out for one another in 
times of need.  Whether the hardship is caused by a national 
disaster, illness or unemployment it is important to help our 
fellow Canadians wherever they are, wherever they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that unemployment is higher in certain regions of 
the country, but we also have to look at the unemployment levels 
by industry to ensure we are helping as many Canadians as 
possible and helping them equally.  That is what being Canadian 
is all about.

think my distinguished colleague is totally disconnected from 
human reality in this country. She must surely live in a posh 
neighbourhood, and she probably does not meet her voters in the 
places where she should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, Quebec paid $475 million more than it received. 
Federalists can no longer use the argument they relied on in 
1980, when they tried to scare people by saying “We cannot 
separate from the rest of Canada, or else we will lose access to 
the unemployment insurance program”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke about poverty. I would like to know what 
she thinks of the people in my riding who work as volunteer 
firefighters. These people clean fire trucks, hoses, etc., on a 
volunteer basis. 
The fifteen or so volunteer firefighters in Black Lake spend 
hours of their free time doing that work and maintaining a 
volunteer firefighters unit in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they fight a fire, they are paid $14 or $15 per hour. There 
is a volunteer fireman who helped fight 12 fires. He suffered a 
shortfall of $1,534. Because he earned $526, the government 
knocked $1,534 off his benefits. This is a volunteer fireman who 
does volunteer work and who contributed $1,534 to the $20 
billion accumulated surplus. Is this what we mean by poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is taxing poor people to death in order to lower 
its deficit. EI contributions are too high, given the benefits 
paid by the government to the unemployed.

to sit across from the Bloc Quebecois and listen to this.

opposite, and I must represent— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
sometimes it is unfortunate that we are limited in time. The

had been very well managed by the Liberal government.  That is 
exactly what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My opinion is that a $19 billion surplus which does not exist 
because it has been spent is atrocious management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member for Guelph—Wellington would agree that 
misappropriation of $19 billion is very good management as stated 
by the member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke.

that wants to privatize the plan and that does not wish to help 
other individual across the country or even help its own citizens 
in the ridings it represents continually tries to look at the 
dark side.  Reformers do not want to lift people up. They do not 
want to help their fellow human beings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
must say I was really wanted to speak today.  I must also say 
that this is a sad moment, because the subject of the debate is 
not a happy one at home.  Unemployment insurance is always a 
subject of sadness for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Atlantic region, as in my riding of 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, many people are suffering as the result 
of cuts to EI made by our famous Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I keep 
saying, this is the government whose Prime Minister campaigned 
in my riding, making promise after promise, saying that he would 
scrap the GST, that he would make sure seasonal workers did not 
have to worry about managing to live in our regions.  The people 
believed him.  They elected him.  And this is the thanks we get. 
We have not forgotten it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of sadness.  As I said earlier, I got another 
call last night, from a woman who said “I think the employment 
centre has made a mistake.  They did a calculation and included 
only the past six weeks, the money from the past six weeks, 
although I worked 26 weeks”.  She ended up with just about 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we have Liberal members who say they are very 
proud of themselves, that there is a $20 billion surplus. They 
are proud of the way they managed the account, but they do not 
say a thing about the suffering there is everywhere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more people are living in poverty.  Mothers come to me 
and say “It's not just a problem for the seasonal workers.  It's 
a community problem”.  They have taken $927 million out of the 
New Brunswick economy since the cuts, and the government is as 
proud as punch of having done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not have the opportunity to see the Minister of Human 
Resources Development come to our region and face these 
problems.  He does not have the gumption to do so, because he is 
not capable of looking the poverty and misery he has created in 
the face.  He is not the one getting calls to his office.  I am 
sure he is never there.  In my opinion, he is not even aware of 
what is going on, three-quarters of the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would really like to see him go to northern New Brunswick, to 
Kent and Albert County, to face the reality of employment 
insurance reform.  The government has found the path to the pot 
of gold, and now it can boast it has paid off the deficit.  Very 
proud of themselves they are, those Liberals.  The only ones who 
should be proud are the workers.  They are the ones who paid off 
the deficit.  Nobody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the Prime Minister come to tell us he was going to “scrap 
the GST”.  What was the outcome of that?  An additional 15% on 
electricity bills, an additional 15% of workers on unemployment, 
an additional 15% on the cost of children's clothing, while 
employment insurance cheques are cut at the same time.  Then 
people wonder why there is more violence in our communities. 
They blame it on the parents: broken homes, some other problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the source of the problems. They have been right in 
front of me for over a year. That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine that members on the other side can say they are 
proud of the society they are creating. At home, in an area 
where there had never been a bank robbery, there were three in 
four days in the county of Kent. There was one in a store in 
Bouctouche last week. These things did not happen at all two 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used to have a program that had been established to share the 
wealth. Now we have another problem. Some children go to school 
hungry. Why? Their parents are poor. We do not find a poor child 
if his parents are not poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government brags about that fact it has created many jobs. 
It never talks about the jobs that it has cut, the jobs that 
were lost, the jobs that will be lost with bank mergers. 
We do not hear about those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not hear about the women who were penalized. The Liberal 
member said a few moments ago that part time workers with three 
or four jobs now qualify for EI. That is good for urban areas, 
but it does not do much for rural communities where finding even 
one part time job is difficult. Those people pay EI premiums but 
never qualify, while the Liberals keep playing with numbers. 
Those people pay thousands and thousands of dollars in premiums, 
but they are not eligible. A distinction must be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about women who are no longer eligible for maternity 
benefits? Before the reform, they had to work 300 hours to be 
eligible. Now, they have to work 700 hours. What is good for 
women in that program? Nothing. Part time workers in education 
are also affected. Some of them no longer qualify. 
In the past, if they did not qualify, at least they did not have 
to contribute. Nowadays, they must contribute, but they do not 
qualify. The same goes for health care workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The famous dividing factor must also be discussed. They are 
saying: “Yes, people can qualify with 10 work weeks, as long as 
they have the required number of hours worked. People can 
qualify with six work weeks, as long as they have the required 
number of hours worked”. However, they forget to mention that, 
in their regions, the number is to be divided by 14. In other 
regions, it is divided by 18. And then the benefits will be 
calculated over 26 weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get calls from people who receive cheques for $32, $65 or $85, 
and I see Liberal members standing up to congratulate 
themselves.

night about where they will find the money, the $2 they need to 
pay for their kid's lunch at school the next day. The members 
opposite never talk about this. No, because most of them are 
rich. They know nothing about being hungry. They need to learn 
what it is to be hungry. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about Albert county.  People in Albert county 
which is an hour's drive from Moncton need the same amount of 
hours as someone working in Moncton.  They are down to 18 weeks 
for the benefit period. I have workers who will be out of 
employment insurance in January. Those are the workers who 
qualified.  Many are not going to qualify at all because they 
need the same amount of hours as someone living in Moncton and 
the minister says this is good.  We have proved to the minister a 
number of times that he is wrong. His arguments do not stand up. 
He needs to change it.  A lot of people in Albert county are 
suffering because the Liberal government does not want to admit 
that it makes mistakes.  It is making mistakes that are costing 
lives.  How many people are committing suicide because of their 
difficulties? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to talk about the unfair accusations of fraud 
because people make a mistake on the form.  Even though the 
Canada employment centre has not paid them one penny, if they 
happen to not put the right amount on their form they will be 
charged with fraud.  Someone explain that to me. This was drawn 
to my attention on Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People opened a claim, did the waiting period, kept their claim 
open, reported their hours and earnings, reported an amount and 
the Canada employment centre did not give them an EI cheque. If 
there is a discrepancy, even though the government has not paid 
them a cent, they are accused of fraud and have to pay the 
difference between what they actually made and what they 
reported.  It is armed robbery. That is attacking the unemployed, 
attacking honest people who could make a mistake.  A lot of 
honest people are being accused of fraud. This has got to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to wake up. There is a lot of legislation out there. 
We have to wake up and show the Liberals that this cannot 
continue.  There is just too much poverty.

truth, who describes what is going on in her region, who has 
heart and tells it like it is in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a message in there for the Liberal majority. This 
member defeated Dominic LeBlanc, the son of the Governor General 
of Canada. In the neighbouring riding, Doug Young, the sponsor 
of this EI reform, was also defeated. I think these two men 
personify the Liberal Party's arrogance in the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not rewrite history, but I would nonetheless call upon 
the members who will participate in the vote on this motion 
tonight or tomorrow to think it through, especially those living 
in high unemployment regions, as well as any member with 
constituents who, as a result of the small weeks program, 
receive ridiculously low benefits that are practically 
impossible to live on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, they hear that there is a $20 billion surplus 
in the EI fund, that running the small weeks program costs 
between $100 million and $125 million a year, or 0.5% of this 
surplus, and that the government is responsible for the 
increased poverty across Canada. I think they get the message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they do not send a clear message to the contrary very soon, 
the Liberals will pay the political price, and deservedly so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree that we should be 
clear. The pilot project has to go on, and the legislation needs 
to be amended. If you think we have a poverty problem now, just 
imagine what it will be like if the government decides not to 
extend the pilot project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people work part time all winter long. It is not true that 
these people all end up in the tavern drinking all winter long. 
That was what the Prime Minister said, and he was quite pleased 
with himself, when he came back here. These people work during 
the winter when they get a chance. If the pilot project 
disappears, these people will be penalized. I cannot understand 
a government that goes on stomping on people who are in dire 
straits. It is the only thing it can think of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping the pilot project alive is not enough. We also need a 
comprehensive review of the program. Some employers have come to 
realize this. They have started calling us on the phone and they 
tell us: “Employees are being penalized. I cannot hire workers 
anymore, and I do not blame them”. People are getting cheques as 
low as $65 right now. If the pilot project disappeared 
overnight, they would get big weekly cheques of $5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe we have to fight the government over this, 
because we have all the evidence we need. We are told to wait 
for the reports, to wait for the studies. Send the Minister of 
Human Resources Development to our region, and he will get his 
report.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was hoping that everybody in the country could listen 
to that. Then they could understand exactly what goes on when we 
fool around with the EI concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all I would like to bring greetings from the hon. 
member for Acadie—Bathurst who unfortunately could not be here 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that this motion at the outset seems to be an act of 
desperation.  Because of all the changes to the EI legislation 
since the Liberals got into power, this is the kind of motion one 
has to figure out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry for 
interrupting but I first needed to be assured that both the 
member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac and the member for 
Sackville—Eastern Shore were splitting their time.  I thought 
that had been made clear but I was not sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier today in the 
debate the Minister of Human Resources Development said that he 
has not yet come up with a decision about the issue, but it is 
only three weeks away.  We need a decision within three weeks.  I 
should remind the House that one of those weeks we will not be 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a feeling that typically, like the government did with 
the TAGS program, it will announce the program when we are not in 
the House to debate it properly.  This is where things should be 
debated, in the House right here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the Reform Party for just a moment.  Every 
time we talk about EI concerns or anything of that nature, 
Reformers very quickly switch the debate to tax breaks but not 
once do we hear them talk about a reduction of the GST-HST.  All 
they wish to talk about is taking EI funds from workers and 
employers so their corporate friends can enjoy further tax 
breaks.  They want to take that money from workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarkable thing is that the Reform Party constantly talks 
about Atlantic Canada as if it were a basket case. I am from 
Atlantic Canada and it is not a basket case.  The fact is we have 
some very serious problems.  We have some very serious concerns, 
but as everyone knows after the Swissair disaster, Atlantic 
Canadians and especially Nova Scotians are some of the finest 
people in the entire country.  Atlantic Canada is not a basket 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after the last EI reductions were brought in last year 
by the finance minister and the human resources minister, I think 
to the tune of $1.4 billion, the finance minister went to Halifax 
to speak to the chamber of commerce.  They said that he had not 
reduced it enough and that he should have given them a further 
reduction in EI premiums. The finance minister in his wisdom said 
“If I reduce it another 20 cents, how many jobs would you people 
create tomorrow?” The entire chamber of commerce was silent. 
They could not guarantee one extra job if the EI premiums were 
reduced another 20 cents.  They could not do it. Yet the Reform 
Party stands here with its right wing policies and says that if 
EI premiums were reduced, all these jobs would be created.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the Reform Party that if it wants to give 
tax breaks to people, then reduce the GST and the HST.  That 
would be the biggest job creator for every single Canadian in 
this country from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We never hear Reform Party members talk about reports or 
objective concerns from labour.  They never discuss the concerns 
that come out of the CLC, the CAW, the PSAC or the FFAW.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak tonight on an issue of grave 
importance to my riding of Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and, 
in particular, Guysborough county. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue that I have vigorously pursued with the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans through personal interventions, 
correspondence and, as well, through statements and questions in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is this Liberal government's continued refusal to work 
with the fishery workers in communities such as Canso and 
Mulgrave to ensure that these communities remain economically 
viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government's treatment of Mulgrave and ACS Trading 
has been extremely disgraceful, I am going to focus my comments 
tonight on the community of Canso and, in particular, on the 
efforts of the Canso Trawlermen's Co-op which has been championed 
by Pat Fougere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely timely adjournment debate because this 
coming Saturday there is a large public meeting taking place in 
Canso on the future of the fishery in that community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canso is the birthplace of the modern era fishing industry.  I 
say this out of respect for our First Nations fishermen.  Since 
1504 when Basque sailors first set up camp on Nova Scotia's 
shores, Canso has been known as the hub of the commercial 
fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In more recent years, despite the overall downturn trend in the 
Atlantic fishery, the Seafreez company has been operating a 
processing plant in Canso in which a number of species are 
utilized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to highlight that it was through the efforts of 
former Progressive Conservative governments, both federally and 
provincially, that Seafreez commenced operations in Canso. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To cut right to the chase, the Canso Trawlermen's Co-op has 
developed a proposal in conjunction with Seafreez to catch an 
additional 2,200 tonnes of northern shrimp out of the additional 
7,000 that the Government of Canada was planning to allocate this 
spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans denied the application from 
Canso, as he did for three similar applications from Nova Scotia 
ridings, including the riding of Bras d'Or.  The minister's trite 
answer at that time was “The fish come first”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While nobody would take away from the importance of 
conservation, least of all the Canso Trawlermen's Co-op, the fact 
is that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans decided to allocate 
every single additional tonne of northern shrimp quota to 
Newfoundland and Labrador, pitting two regions in the country 
against one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing was given to Nova Scotia.  Nothing was given to a 
community that has nearly 500 years of tradition at stake within 
the fisheries.  So much for Liberal fisheries policy that is 
based on fairness and equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether fish actually come first with the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, but I do know who comes last with this 
minister and that is the people of Nova Scotia and, most notably, 
those of Canso. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canso Trawlermen's Co-op has made more than 50 requests to 
meet personally with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  They 
want to advance their cause.  They want to put a face to the 
disastrous consequences of the minister's decision.  They even 
travelled all the way from Canso to Ottawa so they would have a 
chance to meet with the minister, but did not get a chance to 
meet with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did he have the courage to meet with them face to face?  No.  I 
have repeatedly urged the minister to meet with them in Canso and 
again his answer has been no.  Even the premier of Nova Scotia, a 
former colleague of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, has 
asked the minister to meet with the co-op.  Again his answer was 
no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is further proof that the current premier of Nova Scotia has 
no clout with his former Liberal friends and is therefore of no 
great use or advantage to Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who does the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans think he is when 
he will not show the decency to meet with hard-working people 
like those from Canso?  Pat Fougere of the Canso Trawlermen's 
Co-op said that the minister demonstrated complete disrespect for 
the area's fishermen and that he must take responsibility for the 
slow death of the fishing community in Canso. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pat Fougere is absolutely right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, there will be a meeting in Canso on November 1. 
Members of the provincial government, representatives of DFO and 
other community leaders will be present.  I urge and challenge 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to have the courage and the 
guts to show up at that meeting and tell these people to their 
faces what their future will be if his decisions are not changed 
in the near future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am aware and I 
fully understand the concerns of some Nova Scotia communities 
with respect to their lack of fishing opportunities.  However, 
this is not just a Nova Scotia phenomenon.  Every year DFO 
receives many requests for access to various fisheries from 
people in similar situations.  The total allowable catch, TAC, 
increases in the northern shrimp fishery announced in May 1998 
were allocated according to principles which were developed for 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, stakeholders, the 
Atlantic provinces and Quebec to ensure that the benefits of the 
fishery were shared in as fair and open manner as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of these principles is that those adjacent to the 
resource will have priority in fishing the resource, new entrants 
from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and P.E.I. were not included in 
the temporary sharing of northern shrimp.  Nova Scotian interests 
received a share of the increase through existing licences held 
by Nova Scotian companies, which represent two and a half 
licences out of seventeen.  The existing licence holders received 
90% of the increase off northern Labrador and 10% of the increase 
off eastern Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishing communities in Newfoundland and Labrador, northern 
Quebec and the lower north shore of Quebec benefited from the 
increase.  In addition, those who received temporary access in 
1997 received the same level of quota in 1998.  The traditional 
offshore fleet also shared in the quota increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the May 15th announcement, DFO approved temporary 
sharing of the gulf shrimp and Scotian shelf shrimp resources 
with fishermen in Nova Scotia, P.E.I., New Brunswick and Quebec. 
The sharing in these fisheries was also consistent with the 
principle of adjacency, with access based on the department's 
sector management policy which governs the access of inshore 
vessels.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MILLENNIUM SCHOLARSHIPS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 8, 1998, I asked the Deputy Prime 
Minister a question. He answered that there were ongoing 
negotiations about the millennium scholarships. In particular, 
he said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to arrive at an agreement to co-operate with the 
provincial government, and our negotiations are continuing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know today that all that was simply a smoke screen, and that 
the federal government, at the urging of the Prime Minister, had 
decided that the millennium scholarships would be established in 
spite of the opposition: against the wishes of the Quebec 
government, against the wishes of the Quebec student 
federations, against the wishes of the Canadian student and 
university federations, which today still ask that they be 
turned into something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two and a half billion dollars were set aside for the millennium 
scholarships. Quebec's share is thus some $600 million. At the 
same time, transfers to the provinces were cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has the best student loans and scholarships system in 
Canada. That is recognised by all the players. In fact, it is 
the only system where scholarships are given based on financial 
need. There are also loans that are provided based on financial 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Canadian system, it provided loans only. This has 
created a much higher debt load for Canadian students. In 
Quebec, there is a consensus that this $600 million should be 
reinvested in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, Mr. Charest came and softened the position of the 
Liberal Party of Quebec. As we know, Mr. Charest does not have 
any constitutional demands. He has no demands for Ottawa. 
Besides, the Prime Minister told him so very clearly.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saturday, the Prime Minister of Canada put it back in his face, 
saying “What do you think Quebec needs? My allied in Quebec, Mr. 
Charest, tells me he needs nothing.” That is a problem we face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But everyone in Quebec still wants this money to be returned to 
Quebeckers, to the Government of Quebec so that it can invest it 
in accordance with its priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of this $600 million, Quebec could invest $20 million in the 
Lower St. Lawrence region that I represent. 
We could use the $20 million to better purpose in our schools, 
in our colleges, by allowing them to offer professional options 
better suited to the new economy, to offer agricultural programs 
on new production methods, on all sorts of very important 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships program is probably the measure that 
shows most clearly the government's centralising approach, but 
we still hope to see the government back down, and give the 
money back to the provinces, which are the real experts in 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it possible to make the government see reason, to make it 
reverse its decision and give the money back to Quebec, thus 
allowing Quebec's educational institutions and students to 
redistribute the money in accordance with their needs and not to 
use the money for scholarships based on merit that nobody wants 
in Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK297"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to 
comments made last May by the member opposite on the millennium 
scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague raised comments made at the time by the three 
largest employer organizations in Quebec on the scholarships and 
on the constitutional jurisdiction of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada recognizes that education is a matter 
of provincial jurisdiction.  We are not interested in stepping 
into provincial jurisdiction in terms of education.  What we 
believe strongly about is helping Canadians have proper access to 
the good education and the knowledge provided by the provinces. 
That is why we introduced the millennium scholarships.  We have 
always stated that the enabling legislation offers all the 
flexibility needed to meet much of what Quebec wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships will be managed and delivered by an 
independent foundation that will work closely with the provinces 
to establish criteria and to avoid duplication with what the 
provinces are already delivering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation will be undertaking consultations over the next 
few months with the provinces and the educational community to 
increase access to post-secondary education everywhere in Canada 
for low and middle income Canadians in a manner that avoids 
duplication and builds on existing provincial programs and 
processes.  This makes good sense for students, for the provinces 
and for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers should feel confident that the millennium scholarship 
foundation will act responsibly and will work with all the 
provinces in a way that will avoid duplication with provincial 
systems.  Jean Monty, the president of the foundation, is a well 
respected and responsible individual.  We are confident he will 
work well with all provincial governments, including the 
Government of Quebec, to ensure students have better access to 
education provided by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation will make every effort to establish the 
millennium scholarships in a manner that respects the needs of 
each province, including Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the hon. member to recognize that both orders of 
governments have a role to play to increase the equality of 
opportuntiy for Canada's young people.  Through partnerships we 
can achieve results which are beneficial to all Canadians, each 
and every one of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships are not about jurisdiction.  Rather, 
they represent Canada's unique way of celebrating a new 
millennium by investing in all Canadians and their future.
