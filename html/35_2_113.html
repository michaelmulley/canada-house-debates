	We should replace the Indian Act with the equality for Indians 
act. We should give grassroots Indian people real choices about 
their future. Give them the option of the system of local 
government they want to live in. Give them the option of owning 
their own land or having it held communally. Give them the option

	In almost every Parliament, government backbenchers 
grandstand about credit card interest rates but are unwilling to 
criticize their own government on the issue, even when as is the 
case presently, the government is actively defending and repeating 
the banks' position.
<P>
	New Democrat MPs were glad to sign the letter challenging the

strategies from the fact that it is the Liberal Party that runs the

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr.

us hope so, as it is not long until the holiday season. If there is one 
person who is stirring up a storm at this moment, it is the Minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7081"> 7081 </A></B>
<P>
of Human Resources Development. Yesterday, in fact, this minister 
told my colleague from Mercier that the transition period in the 
new employment insurance program had started in January. He 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is time the hon. member for Mercier realized that the reason why some 
provisions of the act were implemented on July 1 while others will take effect 
January 1 is precisely to give people time to adjust to the reform.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Now, there is a little problem; it would be hard to have 
something in application since January 1, when the act was passed 
in June. The minister has a problem. In the spirit of fair play, 
however, I will give him the chance to correct himself today. 
Yesterday he told us that there would be changes to the regulations, 
which he described as minor, in order to effect the transition 
between the old and the new systems.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Human Resources Development confirm 
that these minor changes to which he referred include a hypothesis 
that, effective January 5 and for the application of the new system, 
weeks worked prior to December 1996 are all deemed to have been 
35 hours in length for the purposes of eligibility for the new 
system? Can the minister tells us whether or not this measure 
exists?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what I said yesterday on the 
employment insurance reform is that, for several months, our 
government has been working very hard to inform Canadians so 
that they may adjust to the new system.
<P>
	We have run a national advertising campaign for Canadians 
since this past July 1. We have set up a 1-800 line so that Canadians 
can get information on the conditions of this employment 
insurance reform. We have printed a leaflet announcing passage of 
the legislation, which was mailed out to all recipients in July. We 
have, therefore, fully done our duty in informing people about the 
new system to start this coming January.
<P>
	What we want is for Canadians who work part time to be 
covered, starting January 1, from the first hour worked, because we 
see this as a reform of considerable interest to a great number of 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a big problem here in the House, and the minister 
has a really big one. The minister tells us that the government is 
doing its best to inform Canadians. Could the minister start by 
informing the House, since he is being asked questions.
<P>
	I will ask him very, very precisely what we want to know. I 
cannot speak to him directly. I will do it through yourself, Mr. 
Speaker; however, I would like him to listen in order to understand 
the question. Can the minister tell us whether he is, or is not, in the 
process at this time of examining the hypothesis of a transition 
which would consider all hours worked during 1996 as 35-hour 
weeks? Is he, or is he not? That is the only thing we want to know.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is not my habit to comment on 
each and every hypothesis which could have been presented to me 
on what the Leader of the Opposition tells us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what we are talking about is a system which represents the 
bread and butter of a good many Canadian families starting in 
January.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Huge numbers of people are in danger of being excluded from 
the system by the transition rules, which would appear to require 
35-hour weeks. Huge numbers of people will no longer have access 
to the employment insurance plan. They would qualify under the 
old system, they would qualify under the new one, but they would 
not qualify under the transition rules.
<P>
	First, is the minister aware of this and, second, will he take this 
into account when making a decision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, would the opposition be 
opposed to a system which, in Quebec alone, will enable 73 per 
cent of employment insurance contributors working for under 35 
hours a week at the present time to be eligible? Is he aware that 
127,000 Quebec part time workers will, in future, be covered for 
the first time? Does the opposition not accept a system which will 
enable 500,000 more Canadians to be covered by the employment 
insurance system, including 270,000 women? That is what the new 
system starting up January 1 will be like.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Either the minister does not understand, although there are 
enough officials in his department to explain the matter to him, or 
he does not want to understand, which is unfortunate for the 
Canadians and Quebecers who depend on his judgment. I will try 
two simple questions.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that if there are no transitional 
measures to transform weeks under the old system into hours under 
the new system, in other words, one week of work equals 35 hours, 
a young person who worked 26 20-hour weeks in 1996 will not be 
entitled to employment insurance on January 5, if he loses his job? 
Does the minister realize that without transitional measures, this 
young person will go on welfare?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see the opposition 
in fine fettle, despite its lack of programs, especially constructive 
programs. We will try to do better than the opposition, which is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7082"> 7082 </A></B>
<P>
simply there to  obstruct but has nothing to do, obviously, because 
it will never have to run this country.
<P>
	What Quebecers want and what all Canadians want is an 
employment insurance system. A-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to finish explaining to 
the opposition that we have five active employment insurance 
measures aimed at helping people adjust to the new labour market. 
The transitional measure happens to be one of these five active 
measures.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
January 5, a pregnant woman goes on maternity leave and reports 
to a human resources centre after having worked 30 20-hour weeks. 
According to the legislation in effect in 1996, she qualifies for 
special so-called pregnancy benefits. Without transitional 
measures, on January 5, this woman will not be entitled to her 
pregnancy benefits. The minister can hardly say this is 
unimportant, that these are minor measures. This is important to 
the life of the average person. Does the minister realize that?
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what I realize, first of all, is that 
a woman in Sydney, Nova Scotia who works 14 hours a week in a 
department store does not have insurable employment at the 
present time. Under the new employment insurance system, she 
will be entitled to benefits after 30 weeks.
<P>
	A father in East Montreal who has three jobs, each of which 
takes up 14 hours a week, adding up to 42 hours, does not have 
insurable employment at the present time.
<P>
	This system wants to encourage people to work and will insure 
them starting with the first hour worked.

Speaker, since the beginning of the Canadian Airlines crisis, the 
Reform Party has called on the government to intercede to ensure 
the democratic rights of the union workers of Canadian Airlines. 
The government has responded by saying that the rules do not 
permit it to do that. I would point out that those rules are made 
here.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Labour. Is the Minister of 
Labour now ready to intercede and set in place rules that would 
permit those workers to resolve this issue and to ensure that other 
people caught in this situation in the future do not have to go 
through the  same pain and anguish that Canadian's unionized 
employees have been going through?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on numerous occasions during the last few days, I have 
urged all parties involved to go to the negotiating table with the 
Canadian alliance and find a negotiated solution.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we are at an impasse and 16,000 jobs are at stake. 
That is why I directed the Canada Labour Relations Board to 
organize a vote for the employees of Canadian Airlines who are 
members of the Canadian automobile workers union. I directed the 
board according to the authority given to me under article 17 of the 
Canadian Labour Code.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad the government has seen fit to end this problem. 
I hope that in the future, if these kinds of problems come up, that 
collectively we will act quicker to save that same pain and anguish.
<P>
	There is still more to this. I have a question I would like to direct 
to the Minister of Finance. The package that the federal 
government has provided to Canadian does help. I am pleased to 
see that something is there, but it is based on the fuel tax. That fuel 
tax is twice as high in Canada as it is for the American competitors 
that all Canadian airlines must compete against under open skies.
<P>
	Will the government reconsider the method by which it is 
helping and go instead to a straight reduction of fuel taxes so that it 
applies to all airlines? In that way we do not solve the problems of 
Canadian and transfer them on to someone else.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when one looks at the taxation of any entity, one has to take a look 
at the full range of taxes: payroll taxes, corporate taxes, excise 
taxes and anything else. The taxes levied on Canadian transporters 
are quite competitive and do not in any way inhibit their situation.
<P>
	Furthermore, on international routes, the federal government 
does not impose undue taxation. What the hon. member might want 
to do is to take a look at the level of provincial taxation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are looking at provincial taxation. However, I was sent 
here to represent people at the federal level and not slough it off to 
the provincial governments.
<P>
	I would point out that the Minister of Finance certainly started 
out very correctly when he gave a long list of the taxes that the 
government levies against companies like Canadian Airlines.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	Rather than tell us what we already know, that Canadian pays a 
lot of taxes in a lot of categories, will the minister re-examine the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7083"> 7083 </A></B>
<P>
tax on aviation fuel and go for  an across the board reduction in the 
name of fairness to all Canadian aviation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are two questions here. One is the question of fuel 
taxes and taxes generally which has been answered by my 
colleague, the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	However, it is important for us to remember, including the hon. 
member whom I commend for his interest in this issue, that 
Canadian Airlines is not yet in a position where it is assured of 
success. Ten organizations, five of them unions, three of them 
governments and two companies are on side. We trust that a vote of 
the members of the auto workers union who are employed by 
Canadian Airlines will have a positive result. Of course we are not 
sure. We do not know how they will vote.
<P>
	I would remind all members of the House that this company has 
had five weeks of uncertainty. It has had five weeks of problems, 
ranging from creditors on the one side to bookings on the other. If 
Canadian is to survive it needs the co-operation of all parties to 
move forward with the restructuring proposal to turn from a 
company which had chronic losses that totalled over $1.3 billion to 
one in the black which makes money.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources is refusing to admit that 
there will be transition measures in the implementation of the new 
employment insurance program. He refuses to admit it. He is also 
refusing to respond regarding very the specific cases put to him by 
my colleague for Mercier. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development is like a barrel organ: you can request any tune you 
like, but, when you turn the crank, the tune is always the same.
<P>
	To continue with his example of the woman in Sydney, I would 
ask the Minister of Human Resources Development to explain how 
this person will manage to qualify for employment insurance, when 
no employer recorded the number of hours worked in 1996?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I was explaining that we have a 
new system where we are trying to break with the old methods. Can 
the opposition not accept the fact that we are really trying to adapt 
to a new labour market and that, necessarily, the new system is 
much fairer and more equitable in our opinion, because it will 
insure people from the first hour, from January 1, 1997.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us take this calmly and explain matters to the new 
minister. In the example he himself gave us a  few minutes ago, the 
minister said that the woman would now be eligible for 
employment insurance on the basis of the hours she worked. We 
know that her hours have to be indicated in order for the Canada 
employment centre to process her application.
<P>
	In 1996, no employer was equipped to count the hours 
employees worked. The application was based on the number of 
weeks worked. How will they know this woman worked 720 hours? 
There is no way of knowing.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, those who are covered by 
employment insurance in 1996 will continue to be covered and will 
not lose their coverage as of December 31, 1996. I think this is 
important.
<P>
	On the other hand, we can also inform. The opposition claims I 
am not familiar with the system. I can tell you that the woman in 
Sydney working 14 hours in a department store will be insured 
after 30 weeks.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	The young father of a family in Montreal East, whom I 
mentioned earlier, holds three jobs and works 14 hours a week at 
each and is not insured. He will be, after the 11th week. The system 
is much more suited to things as they are at the moment and is far 
and away more interesting than the old system the opposition 
clings to in its retrograde reveries.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
August 1984 health department officials sounded alarm bells about 
the dangers of AIDS and legislation was drafted to protect the 
blood supply. The Turner government and the Mulroney 
government which followed ignored those warnings and simply 
shelved the legislation.
<P>
	The Krever inquiry and the victims of tainted blood want to get 
to truth. I ask the Prime Minister, who was deputy prime minister 
in August 1984, will he release all the documents and the draft 
legislation from 1984 to Justice Krever, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister has replied to that question 
many times in the House of Commons. We were very unhappy with 
the situation that existed at that time. There is an inquiry which we 
hope will be able to report soon. Then improvements can be made 
to the legislation so the same mistakes will not be repeated.
<P>
	As far as the cabinet documents are concerned, according to the 
law of the land there is a limit. I did not pass this law. The law is 
there and we will respect the law. I am very surprised that the 
member is asking us not to respect the law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7084"> 7084 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister at the time, Madam Bégin, said that she is willing 
to testify. I do not know why the release of cabinet documents, 
if they exist, will help. I think the judge has all the things he needs 
to make a report and help us ensure the problems do not recur.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
Prime Minister is hiding behind excuses. First of all, the Canada 
Evidence Act is discretionary. He could choose to change that and 
release those documents if he wanted to. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	Second, when he talks about Monique Bégin, she has already 
said, and documents were uncovered yesterday, that the Deputy 
Prime Minister was incorrect in that. She said that she had refused 
frankly to testify. So those excuses simply do not wash.
<P>
	Justice Krever wants the documents and tainted blood victims 
want answers. That is all there is to it. That is all those people want. 
It is up to the Prime Minister now to decide whether he will release 
those documents or continue to hide behind those flimsy excuses.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister release the documents or will he 
continue to hide the truth. Just like John Turner in 1984, you have a 
choice, sir.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, you will address yourselves to me, 
please, in all the questions. I will permit the Right Hon. Prime 
Minister to answer if he so chooses.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Turner was the prime minister for three months and 
Parliament was not in session at that time. After that it was Mr. 
Mulroney. I am not here to protect anybody in that.
<P>
	There is a law of the land that protects cabinet documents. All 
the documents the law authorized us to give to the judge were given 
to the judge. We hope he will be able to report and make the 
recommendations needed so we can improve the situation.
<P>
	The Minister of Health in collaboration with his provincial 
colleagues already moved on the problem even before the judge 
made his report.

us to fine rhetoric and outlining interesting concepts. But what we 
want is an answer to some simple and specific questions. Let me 
put this one to him as if I were a constituent visiting him at his 
riding office.
<P>
	A young worker loses his job on December 31, 1996, having 
worked 26 fifteen-hour weeks. The minister must know, at least I 
hope he does, that this young man is eligible for employment 
insurance. Right? His neighbour  loses his job on January 5, after 
working 26 fifteen-hour weeks.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	I would like the minister to tell us whether or not this person will 
be eligible for employment insurance. This is not too complicated: 
Will six days make a difference in the way these two employees of 
the same company will be treated, yes or no? That question is clear 
enough, I hope.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate the interest 
shown by the opposition today. This is indeed a system I want to 
draw attention to.
<P>
	What this worker will get when he meets with his employment 
officer at the HRD centre-I wish to acknowledge the excellent job 
these people are doing in all our ridings-is someone who will 
have enough common sense and skill under the regulations we are 
developing to be able to assess the number of hours of work 
accumulated in the past year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this officer will certainly have more sense than this 
minister, I have no doubt about that, because the minister is unable 
to answer a question in this place.
<P>
	He would not be fit to do the job of a government employee, 
who, I am sure, will be able to answer questions, provided that the 
minister has given him clear instructions, which does not seem to 
be the case. Either no instructions were given, or the minister is not 
aware of them.
<P>
	I would like to put another question to the minister, since I did 
not get an answer to the first one. If a person who juggles three 
jobs, three 16-hour jobs, as mentioned by the minister, has to quit 
one of them, because working 48 hours a week at three jobs is not 
easy, is it not true that this person will be disqualified for quitting 
his or her job? Yes or no? I ask him to answer me as a government 
employee would, not as a Liberal minister.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> There we have it, Mr. Speaker. The 
opposition has objected to any change to an employment insurance 
system that is much more interesting. Those people voted against 
spending $800 million on active measures to help workers get back 
to work.
<P>
	This is a government that adjusts to the modern economy. The 
opposition party, on the other hand, has rejected every effort to 
reform the system, when we were trying to include the part time 
workers the people opposite are referring to. That is what the 
opposition is capable of.

colleagues in getting an answer from the minister.
<P>
	In its report tabled in October, the Liberal task force on people 
with disabilities recommended that the federal government 
continue to financially support national organizations for people 
with disabilities. In its report, the group said that the federal 
government's commitment in that respect should include, but not 
be limited to, core funding totalling $5 million per year.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us if this recommendation means that the 
financing of all organizations promoting the rights of people with 
disabilities will be restored to pre-1994 levels?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, before answering the opposition 
member's question, I should first congratulate the hon. member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury, and all the members of his task 
force whose exceptional work contributed to a greater 
understanding of people with disabilities.
<P>
	I must tell you that the Minister of National Revenue, the 
Minister of Finance, the Minister of Justice and myself were 
impressed by the quality of their work. The recommendation 
regarding the financing of organizations for people with disabilities 
was taken under consideration and we will follow up on it at the 
earliest opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead,

bad performance in the House before. The minister can 
congratulate his colleagues, he can tell me to get lost, but when it 
comes to people with disabilities, we expect action from the 
government, not just lip service.
<P>
	Let the minister wait. I am not through with my question. In any 
case, we are in no hurry, because we will not get an answer. Will the 
minister admit that his inaction amounts to shelving the report of 
his Liberal colleagues and confirms his contempt for the needs of 
people with disabilities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, comments by the opposition 
accusing us of showing contempt for people with disabilities are 
totally uncalled for. The reason people have so little respect for 
politicians is because we do not debate issues more intelligently. I 
am sorry, but this sanctimonious tone by people who do not even 
have an agenda is totally uncalled for.
<P>
	What I can tell you is that I was very proud, last week, when the 
ministerial council on Canada's social union, which is co-chaired 
by Minister Stockwell Day, representing the provinces, and myself, 
made the plight of people with disabilities a top priority. We are

Mr. Speaker, after three years of waiting farmers now see the 
agriculture minister's totally inadequate blueprint for changes to 
the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Farmers wanted a more accountable, flexible and transparent 
wheat board, one they could govern and call their own. Instead, the 
minister is proposing a powerless, partially elected board where the 
minister calls the shots.
<P>
	Ontario wheat boards have had their own farmers direct the 
boards for many years and, believe it or not, have been able to 
manage their own affairs.
<P>
	Why does the minister show such blatant disregard and lack of 
respect for Canadian farmers by not proposing that they run their 
own wheat board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the legislation that we have put 
before the House of Commons does in fact provide for a more 
accountable, more flexible, more  transparent Canadian Wheat 
Board, to use the language of the hon. gentleman.
<P>
	It does call for a majority of the board of directors of the 
Canadian Wheat Board to be elected by farmers across western 
Canada and of course the board itself will be accountable to that 
new board of directors including a producer elected majority.
<P>
	The fundamental difference between this government and that 
party is that party has an agenda with respect to the Canadian 
Wheat Board that would utterly destroy the institution and this 
government will defend it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not think the minister has read his own bill.
<P>
	The primary reason to reform the wheat board was to allow 
farmers to actually manage the board that they pay for. Instead, the 
minister wishes to retain his tight leash on the board by handing out 
the key management positions himself. He will appoint the 
chairman of the board. He will appoint the CEO of the Canadian 
Wheat Board. Can the minister not see that farmers want a board 
that is accountable to them and not to him?
<P>
	Why does the minister feel that a farmer elected board of 
directors is incapable of choosing its own chairman and selecting 
and hiring its own CEO?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fundamental point is that the 
direction and control of the Canadian Wheat Board will be placed 
in the hands of a board of directors, the majority of which will be 
producer elected across western Canada. The hon. gentleman

every six days.
<P>
	The hon. member does not even understand the status of women 
in this country. Canada is a country that believes in removing the 
barriers to every individual so they achieve their potential and be 
able to be independent contributors to society.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday Louise Comeau on behalf of people everywhere 
who are concerned about the future of the planet pointed out that 
Canada is not going to meet its international commitments on 
climate change. It appears that federal and provincial ministers will 
do nothing to rectify this deplorable situation when they meet on 
December 12.
<P>
	Will the Minister of the Environment reaffirm his personal 
commitment today and tell the House and the people of Canada that 
on December 12 he will acknowledge that Canada is not doing 
enough and that he will talk about concrete measures which will 
actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions to ensure Canada meets 
its international obligations by the year 2005?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me thank the hon. member for his question. It was the 
federal government at the recent CCME meeting of 
federal-provincial ministers of the environment that put climate 
change on the agenda in preparation for the meeting that my 
colleague, the natural resources minister, and I will attend.
<P>
	We have been very clear and transparent with the Canadian 
public that we made international commitments in 1992, as did the 
international community, and it is time that the international 
community meets its obligations.
<P>
	We have also said that Canada, together with most of the world, 
is falling behind in meeting those obligations. It is imperative that 
the federal government, together with the provincial government 
ministers of the environment and energy try to do everything in 
their power to come up with new initiatives to improve the 
voluntary program so we can, together with the world, meet our 
obligations together with industry and the NGO community.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to draw your attention to the question asked by the member for 
Nepean and the response by the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs in question period today.
<P>
	I would also like to draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, to 
Standing Order 37(1) which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Questions on matters of urgency may, at the time specified in Standing Order 
30(5), be addressed orally to Ministers of the Crown, provided however that, if in the 
opinion of the Speaker a question is not urgent, he or she may direct that it be placed 
on the Order Paper.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Order Paper allows, immediately following question period, 
for the tabling of documents and statements by ministers.
<P>
	It was quite obvious from the question posed and the response by 
the parliamentary secretary that this was a pre-planned and 
orchestrated question and answer to get the information out on the 
floor of the House of Commons. I do not think that it was a matter 
of urgency if it was orchestrated and pre-planned, as it obviously 
was.
<P>
	Since we are now moving into Routine Proceedings, that would 
allow the government to table that particular document. I think this 
type of information should be tabled at the appropriate time and 
question period is not the appropriate time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
the greatest of respect, I would submit that is not a point of order. If 
the member wishes to have a better read of what was offered by the 
parliamentary secretary he could read <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow. It will be 
there word for word verbatim.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Urgency is something in the eye of the 
beholder. The ``blues'' will be available and as there has been a 
change in Speaker I will ask that the ``blues'' be referred to His 
Honour the Speaker who was here earlier during question period.

and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this complex and difficult issue.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	It is an issue that is complex and difficult for Newfoundlanders 
and for Canadians, but less so for Quebecers. That having been 
said, I can understand that members across the way, who are 
particularly concerned by the effect that a vote in the House of 
Commons could have on the recognition of the rights of minorities, 
of native peoples, in the Constitution, may be thrown into disarray 
by the House's approval of the amendment proposed by the 
Province of Newfoundland.
<P>
	This needs to be acknowledged, and the Senate has given us an 
opportunity to take another look at this issue. I would note in 
passing that it is unacceptable for an unelected Chamber to be 
permitted to do what it has done, and the Bloc has made this point 
on a number of occasions.
<P>
	But, back to the main item. The opportunity we have been given 
to take another look at this issue allows us to bring out a number of 
facts: the fact that the Newfoundland referendum was not won by a 
large majority, quite the contrary, allowing us to say that the groups 
affected-and I am not calling them minorities-in this case, the 
various denominations, gave their approval. It is clearly a decision 
by Newfoundlanders regarding the organization of their schools, 
irrespective of the original provisions of the Constitution.
<P>
	Some people may have language concerns, but we know that for 
most the primary issue is denomination. You know that this is an 
extremely sensitive issue in Quebec, and that the Constitution of 
1867 provided guarantees, which at the time were supposed to be 
guarantees for anglophones in Quebec and francophones in 
Ontario, and later in other provinces. But back then, as 
denomination and language were largely, not exclusively, but 
largely linked, the guarantees given denominations were largely 
language guarantees.
<P>
	Today, urged on by a large percentage of the public, by 
extremely urgent constraints, the Government of  Quebec wants to 
reorga-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7092"> 7092 </A></B>
<P>
nize the entire school system on the basis of language, rather than 
denomination. But it is prevented from doing so by section 93.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Obviously, Quebecers who would like to change their school 
system and thus change the guarantees given in the Constitution to 
religious denominations are extremely interested in this vote, this 
referendum that was held in Newfoundland and in the amendment 
requested by the Government of Newfoundland.
<P>
	It is important to realize that the rights affected here are not 
those of an internationally recognized minority. These are 
guarantees given to religious denominations for which the province 
is, in the end, responsible.
<P>
	When this measure became before the House, the Bloc 
Quebecois voted in favour of the motion because it recognizes the 
right of the people of Newfoundland to organize their schools as 
they see fit, and also the fact that the people of Newfoundland 
would give religious denominations the guarantees they felt were 
required by law.
<P>
	In Quebec-and I say this quite frankly-using section 93 is 
more complicated because to do so we would have to accept the 
Constitution of 1982 which was imposed on us, and when I say us, I 
mean the people of Quebec and the National Assembly. This 
Constitution of 1982 is considered internationally as a denial of the 
fundamental right of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	Although the Constitution of 1982 that was imposed on us by 
force does not apply with any legitimacy, we nevertheless refer to 
the possibility of using section 93 as a way to deal with this urgent 
matter of reorganizing our school system.
<P>
	I would like to explain how urgent the problem is. You probably 
know that about 90 per cent of immigrants who settle in Montreal 
and become Canadian citizens in Quebec still remain largely in 
Montreal and the surrounding area. This means that the proportion 
of francophones has gone down steadily and that, since the 
guarantees provided under the Constitution prohibited us from 
organizing school boards along language lines, we have this absurd 
situation where the children of immigrants are required under Bill 
101-which became Bill 86-to study in French. That is the only 
thing left of the bill.
<P>
	However, many children do so in Protestant and therefore 
anglophone school boards, although they have French classes. 
However, in these French classes-and I have heard many 
comments from teachers and parents who send their children 
there-it is clear they are not part of a francophone whole but of an 
English-language organization that provides classroom teaching in 
French.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	It is public knowledge that when these young people graduate 
from high school and are no longer under the obligation to study in
<P>
French, most of them end up in one of the anglophone CEGEPs. So 
this is a problem for all of Quebec, but it is mainly concentrated in 
the Montreal region.
<P>
	The Montreal region has to live with the problem of the 
permanency of these guarantees which actually no longer 
guarantee anything at all as far as the Protestant religion is 
concerned. Since there are so many denominations, there is a 
tendency to teach religion outside of school, while the schools will 
teach ethics, but they will still have a so-called religious, 
anglophone organization.
<P>
	On the French side, there are parents in Montreal who want their 
children to go to Catholic schools, although as we saw recently in a 
survey, the majority is not in favour, so certain distinctions must be 
made.
<P>
	The important question is to find out whether the Montreal 
component of Quebec society will be able to integrate the children 
of immigrants and of new citizens of Quebec, which is vital to 
maintaining, if not improving, the position of the French language 
in Quebec.
<P>
	Accordingly, and I would like to come back to the nuances I 
mentioned, parents clearly want their children to continue to be 
educated in religious history and in religion in school. They do not 
want their children to remain ignorant about the existence of 
religion, authority, the Bible and the Gospel. On the other hand, 
they are very aware that, if schools are to teach religion, there will 
have to be schools for all the denominations that make up the 
religious mosaic of Montreal.
<P>
	This issue is therefore both complex and delicate. For 
Quebecers, and especially those in Montreal, it means that, if the 
Constitution as it stands is not changed, it will be impossible, for 
all intents and purposes, to reorganize the schools so as to promote 
integration.
<P>
	There was an attempt by the previous government to have the 
Supreme Court interpret a bill that did not pass, through a change to 
section 93. The result was ludicrous, because it split up school 
systems by maintaining the religious elements and tacking on 
French or English elements to them. The resulting fragmentation 
would be extremely expensive, but would not serve the 
fundamental needs I mentioned earlier.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	As a Quebecer, I can easily understand what the people of 
Newfoundland want, especially since they worked so hard for 
something that was imposed on Quebec, namely the patriation of 
the Constitution.
<P>
	For the rest of Canada, for francophones outside Quebec, whose 
assimilation, which is on the rise and  alarmingly so in some cases, 
seems a tragedy, the fact that the House of Commons can, by a 
majority vote, change what was guaranteed by the Constitution--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7093"> 7093 </A></B>
<P>
not to the minority but to certain groups-seems to pose a serious 
danger.
<P>
	Would this House vote for the elimination of the constitutional 
provisions that protect francophones in one western province or 
another?
<P>
	I know that, whether they speak French or English, my 
colleagues opposite who are concerned about this strongly oppose 
this measure and I can understand why.
<P>
	The result of this alarming assimilation rate in some parts of the 
country is that the rights of the francophone minority in Canada are 
being and will continue to be trampled. In this respect, the vote on 
this motion has set a precedent, not because it concerns religious 
guarantees but because it concerns guarantees entrenched in the 
Constitution. I can understand my hon. colleagues when they say 
that a line may have been crossed.
<P>
	We fought with all our energy for francophones outside Quebec. 
Our history-and there is no doubt about this in my mind-is the 
reason why the Official Languages Act exists. As a historian by 
training, I have no hesitation in saying that the Official Languages 
Act would never have seen the light of day, had it not been for the 
tumultuous language debates that took place in Quebec during the 
sixties.
<P>
	Had these debates not taken place, Prime Minister Trudeau 
would never have had any reason to impose on the whole country 
an act which a large number of Canadians did not want. This act 
was passed because people believed it would settle the Quebec 
issue. They were bitterly disappointed when they realized that this 
was not what Quebec wanted. What Quebec wants is to eventually 
have all the powers. It does not want an official languages act 
imposed from coast to coast.
<P>
	So this is an important vote. It was an important vote the first 
time and it is an important vote today.
<P>
	I believe that the existence in a mostly French speaking, 
sovereign Quebec of an English speaking minority would also help 
protect the French speaking minority in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Again, for the time being, I understand the hesitations of the 
members opposite. I understand them because, in spite of the very 
disappointing and shallow comments made by the heritage 
minister, life for francophones outside Quebec is not easy. These 
people have to perform daily heroics, as I have frequently seen 
during trips to the western provinces, Ontario and, occasionally, 
Acadia.
<P>
	Daily heroism is not conducive, among other things, to 
maintaining the enthusiasm of young people. We know that 
assimilation is rampant and almost a normal  phenomenon when 
these young people marry English speaking persons. It must be 
noted that the assimilation rate in Ontario is 38 per cent, and rises 
to 76 per cent the further west you go. The situation is getting 
worse, not better, and is a cause for serious concern.
<P>
	It will not be by refusing to pass the amendment sought by 
Newfoundland, which is facing an educational and denominational 
organization that is very difficult and complex for a small province, 
or by preventing Newfoundland from resolving this problem that 
the growing assimilation in western Canada will be halted. I think 
this issue will be, not resolved, for it is too late for that, but at least 
affected by energetic measures that we have yet to see, which will 
focus attention on the problem and slow down the rate of 
assimilation.
<P>
	One thing I would like to point out, and this still falls within the 
area we are talking about, is how many functionally or totally 
illiterate francophones there are outside Quebec, and how rare and 
inaccessible the measures are to help them learn to read in their 
own language. My point is that, in order to protect the future, we 
need to take active, energetic steps, rather than stand in 
Newfoundland's way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
debate triggered by Resolution No. 12 in this House on term 17 of 
the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada has, as the hon. 
member for Mercier said in her speech, brought to light all the 
misgivings we may have concerning constitutional change, 
particularly when it appears that a category of persons protected 
under the Constitution will find its rights diminished, if not done 
away with altogether, without its consent.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The question before us is not a partisan one, but a matter of 
analyzing the protection of categories of persons.
<P>
	I do not wish to interfere in the matter of the administration of 
Newfoundland's schools, but I can still analyze the situation. 
Obviously, their school system is a complicated one. To all intents 
and purposes, term 17 gives the legislator of the province of 
Newfoundland, what is, after all, a limited power over education in 
that it cannot legislate unless the various religious denominations 
are respected. Strange situations occur, like having six different 
school buses picking up children of six different religious 
denominations in one small locality, because these denominations 
must be given equal treatment. Perhaps, in 1996, this needs 
reviewing.
<P>
	A position definitely needs to be taken, when all is said and 
done. The more the debate progressed-and I have listened 
attentively, either in my office or in this House, to my hon. 
colleagues who have spoken on this-the more it struck me that it 
was not all that obvious that, in the September 5, 1995 referendum, 
each and every religious denomination constitutionally protected 
by term  17 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7094"> 7094 </A></B>
<P>
of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada had given 
consent.
<P>
	I cannot state the contrary, either, that every religious 
denomination refused to consent. In some parts of Newfoundland, 
people voted massively against the Newfoundland government's 
proposal, while in others they voted massively in favour. The vote 
was very divided, and the final vote was also very divided. So 
much so that basically, it is up to those who are primarily 
concerned to pass a final judgement on this issue. The 
Newfoundland government, rightly or wrongly, thought that on the 
basis of a referendum held on September 5, 1995, it had a mandate 
to pass a constitutional resolution to amend term 17 and ask the 
governor in council to refer the same question to this House, which 
is what happened.
<P>
	History will have to realize we did not initiate these proceedings, 
that the Newfoundland legislature acted first, and that the 
Government of Newfoundland drew its conclusions from the 
outcome of the referendum. I respect its decision although I have 
quite a few questions.
<P>
	It will be up to the voters of Newfoundland, if the government or 
the legislature did not act wisely, to pass judgment on their elected 
representatives who adopted the constitutional resolution before 
the House today.
<P>
	The situation that will be created by the vote in this House is not 
irreversible, in that a new legislature in Newfoundland, with 
different concerns, may request a constitutional amendment to 
revert to the previous legal position.
<P>
	In that respect, we are not doing anything irreparable. It would 
not be like amending the Canadian Constitution to say that from 
now, bills and court rulings will be in English only. That would be 
irreversible. So there is still a certain amount of flexibility here.
<P>
	In the end, although we are extremely reticent, because this is a 
mine field and we might be accused of having created a precedent 
today, in the end perhaps we can, by stretching our tolerance to the 
limit, accept the resolution before the House.
<P>
	However, this precedent should not be used to attack the rights of 
Franco-Ontarians or the rights of francophones in Manitoba or 
anywhere else, but especially in those two provinces where they 
enjoy constitutional protection, as in the province of New 
Brunswick, which subsequently protected its francophone 
minorities.
<P>
	The question is of course a sensitive one where Quebec is 
concerned, as the hon. member for Mercier said earlier.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	We know that in Quebec we have provisions governing schools 
and minority rights, which are now out of date. The only way to get 
around this would be perhaps to  have section 93 of the 
Constitution amended, while ensuring that those protected under 
this section are in agreement. There are ways to do so and these 
ways have already been used in other circumstances.
<P>
	I also understand the reticence of the Government of Quebec to 
apply under the amending formula of 1982, which it and all 
political parties in Quebec never recognized. I can understand its 
reticence in not joyously rushing, with honour and enthusiasm, to 
pass a resolution to call on this House to pass one as well to amend 
section 93, which would make things so much simpler in Quebec, 
as the hon. member for Mercier pointed out earlier, by enabling us 
to update our system of education.
<P>
	However, the Government of Quebec has not acted in order to 
show how touchy constitutional change is with respect to 
minorities, because a fairly strong consensus is emerging in 
Quebec. There is of course the 1982 padlock, which is more of a 
yoke than a padlock, obliging us to live with this situation.
<P>
	Those like me who were raised in a rural municipality of 
Quebec, where, two or three times a year, a collection was taken up 
in school for the survival of French-the hon. member for Mercier 
must remember that-get a little nervous when there is talk of 
taking rights away from classes of persons protected by the 
Constitution.
<P>
	That is why, as this debate draws to a close, I am telling you that, 
because of this uncertainty and in spite of all the misgivings I have, 
in the end, I could probably vote in favour of the proposal before 
us, while at the same time expressing the wish that the provisions 
contained in the Constitution that protect minority rights not be 
changed without first obtaining the consent of the minorities 
concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply want to say that the hon. 
member's speech reflects how sensitive this issue, which appeals to 
people's principles, really is.
<P>
	The whole debate, at least on our side, has led us to the 
conclusion that, in spite of some reservations, there are enough 
guarantees for the French speaking minority which, again, is not 
the one affected, and we can understand and accept why 
Government of Newfoundland made this request, to which the 
federal government has acceded.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The question is on the amendment. Is it

jobs, all he has to do is read the study from Ontario. It stated: 
``Harmonization would remove $3 billion from the Ontario 
economy, and kill jobs and economic growth''. That is why Ontario 
did not agree to harmonization. It knew this policy will kill jobs, 
jobs, jobs and not create them.
<P>
	In order to kill jobs, jobs, jobs in the Atlantic region, the Liberals 
will kill jobs, jobs, jobs in Ontario, Alberta and B.C. The Liberals 
will remove over $300 million each from the Ontario, Alberta and 
B.C. economies to bribe the Atlantic premiers into signing on to 
harmonization.
<P>
	Have the Liberals no understanding of economics? Do the 
Liberals not know that if Canadians feel insecure in their jobs they 
will not spend and purchase more than absolutely necessary? This 
failure to create retail sales will kill jobs, reduce federal income 
and force higher expenditures from federal tax dollars to finance 
unemployment insurance and social services. All this adds up to a 
bad deal.
<P>
	The Liberals will cost taxpayers more, create fewer jobs, stifle 
government revenues just so they can claim to have fulfilled a 
broken promise from their Liberal dead book.
<P>
	Since the Liberal policy will lower sales, end jobs and give 
companies leaner profits, the self-fulfilling prophecy of less retail 
sales will be reinforced.
<P>
	Again the Liberal understanding of economics is suspect. An 
increase in subsidy money acts as an increase in regional money 
supply, increasing inflation. The bribe money of a $1 billion is a 
regional subsidy that will further harm regional job creation 
through inflation. The Liberals have stated many times that 
inflation is a job killer, yet they will increase regional inflation, 
killing more jobs, just to keep this Liberal dead book promise.
<P>
	The Halifax Chamber of Commerce said that harmonization will 
increase new house prices by 5.5 per cent. Consequently that is 
going to lead, according to many experts, to much higher property 
tax within the area, this in an area that has difficult economic 
problems because of past government policies.
<P>
	The Liberals will do anything, regardless of the effect on 
Canadians, to try to prove that they have integrity, even though all 
Canadians know, thanks to the Liberal dead book, their integrity is 
very, very low.
<P>
	The finance minister will argue his harmonization policy to 
falsely fulfil a Liberal promise will not kill jobs. I would like to ask 
the finance minister if this is so, why is Greenberg stores closing 
five stores even before harmonization takes place? Greenberg has 
run a cost benefit analysis. It knows this policy will reduce profits 
and have acted accordingly. What cost benefit analysis has the 
finance minister conducted and will he release this information to 
Canadians? I think not because it is obvious he had done none.
<P>
	When the harmonization policy takes effect it will increase the 
cost of doing business to Atlantic province retailers. This much is 
already confirmed and known by the studies done in the provinces 
agreeing to harmonization.
<P>
	This will simply drive consumers near New England states to 
cross the line, purchase their goods where taxes are lower and add 
further problems to our current balance of payments. If the Liberals 
would only wake up and listen to Reform policies and try to 
implement something that would be far reaching from sea to sea, 
involving each and every province, then Reform would gladly have 
a look at their proposal. But they do things in a piecemeal fashion 
and cause all sorts of problems, pitting one province against 
another. It causes nothing but grief. It is no wonder that we are 
having difficulty in this land, trying to bring unity and 
understanding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I listened 
to the hon. member's comments I wonder if he is aware that when 
we harmonize two taxes that what happens is there are adjustments. 
That means some commodities go up and other commodities go 
down.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The Reform member talked about those things which are going 
up. He did not talk about the reality that in all of those provinces at 
different rates, 5 per cent in Newfoundland, 4 per cent in Nova 
Scotia and 4 per cent in New Brunswick, the total quantum of taxes 
being collected by government has been reduced. The reality is that 
money is being added to the pockets of consumers. The bottom line 
is there will be more disposable income for consumers which will 
create jobs. The whole philosophy that the member used, that it 
will kill jobs, is erroneous.
<P>
	The member talked about the Greenberg company. Its 
representatives have indicated that many of the Greenberg stores in 
the maritimes were marginal. They were losing money. They are 
talking about closing some of them. However, the bottom line is 
they were going to go out of business anyway. It has nothing to do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7098"> 7098 </A></B>
<P>
with the  implementation of tax, but hon. members opposite want to 
use that as some kind of analysis.
<P>
	The member did not talk about the positive things. One of the 
positive things is one collection authority. Right now each 
individual province has an administration to collect the retail sales 
tax and the federal government has an administration to collect tax. 
Why can the Reform Party not see that it makes sense to have only 
one administration collecting those taxes? Why can Reform 
members not see the great economic benefit that will be extended 
to the maritime provinces because they will not have to incur those 
costs?
<P>
	Yesterday I talked to a fellow accountant in St. Anthony, 
Newfoundland. He said it was one of the best things he has ever 
seen happen in the province. The province of Newfoundland will 
save millions and millions of dollars. That money will go back into 
an economy which as we know is very weak. That is a positive 
benefit of this legislation.
<P>
	Right now, small and medium size businesses, the job creators in 
this country, have to fill out forms for the retail sales tax and forms 
for the GST. There is not one of those small businesses that would 
not say that just having one form will be a tremendous 
improvement. Why is it that the Reform Party cannot see that?
<P>
	Then there is the business about pitting one province against 
another. We have three provinces now, which is three more than we 
had a year ago. A couple of years from now we will have twice as 
many as that again, including my province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to answer a question 
that was a speech but I will try.
<P>
	It is ridiculous for any member of this House to say: ``What are 
you talking about? This is something which Canadians want. After 
all, we got three provinces this year and two or three years down 
the road we will get a couple more and another five years down the 
road we might get one more''. What kind of a planning strategy is 
that?
<P>
	What about offering a package to all the provinces and give them 
a chance to study the issue and respond? No, not from the dictators 
that we have in this place. It is better just to throw it out there and 
say: ``This is a good deal. If you do not believe it, just ask us and 
we will tell you''.
<P>
	The Ontario studies have said it would cost that province $3 
billion. Ontario is not interested. I am surprised the member who is 
from Ontario would not take that into account. He should talk to a 
number of people in his own riding. Obviously a number of people 
in Ontario are extremely opposed to this.
<P>
	And the Liberals say that things are going to be cheaper overall. 
Add up the things which a family with an average income has to 
buy, like children's clothing,  heating oil and other necessities. All 
of a sudden they will have to pay more for those items. Those 
families do not buy luxuries by any means; they try to make ends 
meet. I am talking about the bulk of the people, the people who 
pack their lunch, put their head down and go to work every day. 
They have a terrible time trying to make ends meet because of the 
taxes they have to pay. If the member does not believe that, he 
should ask anybody who is out there working how well they are 
making out.
<P>
	To me this whole thing is a sham. It is a cover-up for a dead book 
error. The Liberals were going to scrap and kill the GST. They 
made big, brave statements in the campaign, but when push came 
to shove they did what we see today. It means nothing. If the 
Liberals want to make a proposal to the country as a whole, if they 
want to take Canada into consideration for the good of all 
Canadians, then they should show us something that does that and 
they should stop piecemealing around.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand there is only a little time so I will ask the member a very 
direct question. The member and his party have stated that they are 
opposed to the harmonization of the taxes. They keep pushing 
about killing, abolishing and scrapping. Is the Reform Party 
proposing that the current GST simply be eliminated totally?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is pretty obvious what we have 
said from the very beginning. Let us have a responsible 
government, let us balance the books, let us stop spending more 
than what we have. Get the balancing effect into place, then start 
giving some people a break in taxes and maybe the GST would be 
an excellent place to start.
<P>
	The Liberals are bringing in a harmonization plan that only 
affects a small number of Canadians in three provinces. It does not 
address the real issue all across the land. Other provinces are 
saying no to the plan and some are saying that they do not think so. 
What kind of decision making is that? Let us get this act together.
<P>
	It is time the Liberal government started consulting Canada 
instead of its caucus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened intently to the hon. member's presentation and 
to the subsequent questions and comments which came forward. I 
wonder if the hon. member is aware of three relevant points to this 
debate.
<P>
	One point relates to small business. I have talked to a number of 
small business people in Atlantic Canada. They have said that with 
the harmonization they will have one set of records to keep, one 
cheque to issue, one auditor to review their books and accounts. 
This will replace the current two sets of books, one for provincial 
sales tax and one for GST, two cheques to issue, and two auditors 
coming in from time to time to review their  accounting systems. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7099"> 7099 </A></B>
<P>
They have said this is a tremendous cost saving to them in the 
operation of their businesses.
<P>
	Second, in my home province the current provincial sales tax is 
11 per cent and the GST is 7 per cent. Is the hon. member aware 
that currently there is 7 per cent and 11 per cent on top of that 7 per 
cent on purchases of such items as automobiles, refrigerators, 
stoves, paper towels, Kleenex, bathroom tissue, paper supplies, all 
the normal things that we use day in and day out? To harmonize 
that into one system with a single 15 per cent tax is a savings. There 
is no question about it.
<P>
	According to the GST listing there are other products that will go 
on. For some of those a credit system will come forward but overall 
there will be a tremendous savings for the consumer and the 
business person. This proposal is supported by the majority of 
people in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Speaker, it is questionable how much 
support there is when I see petitions bearing 16,000 signatures of 
people who live in these provinces and object to the harmonization 
plan. I find it unusually strange that there has been some careful 
analysis done by some companies which were going to open new 
stores in 1997 but decided not to because of what was happening, 
that it was not good for business.
<P>
	There has been a very careful analysis regarding retail sales. 
Many retailers have come to the conclusion that retail sales would 
be way down. We all know that whenever retail sales are lost there 
is a good chance of job losses and the overall effect is not good.
<P>
	I think a very careful analysis has been done by both sides, not 
just on the cost savings because of the harmonization but also the 
increase in other problems that may arise. It has all been carefully 
done by those who have the expertise to do so.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to remember that statements are 
coming from people who have a great concern about this, people 
such as those at the Retail Council of Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am sorry, but 
the hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I thought if I was asked a question, I would 
have time to give the answer.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue on 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am going to speak 
about improvements to Canada's federal goods and services tax. 
There are over 130 improvements and the government is 
introducing them to simplify the GST and to increase its fairness. 
These changes do go a  considerable way toward replacing the GST 
as we know it with a better system.
<P>
	The GST as we know has been a source of much controversy. 
There is nothing as topical as something everyone dislikes and no 
one likes taxes. That is not surprising.
<P>
	It was not long ago in this country that nobody paid taxes 
because there were none. At the turn of this century there were no 
national income, corporate or sales taxes for anyone to pay, rich or 
poor. Believe it or not, in 1900 Ottawa got most of its revenues 
from customs duties. I suspect that this could be the reason our 
political ancestors promoted Canada as a great trading nation.
<P>
	But we live in a different time and in many ways a much 
different country, a country cited as one of the finest in the world in 
which to live. One of the distinguishing features that makes this 
country of ours the envy of others is the priority we place on quality 
of life. We are known the world over for social programs we have 
devised to ensure a decent quality of life for everyone.
<P>
	Taxes unfortunately are the duties and dues that we pay for the 
privilege of membership in this country and this society. The taxes 
we pay ensure a common richness. And let us face it, the GST is a 
tax that brings in $18 billion a year, or 13 per cent of the total 
federal revenues. Without a tax like it, our social programs would 
be in jeopardy, our debt problems would be deadly, and our 
national advantage as an international economy would be at risk.
<P>
	Having said all this, I want to say also that the government has 
been correct to criticize the GST as it was. In so doing, we were 
responding to what Canadians told us. Canadians told us that the 
GST was poorly conceived. They told us it was an outrageous 
example of overlap and duplication that came out of bureaucracies. 
They told us that the GST was cumbersome and that in particular it 
cost small business too much time, too much energy and too much 
money.
<P>
	The legislation being introduced now both simplifies and 
clarifies the application of the GST and also streamlines the 
administration. In doing this it introduces a greater fairness in the 
system and lays the foundation for a national harmonized sales tax. 
Taken together, the measures that we see in the bill represent a 
major step toward replacing the GST as we have known it. They 
respond to what Canadians have been telling us.
<P>
	In looking at alternatives to the GST, the all-party finance 
committee of the House went to Canadians for advice. It listened to 
nearly 500 witnesses and read more than 700 briefs from 
consumers, professionals, businesses and individuals. What did the 
Canadian people tell us?
<P>
	Canadians told us to do what is sensible. They told us to fix the 
problems that were there. They told us not to run off and create 
some other new or strange scheme to  adjust to, to do the same job 
as the GST and risk the same complexities. They said: ``We need 
the $18 billion, we understand that. The thing is in place now so fix 
the problems and get rid of the irritants. Fix the duplication and 
create sales tax harmonization. Fix the headaches that we have by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7100"> 7100 </A></B>
<P>
clarifying the rules and making it simpler and fairer''. This is 
precisely what this legislation starts doing. In so doing, it shows 
what can be accomplished by simply responding to what Canadians 
have told us to do.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Our other colleagues in the House will speak to the issue of sales 
tax harmonization which is in the legislation respecting three of the 
maritime provinces. Today I do want to comment more on the 
measures that address the headaches that affect all Canadians in 
this legislation and which are also being dealt with at the same 
time.
<P>
	In developing the changes, many of which are technical and 
sector specific, this government went straight to many of the 
groups, organizations, sector leaders and professional associations 
affected by the tax. We told them we had the tax and asked them 
what we could do with it to make their life somewhat easier. We 
wanted to know what we could do to fix their problems with this 
legislation.
<P>
	What we heard in response resulted in this legislation with about 
130 different changes affecting multiple sectors of our society. The 
package introduces measures to simplify the operation of the tax 
for many businesses and non-profit organizations. It introduces 
measures that make compliance easier and clarify confusing 
aspects of the tax. It also introduces measures to improve the 
fairness of the tax both for the consumers and for businesses.
<P>
	I wish to elaborate on a few points. First, well over one-third of 
these proposed modifications are aimed specifically at 
simplification. These include streamlining the tax treatment of 
charities and non-profit organizations. They include a simplified 
calculation of employee and shareholder benefits for Canadian 
businesses. Businesses can now make a one step tax calculation 
using the same information they use for their income tax purposes. 
The modifications include measures which simplify transactions 
related to used or second hand goods, which have become a 
significant part of the economic activity in this country.
<P>
	The package also includes proposals to clarify the application of 
the tax and, in particular, to ease the burden of compliance for 
small businesses. These changes were done to ensure that there is 
more precision in the application of the GST and that it does not 
complicate administration unnecessarily.
<P>
	They clarify certain educational services such as those provided 
and what we are now defining as public colleges and vocational 
schools as well as universities. They  involve streamlining the 
administration of tourist rebates, something that is very important 
in this country as an industry, and extend the eligibility to these 
rebates to non-resident businesses.
<P>
	There is also the much needed clarification of the GST in areas 
relating to financial services, to trusts and estates and changes to 
existing partnership rules.
<P>
	Finally, this package of measures restructures the GST to make it 
fairer for all Canadians. This is accomplished by ensuring 
competitive equity among businesses and applying the tax equally 
to all consumers. A variety of modifications restores the 
international competitiveness of Canadian service providers, 
equalizes the tax treatment of health care services and introduces a 
fairer application of the GST to housing rebates.
<P>
	The themes are simplification, clarification and greater fairness. 
These have all been the guiding principles in developing these 
changes. Many of these measures being proposed are technical and 
strategically aimed to deal with specific problems in certain 
sectors.
<P>
	In the amount of time I have here today it would be impossible 
for me to review each adequately or in sufficient detail. I know all 
the members have access to that material. Consequently, I would 
like to draw the attention of the House to some general examples of 
the improvements which are in this legislation.
<P>
	I should first remind the House and its various members of the 
invaluable contribution being made to the well-being of our 
Canadian society by Canadians and Canada's charitable 
organizations. However, when the GST was established the rules 
were developed to address the activities of the largest charities. 
Many smaller charities have found these rules to be too onerous for 
their use. Yet combined together these small charities, precisely the 
smaller charities, do much of the charitable work in the country.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	This legislation proposes new and simpler rules for all charities 
but, in addition, new rules were specifically designed for smaller 
charities which will simplify compliance for the GST for the 
smaller charitable group. As a result of these changes significantly 
fewer charities, about 10,000 fewer to be exact, will have to 
register for the GST at all. For those that do remain registered, 10 
to 12 per cent of all charities, the rules will be simpler, particularly 
for fundraising activities, for filing returns and for claiming 
rebates. I think that is very important and very positive. This will 
help our charity sector increase the range of its activities in a time 
that fiscal restraint is forcing many to become more dependent on 
the network of goodwill that exists among our volunteers and our 
community based organizations.
<P>
	Further, a number of changes are proposed to make the federal 
sales tax system fairer in its application in the health care sector. 
We all know especially with our aging  population how important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7101"> 7101 </A></B>
<P>
the health care sector is to Canadian society and how much more 
important it will be in the future.
<P>
	There will be changes to the treatment of services provided by 
health care practitioners who are not medical doctors or dentists. A 
greater degree of fairness is being introduced to exempt from GST 
the services these practitioners provide. For example, the list of 
exempt health care practitioners will be extended to include 
dietitians who meet the criteria for health care professionals in five 
provinces. As a result, using that example, dietitians will be able to 
provide their services exempt from federal sales tax to individuals, 
health care facilities and public sector bodies starting January 1, 
1997.
<P>
	An added advantage of this measure is that it increases 
professional regulation of health care practitioners who are 
requesting an exemption. This makes their services more 
financially accessible to the public.
<P>
	A number of changes are also proposed to extend or clarify the 
zero rating provisions as they apply to certain medical devices and 
associated services. For example, the zero rating of hospital beds 
will be extended to purchases by all health care facilities, including 
long term health care facilities. Currently the sale of hospital beds 
is zero rated only when purchased by a hospital or by an individual 
with a written order from a medical practitioner. I think we can see 
that there are positive elements in the legislation.
<P>
	The zero rating of the cost of modifying a car, for instance, to 
meet the needs of an individual using a wheel chair will also be 
expanded. Orthopaedic devices will be zero rated when they are 
made to order for an individual or when they are supplied under 
prescription.
<P>
	These are sensible changes which are being introduced at an 
appropriate time, as I said before, when the needs of an aging 
population are increasing. I do not think there would be any 
argument in this House that these are beneficial to certain segments 
of Canadian society.
<P>
	I go to another sector, the municipal sector. We used to have 
various complications concerning the GST, for instance, garbage 
collection. These will be alleviated under this new legislation. The 
collection of garbage will now be exempt from GST when it is 
provided by a municipality or by a government.
<P>
	Similarly, services to remove snow, ice and water, maintain 
water distribution, sewage or drainage systems or repair and 
maintain roads and streets and sidewalks, these all will now be 
exempt from GST when they are supplied by the municipality. This 
government proposes also that the collection of recyclable 
materials be included in the exempt provision for the collection of 
garbage. That is important when we are trying to help our 
environment in this country. These efforts, simplification and 
clarification in the application of GST,  will have a beneficial effect 
for the environment and for different levels of government, namely 
the municipal level.
<P>
	There is another sector this provision has a beneficial effect on, 
the agricultural sector. Here again the list of zero rated supplies is 
being expanded to include automated and computerized feeding 
systems, specified mulchers, crop shredders, transportable 
conveyers and elevators, and certain wagons and trailers.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	It is always important when we develop legislation that we treat 
all the sectors across this country, whether it is industrial, 
agriculture, municipal levels of governments or health care sectors, 
that there is something that is going to help a number of the 
organizations in this land.
<P>
	There are changes to the existing rules for the benefit of builders 
of subsidized residential complexes to ensure that they also have 
equitable treatment for themselves as builders, together with 
non-subsidized housing.
<P>
	There is a broader range of goods and services relating to 
international transportation which can and will also be zero rated, 
as will services provided by purchasing representatives to 
non-resident businesses.
<P>
	These things are technical. I do not think they are the most 
exciting but I know to the people who are concerned with this 
legislation they are important changes. They will have a benefit in 
areas where people were complaining to us before. I know the 
members of the finance committee heard these complaints, and this 
legislation is the response.
<P>
	There are many other proposed changes to the tax treatment of 
international transactions that will improve the administrative 
efficiency and the competitive advantages of Canadian businesses. 
I could go on with more examples but these changes address the 
inequities, the complexities and the unnecessary obstructions that 
have made the GST so unpalatable to Canadian citizens, Canadian 
businesses and different levels of governments.
<P>
	They bring needed simplicity, clarity and fairness where issues 
sometimes were cloudy. In making these changes, this government 
has responded in large measure to not what a government wanted, 
or the government side of this House wanted, but what Canadians 
told us were problems.
<P>
	In addressing these technical amendments to the GST, we are not 
talking only about the harmonized provinces. We are talking about 
across Canada. It is a response to the irritants in a system of a badly 
designed tax and we are trying to improve it. This is not a perfect 
world. There is no legislation that is perfection that I have ever 
seen in this House any former House or probably any future House. 
But we are moving forward with improvements.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7102"> 7102 </A></B>
<P>
	That is what legislation does. That is our job as responsible 
people trying to administer fair taxes, simpler taxes and equitable 
taxes in a country.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> It is incredible to listen to people heckling while 
one is trying to complete a speech but that is part of standing up and 
debating in this House.
<P>
	We have to understand that this bill accomplishes a major step in 
replacing the GST as it was. In my opinion it is moving toward a 
better system. I would like this country at some point in time to be 
a fully harmonized system but life is not perfect, we as members of 
this House are certainly far from perfect, and other legislatures are 
far from perfect also.
<P>
	What we do is make improvement and gradually things move in 
the right direction and maybe one day we will have the perfect 
solution for people who think there are perfect solutions. Right now 
we are working toward improvements.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I will allow a 
very short question and a very short answer. There is one minute 
left in this debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a very brief question, and I hope the answer will be 
equally brief.
<P>
	I listened to my colleague, the member for London West, speak 
of her pride in being associated with such a bill. I would like to ask 
her what about this bill she is proud of. First of all, it is costing 
Canadians $1 billion in political compensation for a political 
agreement, when Quebec had already gone ahead with 
harmonization at no cost to the federal government.
<P>
	Second, how can she be proud of her government, when the 
promise that it made-and that was part of the reason it won the 
election-was to scrap the GST, not to conceal it in the price, not to 
conclude harmonization agreements with the maritimes at a cost of 
$1 billion?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It being5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Mr. Speaker, the short answer is that I am very 
proud of my government because it responds to the needs of 
Canadians. It has travelled across the country and has listened to 
people. If the hon. member had listened to my speech, many 
examples were given to him. There are 130 exact examples in this 
legislation which he can read. Constituents in all ridings, I do not 
care in which province, will benefit from this legislation.

	The House resumed from October 10 consideration of the 
motion; and of the amendment
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, along with many of my 
colleagues in this House I have been lobbied by firefighters from 
right across the country with respect to the need for a Canadian 
Operation Respond test site.
<P>
	Therefore, it is my privilege to rise in the House, on behalf of the 
Minister of Transport, to announce the government's support for 
the private member's initiative undertaken by the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway. The Government of Canada agrees with the 
principle that, wherever it is reasonable to do so, full support 
should be provided to firefighters as well as to other emergency 
response personnel. M-241 has this goal in mind and, for that 
reason, we support it.
<P>
	I should, however, clarify some of the terms used in the motion. 
Let me begin with the title ``Operation Respond''. In the early 
1990s the International Association of Firefighters in both Canada 
and the United States proposed that a system be established to 
provide firefighters with immediate information on contents of 
trucks and railway vehicles.
<P>
	The essential elements were: first, each means of transport 
intended to carry dangerous goods must be assigned a unique 
identification number.
<P>
	Second, on loading dangerous goods the operator of the means of 
transport report to a central computer the identification number and 
details of a load. On delivery, the operator would report a second 
time to have the entry deleted.
<P>
	Third, computers, similar to those used by police forces for 
direct access from their vehicles to centrally located computer files 
be provided to fire department vehicles so that at the scene of a 
transportation accident the firefighters could access the central 
databank to find out what was carried in the involved means of 
transport.
<P>
	A study conducted in 1993 by the U.S. National Research 
Council, under the guidelines of the U.S. National Academy of 
Sciences, concluded that the generation and handling of the data 
needed to give effect to such a system for all dangerous good 
shipments was too expensive to justify the implementation. 
However, it was noted that some companies, notably railways, 
already had the necessary data in computerized form.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7103"> 7103 </A></B>
<P>
	The decision was taken in the U.S. to support the development 
and use of software which could access such existing data. The 
organization established to do this is Operation Respond Institute 
Inc.
<P>
	Since Operation Respond began in 1992 its software has been 
established in 40 locations. Companies whose data can be accessed 
using the software currently comprise two trucking companies and 
16 railway companies.
<P>
	Operation Respond is a program established through contractual 
agreements between Operation Respond Institute Inc. and data 
providers such as railway companies and between Operation 
Respond Institute Inc. and data users such as fire departments.
<P>
	We agree that Operation Respond, as operated in the United 
States, be demonstrated right here in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	With respect to the statement that the Minister of Transport 
should move rapidly to establish a Canadian test site, there are no 
regulatory roadblocks or initiatives required in order for Operation 
Respond to operate in Canada as it operates in the United States. It 
would appear from the motion that what is wanted is a champion to 
promote the initiative.
<P>
	I can advise that the Minister of Transport will act in this role for 
the establishment of a demonstration site. To promote the 
establishment of the demonstration site, the Minister of Transport 
will request CN and CP to participate in the program. They will be 
asked to make available their data on the contents of railway cars in 
the manner required by Operation Respond software.
<P>
	Further, the Minister of Transport will assist financially in the 
establishment of Operation Respond software in a Canadian 
location which includes installation and training. In selecting the 
Canadian test site referred to in the motion, we considered past 
accidents in communities which have significant rail and highway 
traffic. I can advise the House that an informal agreement has been 
reached between the Burnaby Fire Department and Transport 
Canada to establish the Canadian demonstration site in Burnaby, 
B.C.
<P>
	Although Burnaby, B.C. has not had frequent accidents, it has 
had a higher rate than similar communities. I am sure the member 
for Burnaby-Kingsway would agree that a Burnaby test site 
would be highly appropriate. The Minister of Transport supports 
the establishment of a Canadian demonstration site for Operation 
Respond. I encourage all my colleagues in the House to support the 
private member's Motion No. 241.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Motion No. 241, a motion 
which the Reform Party supports. It was put forward by the 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway.
<P>
	The motion deals with the protection of firefighters and other 
emergency health personnel who are often confronted with 
dangerous situations. In particular, this motion deals with 
hazardous materials.
<P>
	The situation that exists currently is that in the event of an 
accident, firefighters can get their information from CANUTEC. 
Unfortunately, it takes about eight to ten minutes for this 
information to be available. This is valuable time that can be used 
to save firefighters, the surrounding public and the communities 
where the hazardous situation has arisen.
<P>
	What the member for Burnaby-Kingsway proposes is that we 
have a test site for a rapid response situation where information can 
be determined on site within a minute. All a firefighter would have 
to do to get information on a vehicle or train that has crashed is put 
it into a computer system. The computer will then be able to tell 
them immediately what hazardous materials are actually sitting in 
the train or truck. The availability of this information will save 
lives.
<P>
	The condition of support of this motion is that it does not cost 
more money and that it does prove to be a more efficient way of 
protecting firefighters and other emergency health care personnel. 
The good thing we have right now is that the software is already 
available because it is being used in the United States. The 
Americans are prepared to give that to us free of charge.
<P>
	Firemen also have laptops and modems available to them. 
Therefore, it is not going to cost more money. Indeed, it will be 
interesting to see what the outcome will be of the emergency 
response situation.
<P>
	Firefighters all over the country have been doing a lot of work in 
pursuing this idea and, in particular, Ed Pakos, the president of the 
Victoria Fire-Fighters Society and firefighters on Vancouver 
Island. The motion is supported by the International Firefighters 
Association, the Canadian Police Association, the United Transport 
Union and the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs.
<P>
	I would also like to speak on an ancillary topic which is very 
much related to this issue and involves the protection of firefighters 
and other emergency personnel. This is something that firefighters 
have been pushing forward for a long time. It involves the 
disclosure of the health of individuals if the emergency personnel 
are confronted with body fluids.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	For example, in the case of a car accident, the firefighters, police 
officers and medical personnel attend to the victims on the site. 
Glass can be present. Body fluids are around. When emergency 
personnel come into contact with those body fluids they run the 
risk of acquiring some potentially lethal diseases such as AIDS 
through HIV transmission or hepatitis B or C.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7104"> 7104 </A></B>
<P>
	The government ought to put forward a bill that will ensure that 
good Samaritans and emergency health care personnel have a right 
to this information, a right to know whether the people they are 
helping are carrying a deadly disease. The government voted 
against this, much to my shock and disgust, when members of the 
Reform Party put forward some very strong and persuasive ideas 
on how we can protect the health of all emergency personnel.
<P>
	This idea has the support of firefighters, police associations and 
medical personnel across the country. It seems absolutely unfair 
that when good Samaritans and emergency personnel respond to an 
emergency and come in contact with body fluids, they must have 
the right for their safety and the safety of their families to know the 
health status of the individuals in need.
<P>
	The government believes that good Samaritans do not have the 
right to this information. It believes that protecting the individual 
who is sick is more important than protecting the individuals who 
help them. This is not a situation where the rights of sick people are 
abrogated. This simply makes good common sense.
<P>
	When Motion No. 241 was put forward, when firefighters came 
to us with suggestions about the motion, they also suggested ideas 
for legislation that could be used by them to get information on the 
sick or injured people they may be dealing with and whose body 
fluids they may come in contact with.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we have not seen any motion to that effect put in 
the House. I believe it is essential for protection of all individuals 
involved in emergency health care procedures to have the right to 
know the health status of individuals they are dealing with when 
they are exposed to the body fluids of these people. As I said 
before, these body fluids can pose a significant and sometimes fatal 
risk to the good Samaritans and health care personnel.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports Motion No. 241, on the condition 
that it does not cost the taxpayers any more money and that it will 
improve the current situation. We hope that it will because we 
believe that the protection of these hard working firefighters, 
police officers and other emergency response teams who are 
confronted by these hazardous situations must be protected. They 
are courageous and honourable people who protect all of us and we 
in turn must do the same to protect then.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to speak in favour of Motion No. 241. I would 
like to thank the member for Burnaby-Kingsway for bringing this 
to our attention today.
<P>
	As I have talked about this issue with a lot of firefighters and I 
have learned a lot about firefighting. The reality is that firefighting 
is not exclusively about fighting fires. It seems that less than 50 per 
cent of the  time is spent in conventional firefighting and the 
balance in attending accidents.
<P>
	The motion is on the movement of hazardous materials and as 
our society seems to be getting more and more sophisticated, it 
seems to be happening more and more often.
<P>
	About a year ago January I was in British Columbia. I took the 
train through the Rocky Mountains and I probably passed close to 
the member's riding. I discovered that there had been a tremendous 
number of derailments out there. It must be very difficult for 
firefighters who arrive at the scene not to know what the contents 
of those cars are or exactly how to deal with them.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	In an era of technology and software development it appears 
very appropriate that we develop Operation Respond, which 
already exists in the United States. As some other members have 
said, it is very easy to clone that system in Canada.
<P>
	The minister has been very supportive in requesting that our two 
major railways participate in that plan. That minister is willing to 
provide funds toward the purchase of the software and the training 
of those people who will be engaged in the test site in Burnaby.
<P>
	It is not just about the contents of these carriers. There is also the 
issue of training personnel in the evacuation of communities based 
on what sort of hazardous material is on these carriers.
<P>
	I would like to thank the Oshawa firefighters, the Clarington fire 
department, the Scugog fire department, which is a volunteer fire 
department, and also the one in Oxbridge that brought this matter 
to my attention.
<P>
	We talked about this time and time again. I have sent many 
letters to the minister and so forth. I am very happy that the 
government and the member for Burnaby-Kingsway have been 
able to come to an agreement. It shows how a government can work 
with the opposition. All parties in the House can work together to 
come to very sensible conclusions and to develop good legislation 
for the protection of our people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to private member's 
Motion No. 241, brought forward by my NDP colleague from 
Burnaby-Kingsway. He has worked very hard on this important 
motion to bring it to our attention for which I congratulate him.
<P>
	Motion No. 241 deals with a subject matter that I also have been 
supporting and have done a lot of work on over the years. That is 
why I want to say a few words today. It is important to note that 
another one of our colleagues from the New Democratic Party, the 
member for Winnipeg Transcona, has worked very hard on this  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7105"> 7105 </A></B>
<P>
issue. We all thank the parliamentary secretary and the minister for 
responding in the way they have.
<P>
	The motion essentially deals with the establishment of a 
Canadian test site for Operation Respond, a computerized database 
of hazardous materials that would improve safety for firefighters 
and help save lives and property.
<P>
	There is no question in my mind that this is a critical motion 
which every member of this House should support. At the same 
time the Minister of Transport should be as we speak preparing to 
establish this test site. As the parliamentary secretary indicated a 
few minutes ago, I believe that is what he is doing. I am very 
pleased to hear that tonight and I recognize the support the 
government has given to this motion.
<P>
	This is an issue that is most important to Canada's firefighters. It 
was first brought to my attention by Saskatchewan firefighters 
during one of their lobby days on Parliament Hill. The firefighters 
annual lobby effort is one of the most effective I have been subject 
to in my eight years in Parliament. I congratulate the firefighters on 
that.
<P>
	I also want to congratulate Doug Coupar who was the Canadian 
director of the International Association of Firefighters. His efforts 
were instrumental in the success of this lobby. During that lobby 
they told me that firefighters dealing with incidents involving 
hazardous materials need to know precisely what chemicals are 
present and how to handle them. The faster they can obtain this 
information the more effectively they can protect their own safety 
and that of the community around them.
<P>
	The situation today is not adequate. Operation Respond, on the 
other hand, is a system that gives firefighters firsthand access to 
information that they need by use of a laptop computer and a 
modem installed in their emergency vehicles. They simply enter a 
number which has been assigned to each load travelling on the rails 
or highways into that laptop and within one minute they can know 
exactly what materials are onboard that vehicle which may have 
been involved in an accident. They will know what safety 
precautions to take and how to contain the incident they have 
encountered more effectively.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	Compare that to the 10 minutes to several hours that it 
sometimes takes under the existing system. The sources of the 
information for Operation Respond are databases kept by the 
carriers. The system is applicable to all forms of transportation in 
its ideal usages, trains, trucks, ships and aircraft. I hope we will be 
able to find a way to ensure that this happens. Operation Respond 
makes a tremendous amount of sense.
<P>
	In May of this year I wrote a letter to the Minister of Transport. I 
stated: ``I have recently met with Canadian  firefighters who are 
interested in securing a Canadian test site for a program they refer 
to as Operation Respond. I know you are familiar with the proposal 
and I think you were supportive of the concept prior to your 
appointment as Minister of Transport.
<P>
	``The concept of identifying hazardous materials in transit is a 
very important one because the most dangerous aspect of 
firefighting is responding to incidents involving hazardous 
materials. Firefighters in Canada are especially hampered, they 
say, by a lack of information available at such incidents, especially 
within the critical first minutes upon arrival at the scene.
<P>
	``Firefighters in Canada are urging you to make Operation 
Respond's Canadian test site a priority of your government by 
committing staff and resources to the project immediately. I am 
writing today to say that I agree with the firefighters' request and I 
trust that you will make this commitment without delay''.
<P>
	That was the letter I sent to the minister after the Saskatchewan 
firefighters along with their colleagues from across Canada visited 
me here in Ottawa.
<P>
	In June the minister responded to my letter. A major part of his 
response to me was that the CANUTEC system, the system in place 
today, seemed to be working just fine but there was always room 
for improvement. The minister said there were Canadians currently 
in the United States monitoring the Operation Respond system and 
he suggested that perhaps this fall there might be recommendations 
coming forward to change the way the Canadian system operated.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see today that perhaps the experience in the 
United States has had an effect here in Canada and it is as a direct 
result of the firefighters lobby and their request that these matters 
take place.
<P>
	In light of how important this issue is and in light of how 
supportive of change the firefighters are, I think it is time that we in 
Canada took action.
<P>
	The motion in front of us today gives every parliamentarian in 
Canada a chance to confer with the minister, the cabinet and the 
department and say that firefighters know what they are talking 
about. By voting in support of this motion today we may actually 
be doing something that will one day prevent a serious human 
accident and perhaps even save a life.
<P>
	I was proud to support the call of firefighters in May and I am 
proud to support this motion today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in support of Motion No. 241 which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the Minister of Transport should proceed 
rapidly to establish a Canadian test site for Operation Respond, a computerized 
database of hazardous materials, that would improve safety for firefighters and help 
save lives and property.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7106"> 7106 </A></B>
<P>
	The previous member mentioned and I would like to repeat that 
the International Association of Firefighters has done an excellent 
job of making its case to members of Parliament on all sides of 
the House. It has provided exceptional information. It has made 
its arguments clearly and it has asked us to consider its request 
for this test site.
<P>
	We are often approached by many groups that would like to see 
certain initiatives or changes made in legislation. If they all 
followed the model that the International Association of 
Firefighters followed, we would achieve many more constructive 
amendments to legislation if that model were followed.
<P>
	I want to also commend Doug Coupar, who was the then director 
of the IAFF. I also had an opportunity to deal with Mr. Elliot 
Hastings who has been carrying on on its behalf.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	There was some concern in the first hour of debate some weeks 
ago that there was a position being formed. I can assure all 
members and certainly firefighters that the points raised even in the 
initial debate had been carried back to the minister.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Hamilton West, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Transport, listened carefully and 
advocated on behalf of this motion because it was the right thing to 
do. Who else would now better what they can do than the 
firefighters themselves?
<P>
	I understand as a result of the advocacy of members on all sides 
of this House that there is an intent today to have this debate close a 
little early. That would allow us to have a vote today and not in one, 
two or three months from now. I believe now, as a result of the 
work of all the people, including the firefighters, that the case has 
been made very clear and the very right thing to do is pass this 
motion and get on with it.
<P>
	I would like to make one final announcement that the firefighters 
and the police officers of Canada will be pleased about. Yesterday 
there was another draw in the private member's process and a 
motion that I had submitted has been drawn for consideration by 
the House. That motion is another of the recommendations of the 
IAFF. It is to establish the public safety officers compensation fund 
which would establish a fund to receive gifts and bequests for the 
benefit of families of officers and firefighters who have lost their 
lives in the line of duty. That will be coming before this place when 
we return after the Christmas break.
<P>
	On behalf of all members I want to thank the IAFF for the 
excellent job it did to make its case convincingly and to earn the 
respect and the support of members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have followed this debate rather closely and I would like 
to add a couple of words that I have not heard arise in the debate 
yet.
<P>
	Firefighters in Surrey have brought to my attention that their 
main problem was the time element, the time element of getting to 
the scene, identifying what they were dealing with and taking the 
appropriate response.
<P>
	The second point I have not heard in debate and one I would like 
to put on the record for consideration when this is activated is the 
nature of the elements they are dealing with. On occasion there is 
the transporting of more than one particular hazardous chemical. 
The second one may not be hazardous in itself but when these mix 
they are dealing with a totally different kind of response than they 
would if they were dealing with one on its own.
<P>
	That was stressed very clearly to me by the firefighters that 
sometimes that entails a second call, a wait and this kind of thing. I 
would like to bring that to the attention of those who would be 
addressing this situation in the future to certainly keep that in mind, 
that this operation or program would certainly cut down that time 
element and address that issue.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ENDANGEREDSPECIES">ENDANGERED SPECIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Bill C-65, the Canadian Endangered Species Protection Act, is 
the first federal piece of legislation dealing with listing protection 
and recovery of a variety of endangered species to fall within 
federal legislative jurisdiction. It covers migratory birds, fish and 
marine mammals, species that cross international boundaries and 
all species found on federal lands or within Canadian coastal 
waters.
<P>
	The bill prohibits the killing, harming, harassing, capture, taking 
or possession of an endangered or threatened species as defined in 
the bill, as well as the destruction of residences of individual 
members of such species, including their dens or nests. It creates 
several means of enforcing its provisions, including citizens' rights 
to take civil actions in some circumstances and penalties for breach 
of the offence provision such as fines of up to one million dollars.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The bill is intended to put the federal government in a leadership 
position in a national endangered species regime that will involve 
the provinces in a number of key areas. Four provinces already 
have endangered species legislation in place but may have to 
update it to meet the obligations which the governments have all 
agreed in principle to meet under the National Accord for the 
Protection of Species at Risk signed at Charlottetown on October 2, 
1996.
<P>
	In the accord the provinces and the federal government have 
agreed to establish complementary legislation and programs to 
provide for effective protection of species at risk throughout 
Canada, including the provision of protection for habitat of 
threatened or endangered species. Also agreed was their 
participation in the Canadian Endangered Species Conservation 
Council which would be established under Bill C-65.
<P>
	The bill reflects many years of hard work by environmental 
groups and other stakeholders who have advocated the adoption of 
federal legislation to protect endangered species as part of an 
approach to conserving biological diversity within Canada. 
Witnesses  representing the agricultural community have made an 
important contribution to the debate.
<P>
	There are currently 275 species of wildlife included in the 
COSEWIC list, which is an organization that identifies species 
which are endangered or threatened. Ten of these 275 species are 
extinct and 11 are extirpated, which means they no longer live in 
the wild.
<P>
	For a number of years opinion polls have shown that Canadians 
have expressed a consistently high level of concern about 
endangered species. It is widely seen as an area in which the federal 
government should exercise a strong leadership role.
<P>
	The majority of species at risk are in trouble because of threats to 
their habitat by human activity. Biological diversity, sometimes 
called biodiversity, means the variety of life in an area, and the area 
could be as small as a decaying log or as large as the entire country. 
It includes the variety of species and ecosystems on Earth, and the 
genetic differences of organisms, communities and populations.
<P>
	There are many reasons to preserve biodiversity, including its 
intrinsic value, the rate at which it is disappearing, its value as a 
source of scientific knowledge and aesthetic pleasure, human 
dependence on it for food, medicines and other products, its 
contribution to moderating climate, soil conservation and pest and 
disease control, and our lack of knowledge about the biodiversity 
that exists in Canada and the consequences of failing to preserve it.
<P>
	Canada was the first industrialized country to ratify the United 
Nations Convention on Biological Diversity signed at the 1992 
earth summit in Rio de Janeiro. The convention entered into force 
in December 1993.
<P>
	The bill deals with critical habitat, a concept that is key to the 
American Endangered Species Act. The habitat aspect of the bill is 
limited by the bill's primary focus on the residence of a creature in 
a number of key areas, in that a residence is a much smaller area 
than a creature's habitat and preservation of the residence alone 
would often be insufficient to ensure the survival of an individual 
let alone a species.
<P>
	I ask the parliamentary secretary, what are the stumbling blocks 
to providing more comprehensive protection for habitat and should 
the bill be amended in this respect?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank the member for his concern and for his question. He 
has been a very active member on the environment committee.
<P>
	The original proposal for the endangered species legislation 
covered only 4 per cent of Canada's land mass. The new 
legislation, Bill C-65, extends this 4 per cent coverage to 60 per 
cent. While the legislation does not  extend the coverage to 100 per 
cent, 
<P>

<P>
from sea to sea to sea, it is important to note that the legislation is 
part of a larger framework.
<P>
	In October 1996 the federal Minister of the Environment and the 
provincial ministers responsible for wildlife protection agreed in 
principle to a national accord to protect species at risk. Under this 
accord the provinces and territories are co-operating with the 
federal government to ensure that complementary legislation and 
programs are put into place.
<P>
	The member asked if there are stumbling blocks to 
comprehensive habitat protection. I would prefer to think of these 
as challenges and opportunities.
<P>
	Endangered species protection in Canada is dependent on the 
co-operation of different levels of government, of the public, the 
private and non-governmental sectors, of groups, organizations and 
individuals.
<P>
	Over 90 per cent of Canadians want endangered species 
legislation. Canadians from all walks of life want species to be 
preserved and to be protected. They are our most important allies. 
Some Canadians may have concerns about how the implementation 
of the endangered species legislation will affect them. It is 
important to remind the House of the fantastic contribution that 
ranchers, farmers and other private land owners have made to 
protect endangered species.
<P>
	The burrowing owl program in Alberta is one fine example. My 
mother-in-law in southern Ontario supports habitat protection for 
migratory birds. She lives on the edge of 100 acres of a heritage 
wetland along the shore of Lake St. Clair.
<P>
	Yes, we have challenges but we also have opportunities and 
partnerships that have been long established. The Canadian people 
want endangered species legislation and the Canadian people will 
help us preserve and protect species at risk.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> A motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted.
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow, pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.10 p.m.)
