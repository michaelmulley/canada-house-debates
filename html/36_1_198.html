country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of us is in a position to contribute to promoting French

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since the first Sommet de la Francophonie, the

exchanged views in an atmosphere of harmony, not only on 
cultural aspects, but also on the scientific, technical, 
economic and social aspects of their relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May this Semaine de la Francophonie continue to unite peoples 
and countries and bring them ever closer, in areas of 
complementarity in which they can enjoy mutually advantageous 
exchanges and collaboration in areas as diversified as culture, 
social development and economic development.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, PSAC employees are being shafted.  They are on strike 
because their ability to engage in binding arbitration has been 
taken away from them.  All PSAC employees want is to be treated 
fairly and to get back to work.  As a result of the strike the 
public is inconvenienced and our economy is hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do PSAC employees want?  They want to be paid the same for 
doing the same job with the same skills as other people in other 
unions within the government.  As it stands, PSAC employees are 
paid significantly less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian forces base 
personnel have been exemplary in meeting the challenges laid out 
for them.  They have downsized more than 40%, increased 
efficiency and doubled up on their duties.  All they get from 
this government is a kick in the teeth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must deal with PSAC workers fairly and treat them the same as 
other workers within the federal government, give them the same 
wages, benefits and opportunities and get them back to work. 
Anything less is an abdication of this government's 
responsibility.

conserve the French language and culture has been a long and

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fear of losing the rich national resource that our language

consolidating the position of francophones outside Quebec.

have accomplished and join with Quebec in marking this week 
which celebrates French and the ongoing battle in all of the 
provinces of Canada to preserve and promote this rich culture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
has become fashionable to kick an organization which cannot 
defend itself, namely the upper house of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the decades valuable studies and reports have been produced 
by our senators who have made a fine contribution to the 
understanding of issues and the shaping of policies and laws.  A 
special Senate committee on poverty in Canada headed by Senator 
David Croll is just one example.  Upcoming reports include one on 
the impact of globalization and another on Canada's boreal 
forest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than attempting to dismantle a fine Canadian institution, 
critics could better use their time and energy in becoming 
acquainted with the good work of the other place and in informing 
Canadians about the achievements of senators past and present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With some exceptions, we in the House of Commons believe we have 
the best possible arrangement for Canada, with one elected and 
one appointed chamber.  It is an ideal balance.  Rather than 
denigrating the Senate we should support it.

I rise today on behalf of all Canadians to honour one of my 
constituents and one of our country's greatest and most 
courageous athletes.  Silken Laumann, Olympic medalist and world 
champion rower, announced her retirement yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While her accomplishments include three Olympic medals and the 
1991 single sculls World Championship, it was her determination 
to triumph over adversity that won the hearts of a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just months before the 1992 Barcelona games her leg was 
seriously injured in a collision at a German regatta.  Doctors 
said she would never race again.  But she refused to give up. 
She endured eight operations and battled back to win the bronze 
medal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they awarded an Olympic medal for courage and determination, 
I can think of no other recipient more worthy of a gold than 
Silken Laumann.  She is a shining example of what it means and 
what it takes to be a true Olympian in every sense of the word.

clearly symbolized on Canada's coat of arms, which includes the 
Royal Harp of Tara and the Shamrock.

significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is in fact the first time in thirty years that the Irish in 
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are celebrating 
their national day in peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Belfast agreements contain provisions for the possible 
liberation and unification of the people of Ireland, thus 
bringing to conclusion the work started by Daniel O'Connel,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member for Saint John is a hard act to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Irish everywhere, including those who wish they were 
Irish, celebrate the feast day of their patron saint, the 
evangelist of Ireland, St. Patrick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Ireland enters its 15th century of Christianity, Canada's six 
million Irish descendants can give thanks for the growing spirit 
of peace taking root in their homeland.  The Good Friday 
agreement is a sign of hope in what has been a century of 
violence and bloodshed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is also a day to recall how fragile is the current peace 
in a land riven by decades of sectarian hatred.  Monday's brutal 
car bomb attack on Rosemary Nelson, an Irish human rights lawyer 
who died two hours after her legs were blown off, comes just two 
weeks before the Good Friday peace agreement turns a year old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is simply the latest victim of the enemies of peace. 
Terrorists on both sides have continued a murderous campaign to 
prevent this resolution taking root, from the bombing at Omagh to 
the daily beatings and shootings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Terrorist intimidation must not be allowed to stand in the way 
of peace.  Without that there is little hope of restoring the 
legacy of St. Patrick and the great civilization his message 
spawned in Ireland.

Speaker, this week Liberals tabled a memo to justify the 
so-called security reasons in the case of the untendered 
contracts for the Prime Minister's cottage.  The memo raises 
other questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows that the RCMP asked for $80,000 to build a guard post 
on the road.  They actually awarded two untendered contracts 
worth $137,000 for this work.  Now we learn that costs have 
reached $147,000 for the road alone, with no final billing yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In total, to date they have spent $200,000 on the Prime 
Minister's personal cottage.  The money has gone to the Prime 
Minister's personal contractor who allegedly meets security 
criteria but whose subcontractors are now before the courts on 
fraud charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian's are asking, how can they be sure the overruns are not 
subsidizing the costs of the Prime Minister's private cottage 
when the contracts went untendered to the same contractor before 
construction of the cottage was complete? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the extra $120,000 gone to a Liberal friend?

tabling all relevant documents.

such a great contribution to what Quebec and Canada are today.

of English domination, fought to make Ireland a sovereign country 
in 1921; of those proud Irish who, with the Belfast agreement, 
committed Northern Ireland to a process giving their country 
greater independence from the government in London; of those 
proud Irish who left their native land to settle in America, to 
build new lives and to build a country; of those proud Irish 
who, in 1837 and 1838, took up the defence of the people of 
French origin to establish an independent republic in Lower 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I am a descendant of those proud Irish, whose culture and

speech by the industry minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that speech to the Empire Club he admitted that Canada's

that period we created more than 1.6 million jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister listed two principal reasons for the falling 
standard of living, high government debt and high government 
taxes, taxes that are 20% higher than our closest competitor and 
a debtload that is too high in relation to our GNP.

money in research and development to make sure that Canada is

truth is that its high debt and high tax policies are driving the

guess the industry minister is caught in a time warp.  Here is 
what he said February 18.  He told the audience that our standard 
of living has fallen behind Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia.  He 
said that because our productivity was so weak the average 
Canadian has lost $7,000 a year.  That is what he said three 
weeks ago.  I guess he is in a time warp.

quoting from a series of projections that arose out of the 1980s.

than what it was in the 1980s.  Our manufacturing productivity in

should speak for itself internationally in areas under its 
jurisdiction.  This contention was put forward by a federalist 
and has the support of federalists in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

this issue is that it has come to it too late.  The government 
began to address it immediately.  That is why we eliminated the 
$42 billion deficit.  That is why we have invested in education. 
That is why we have invested in research and development.  That 
is why we have invested in the future of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that just because the Reform Party has only woken up

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government can blow its horn as much as it likes, but the 
fact is that we still have huge high debts and high taxes.  That 
is what is affecting our standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marzolini's advice to the Prime Minister is usually secret but 
today it is public because the situation is so dreadful.  We are 
poorer now than Mississippi.  The Prime Minister knows it and the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women, who is supposed to 
look after women's interests, sided with the government, which 
claims that women are not being discriminated against by the new 
eligibility rules for maternity benefits, because pregnancy is a 
natural event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Human Resources Development realize that 
his department is not immune to discriminatory practices toward 
women when it states that pregnancy is a natural event? 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that when we 
take a close look at the number of Canadian women who were paid 
maternity benefits, we can see that these benefits were 
maintained and that it is the number of births that went down. 
Therefore, women have definitely not been penalized in that 
regard in recent years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
is well aware that, in 1989, the supreme court ruled that 
discrimination based on pregnancy was discrimination against 
women and that it violated the charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister let his department still use an argument 
that takes us decades back in time to justify the fact that the 
employment insurance program discriminates against pregnant 
women? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it goes without saying that, 
when our government tabled in this House an act to reform the 
employment insurance program, we made sure that it was legal and 
constitutional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be challenges. Challenges are part of the democratic 
process. I can assure you that our government is absolutely 
convinced that there is no discrimination, that the Employment 
Insurance Act is perfectly legal and constitutional.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the major problem behind the falling Canadian dollar is the low 
rate of growth of business productivity over the past twenty

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two important factors that may influence productivity: 
R&D investment and equipment purchases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this government compromise the future prosperity of this

effort is lower than last year?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member's question is a bit hard to grasp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the latest budget, one sees that there has been a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would remind the Minister of Finance that this comes from an 
OECD report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With so little federal effort in R&D, and with a devaluated 
dollar, which makes imported machinery virtually unaffordable, 
is there not a risk in the medium term that this government's 
negligence will cost us dearly and will confirm the OECD 
prediction that the standard of living in Canada will be 15% 
lower than the average of the other countries? 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is obviously an old report.  It dates back to the 1980s and very 
early 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly why the government has invested in research and 
development, for example $1.8 billion this year.  This is why we 
have created the Canadian foundation for innovation.  This is 
why we have put so much money into medical research. This was 
precisely in response to that OECD report, which is now out of 
date with the Canadian reality.

we continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the British Columbia minister responsible for the leaky

security, already a significant element in Canada's foreign

meeting their basic needs and respecting their basic rights, and 
that Canada as a new member of the UN Security Council has an 
added opportunity to take leadership in proposing alternative 
approaches to the effort to bring about peace and stability in 
Iraq and the Middle East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call upon parliament to strongly appeal to the 
UN, the U.S. and Britain to reject any further military action 
against Iraq.  They call for a serious attempt to be made at 
peace negotiations with Iraq and its neighbours; and further, in 
order to build a stable and sustainable society in Iraq, 
excluding an embargo on military goods, that all other sanctions 
be listed; and further, the petitioners urge Canada to vastly 
increase its effort in providing food, medicine and 
infrastructure reconstruction to Iraq and to take a lead in 
promoting the same through the United Nations.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK156">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (for the Minister of Finance, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-71, an act to implement certain 
provisions of the budget tabled in parliament on February 16, 
1999 be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK158"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure on behalf of 
the government to launch the debate on second reading of Bill 
C-71, the 1999 budget omnibus bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the minister's budget speech last month he reminded us and 
all Canadians about what budget making is really about: “It is 
to make the lives of Canadians better.  It is to improve their 
standard of living.  It is to build today for a better tomorrow, 
for budgets are about more than entries in the books of a 
government; they are chapters in the progress of a people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This vision is reflected clearly and concretely in the 
legislation before us.  It will add some important, impressive 
pages to the record of national investment by the government.  In 
particular, it provides historic new funding for Canada's public 
health care system, a very real aspect of the standard of living 
cherished by Canadians from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on agreement with the provinces, it sets out the design of 
significant additional funding under the Canada child tax 
benefit, the primary federal instrument for providing financial 
assistance to families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course not every measure in this bill touches so directly and 
so dramatically on so many Canadians.  It also includes measures 
dealing with the operations of government itself.  It includes 
debt management, income tax administration and first nations 
taxations among other initiatives.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions should not be seen as mere footnotes to the 1999 
budget vision of building today for a better tomorrow.  These 
reflect our continuing commitment to an effective, efficient and 
fiscally responsible government.  This is one of the key 
foundations that has allowed us to make new investments for a 
stronger economy and society and at the same time provide broad 
based tax relief while remaining deficit free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is certainly a lot to cover in this legislation so I will 
move on to the measures themselves, starting with the vital issue 
of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medicare is certainly, as everyone would agree, one of our most 
cherished social programs.  It represents the fundamental values 
of fairness and equality that define our country by ensuring that 
all Canadians, regardless of their financial means, have equal 
access to high quality health care services that are based on 
need and not on the ability to pay.  That is why action to 
sustain and strengthen health care is a key priority of this 
government and a central initiative in today's legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part one amends the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act 
to implement an $11.5 billion increase in cash through the Canada 
health and social transfer of health care.  This funding marks 
the largest investment this government has ever made.  The 
increases will be distributed on an equal per capita basis.  That 
means each and every Canadian in every province will receive the 
same amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an investment that will help provinces deal with the 
immediate concerns of Canadians about health care.  Those 
concerns, I believe, are articulated quite clearly, waiting 
lists, crowded emergency rooms and diagnostic services.  At the 
same time this funding provides Canadians with longer term 
stability and predictability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Romanow recognized the importance of this budget when he 
said: “The important message of this budget is that it is a much 
needed shot in the arm of the health care system not only in 
Saskatchewan but right across the country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this legislation the Minister of Finance is authorized to 
pay $3.5 billion of these funds into a trust from which they will 
be distributed to the provinces at a pace they set over the three 
year period beginning April 1, 1999.  The further $8 billion will 
be distributed through the CHST over the four year period 
beginning April 1, 2000. These numbers are significant by 
themselves but let me put them in a wider context for the House 
and for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the increase in funding reaches $2.5 billion in 2001 and 
2002, direct cash support from the federal government under the 
CHST will total $15 billion a year.  That means what is regarded 
as the health care component of the CHST will be as high as it 
was before the period of spending restraint.  That period of 
spending restraint was to help eliminate the deficit in the 
mid-1990s. The story does not end there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we also include the growing value of the CHST tax transfers 
to the cash funding, total assistance to the provinces will be 
worth $30 billion in 2001 and 2002.  This is a new high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation also provides for the complete elimination of 
the per capita disparities in the distribution of the existing 
CHST among provinces.  By 2001-02 all provinces will receive 
identical per capita entitlements providing equal support for 
health and other social services to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the $11.5 billion increase in provincial 
transfers for health care, the budget announced that our 
government will further invest about $1.4 billion over the 
remainder of this year and over the next three years in health 
information systems, research, first nations and Inuit health 
services and health problem prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Significant increases in the equalization program will also make 
more resources available to those less prosperous provinces for 
public services, including health care. 
Payments this year alone are expected to reach $10.7 billion. 
Bill C-65, which is now in the other place, renews the 
equalization program for the next five years.  That means the 
projected payments will be a further $5 billion higher than over 
the previous five years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one final point I would like to make.  The government 
is not only increasing transfers for health care, we are also 
providing provinces and territories with greatly improved 
stability and predictability in funding.  All major transfers, 
CHST, equalization and territorial formula financing, will be 
placed on a common five year track for the very first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next measure I would like to highlight is the Canada child 
tax benefit.  Through the creation of the national child benefit 
system the federal and provincial governments have embarked on a 
major co-operative effort to support families and reduce child 
poverty.  Our purpose is to ensure that children are always 
better off when their parents join the workforce.  In 1997 we 
announced the first federal contribution to this national 
endeavour, $850 million which began flowing last July, increasing 
financial support to over two million children and their 
families.   In the 1998 budget we announced that a further $850 
million would be allocated following the consultations with the 
provincial and territorial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's legislation acts on those consultations.  It also 
provides a further $300 million to increase benefits for modest 
and middle income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should explain that the Canada child tax benefit has two key 
components, the base benefit and the national child benefit 
supplement. The base benefit provides a basic amount of $1,020 
per child to families with incomes up to $25,921.  Beyond this 
threshold it is progressively phased out and becomes nil when the 
family income exceeds $67,000.  The national child benefit 
supplement provides maximum benefits of $605 for the first child, 
$405 for the second and $330 for each subsequent child to 
families with incomes up to $20,921.  It becomes nil when the 
family income exceeds $25,921. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposes changes to both the supplement and the base 
benefit.  It sets out the design of the 1998 budget commitment to 
provide an $850 million increase in the national child benefit 
supplement payments to low income families. The implementation of 
the proposed changes requires amendments to various sections of 
the Income Tax Act, section 122.6 to be specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments will increase the level of the maximum benefits 
provided under the national child benefit supplement by $350 per 
child in two stages, $180 in July 1999 and $170 in July 2000. 
They would avoid a significant increase in the effective marginal 
tax rates for modest income families by increasing the net income 
level at which the supplement is fully phased out, from $25,921 
to $27,750 in July 1999, and from $27,750 to $29,590 in July 
2000. Finally, they would increase benefits by $184 per family 
for modest and middle income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall these changes mean, for example, that a family with two 
children which earns $20,000 will receive an increase benefit of 
$700 for a total of $3,750 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the aggregate results. The child tax benefit 
actions in our two previous budgets will ultimately provide $1.7 
billion for the children of low income families. This legislation 
builds on that effort, not just by establishing the design for 
the $850 million allocated in 1998 but by delivering a further 
$300 million to enhance the child tax benefit for modest and 
middle income families.  As a result 100,000 more Canadian 
families will become eligible for all or part of the base 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue, support for Canadian children in need, takes me 
directly to the next aspect of this bill that I would like to 
cover.  It takes actions to ensure that the full amount of the 
single supplement of the goods and services tax credit also goes 
to single parents whose income does not exceed $25,921.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will increase GST credit benefits for low income 
single parents to complement the national child benefit by 
providing them with the full value of the supplement.  It will be 
effective on July 1, 1999 and will provide additional benefits to 
300,000 single parent families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures relating to the GST take me directly to the next 
set of measures contained in the legislation.  In case hon. 
members have not noticed, the bill comprises a number of various 
measures so I am moving from one to the next as quickly as I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section deals with the taxation powers of first nations. In 
our budget plan the government once again expressed its 
willingness to continue discussions and to put into effect 
taxation arrangements with first nations that indicate an 
interest in exercising taxation powers.  This builds on the last 
two years of budget commitment to put into effect taxation 
arrangements with interested first nations which resulted in 
taxation authorities for three British Columbia first nations: 
the Cowichan Tribe, the West Bank First Nation and Kamloops 
Indian Band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's legislation will further facilitate first nation 
taxation in a number of ways.  The West Bank First Nation would 
be authorized to levy a 7% GST style tax on the sale of fuel sold 
on its reserve.  This would take place in addition to its 
existing tobacco and alcoholic beverages tax authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to address another area where today's 
legislation involves the administration of taxation, specifically 
citing the example of the Nova Scotia workers compensation board. 
The amendment contained in the legislation will permit 
co-operation in audits and the exchange of program information 
between Revenue Canada and the WCB to help ensure that amounts 
owed are paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions are a direct result of the service agreement 
signed last October between Revenue Canada and Nova Scotia. These 
two levels of government are pursuing opportunities for 
partnership in tax administration, including joint employer 
remittance for payroll deduction and WCB payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administration agreement will result in improved fairness 
and make compliance easier for business.  We have often heard 
about this in the House and from other associations interested in 
ensuring the compliance burden is reduced.  This is an example 
where various levels of government are joining together to reduce 
the compliance burden.  It also reduces government overlap and 
duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the most important measures in today's legislation deal 
with investments our government is making in national health care 
and certainly in the welfare of children.  We have not and we 
will not lose sight of a very fundamental concern:  the critical 
importance of continuing good financial management.  The 
investments we have made will not jeopardize our commitments to 
balanced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear in the House and from Canadians in our 
constituencies that we still carry the painful legacy of decades 
of deficit financing in the form of a massive debt burden that 
costs us over $40 billion a year in interest payments.  It is 
money that cannot go to further tax reduction.  It is money that 
cannot go to additional investments in strengthening our economy 
and social safety net.  That is why we have implemented our debt 
reduction plan.  That is why we are also committed to managing 
the debt we carry as cost effectively as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's legislation includes further measures to help achieve 
this goal.  The amendments cover two principal areas.  The first 
is clarifying the authority governing government borrowing and 
distribution of its debt.  The second is modernizing government 
financial and risk management powers.  Many of these are quite 
technical and often just confirm or clarify existing practices of 
powers, but let me just highlight a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 46 of the existing FAA provides the government with 
standing authority to refinance maturing debt.  The government 
proposes to amend this section to clarify that maturing debt 
could only be refinanced within a given fiscal year. Accordingly, 
any debt that is not refinanced by the end of a fiscal year 
lapses and cannot be refinanced in the next fiscal year. 
It is a practice the government has followed for many years.  The 
legislation is in response to interpretation questions raised 
with respect to the existing wording.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should be very clear that the changes do not give the 
government more authority to borrow.  New borrowing authority to 
finance a deficit must be obtained and would be obtained, as it 
has been in the past, through a borrowing authority bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment clarifies and enhances the legislative basis 
pertaining to auctions of Government of Canada securities.  Last 
fall the government reached an agreement with the distributors of 
its debt on new rules in terms of participation at auctions of 
government securities.  The amendments set out in more detail the 
minister's authority in respect of these auctions.  The new rules 
are designed to enhance market integrity and to maintain a well 
functioning market in Government of Canada securities which 
benefits all taxpayers through lower debt costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another measure I would like to highlight because it 
deals with the issue of parliamentary accountability.  I know 
members opposite are very interested in parliamentary 
accountability, as are all Canadians.  The legislation will amend 
the FAA to enhance reporting to parliament on debt management 
activities and future debt management plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments ensure that parliament formally receives 
information annually on the government debt management program 
and plans, thus strengthening the reporting structure on an 
important government activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also proposing to repeal the Borrowing 
Authority Act, 1996-97.  Currently there is $4 billion of 
non-lapsing borrowing authority contained in this act to provide 
for contingencies such as foreign exchange requirements.  The 
government proposes to transfer this unused borrowing authority 
to the budget implementation bill.  No change in authority is 
being provided by this transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, today's legislation is truly wide ranging. I 
have been more brief than I would have liked in dealing with some 
of the measures addressed so far, but as we continue this debate 
I expect that some of my colleagues will go into further detail 
on aspects of the legislation that interest or concern them most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the other issues the bill deals with very briefly now 
will be acts like the Superannuation Act which applies to the 
public service, the Canadian forces and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police.  This change would improve future pension 
benefits for these individuals.  There is an amendment to the 
basic pension formula to provide for benefits to be calculated on 
a five year average salary and one for integrating benefits for 
retirees when they become eligible for CPP or QPP benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will also amend the Patent Act to clarify the 
authority of the Minister of Health to pay provinces moneys 
collected by the Patented Medicine Price Review Board from 
excessive pricing of products by patented manufacturers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also amending the Agricultural Marketing Programs Act.  A 
number of members in the House often speak out for the farming 
community and for rural parts of Canada.  We are amending this 
act so that we can clarify the scope of federal government 
guarantees to financial institutions that fund advanced payments 
to agricultural producers under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should add a note of explanation.  Although the intent was to 
provide direct unconditional guarantees to the lending 
institutions, the Agricultural Marketing Programs Act needs to be 
clarified for the federal government to provide such guarantees. 
Under the current legislation direct guarantees are conditional 
upon having producer organizations meet the terms and conditions 
stated in the act, which results in higher risk for lenders and 
interest rates on the advances that adversely affects our farming 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the government is taking measures in the 1999 budget 
to correct the wording of the AMPA and to ensure that advance 
payments can be provided to agricultural producers at the lowest 
possible cost.  This measure is another example of federal 
government commitment to agricultural producers and rural 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we are amending the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development Act to provide the Minister of Finance with the 
authority to undertake the financial operations necessary to meet 
our commitments to the EBRD.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are but a few highlights of Bill C-71, the 1999 budget 
omnibus bill.  It does not cover every measure that the February 
budget proposed.  For example, the broad based income tax cuts 
which were announced will be confirmed in separate legislation. 
Even the actions in the legislation by themselves reflect the 
commitment to a balanced approach in budget planning and budget 
making which has been the hallmark of the government since coming 
to office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance said in the budget speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social and economic needs of a nation are not separate.  They 
are not in conflict.  The balanced pursuit of both is key to the 
health and wealth of our country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, with the federal books in balance, we have brought 
before the House a bill that delivers historic investment in an 
area which Canadians have made very clear is their key priority. 
We all know that key priority is health care and that it 
continues our work to assist children in need or at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be very clear that nothing we have proposed will 
undercut another vital aspect of balance: our commitment to 
providing Canadians with balanced budgets this year and in the 
years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of fiscal responsibility will allow us to sustain the 
social and economic investments we must make to maintain an 
economic environment which keeps interest rates low.  We need to 
continue, as we have stated over and over in the House, and the 
Minister of Finance outside the House, the process of tax relief 
we all desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as a government and as parliamentarians that Canadians 
never want to return to the time of deficit financing when we 
were burdening our children and future generations with debt and 
adding to that debt each and every year.  We have finally turned 
the corner.  We now have an opportunity to build as we go forward 
in a very balanced and very responsible way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move forward in the consultations for the next budget 
Canadians will come forward and clearly articulate their 
priorities.  I am sure and quite confident that Canadians, as 
they have done in the past, will continue to provide a very 
balanced and thoughtful approach to making budgets for this great 
country.  It will be one that will involve reinvestment both in 
the social arena and in the economic arena.  It will ensure that 
we continue to pay down debt, that we stay balanced, and that we 
provide the kind of tax relief Canadians are looking for in a 
responsible way, which Canadians will clearly support.  We have 
done so in the past.  I submit that we will continue to do so in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other members will be speaking to the 1999 budget omnibus 
bill.  It contains a number of various elements contained in the 
budget speech, certainly in areas which reflect what Canadians 
told us in the prebudget consultations.  The success of this 
budget and the success of the bill are embedded in the success 
Canadians have experienced and will continue to experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an opportunity for Canadians to contribute to the process 
and have their priorities heard.  Many Canadians from my 
constituency and from other constituencies across the country 
will provide the input and necessary insight which clearly 
reflect where they want to go.  They can rest assured their 
insight and priorities will continue to be reflected in what the 
government does in budgets to come.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for agreeing to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to address Bill C-71, an act to implement certain 
provisions tabled in the budget on February 16. This legislation 
is an omnibus bill, maybe an ominous bill too.  It deals with a 
number of different issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes it difficult for an opposition party to vote on a bill 
like this one when there are so many different things in it. 
There are parts of it we agree with.  There are parts we 
completely disagree with.  It points to the need to have an 
agreement that legislation tabled in the House be roughly of one 
kind so that when we address these things we can vote against the 
legislation knowing that we are voting against a core group of 
things that we oppose, or support, if there are supportable 
things in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from the Liberal Party pointed out, a number of 
different things are dealt with in this bill.  The biggest issues 
in the bill have to do with health care and the child tax 
benefit. The Reform Party has already told the government that we 
support putting more money into health care.  We have been 
arguing for that for a long time.  We disagree completely though 
with how this was done, which is why we cannot support this 
legislation, unfortunately.  We disagree with it on a couple of 
counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a situation where the government cut a tremendous 
amount of money out of health care initially, somewhere in the 
range of over $20 billion.  Now it is putting $11.5 billion back 
in over a five year period, and the government is seeking to get 
some kind of credit for doing that. This is another example of 
the Canadian public paying more in taxes and getting far less in 
the form of health care. We disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have been up front with Canadians instead 
of playing this shell game as it does so often.  There are many, 
many examples of how the government plays this shell game. 
Whether it is with employment insurance, the Canada pension plan, 
or whatever it is, the government starts out giving people more 
benefits and then takes them away.  It gives with one hand and 
takes away with the other and expects to get credit. That is 
wrong.  The government should not be rewarded for that. We 
disagree completely with the government's approach on health care 
in doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has some supportable measures in the legislation. 
In this budget the government has a chance to send a powerful 
message to the Canadian public that it understands the difficult 
position Canadians are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a surplus this year.  It would have been a much larger 
surplus than it actually turned out to be because the government 
in its wisdom decided to go on a spending spree again.  We had a 
spending target of $104.5 billion.  The government went almost $8 
billion over budget in its spending.  This meant that all of a 
sudden there was no money left for substantive tax relief.  There 
was no money left for substantive debt reduction.  And the 
government continues to spend on programs that are absolutely 
counterproductive, programs that distort the Canadian economy, 
that hold us back as a country in today's global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should go through its spending with a fine-tooth 
comb. Money which is being spent on low priority items should be 
taken away from those items and spent on things like health care, 
things like fixing up national defence.  In many ways it has 
become a laughingstock, not because of the tremendous effort of 
the soldiers and people who make up our Canadian armed forces. 
They do an outstanding job but they are ill equipped.  That money 
should have gone back into ensuring that our soldiers who are in 
places like Kosovo have proper equipment.  Sadly that did not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our criticism goes beyond that. Canadians want tax relief.  They 
are demanding it. 
They did not get it in this budget.  We do not see it in Bill 
C-71 at all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from recent events that the government, in its open 
moments when it assumes that no one is listening, acknowledges 
that Canada has a serious problem when it comes to the issue of 
taxation. The situation today is we are one of the highest taxed 
nations in the world. If Liberal members doubt my word on that, 
then I invite them to consider what their own industry minister 
said just three weeks ago when he spoke to the Empire Club.  I 
want to read from some of the slides he put up when he spoke to 
the Empire Club. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was addressing the issue of standard of living.  He 
pointed out that since 1987, Canada's standard of living has 
increased by only 7%.  In the United States it increased by 17%. 
According to the slide:  “The income gap between the U.S. and 
Canada is 30% and growing, $37,239 versus $28,000”.  That is a 
$9,000 difference in income between Canada and the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry minister was reading from statistics prepared by 
Statistics Canada.  It was not the Reform Party.  This was the 
government's industry minister levelling this kind of criticism 
at the performance of the Canadian economy. And guess what?  For 
the last five years this government has been in charge of the 
Canadian economy.  It is an admission that the government has 
done a horrible job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The slide on productivity reads:  “Impact of productivity. 
Canada has the lowest rate of growth in productivity in the 
G-7”.  Out of all the major industrialized world, the industry 
minister told the Empire Club that Canada has the lowest rate of 
growth in productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we heard yesterday at a conference sponsored by a former 
Liberal cabinet minister, the pollster for the Liberals, Michael 
Marzolini, pointed out that productivity is tied intimately to 
the standard of living of Canadians.  There is a direct 
connection between productivity and standard of living. We have 
the lowest rate of growth in productivity, meaning we have the 
lowest rate of growth in standard of living.  This is the Liberal 
pollster at the Liberal productivity conference.  And the Liberal 
industry minister was saying all these things. This was not the 
Reform Party.  This was the government pointing these things out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We go to the next slide, productivity payoff: “Our falling 
productivity has resulted in lower incomes, $7,000 per capita”. 
That is not cumulative.  That is not from 1979 to 1997 if we add 
it all up.  No.  What we are talking about is that in 1997, the 
difference between Canada and the U.S., because we have fallen 
behind in our productivity, is now $7,000 per person per year. 
The industry minister went on to point out that it works out to 
$28,000 per family of four difference in income if we had kept 
our productivity even with the United States, but we have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means the Prime Minister, the finance minister, the 
industry minister and the whole government are responsible for 
engineering an economy that has left the average family $28,000 
poorer than they would have been otherwise.  That is an 
absolutely shameful fact and the government actually spoke about 
it at this conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to make some fundamental changes.  In order to do 
that we have to begin to lower the crippling tax burden that the 
government levels on Canadians each and every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry minister also pointed out that we have much higher 
taxes in Canada than they do in the United States.  Our taxes are 
130% higher than taxes in the United States.  Taxes in the U.S. 
are around 28.5% of GDP according to the industry minister.  Ours 
are 36.8%, 130% higher.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This points to the need to make some changes in order to ensure 
that we have the standard of living we used to have in Canada. 
We used to be the economic equal of the United States. We have 
become second class economic citizens compared to our U.S. 
cousins.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's plan over the last five years has been to 
anesthetize the public and allow people to think everything is 
moving along the way it should be.  We hear this don't worry, be 
happy message from the Prime Minister almost every week.  I think 
my friends around the House would agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know it is simply not so.  We know we are falling further and 
further and further behind the United States.  It should not 
happen.  We are as good as they are.  We are better in so many 
ways.  We can do so many things much better than the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have companies that are world leaders, but what do we see? We 
see companies like Nortel, a great leader in the 
telecommunications industry, in the high tech field, moving more 
and more of its operations into the United States.  That is a 
condemnation of the policies of the government.  It is 
unbelievable that the government sits idly by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, that is not quite accurate.  The government does not sit 
idly by.  Instead it trots out these rinky-dink little programs 
saying, “We will have this program, we will have that program” 
expecting to reverse the terrible trend that is bankrupting 
families.  Instead, the government should be cutting taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is hardly an economist left in the country who does not 
understand that we have become uncompetitive when it comes to 
taxes.  The result is that our productivity continues to fall. 
Our standard of living continues to fall.  We see that every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bet there is not a member of parliament in this place who 
cannot tell a story about a family member, a daughter, a son, or 
a friend who has left Canada to go to the United States. Why do 
they go? There are four very compelling reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there are more jobs in the United States especially for 
people with great skills in those high tech fields.  Our high 
tech industry is held back by the government but in the United 
States it is booming.  It is absolutely going crazy. There are 
all kinds of jobs. We hear stories about the entire class or a 
great chunk of the class from Waterloo being recruited by 
Microsoft to work at Microsoft in Seattle.  We hear those stories 
all the time.  There are more jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the pay is better.  When there is an unemployment rate 
in the United States of 4.3%, companies in the U.S. are desperate 
to find good workers.  They pay a lot more money.  Even when 
comparing American dollars to Canadian dollars, companies are 
still paying a higher numerical value in the United States for 
those workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, people in the United States get to keep more of the money 
they earn. As the industry minister has pointed out based on the 
government's own data, our taxes are far higher than the taxes in 
the United States.  The industry minister hounded that point home 
at the Empire Club. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the U.S. dollar is worth so much more than ours.  Ours 
is now at 65 cents, near a record low. People are able to buy a 
lot more with those dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are four big reasons the government indirectly has given 
to young people to leave Canada to go to the United States.  It 
is disgraceful that that happens.  It is an economic tragedy. 
More than that, it is a human tragedy.  We are losing our family 
members to places outside Canada, not only to the United States 
but to other countries around the world as well. Ireland is 
attracting many people, the U.K., and on and on it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a human tragedy. We would like to keep our families 
together.  We would like our young people to have the option to 
continue their high tech careers in Toronto, Kanata, Calgary, or 
wherever. We just do not see that happening because the 
government punishes innovation.  It punishes people who have 
obtained skills.  The result is that we lose these young people 
which is a great tragedy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lately the government has been attempting to hang its hat on a 
study done by KPMG Consulting which the government alleges 
suggests that Canada is somehow far more competitive than the 
rest of the world in terms of attracting business to Canada. 
When we look at the fine print in that KPMG study two things jump 
out. The first is that the single biggest reason people should 
come to Canada is because we have low wages.  For government 
members to get to the point where they will stand in the House of 
Commons to boast about Canada having extraordinarily low wages so 
others should come here to set up shop speaks of the desperation 
of the government.  It demonstrates real desperation when they 
get to the point of essentially saying “Come to Canada because 
Canadians will work for peanuts”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they say that others should come to Canada because we 
have an extraordinarily weak currency.  The currency is the 
barometer of the health of the economy.  We can take where the 
currency is and essentially say that is where the standard of 
living is.  As the currency strengthens, so does the standard of 
living.  We saw our currency fall to record lows in July and the 
government did nothing about it.  In fact the Prime Minister 
almost bragged about it.  He said “It is good for exports.  No 
problem”.  He has said that over and over again during the 
course of his career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrarily, when the finance minister was running for the 
leadership of the Liberal Party several years ago he berated 
Michael Wilson, the Conservative finance minister at the time, 
because the dollar had dipped below 80 cents.  We yearn for the 
days when it was only 80 cents.  We yearn for those days because 
again the dollar reflects the standard of living of Canadians. 
When the dollar is low the standard of living is low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone doubts for a moment that Canadians have seen their 
standard of living drop, then do not listen to my words, listen 
to the words of the industry minister of the Government of Canada 
who pointed out in his speech to the Empire Club that Canada has 
seen its standard of living fall below the poorest of the deep 
southern American states.  Canada's standard of living is below 
that of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas and Louisiana. 
That is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry minister told the Empire Club that a few weeks ago 
and the government continues to stick its head in the sand a 
pretend everything is okay.  “Don't worry, be happy”.  That is 
all we hear from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had a chance to rectify this problem.  It has been running 
surpluses.  If it had kept the line on spending we would have 
money to start lowering taxes and to increase productivity and 
the prosperity and standard of living of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We desperately need that in Canada today.  We are tired of being 
second class economic citizens compared to the United State.  We 
used to have a dollar that was stronger.  We used to have a 
standard of living that was stronger.  We used to have 
unemployment that was lower.  That has all gone by the wayside. 
Since we have had this government, and Tory and Liberal 
governments before it, we have seen the erosion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to reverse that and there is a way to do it.  The way 
is to hold the line on spending, run up big surpluses and cut 
taxes.  What happens when we cut taxes?  Revenues increase. Those 
who doubt for a moment what I am saying should look at Ontario 
where revenues have increased since it cut taxes.  On St. 
Patrick's Day, look at Ireland and the Irish miracle.  It cut 
taxes and its economy has grown at over 5% a year for several 
years now.  It has extraordinarily low income tax rates and tax 
rates of all kinds, to the point where it is actually able to 
provide free tuition to everybody in Ireland today.  That is how 
much extra revenue it is bringing in as a result of cutting taxes 
because of the increased business activity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is way off track with Bill C-71.  It is way off 
track with its budget in general.  It should have taken the 
opportunity to start cutting taxes, to leave more money in the 
pockets of homemakers, business people and entrepreneurs.  Those 
are the people who create the jobs.  Those are the people who 
deserve a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my friends across the way to not be so hidebound and 
to consider for a moment that there might be some good ideas 
coming not only from the other side, not only from Canadians, but 
even from the Department of Industry in the comments made by the 
industry minister not so long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, Canadians deserve this tax relief.  We 
should be getting it from this government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is a pretty tough act to follow, but I will see what I can 
do.  I have a lot of admiration for my colleague and friend from 
Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about budget implementation and I will focus on 
different aspects of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day of reckoning is coming.  Within a few years this Liberal 
government is going to see that Canadians cannot be given a snow 
job.  This is really about brainwashing, not about budgeting. 
Government spin doctors are famous for their tinkering.  All they 
know how to do is tinker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just look at the record of this Liberal government.  I 
want to stick to the facts.  In 1999 the average Canadian will 
pay $2,000 more in taxes than they paid in 1993.  At the very 
same time, health cuts will amount to $1,500 per person.  Over 
the last three years there have been $1,500 in health care cuts 
per person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government's record?  Let us look at the facts. 
What has it done?  I can give hon. members examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of looking at funding hip replacements or surgery, 
taxpayers are providing funding of $100,000 for a government 
grant on a book of dumb blonde jokes.  The list goes on and on 
forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has slashed university funding while protecting 
$4 billion in pork barrel regional development grants over the 
last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an interesting one.  RCMP services have been cut.  We 
have seen that it is devastating.  The RCMP in British Columbia 
has been cut down to the bare bones.  Vacancies are not being 
filled.  As the government continues to cut money that is 
available to the RCMP, it gets millions and millions of dollars 
from the illegal trade subsidies it gives to profitable 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was no more apparent than when we were speaking during 
question period today.  I see that members opposite are wondering 
about this.  The government continues with these illegal trade 
subsidies, and that is exactly what they are.  The WTO ruled on 
it.  It is part of the government's taxation policy to give 
Canadian taxpayers' dollars away to profitable corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course government members stand to make a lot of noise about 
how patriotic they are.  They accuse the official opposition of 
siding with Brazil, which is absolute and utter nonsense.  The 
WTO ruling is the result of the government's taxation policies. 
It wants to give tax dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars, to 
profitable corporations.  It is absolute and utter nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government members are really so patriotic and committed to 
Canadians, why do they continue to gouge the pockets of every 
single Canadian in this country?  Why do they continue with 
sneaky, hidden tax increases, one after the other?  They are 
endless, and they are all sneaky, hidden tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then government members claim these victories after they have 
raised taxes and raked the wallets and pocketbooks of Canadians, 
who are struggling from payday to payday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members claim they had to make tough decisions so 
they could balance the budget.  They have no right to claim for 
one second that they did one thing to balance this budget. 
The credit goes entirely to every single Canadian taxpayer who 
has been paying $2,000 more in taxes each year since 1993.  The 
credit goes to those families who have suffered irreversible, 
incomprehensible harm as their loved ones have died waiting on 
hospital lists.  That is who the credit really goes to for 
balancing this budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not the Liberal government that made tough decisions for 
Canadian families; it was the Canadian families themselves who 
had to balance their paycheques every month to scrape by, dip 
into their RRSPs, cash in their savings and struggle to make ends 
meet.  It was not the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the Minister of Finance stand in this House to 
claim how proud he is that he has cut taxes.  Sure, there might 
have been some minor tinkering to provide slight tax cuts, but 
what he is not telling us is that the increases have been 
greater.  In fact if we take into account payroll taxes, Canada 
pension plan premiums and bracket creep, taxes this year alone 
have increased by $2.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus the rest of my talk on a couple of issues.  I will 
deal with brain drain and how we have shattered the hopes and 
aspirations of young Canadians.  The other area that I feel very 
passionate about is tax discrimination, tax unfairness, what we 
are doing to the Canadian family and how the government attempts 
to justify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard that a family of four with an income of 
$50,000, with one parent who chooses to stay at home, will pay 
$4,000 more in taxes than that of a family with the same income 
with two parents working.  Let us look at the net effect.  How 
does that affect these families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax policies are discriminatory.  I will use my sister for 
an example.  My sister is a schoolteacher in Invermere.  She has 
three small girls who are just starting elementary school.  Her 
husband James decided to put his career on hold.  He stayed at 
home with the three girls while my sister went off to teach. 
They felt it was very important that one parent be at home until 
the girls started school, so James put his career on hold and my 
sister went to work.  He made personal sacrifices that we should 
be commending him for and not penalizing him under our current 
tax act.  That is exactly what we are doing.  There is no 
question about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote some statements made by members opposite. 
The member for Vancouver Kingsway said in a finance committee 
hearing on October 8, 1998, when she was talking to parents who 
had chosen to put their careers on hold, chosen to stay at home 
and who place some value in parenting, “Perhaps individually you 
have low self-esteem for many reasons.  Most women can combine 
career and family life.  We know it is very difficult.  A lot of 
times people just take the easy way out”.  Those have to be the 
most insulting comments to make to someone who chooses to stay at 
home to look after their family.  It is an absolute disgrace 
coming from the government, with all its fanfare and hoopla and 
all of its wining and dining of the financial institutions in 
trying to spin this budget. 
All the spin doctors out there have failed to recognize some very 
basic flaws in our tax act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the province of Alberta has taken a 
leadership role in the country with respect to this issue.  It is 
rectifying the issue as far as it can within its provincial 
jurisdiction to bring back fairness.  It is breaking new ground 
and it is high time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue was brought to the attention of the Minister of 
Finance over and over again.  The Reform Party of Canada has been 
fighting the issue since it first became an official party of the 
House in 1993.  It has had supply day motions and this debate has 
been going on and on.  The government has again buried its head 
in the sand and has refused to recognize it.  It is one of the 
most offensive areas I have found in tax policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do?  It only tinkers.  Its day of 
reckoning is coming.  These are the hard core facts.  I know the 
government does not like them.  It is not very proud of them but 
they are the facts and it cannot get away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I do not have the form in front of me I can recite form 
T778, the child care deduction form, because I know it so well. 
It gets even worse.  If only one parent of a two parent family is 
working there are three ways according to the tax form, which is 
available on the Internet at website www.rc.gc.ca, to claim the 
child deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, they have to be mentally or physically incapable of 
looking after children.  The second one is absolutely amazing. 
They have to be convicted criminals who have spent at least two 
weeks in jail in 1998.  Can we imagine a convicted criminal who 
has spent two weeks in jail being given priority to claim the 
child care deduction?  That is a fact.  It is right on the tax 
form. It is absolutely outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third way is if the parents are separated or divorced for at 
least 90 days.  It is no good if they want to stay together.  It 
is no good if they are happily married.  However, if they want to 
separate, they can follow the Liberal government tax form.  I 
encourage everyone to look it up on the Internet.  They can go to 
any post office in Canada and ask for a T778 form, the child care 
deduction form.  It is absolutely incomprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the Liberals really think of their budget?  What do they 
really think about the Canadian economy?  How proud are they?  I 
will refer to some quotes of the Minister of Industry on February 
18, 1999.  We have already heard from him in the House today. 
This is what he thinks the Canadian economy is doing, one of the 
Prime Minister's henchmen, the frontline people who go out and do 
the messaging: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we maintain or, better still, increase our standard of 
living?  Since 1987 we have done okay. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is debatable.  He continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our standard of living has grown by 7%, but when we look our 
American friends we see that at the same time they have increased 
their standard of living by 17%. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words it is 30% higher in the U.S. than in Canada or 
$37,239 compared to $28,234.  I repeat that this was the Minister 
of Industry speaking, the government's henchman, the spokesperson 
who goes out and brags about the record of government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what does all this mean?  Moving back to our standard of 
living, which is the whole point of this address, the 
productivity in Canada has grown 1.2% per year faster, which is a 
gap between U.S. and Canadian growth.  According to the OECD per 
capita income would have been $7,000 a year higher.  For a family 
of four this is a $28,000 shortfall. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's henchmen are going out and doing their 
messaging to promote the budget, yet they are admitting that 
their economic policies have been an absolute, utter and complete 
failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some lessons to be learned from the American system. 
Obviously in 100 square miles in the U.S. and 100 square miles in 
Canada we will not be able to deliver the same services for the 
same price, but the difference does not have to be 10 times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government's policies are driving us to bankruptcy.  Our 
government's taxation policies are driving Canadian businesses 
out of Canada every minute of every day.  Our government's 
policies on taxation are shattering the hopes and aspirations of 
all young Canadians.  They are going across the border by the 
thousands.  Where are they going?  It is to our neighbours to the 
south.  They are not going down there for the sunshine.  They are 
not going down there to live in their cities for their clean air. 
They are going down there because they do not see any future way 
of fulfilling their aspirations and dreams in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am standing in the House today.  I ask any member 
of the House to challenge that I am not a patriotic Canadian and 
that I am not here to fight for Canada, to make this country a 
better place in which to live.  That is why I am here and I made 
sacrifices to be here.  We have to offer a vision so that young 
Canadians will be able to fulfil their dreams in this country and 
not have them shattered by our taxation policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back 25 years to when I left high school.  People 
today do not have the same opportunities I had.  When I finished 
high school I could easily get work.  It was no problem.  I was 
never out of work a day.  I had good paying jobs and was able to 
fund myself all the way through university without assistance.  I 
could do it because there were opportunities. There was 
excitement.  We were ready to get an education and get into the 
working field.  We could hardly wait to start going after our 
dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young Canadians from coast to coast to coast in the country do 
not see the same opportunities.  They are trying to find minimum 
wage jobs.  They are graduating from university with students 
loans in excess of $50,000.  They are calling my office and 
asking what they can do and how to get out of that mess.  They 
have degrees.  They cannot get jobs.  They owe $50,000.  They ask 
if they can declare bankruptcy.  They ask for guidance.  They do 
not see any opportunities to fulfil their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It is because of the government's tax, tax, tax and spend, 
spend, spend policies.  We have known about this for a long time, 
as has the government.  It likes to tinker a bit, fudge a few 
numbers, shuffle the books and then say it has brought in a great 
budget.  It is all brainwashing.  It is all nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave government members with a few thoughts of which I 
want them to take note.  I am standing here along with my 
colleagues to fight for Canada, to make the country a better 
place so that young Canadians can fulfil their aspirations, hopes 
and dreams; so that families can make the right decisions and can 
choose to stay at home to raise their families without being 
discriminated against by absolutely insane government taxation 
policy.

tax decreases the government keeps talking about.  I will leave 
them with this thought:  please phone me, please give me a call. 
I ask them to take their paycheque stubs to their members of 
parliament next month or in three or six months from now and show

<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Bill C-71 now before the House, which seeks 
to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled last month 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to find positive things to say about this bill, 
since the budget alluded, of course, to the centralizing of the 
health care system, does nothing for the unemployed and is 
giving the agriculture sector nothing but crumbs. I want to show 
how this government managed to eliminate its deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us look at the employment insurance program. Members 
opposite are very stubborn; we keep telling them that the system 
is not working, that it is choking the unemployed. Let me give 
you an example. As members know, in recent years, the employment 
insurance benefits that the unemployed were not getting have 
been used to increase the amount in the employment insurance 
fund which, in turn, was used by the Minister of Finance to 
eliminate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1999 budget, the government confirms that it 
misappropriated the $7 billion EI surplus in 1998-99 and that it 
intends to repeat the performance with the anticipated $5 
billion surplus in 1999-2000. 
Adding up all the billions that were taken from the unemployed, 
by the end of this year—and this is a real bug for the 
jobless—amounts to a $26 billion surplus, which has made the 
regions, including Quebec, poorer and put the jobless in a scary 
situation that still persists. These people have no hope that 
the system might some day meet their expectations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I rose a few weeks ago to speak to the budget, I had made a 
long list of suggestions to improve the employment insurance 
plan.  However, when we on this side speak to the other side, I 
do not know, it is as if there is an invisible wall or some 
comprehension problem, but they do not understand common sense. 
They really do not understand common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hoping that, finally, the Liberals opposite will 
understand what the Bloc Quebecois wants and what all the 
workers in Quebec and Canada are calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, improved eligibility: the end of discrimination 
against certain categories of unemployed because of their so 
called regularity on the labour market; a reduction from the 
current 700 hours to 300 hours the requirement for special 
illness, maternity or parental benefits; an increase in the 
number of weeks of benefit from 45 to 50; the abolition of the 
so called intensity rule, which progressively cuts benefit rates 
from 55% to 50% for contributors regularly drawing employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, like a diet, a plan can be hard on people.  Sometimes 
people lose weight when they go on one.  But the unemployed lose 
money.  They really lose money.  Since 1993, this government has 
ceaselessly attacked society's most disadvantaged. 
This government, and especially the Minister of Finance, has 
become very good at creative bookkeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings us to the transparency of the EI fund.  At a press 
conference last winter, the four parties, including the Bloc 
Quebecois, got together and called for the EI account to be kept 
separate from government operations and for the Employment 
Insurance Commission, not the minister, to be given sole 
authority over EI premium rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every December, the minister trots out so-called good news that 
bears no resemblance to what unemployed workers want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also called for the rules that reduce the amount of benefits 
to be eliminated.  We asked that the freeze on maximum insurable 
earnings be lifted, the 52 week base period be restored, and the 
calculation of benefits be based on the number of weeks required 
to qualify during which earnings are highest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are interesting and constructive suggestions, but nothing 
is happening.  On the contrary, the government continues to dip 
into the EI surplus.  Why?  So that it can lower the deficit 
and, worse still, interfere in provincial jurisdictions.  It is 
getting very good at this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was clear in the September 1997 throne speech written by a 
marketing specialist, the sole objective of which was to make 
sure the maple leaf appeared on everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether in provincial, municipal or rural jurisdictions, 
everywhere we turn, there is the maple leaf.  With the 
millennium scholarships, we were even afraid we would have to 
have the Prime Minister's face on the documents. 
What do you suppose would happen to a Canadian dollar with the 
Prime Minister's face on it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It would have lost value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> It would be worth less than 50 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much energy and money is expended by this government in an 
ongoing battle against its own constitution?  When it gets 
involved in health and the municipalities, it is directly 
interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction. When it comes 
in with the millennium scholarships, it is interfering with 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are the losers with the millennium scholarships?  The 
younger generation, the students, who will find themselves 
dealing with two systems—once again, duplication in Quebec—and 
will lose financially.  While the federal government doggedly 
insists on not respecting Quebec's jurisdiction over education, 
who is it that loses out?  The young people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a shortfall of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Everything possible has been done to get negotiations under way 
again, but on an equal footing, not between the president of 
Bell Canada and the new Minister of Education, but between the 
Minister of Human Resources Development and the Minister of 
Education.  This government is trying to shirk its 
responsibilities by delegating a representative of a private 
company.  Let us get serious, now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to employment insurance, I would like to repeat to 
this government the essential demands of the Bloc Quebecois. 
The employment insurance fund must no longer be used as a tax on 
employment. 
The way it is operating, employment insurance has become an 
indirect tax, a tax that is taken from the pockets of the 
unemployed and from employers, and one that has no positive 
benefits for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the following example. A person has insurance 
for his car.  He is told “If you have an accident at 
Drummondville, you will be covered, but if it is at 
Lac-Saint-Jean, you will not”.  The EI system is as ridiculous as 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Quebec City region, crossing the river changes the EI 
rate.  The result of this is that no one gets the same amount, 
no one is entitled to the same number of weeks of employment 
insurance.  Where is the fairness and justice in such a system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, administration of the employment insurance account 
needs to be depoliticized. 
If the federal government has a hard time grasping common sense, 
it need only give this responsibility to employers and workers. 
We have introduced a private member's bill on this issue.  Here 
again, the four parties on this side of the House have approved 
this approach, but, on the other side, nothing is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to discuss the second point of my speech, which 
concerns health, or, if members want to put in that way, the 
initial ravages of the social union.  The cuts are in the amount 
of $33 billion rather than $42 billion.  The budget announced an 
additional $11.5 billion in transfers over five years, which 
means $2 billion in 1999-00 and $9 billion until 2003-04. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the government also announced an additional $1.4 
billion in new health care spending, which tramples on and 
overlaps provincial jurisdictions. 
The $2 billion announced for all of Canada represents only just 
the amount that was cut for Quebec alone in health care.  It is 
a third of the $6.3 billion shortfall the federal government 
announced last month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk figures.  They are the experts in this on the other 
side of the House.  They are also experts in having a hard time 
recognizing the real things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial plan for cuts represented a cumulative shortfall of 
$48 billion between 1993-94 and 2002-03.  The announcement in the 
1997 election was a little election treat.  They are good at 
that.  I will discuss later the little election treats in rural 
development and where the money goes.  You will see that, in 
patronage, these folks are hard to beat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1997 election campaign, the Liberals announced an 
increase of $12.5 billion and said the cumulative cut would be 
only be $42 billion. This is not what I call a treat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now turn our attention to the recent social union 
framework agreement. This was a great blackmail operation 
conducted in the Prime Minister's office, along with provinces 
that will soon hold an election, except one. It is very easy to 
understand why Ontario received $1 billion. That province is 
well represented in this House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why the province of Ontario would be favoured, 
but I have a hard time figuring out why Liberal members from 
Quebec would be so gullible. What is going on in that caucus? 
They are asleep. Quebec MPs fall bow down to Ontario and guess 
who loses? Quebec. Ontario receives $1 billion, while Quebec 
gets $150 million. Is this justice? Is this a worthwhile social 
union? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can certainly understand why the Premier of Quebec, Lucien 
Bouchard, dismissed the agreement that was proposed to first 
ministers. It is impossible to understand why this government is 
always trying to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now give the long list of future federal intrusions in 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réginald Bélair:</B> Let's get the Kleenex out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> It bothers them a lot on the other side to 
hear the truth. But do not worry, I am used to that. I once 
worked in the telecommunications industry and I am not the 
nervous type. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about intrusions, the national health surveillance 
network comes to mind. This network will be used to identify 
outbreaks of serious illnesses and will link Canadian 
laboratories electronically. This is an investment of $75 
million over a three-year period. Health is a provincial 
jurisdiction, it is a Quebec jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the establishment of the Canada health network. 
This network will provide Canadians with access to information 
about health issues ranging from nutrition to colds, from breast 
cancer to diabetes, and so on. It will cost another $75 million 
over three years.  Health comes under the jurisdiction of 
Quebec, not of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the Canadian institute for health information, a 
bunch of medical snoops who will visit CLSCs and hospitals and 
report to the Minister of Health on how he can take money, go 
over the heads of the provinces and of Quebec, and invest it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new mandate of the Canadian institute for health information 
will be to file periodic reports on the health of Canadians and 
the health system, including waiting lists, doctor and 
specialist assignments and the most effective courses of 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a meeting of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food dealing with rural development—since we are talking 
about health—I learned that a $70,000 investment in community 
health was being made in Saint-Étienne-des-Grès.  How odd that this 
is right near, if not right in, the riding of the Prime 
Minister.  I do not know whether the nurse or the person in 
charge of this project is a generous contributor to the Liberal 
Party of Canada.  There are 68 rural development projects for a 
total of $3.8 million in areas of provincial jurisdiction.  They 
excel at this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more.  There are telehealth and telecare pilot 
projects.  These are virtual CLSCs.  There are accountability 
measures and the NURSE fund.  Now they are into training.  But 
the federal government and the Government of Quebec signed a 
training agreement.  This has been ignored. 
What about prenatal nutrition, to the tune of $75 million?  This 
duplicates what is being done by CLSCs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now look at how the federal Liberals went about 
eliminating the deficit.  There is nothing tricky about it: the 
provinces, the sick, and unemployed workers were stuck with the 
bill.  In 1993, the federal deficit stood at $42 billion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645
<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the unfortunate heritage of the Conservative government, 
but we must not forget that before the Conservatives tere were 
the Trudeau Liberals, John Turner and great experts in 
economics.  The result was a growing deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the present Prime Minister said it would be impossible 
for him to eliminate this deficit in under five years, without 
cutting social programs.  The first solution was to cut social 
programs.  And what did the Liberals do as soon as they took 
over?  They systematically demolished social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1994 to 1999, federal government program expenditures were 
reduced by $7.5 billion. 
Transfer payments to the provinces alone were slashed by $6.3 
billion, or 84% of total reductions in program expenditures. 
Thus, close to 80% of federal budget cuts were shouldered by the 
provinces.  These federal cuts to front line services represent 
more than 75 cents of every dollar of cuts to health and 
education in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about the unemployed?  This is another Liberal policy 
aimed at eliminating the federal deficit.  There is nothing 
complicated about it. The employment insurance program is 
reformed, the rules are modified, and as a result fewer than 40% 
of unemployed workers paying into the program are now eligible 
to draw benefits.  And where does the surplus go?  First of all 
into the employment insurance fund, and later into the pocket of 
the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one thinks of it, employment insurance has become surplus 
insurance for the government and poverty insurance for workers 
who lose their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, is there anything more scary than losing one's job? 
There have been so many cuts in offices that the unemployed are 
now dealing with recordings. There is not much sensitivity 
involved. People wait. They do not know what they will get. The 
act is so complex. They are told “Use tape number one to find 
out how to fill your form. Use tape number two to know your 
rights. Use tape number three to kill time”. Finally, when the 
time comes to meet an officer, the afternoon is gone. It is 4:30 
p.m. They are then told “Sir, Madam, come back tomorrow”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the lists get longer. I have received many complaints in my 
riding office concerning the 1-800 number. 
The line is always busy. Yet, the telephone operators are 
located in Shawinigan, in the riding of Saint-Maurice. That 
service should work. After all, it is in the Prime Minister's 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now refer to a recent study by two UQAM professors, 
Pierre Fortin and Pierre-Yves Crémieux, which shows that, because 
of the recent employment insurance reforms, Quebec's welfare 
roles alone will eventually swell by 200,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impoverishment of Quebec and the regions is the result of 
the employment insurance program. The data from Statistics 
Canada support this forecast, given that, between 1989 and 1997, 
the percentage of unemployed receiving EI benefits dropped from 
83% down to 42%. The situation is even more dramatic in the case 
of young people. More than three out of every four young people 
do not qualify for employment insurance, even though all young 
workers contribute to the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word about the tax reduction, about the crumbs 
that this government offered in its latest budget. The Bloc 
Quebecois had asked for a targeted tax reduction that would have 
helped those who paid off the deficit, namely the unemployed, 
the young, the sick and the poor in our society. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT35"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT35"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the elimination of the 3% surtax for middle class 
people earning between $30,000 and $60,000, the reductions in 
income tax amount to $163 per person.  In this budget, the poor 
were left to their own devices, with tax reductions of only $90. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister announced an increase in the basic personal 
exemption from $6,456 to $7,131, a tax reduction of $115 per 
single taxpayer living alone.  That really boosts the economy, 
and helps a parent cope with difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken at length of the unemployed and health care, I 
will now speak about rural development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance announced cuts worth $100 million to 
funds earmarked for regional development.  Since its arrival in 
1993, this government has completely forgotten Quebec regions in 
its budgets.  That is understandable, since a recent survey 
published last week in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> revealed that 77% of 
people did not know who was responsible for regional 
development, despite government propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time they provide a bit of money in Bloc ridings, we are 
not invited.  They arrive on the sly.  The Minister of Human 
Resources Development was by two or three weeks ago on the 
pretext of making big local and regional announcements.  All he 
wanted to do was impress the local media with the benefits of 
the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The press conference was over in 20 minutes, of which 15 were 
taken up with questions and five with announcements.  The media 
reported that there was nothing in the budget for unemployed 
workers, middle income earners, or health.  On the contrary, 
there is plenty for health when it comes to Quebec. But once 
again this was misunderstood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to mention another cute patronage 
trick for interfering in the affairs of the provinces.  It is 
called rural development. There is an indepartmental working 
group composed of 26 federal departments and agencies.  Their 
job is quite simply to find ways of interfering in provincial 
jurisdictions where they have no business. That is their 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least they are frank about it, which is rare for members 
opposite.  They say that the rural development goals for the 
next few years are to ensure follow-up—$3.8 million for 68 small 
projects with no structure—; co-operate better with other levels 
of government.  I wonder what that is all about because they are 
going to be interfering in municipal and provincial 
jurisdictions.  Another goal is to make programs more flexible 
and—here comes the fine print—increase the federal presence.  This 
was on one of the slides shown last Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also want to listen.  Listen to what?  Listen to the 
demands of people who no longer know which way is up.  The 
response is to increase funding and to go over the heads of 
municipalities, provinces and agencies serving the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address these projects, particularly the $70,000 to 
develop a model for rural community health care co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other project—and the minister was asked to define rural 
community last Tuesday—is a $20,000 investment in community 
organizations in the municipalities of Longueuil, Saint-Hubert, 
Boucherville and Chambly. 
These communities are located across from Montreal, on the south 
shore. It is an urban area, and the government would have us 
believe that it will put money into rural development in that 
area. It is nothing but a joke.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, when talking about implementing certain 
provisions of the budget, it is very difficult for us, in the 
Bloc Quebecois, to vote in favour, because our basic demands 
were dismissed out of hand by the Minister of Finance, the Prime 
Minister and the federal Liberals. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a delight to have an opportunity to 
speak to Bill C-71, an act to implement certain provisions of the 
budget tabled in parliament on February 16, 1999. The reason it 
is a delight to have a chance to participate in this debate is to 
clarify some of the mythology surrounding the most recent budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that politics has a lot to do with perception. 
Perception is a fancy word for mythology, or misleading I 
suspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had some interesting advice.  Watching today is a very 
important individual, Ange Vautour, who is age 75.  Today is his 
birthday.  He is very interested in the outcome of today's 
deliberations.  As well, my father who is in his mid-nineties, is 
watching today.  He gave me all kinds of advice in terms of what 
to include in my comments on the budget.  They are two very 
special individuals, and I suspect many other very special 
individuals are watching today's proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened with interest to the debates to this point.  The 
picture from the constituency level is that this was a health 
care budget.  In other words, a lot of people said that the 
government took major steps to once again fund Canada's health 
care system. In a sense that is true, but only in a sense.  When 
we look at the fine print of this budget, we notice that if we 
wait for not this year, not next year, not the year after, not 
the year after that, and not the following year, but the 
following year, the funding the provinces will get will be at the 
same level as it was way back in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bit of magic, a bit of hocus-pocus.  This is moving 
the little shell between hats when the government says it is 
reinstating a whole lot of money into health care, which is true, 
but after all is said and done, many years from now, we are still 
way back in the mid-1990s in terms of funding for health care. 
Let us admit today that we are still going to be seriously 
underfunded in terms of developing the health care system that 
Canadians wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two items that I remember my friends in the Liberal 
Party promised Canadians.  They promised, and promised.  They 
said, “If you elect Liberals, we are going to have a decent home 
care program across the country.  If you elect Liberals, we are 
going to have a decent pharmacare program.  As a matter of fact, 
we will have a national pharmacare program and we are going to 
wind it into our medicare system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed that the budget was relatively mute on two items. The 
Liberals do not talk much about home care any more.  They do not 
talk much about pharmacare.  I suspect they can talk about it all 
they want if they do not put any money into it.  Mr. Speaker, you 
might want to have home care, I might want to have home care and 
my friend from P.E.I. might want to have home care, but if there 
is no money for home care, what the heck do we do?  This is an 
empty promise. This is a promise that means nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say we are not going to have a pharmacare program 
in this country for two reasons.  The most obvious one is that 
the government puts no money into it.  But there is another one 
and it is called NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the provisions of NAFTA if we were actually going to 
impose a pharmacare program that made sense, we would make a lot 
of multinational pharmaceutical companies unhappy, particularly 
those based in the United States.  They would say to us, “If you 
want to impose a national pharmacare program to give the people 
of Canada a break when it comes to buying their prescription 
drugs and so on, you have to compensate us for all the lost 
profits, billions and billions of dollars in lost profits”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No government is going to be in a fiscal position to do that. 
The promise on home care and pharmacare in particular is 
mythology that has been perpetuated by this government. It 
continues to be perpetuated, but I do not think Canadians are 
being fooled in the least.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some very specific concerns I want to raise about this 
bill today.  I want to talk for a moment about a fundamental 
problem that exists in this House, with this government, with 
this parliament and in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know all of us have encountered people saying they do not 
trust us, they trust politicians.  They say we will let them 
down. They do not believe we will do the things we say we will 
do. They feel we do not listen to them. They feel alienated from 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is good reason for having those feelings.  The government 
has let people down.  They are alienated.  Do members think a 
person living in Kamloops or in Chicoutimi or in Moose Jaw or in 
Thunder Bay is involved in the decision making of this government 
at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend says no.  He is a very smart 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Windsor either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Or in Windsor.  People do not believe 
they are involved.  They know they are left out of the circle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into proof, who makes the decisions?  Here and now, 
what we have in this great country is not a parliamentary 
democracy.  We have it in name but in reality we have an elected 
dictatorship where every few years Canadians elect a dictator. 
That person then decides they know what is best for everyone 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This really started with our old pal Brian Mulroney. He came in 
here and said “I'm really a bright person”.  I just thought of 
a joke.  We do not hear many jokes in this place.  These can be 
told about Brian Mulroney but you can load almost anybody else 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Mulroney and the member for Halifax were being invited to 
a speaking engagement in Vancouver.  At the airport in Ottawa 
there was a young fellow standing there feeling very dejected. 
Brian said “What's wrong with you?” The fellow said “I'm a Boy 
Scout and I am supposed to be at a jamboree in Vancouver.  I 
missed my flight”. Brian said “Join us.  We're heading for 
Vancouver”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plane took off and just about over Thunder Bay it got into 
real trouble.  The pilot said “Folks, I have bad news.  We're 
going down.  We're going to crash.  You have to jump out but 
there are only two parachutes. So you will have to fight it out 
between you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Mulroney jumps up and says “Listen, I'm obviously the 
smartest guy in the world.  I have to get down there and save 
this country”. So out he goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Boy Scout says “Listen, Ms. McDonough, you're the head of 
one of the most progressive political parties in the country. 
You have great ideas.  I think you should go”.  She turns to the 
Boy Scout and says “No, we can both jump out.  We can both take 
parachutes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Boy Scout said “What about Mr. Mulroney?  Didn't he jump 
out?”  “Yes, but the smartest guy in Canada grabbed your pack 
sack”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Mulroney started the trend to make this place somewhat 
irrelevant.  I do not think he liked parliament. He found it a 
nuisance and so on but he had to go through the motions.  They 
used closure, time allocation and so on to get legislation 
through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Liberals came in. I was hopeful.  I thought they have a 
much longer tradition of parliament, particularly with the 
leadership of the cabinet, and they would use closure less often. 
Lo and behold, they use it more often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Bob Rae used closure all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  The world is not perfect.  The reality 
is closure, closure, closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is in charge?  My friends opposite in the back who are 
making suggestions for my speech, are they in charge?  No, they 
are not.  Is the cabinet in charge?  No, the cabinet is not in 
charge.  Who is in charge of this country?  Not the Speaker. He 
is too nice a guy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The United States government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  That is interesting.  My friend says the 
United States government.  There is a lot of truth, 
unfortunately, in that.  We will come back to that in a moment. 
The person in charge sits over there.  He is called the Minister 
of Finance.  He actually decides now on major social policy in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back one budget.  In last year's budget we were having 
this debate.  One of the big items was the millennium scholarship 
fund. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said “This is what we are doing for education. 
We thought this through.  We have education policy.  We want to 
find ways and means of encouraging young people and others back 
into the school system, whether it be university, vocational 
school, college, technical school, an institute or whatever. We 
have this great idea. Its called the millennium scholarship fund 
and it will provide support for at least 7% of the students of 
this country”.  What about the other 93%? The funds have been 
cut to universities and colleges.  The government got out of the 
student loan program.  For those 7% of students there is a 
scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They made educational policy.  Was it the backbenchers on the 
Liberal side?  No.  It certainly was not on this side.  Did we 
have a single debate in the House of Commons on education?  Not a 
minute of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance decided that he knows best and he knows 
what educational policy should be.  He introduced it.  He is a 
very smart man.  He is a very nice guy.  I do not think he knows 
anything about educational policy.  Why should he?  He is a 
financier.  That is his responsibility.  That is the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then asked what does this country need. It requires a major 
overhaul of our health care system.  We all agree that health 
care is a crucial priority.  Who decides on health care policy? 
Is it the Minister of Health?  No, it is the Minister of Finance. 
He decides how much money is going into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago he said “We will gut the health care system, 
slash the guts out of the health care system”.  The government 
did, almost to the point this was an emergency situation.  Now 
the minister says they have made a mistake.  Things have to be 
changed so they will start refunding health care.  Five years 
from now we will be at the level we were five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is determining health care policy in 
this great country.  There is something wrong with this. This is 
just the beginning.  I could speak for the next two hours about 
the Minister of Finance being in charge of everything in this 
country.  Cabinet is not in charge and neither is the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use one other example because it is a hot issue, the 
replacement to the Young Offenders Act.  The government brought 
in the new Young Offenders Act which has various provisions and 
ideas, some very positive, some questionable, some negative. 
Nevertheless it is a reasonable try at doing a better job in 
terms of dealing with young offenders.  I will give the 
government credit for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what is lacking?  Are ideas lacking?  No.  Are new 
initiatives lacking?  No.  Are new proposals lacking?  No.  There 
is no money to implement the program.  We could have all the 
programs, all the policies, all the new initiatives, all the new 
legislation, new regulations we want, but if no money is 
available to deliver to the provinces, what good is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the same problem we had with the last Young Offenders 
Act.  One of the main problems we had with the last Young 
Offenders Act was that it had all types of suggestions that 
judges could take but there was no substance.  There were no 
opportunities at the local level.  Lawyers could argue on behalf 
of their young offender clients about the most appropriate way to 
deal with an offence but the judge would say he had no choice but 
to throw the kid in jail.  That is the only choice the judge 
would have.  Unfortunately after this new legislation is in 
place, if that takes place, it will be the same situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my recollection serves me, there is $200 million available 
over the next three years to implement all the provisions in this 
new act.  It is pittance.  It is an impossibility to implement 
the provisions of this new Young Offenders Act. That is the 
mythology.  Who decides this?  Who decides how young offenders 
are dealt with? Is it the Minister of Justice?  No.  Is it the 
solicitor general?  No.  Is it anybody in cabinet?  Yes, the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong with this picture.  I can see members 
shaking their heads. I think we all agree.  There is something 
wrong with the system. We have to change this so that the 
Minister of Finance can spread his decision making around 
slightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was also to be a budget about productivity, acknowledging 
that we need to improve our productivity. I think we all agree 
there are areas of the economy where productivity is important. 
When we say the word productivity, most Canadians watching will 
start to panic.  When people hear the word productivity they 
think of layoffs, salary cuts and overtime.  In other words, 
productivity does not mean what productivity is. Productivity 
means tougher times for most working people.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about productivity, I will take my hat off and 
acknowledge that the government put aside some money for research 
and development, to fund some of the major research agencies of 
the country.  That was a positive step.  By and large those funds 
are destined for the large multinational corporations. That is 
fair enough if some incentive will get them moving into more 
highly productive areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the real innovation and creativity takes place is in the 
small businesses of the country, in the medium sized businesses 
that are out there on the cutting edge of technological change, 
the innovators.  Therein lies a real serious funding problem. 
The government would rather fund Bombardier, which probably does 
not really need any help, than to fund that small business in New 
Brunswick, northern Manitoba or wherever. That funding is not 
there.  That is a serious problem we have to confront through 
either the tax system, granting agencies or whatever, to 
recognize that is where the real creativity is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will identify the fundamental fault with this legislation in 
this budget. What kind of successful life would you have if you 
did not have a clue where you were going, if you did not have a 
clue what you would try to do in the next two months, two years 
or whatever? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that for anyone to be a successful individual, 
however success is defined, there needs to be a bit of a road 
map. Goals and strategies have to be set.  There has to be a 
plan, a business plan as the business community would call it.  A 
person with a business idea, whether a farmer, small 
entrepreneur, home based business or self-employed, before going 
into any lending institution has to have a thought through 
business plan in order to qualify for support or funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the first thing anybody asks for.  What is your plan? 
Where are you going? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know you are very successful in a whole variety 
of areas and I know the reason you are successful is you know how 
to write a good business plan. Successful business people know 
how to write a successful business plan because it is 
fundamental. Your plan on politics may be a little warped but 
that is something we can discuss another time, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a plan to be successful as individuals.  There has to be 
a plan to be successful in business.  There has to be a plan to 
be successful as any organization, whether it is the Red Cross, 
the Boy Scouts, a minor hockey team or whatever.  There has to be 
a plan to be successful.  We all agree with this fundamental 
premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about as a country?  Do we need a plan to be successful as 
a country or can we just mumble, fumble and jumble our way 
through?  That is what we are doing.  Most Canadians if asked 
what they thought the game plan for our federal government is 
would probably laugh or shudder “oh my God, I think it is this 
but I am not sure”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would Canadians not be aware of what our plan as a country 
is?  We do not have a plan.  We have no idea where we will be six 
months from now.  Look at the budget itself.  When most countries 
put together a budget their minister of finance has the guts to 
say “This is where I think our projects are going for at least 
the next five years.  For five years this is what we project our 
revenues to be and for five years this is what we predict our 
expenditures to be”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not dare go there as a country.  We might foray out a 
couple of years.  That is it.  Even those, let us face it, are 
ultra conservative proposals.  Even the Minister of Finance 
agrees we have no plan.  We do not plan ahead and therefore we 
are in trouble. How can we evaluate a budget that is not based on 
anything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing in this budget that really concerns me is the revenue 
agency being created, this monstrous form of government that will 
have access in everybody's lives, and this legislation 
facilitates that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say we will share information about people.  This is the 
ultimate in big brother, sharing information between provincial 
governments and federal government departments about individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this agency were accountable, at least to the elected 
representatives of Canada, I would not feel so bad but it will 
operate at arm's length, virtually like a crown corporation. 
There is not accountability.  It can intrude in Canadian lives 
all over the place and nobody will be able to ask the minister 
what is going on because it will be set aside.  It will be like 
Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has anyone ever tried to find out what Canada Post does to 
wrecked letters or why the mail is not delivered?  It is almost 
impossible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision is something we should be waving some flags 
about. If the government is going to go ahead with this new 
revenue agency, it must have some real transparency and 
accountability to parliament and the elected representatives of 
the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a whole host of other items but I am running out of time. 
I will close by saying that we are not going to support this 
bill.  We have too many concerns about it.  I would not say that 
there is nothing good in it.  There is obviously something good 
in any budget.  There are a number of positive initiatives but 
overall it misses the mark.  It does not reflect the views and 
concerns of Canadians.  And frankly, I do not want a whole 
country run by a dictator called Paul Martin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member is a 
very experienced parliamentarian.  As all other members know, we 
do not refer to other members except by their office or their 
riding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, not only would I hope the hon. 
member would take into consideration what you have just said, but 
also on the way he characterized the Minister of Finance I hope 
when he gets the opportunity to stand up he will correct what he 
said and retract that comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toward the latter part of his comments I am assuming the hon. 
member talked about how he would build budgets.  There has been 
some success on this side of the House in building budgets, with 
two year rolling targets, a contingency reserve, and prudence in 
the budgets ensuring that we stay with balanced budgets.  We took 
that $42 billion down to a $3.5 billion surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member obviously does not agree with the way balanced 
budgets are being built in this country, so I would offer him up 
the opportunity.  How would he build the mechanics of the budget? 
He sits on the finance committee, he has heard from Canadians. He 
talks about rolling out the five year plans.  The last time this 
country got itself involved in rolling out five year plans was 
when the Conservative Party was in government and we ended up 
with a $42 billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the NDP build budgets?  It obviously does not agree 
with the success we have had.  Let us give it a chance to express 
how it would build budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very reasonable 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I do take back referring to the Minister of Finance by 
his name.  I was referring to the Minister of Finance.  And so 
there is no mistaking, if the word dictator can be used in a 
positive sense, that is what I was trying to do.  Perhaps I could 
use a different term.  I will be serious with my hon. friend 
because I respect his views and the work he does, but too much 
power now sits with one cabinet minister.  There is too much 
influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend knows because I heard his comments earlier that this 
budget gives the Minister of Finance and the Department of 
Finance even more authority and even greater power in terms of 
disbursing funds.  This very clear trend is a serious concern 
which I share with him and which others have shared with me.  His 
criticism was well placed.  It was a term that could be 
misconstrued. I did not mean it in a pejorative sense.  I meant 
it in a neutral sense with dictator meaning one single person 
deciding on government policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend said that a major accomplishment of this government 
was balancing the books.  I do not think a single Canadian would 
say that was not the case, but let us acknowledge how that 
balance was achieved.  That balance was achieved by dipping into 
the EI fund.  By dipping into the EI fund and taking billions of 
dollars in employment insurance premiums, it was easy to balance 
the budget. The other way to balance the budget was to devastate 
the health care system.  My friends over here would suggest there 
were some tax issues involved in this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any government can balance the budget if it slashes the meaning 
out of a society.  Anybody can do that.  If the government shut 
down every university and every hospital, it would balance the 
budget.  It is that simple.  But what kind of a country is that? 
What kind of a government is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the government dip into the EI fund, which some 
people have suggested is illegal to do, but it is now going to 
dip into the pension fund of the federal government employees. 
The government is going to dip into $37 billion of a pension fund 
for which it has no authority. The government is going to have to 
bring in legislation to be given that authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point was to acknowledge that the surplus comes with a 
great deal of pain. 
Were the people who were most pained by this budget cutting 
rewarded now that there is a surplus?  Were the homeless 
recognized?  No.  Were the unemployed recognized?  No.  Were the 
people who need affordable housing recognized?  No.  Were the 
farmers acknowledged?  No.  Were the RCMP recognized? No.  Were 
the people in the fisheries industry recognized?  No. Were the 
miners recognized?  No.  Were the forest workers recognized?  No. 
Who was recognized?

</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time we eliminate all of those groups, the nurses were 
hacked out, the doctors, the teachers, the professors, and on and 
on and on, there was a handful of people who liked this budget. 
My suspicion is that they probably hang around Bay Street.

<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of a constituent of mine by the name of Ange 
Vautour who is celebrating his 75th birthday today, my father 
whom I love dearly, could my colleague explain to both me and my 
father what is in the budget, and again how the deficit was paid? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party mentions that we are attracting companies here 
because of the low wages.  I would like my colleague to explain 
to the House what exactly the Liberal government has done to make 
sure that people are forced to work not only for minimum salary, 
but I have a feeling that a lot of people in this country are 
working below minimum salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was a thoughtful 
question, one I suspect a lot of people are asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard in the House repeatedly that one of the attractive 
features to lure foreign corporations to Canada is the low wages 
they are able to pay.  This seems to be some kind of good news. 
It is a rather warped sense of good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the realities is that the radical changes to the 
employment insurance program resulted in that the majority of 
Canadians who paid into that program are receiving no benefits at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, imagine what it would be like for you to lose your 
job.  When people lose their jobs and have no income, they become 
vulnerable to people who could exploit them in terms of paying 
for their services of one kind or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware, and I know the hon. member is as well, that because 
of the changes to the employment insurance program, when some 
people get their employment insurance cheque, the amount is 
actually as low as $32, $50, $75. Mr. Speaker, I know you are a 
very frugal man, but imagine trying to live for a couple of weeks 
on $32.  This is tough.  Anybody who is trying to live on $32 a 
week, $100 a week or $200 a week will be vulnerable to people who 
are prepared to exploit the worker's skills, background, talent 
and so on.  That is one of the reasons so many people today are 
in a very difficult situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was one reason. The other reason is our taxation.  It is 
fair to say that Canadians by and large with a few exceptions are 
paying too much tax, income tax and other kinds of taxes. It goes 
back to my friend who asked what we would propose, and that is a 
tax cut that would benefit every single man, woman and child in 
the country, not this group or that group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tax cut that every single person would benefit from. 
Even a little kid buying a teddy bear would benefit, or a parent 
purchasing a needed vehicle or a washing machine would benefit 
from a cut in the GST.  This would benefit every single person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what the people who would benefit most from a cut in the 
GST would do with that saved money in their pockets. They would 
spend it.  People are pushed to the wall and their savings are 
minimal, if they have any at all. They would spend those dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those dollars would go from business to business to business 
around that little community. They would support the small and 
medium size businesses. Those dollars would circulate around and 
around in the community benefiting the small businesses which 
hire people and provide employment opportunities. 
But instead, those dollars are coming to Ottawa to be used for 
some questionable purposes from time to time.

listened with great interest to the comments of my colleague from 
Kamloops on the budget implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have considerable concerns, and I think all members of the 
House do, for the future of young Canadians.  The task before us 
is to prepare policies that will create a more prosperous future 
for young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am greatly concerned about the loss of so many young Canadians 
to the U.S.  We have seen an unprecedented level of brain drain 
over the last several years.  We have lost talented young 
Canadians to the U.S.  Every sign is that that will increase 
unless we address some fundamental policies, part of which is tax 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One hon. member referred to the birthday of her father today. 
Today is the birthday of my nephew Seth who is three years old. 
I think of young Canadians like Seth and how they will prosper in 
the future.  We have to work very hard to ensure that the 
policies we create are sound, not just in terms of what is good 
for today, but what is good for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government seems to be very intent on providing labels for 
its budgets.  The label for last year's budget I believe was the 
education budget. All members in the House recognized student 
indebtedness as being a huge issue.  Student debts grew by 100% 
from 1993 to last year, from an average of $12,000 to about 
$25,000 last year. In the year after the education budget which 
was to address the issue of student debt, over 12,000 Canadian 
graduates declared bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a parliamentarian who is very concerned about the future of 
health care. If last year's budget was the education budget and 
the result a year after its implementation was 12,000 graduates 
declaring bankruptcy, I would appreciate the hon. member's 
insight on what he predicts to be the effect of this year's 
health care budget on Canadians and on our beleaguered health 
care system. The health care system has been absolutely 
devastated and decimated by the Draconian slash and cut approach 
of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member expect to be the effect over the next 
12 months when Canadians need a stronger health care system?  Can 
they expect a significant improvement based on this government's 
reinvestment?  He mentioned that in five years the federal 
government will have only reached the 1995 level of federal 
government investment in health care.  Yet the government spent 
$3.6 million of Canadian taxpayers' money to tell them this was a 
great budget for health care. Does the hon. member feel that 
perhaps that money should have been spent on health care as 
opposed to telling Canadians about this health care reinvestment 
which by and large is smoke and mirrors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again it was a very 
thoughtful question from my friend from Kings—Hants.  I think he 
has answered the question himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He described the mythology surrounding this so-called health 
care budget, just like last year's education budget. He 
acknowledged that very little moneys will go into the provincial 
coffers for health care next year as a result of this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My short answer to him is that I would be surprised if Canadians 
noticed any change at all in Canada's health care system as a 
result of this federal budget.  He pointed out a major flaw in 
the mythology the government has been trying to perpetuate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we all agree with his suggestion, and I know my leader 
has said the same thing, about the millions of dollars the 
government has spent trying to tell people that it has done a 
good job in health care.   If that money was going directly into 
health care, it would be money better spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I suggest that if a government or an individual is doing a 
good job, there is no need to advertise that they are doing a 
good job.  People understand that.  They will know that.  But if 
they are not doing a good job, then they have to advertise.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK174">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from December 7, 1998, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-219, an act to amend the Criminal Code (using 
or operating a stolen motor vehicle in the commission of an 
offence), be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise and speak to this 
bill, particularly because of the person who has proposed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose has been absolutely tireless in his 
efforts on behalf of not only the people in his constituency but 
indeed all Canadians in bringing more common sense to the whole 
area of justice in Canada.  He has a tireless history in our 
party of continuously working on behalf of the justice issue, and 
I commend him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-219 is an act to amend the Criminal Code by adding the 
following after section 334: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one who, while committing an offence or while attempting to 
commit an offence or during flight after committing or attempting 
to commit an offence, operates or uses a motor vehicle that he 
has stolen or knows to have been stolen is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of one 
year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could refer to the October 20 edition of <I>Hansard</I>, in 
presenting the bill my colleague from Wild Rose said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My private member's bill amends the Criminal Code so that a 
person guilty of an indictable offence must be sentenced to one 
year imprisonment if the person operates or uses a motor vehicle 
that the person has stolen or knows has been stolen while 
committing or attempting to commit an offence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made the point that the bill put the police chiefs' 
resolution into practice.  As I mentioned, my colleague is 
tireless in making sure he is in tune not only with the Canadian 
public but indeed with the Canadian Police Association and the 
Chiefs of Police.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill puts the police chiefs' resolution into practice.  It 
will clearly serve as a deterrent to those considering these 
types of criminal acts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also noted: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three primary motivations for auto theft:  one, 
joyriding; two, transportation for criminal purposes such as 
breaking and entering, robbery, and drive-by shootings; and 
three, when a car is stripped for parts or exported to other 
provinces or countries for sale. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly interested to note that the parliamentary 
secretary to the justice minister then followed my colleague and 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person found guilty of this indictable offence must be 
sentenced to one year's imprisonment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put emphasis on the word must because there is nowhere in Bill 
C-219 or in the comments of my colleague that says this is a 
mandatory sentence.  She was wrong.  It must not be a sentence to 
one year's imprisonment.  She went on further to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This offence must be served consecutively to any other punishment 
imposed on the person for an offence arising out of the same 
event or series of events. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is again wrong.  There is nothing in Bill C-219 that 
prescribes whether it be consecutive or concurrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short time that I have had the privilege of being the 
solicitor general critic for the Reform Party I have been on a 
very rapid up-ramp of learning.  What I have learned is the 
difference between consecutive and concurrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary is suggesting that even if a person 
was found guilty of this offence, should the bill indeed pass 
through the House and become law, he or she would be liable for 
one year's imprisonment.  That would simply be served at the same 
time as the penalty for whatever other criminal offence was being 
served.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect the minister is prejudging that the court system would 
say it is one extra charge and it will be served concurrently. It 
would be served at exactly the same time so it would not make any 
difference.  What a waste of time if that were the case, and 
indeed it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were the case it would be a pattern much like the 
government has chosen for very violent offences, very violent 
rapes and sexual offences, very violent multiple murders and all 
the events surrounding multiple murders.  Basically the 
government has gone into the business of volume discount. In 
other words, although it is true that one cannot serve more than 
one life sentence, one can be incarcerated for an extended period 
of time if life sentences are served consecutively, that is one 
after the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person were able to apply for parole after the end of 15 or 
25 years, depending on the precise circumstance, and there were 
more than one murder or more violence surrounding the event, the 
penalty for all the other surrounding events would have been paid 
at the same time as that for the longest event because the 
longest sentence before one can get parole in Canada is 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is out of touch with the Canadians with whom I 
speak in coffee shops in my constituency and with whom my 
colleagues speak on the streets of Calgary.  Most members in the 
House, and I dare say even a few Liberals when they talk to their 
constituents, must know that the constituents are after some 
feeling of public safety.  The government is not giving any sense 
of public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get back to the bill at hand.  Bill C-219 takes a look at the 
issue of someone, during the course of committing an indictable 
offence, stealing and making use of a vehicle.  It basically says 
this must be put in place as a deterrent.  The fact is that it is 
only for one year.  Because of the parole system, if a person has 
a one year sentence it is quite possible to be out on day parole 
within one-sixth of a year, in other words within two months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not even involved in truth in sentencing. It 
says they will get one year if they use a car for a joy ride. 
Such is being used, for example, in Cornwall as we speak where 
people involved in smuggling weapons, guns, liquor, drugs and 
tobacco were using vehicles for high speed chases.  All sorts of 
things are going on.  As a result of the sentencing regime under 
this government, even for a one year sentence the offender upon 
conviction would not get one year because that is the maximum. 
Even if he or she got the maximum, the offender would potentially 
be out on day parole within two months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why my colleague brought the bill before the House.  In 
his usual thoughtful manner he will have worked through the 
process and will have taken direction from the people responsible 
for public safety, safety on our streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also as solicitor general critic I must say that I have a deep 
concern about the entire issue of tracking vehicles.  We know 
that stolen vehicles end up at the Canadian police information 
centre on CPIC.  If a police officer sees a vehicle he or she can 
access CPIC to find out the status of the vehicle.  If the 
vehicle is stolen or there is something irregular about it, it 
will show up on CPIC.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my position on behalf of our party that there be an 
upgrading of the CPIC system so that vehicle identification 
numbers, not just for stolen vehicles but indeed for all vehicles 
in Canada, would be available to police officers.  If Bill C-219 
is enacted, CPIC and the vehicle registration system would become 
part of bringing Bill C-219 into full force and effect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand to debate 
Bill C-219.  It is a little frustrating the hon. member for Wild 
Rose is not here to speak to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member knows it is contrary 
to the rules to refer to the absence of hon. members.  I am 
certain his mistake was inadvertent.  Nevertheless, I would urge 
him not to pursue the idea of who is here and who is not.  That 
is contrary to the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  I must say that the bill of the member 
for Wild Rose, Bill C-219, is something that we on this side of 
the House cannot agree with because of the way in which once 
again the Reform Party, in its eternal wisdom, has decided to 
handle minor acts of indiscretion such as joy riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know about the riding of the member for Wild Rose.  I 
know on occasion he likes to play sheriff.  Perhaps some of his 
constituents would be absolutely petrified to go joy riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in my riding, the great riding of 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, on occasion people have gone joy 
riding.  As a matter of a fact a cousin of mine went joy riding 
one time.  I know the hon. member from Kootenay would probably 
say it was the hon. member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke who 
did it, but it was a cousin of mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the government incarcerate a person for a one year term 
because of a minor indiscretion?  Goodness gracious, members of 
the Reform Party continually come forward with notions on how to 
mete out justice.  They would throw them in jail and throw away 
the key.  They would not worry about the person.  They would not 
worry about the indiscretion.  They would throw them in the 
slammer and they would be done with them: out of sight, out of 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way we on this side of the House would handle 
the judicial system.   The hon. member for Kootenay—Columbia 
somehow extrapolated from joy riding to death.  The little 
munchkin is at it again.  If members opposite want to listen to 
the great justice that is being done by the Liberal Party of 
Canada, all they have to do is pay attention for a short while. I 
do not use that in a derogatory connotation against my hon. 
friend on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely disastrous that the Reform Party would 
continually mete out something like Bill C-219.  I know the hon. 
member for Kootenay—Columbia said that the member for Wild Rose 
was a tireless worker.  In my estimation he is rather tiresome 
when he puts forth agendas such as this one.  This is not what 
the Canadian judicial system is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The police chiefs want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  The police chiefs do not want it. 
Reform Party members are infamous for standing up and saying 
there is one police chief, one person, one child or one priest 
and extrapolating that to include the entire Dominion of Canada. 
That is absolutely ludicrous and they know it. That is what I was 
getting to when I said “tiresome”.  It is tiresome that they 
would bring forth that type of logic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view the objectives of the private member's bill now 
before the House are already well served by the tools provided by 
the common law principles of sentencing and legislation which is 
currently in place.  The hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough would agree with me because he 
has a legal background.  He knows that the Reform Party would 
bring into place scurrilous innuendo against the judicial system. 
That party is trying to tell judges exactly what to do.  What is 
the Reform Party's agenda?  If a person is not elected they do 
not know what they are talking about.  Once again it is an attack 
on judges and the judicial system.  My goodness gracious, I do 
not know how some members of the Reform Party actually got 
elected.  I think they were appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-219, an act to amend the Criminal Code, would create an 
indictable offence for using a stolen motor vehicle in the 
commission, attempted commission or flight following the 
commission of an offence.  If found guilty, everyone who commits 
this indictable offence would be liable to imprisonment for a 
term of one year, to be served consecutively with any other 
punishment imposed arising out of the same offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of gibberish is that?  To begin with, it is flawed. 
Even the notion of the bill is flawed.  The summary of the bill 
is flawed.  Under Bill C-41, as everyone in this House knows, 
including the hon. member opposite, we have already looked into 
this.  We have already done justice to this particular matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the member want to bring up Bill C-219?  Why the hon. 
member for Wild Rose would propose this particular piece of 
legislation is beyond my belief and beyond the belief of most 
Canadians.  The way we handle justice in this country is not by 
throwing people in jail and throwing away the key.  But that, in 
the infinite wisdom of the Reform Party, is the way to handle the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House believe in rehabilitation.  We do 
not believe in complete incarceration just for the simple reason 
of it.  We cannot qualify it.  Reform Party members know that. 
They know they cannot put a maximum or a minimum on sentencing. 
That is up to the judge's discretion.  We cannot do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You don't know what you are talking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, far be it for me to 
respond to the hon. members opposite, but if anyone does not know 
what they are talking about it is the hon. member's party on the 
other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the party whose leader came out on the front page of a 
very reputable paper saying “Guess what, fellow Canadians, 
fellow Reformers, the Reform Party can't win so we are going to 
have to form a new party”.  That is unbelievable.  The captain 
of the ship is saying “Listen, if we get on this ship it is 
going to sink”.  Members opposite are on a sinking ship.  They 
want to join the Conservative Party, which has already said it 
does not want them.  The NDP does not want them.  My goodness 
gracious, I just do not know where the Reform Party is coming 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the type of thing Canadian people do not want.  The 
Reform Party, with its self-serving demagoguery and its 
sanctimonious attitude, believes it knows what is best for the 
entire country.  Under this— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am sure that somewhere in this blather we are going to get some 
relevance.  I wonder if we could have some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member began by talking 
about the bill and he seems to have got on to the Reform Party. 
I know that perhaps he intends to talk about the Reform agenda in 
relation to the bill and I think it might be helpful if he did so 
to keep us on the straight and narrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize to you, but I 
certainly do not apologize to the party opposite.  Correct me if 
I am wrong, and we can check <I>Hansard</I>, but whenever the hon. 
member speaks he makes very vituperative remarks about the great 
Liberal Party.  I took a little offence to that.  But I will go 
on to the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If while in flight—and the hon. member was in full flight, 
although he was not in as full flight as the hon. member for Wild 
Rose when he discussed this bill—in a stolen motor vehicle 
following the commission of an offence the offender posed a 
danger to the lives of persons—and I might add that the hon. 
member for Kootenay—Columbia could pose a danger as I have 
actually seen him drive a motor vehicle—for example due to 
excessive speed, this too would be considered an aggravating 
factor meriting a harsher sentence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentencing provisions contained in the Criminal Code also 
enable judges to exercise their discretion to impose consecutive 
sentencing upon offenders where appropriate.  Our sentencing is 
comprehensive and provides the flexibility needed to tailor 
sentences to the factual circumstances of the offender's conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals contained in Bill C-219 are simply not required to 
address the conduct of offenders using a stolen motor vehicle in 
the commission, attempted commission or flight following the 
commission of an offence.  We already have the tools at our 
disposal to deal with this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-219 is flawed.  Members opposite know it.  The Canadian 
public knows it.  We on this side of the House will certainly 
know it and we will not participate or partake in such a flawed 
bill because we know what is right for the Canadian public. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of Bill C-219, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code with respect to using or operating a stolen motor 
vehicle in the commission of an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we understand that Bill C-219 deals exactly 
with that.  I will repeat that for members opposite because they 
seem to have missed the point.  It is an act to amend the 
Criminal Code with respect to using or operating a stolen motor 
vehicle in the commission of an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for Wild Rose.  Although we have not 
always agreed on remedies for the justice system, there are many 
problems in our justice system and I agree that the Liberal 
government is not always there for Canadians to strengthen the 
Criminal Code.  Tougher provisions are needed in many places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by previous speakers, the bill would amend section 
334 of the Criminal Code.  The purpose of the amendment is to 
classify those found guilty of operating or using a motor vehicle 
that a person has stolen or knows has been stolen while 
committing an indictable offence, during flight or attempting to 
commit an offence.  It is fairly simple legislation that is being 
proposed.  All we have to do is stick to the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentence for such an offence would be a term of imprisonment 
for one year.  It would also require that the sentence be served 
consecutively of any other punishment if it arises out of the 
same set or series of events that contributed to the conviction 
for the first offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of that is to say in common parlance that there would be 
greater emphasis placed on an offence that was committed while 
using a stolen vehicle.  In short, Bill C-219 would act as a 
greater deterrent for such offences.  Certainly it would be 
commendable for this type of legislation to come from the 
Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member's efforts in this regard and I am 
supportive of the bill.  This is a positive measure that the 
member for Wild Rose brings forward because it addresses two key 
areas in which there is need for improvement in our Criminal 
Code.  It would toughen the criminal sanctions for those 
individuals who use a stolen vehicle to assist in the commission 
of a criminal act.  This would be a welcome change because it 
would additionally punish criminals for the additional steps they 
have taken, namely to have stolen a vehicle to commit another 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area of the intended amendment proposed in section 
334.1(2), which is very much a truth in sentencing provision, 
ensures that the sentence imposed on the criminal, mainly the 
driver, would be served consecutively.  That is, it would not be 
simply dealt away, which is often done in criminal proceedings by 
a plea bargain.  The sentence would be cumulative.  It would be 
served consecutively as opposed to concurrently.  This would send 
a strong message to the thousands of Canadians who lose their 
vehicles through theft or someone who would commit a robbery and 
forcibly take their vehicles.  It would result in greater 
accountability and would certainly send a message to the criminal 
element.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for everyone to understand that when a vehicle 
is stolen it is often damaged and often never recovered.  The 
person the crime is committed against is greatly inconvenienced. 
People experience a psychological feeling of invasion when their 
property is taken or damaged.  It is similar to when a person's 
home is invaded.  The purpose of the hon. member's motion is to 
amend the code to put greater emphasis on this type of offence. I 
believe it to be a positive one.  I would therefore hope there is 
support at third reading for Bill C-284 brought forward by the 
member for Calgary Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us on this side of the House, at least those who are 
interested enough in this bill to speak on it here today, 
certainly see that voting in favour of this type of legislation 
is a deterrent to the very thing the hon. member had brought 
forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how well meaning, legislation will go nowhere without 
the ability to implement and enforce it.  I would therefore like 
to outline some of my concerns with respect to the government's 
persistence in underfunding a host of law enforcement issues. The 
solicitor general has often stated publicly that public safety is 
a strategy and a priority for the government.  Instead of talking 
perhaps the solicitor general could also do a lot to demonstrate 
that commitment to public safety by supporting legislation such 
as the initiative brought forward by the member for Wild Rose and 
by paying greater attention to what our police community is 
telling him.  Quite bluntly, police officers are getting the 
shaft from the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the information revealed by the government's own 
organized crime committee last April, the national police service 
needs an additional $200 million over the next four years or it 
will functionally expire.  That will have a great impact on every 
part of the country.  We have already seen a situation evolve 
where large detachments of the RCMP are underfunded. The 
solicitor general and the Liberal government decided to cut $74.1 
million from the RCMP's organized crime budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about leadership or providing resources for the law 
enforcement community.  It is quite the contrary.  When you cut 
13% from the budget in one fiscal year what do you expect the 
people who are supposed to uphold the government and the law in 
this country to do?  The RCMP is not the only police force that 
feels the effect.  Municipal and provincial police forces are 
inevitably forced to pick up the slack.  Many of these forces are 
already burdened by the abandonment of the ports police and are 
struggling to fill the void left by this government's axe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a real commitment to law enforcement, not just talk, not 
just debate in the Chamber but real legislation.  The government 
has to bring in legislative initiatives if we are to see real 
concrete improvements.  I applaud the member for Wild Rose for 
taking such an initiative. it is quite disturbing to think the 
government would not embrace such a positive initiative on the 
member's part.  I would expect the government to support this 
legislation since it is votable and as we in the Conservative 
Party will be supporting it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-219 today 
on behalf of my colleague from Wild Rose.  I listened to the rant 
of the member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke.  It was very 
clear he had no understanding of what the bill is all about.  As 
I listened to him I was reminded of an old saying from many years 
ago that if you stare at something long enough and hard enough, 
you begin to take on some of the characteristics of what you are 
staring at.   Considering the long career in harness racing of 
member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, I see there is a lot of 
truth to that saying.  He has obviously spent a lot of time 
staring at the back end of a horse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  On behalf of Standardbred Canada, of which I am proud to 
be a member, and on behalf of the horse racing fraternity across 
this country, I take exception to the hon. member insinuating 
that there could be a member for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke who 
is a horse's ass.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think the hon. member went 
that far.  I am sure if he had he would have been called to order 
by the Chair.  I am sure he would not have wanted to suggest any 
such thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member for 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke believes he is a horse's ass I will 
grant him that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to Bill C-219, it was obvious the member did not 
understand what he was talking about.  The concept of this bill 
put forward by the member for Wild Rose originated in August 1996 
at the annual meeting of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police.  One of the resolutions that came out of that meeting was 
the unanimous consent to add a minimum jail sentence when a 
stolen vehicle is used in the commission of a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-219 would amend the Criminal Code to provide for a 
minimum sentence to be levied when someone used a stolen vehicle 
in the commission of a crime.  There is not rocket science about 
that but the Liberals have a hard time understanding what this 
bill is about.  This would simply put the police chiefs' 
resolution into practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose did receive a letter from the Canadian 
Police Association.  For those Liberals who do not know, these 
are the frontline workers who deal with crime on a daily basis 
and are witness to crime committed using a stolen vehicle. They 
say to the member for Wild Rose: “The measures proposed in Bill 
C-219 are therefore necessary to address this public safety 
concern and we appreciate and support your efforts in this 
regard”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last Liberal member who spoke said that support from the 
Canadian police chiefs and the Canadian Police Association did 
not exist.  I am happy to inform him that it does exist in a 
letter of support for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me deal with another statement. The member for 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke said we should not be hard on 
someone who has had a minor indiscretion and steals a vehicle and 
goes for a joyride.  I have never heard such a ridiculous 
statement in my life.  Does the member know that there are many 
people killed in this country by people who have had, in his 
words, some minor indiscretions?   They have stolen a vehicle, 
gone for a joyride only to wipeout some pedestrian on a street 
corner, or on a crosswalk, or slam head on into another vehicle 
and kill someone.  Does he understand that when he makes that 
statement?  I find it pretty hard to take statements like that 
considering the consequences of this so-called minor 
indiscretions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also says the Canadian judicial system does not want or does 
not need an amendment to the Criminal Code like this.  He says 
that in his opinion and in the opinion of the government 
Canadians are well served by what is in the Criminal Code now. 
The Criminal Code does not, even in Bill C-41 which he talked 
about and which I do not think he understood either, provide for 
an additional sentence to be levied against someone who commits a 
crime using a stolen vehicle.  It does provide for an additional 
minimum sentence for someone who uses a firearm in the commission 
of a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Threatening with a firearm, using a vehicle or using any other 
type of device in a commission of a crime and being a threat to 
public safety, should there not be a provision to address that 
and to provide not only a penalty but perhaps deterrence?  Stolen 
vehicles in this country are at an epidemic stage.  Around 20% of 
all vehicles stolen are stolen for the purposes of committing a 
crime.  They are used as get away vehicles or for whatever 
purpose.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government may make light of the member for Wild 
Rose's private member's bill, I think it is a little misinformed 
about the statistics. It is also misinformed about the opinion of 
the police who are out there on the streets every day.  It is 
also misinformed about the Canadian Association of Chiefs of 
Police and the support it has for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1988 auto thefts have grown about 80%, another 9% in 1996 
alone.  This is the eighth straight year of dramatic increase in 
the theft of vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary motivations for stealing cars or trucks are 
joyriding, transportation for criminal purposes, breaking and 
entering, robbery, drive-by shootings, or they simply strip the 
vehicles for parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars every year to 
the provinces.  I think the government has an opportunity here to 
provide not only a penalty but perhaps deterrence. Deterrence and 
penalties are foreign words to the Liberal government.  We have 
seen it and are seeing it in its approach to the impaired driving 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go to that because we are talking about deterrence and 
penalties.  The justice committee has a mandate to amend the 
Criminal Code to enhance deterrence to impaired driving and 
ensure the penalties reflect the seriousness of the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I understand, someone was arrested who was drunk. The 
person was handcuffed and put in a police car.  Somehow the 
person got the handcuffs in front of them, stole the police 
cruiser while intoxicated, took off down the highway, smashed 
into another car and killed two people.  This was in Quebec. 
Under the Liberal philosophy on how we should treat this person, 
it is not their fault.  They were obviously discriminated against 
in their childhood and it is society to blame, not the person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just hope the mandate received by the justice committee to 
amend the Criminal Code to enhance deterrence and assess 
appropriate penalties to impaired drivers is somehow recognized 
in the next few weeks.  I do have my doubts, given what has 
happened thus far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was absolutely highly irresponsible of the member for 
Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke to refer to the stealing of a 
vehicle for the purpose of joyriding as some sort of brief 
indiscretion, considering the carnage that has been caused by 
just such an act.  He should apologize to the families of the 
victims who have been killed by joyriders and those who have been 
left with permanent injuries as a result of minor indiscretions 
by joyriders.  He should be ashamed of himself for making a 
statement like that in the House.  It proves that if we look at 
something long enough we will take on the characteristics of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed 
an honour to add to the debate this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting how one would react to this issue. We have 
seen pretty well both ends of the spectrum on this reaction. 
There are those who think that when a young person steals a car, 
particularly a person too young to even have a driver's licence, 
it is just one of those things that kids do. Let us not get too 
excited about it.  Let us just carry on. Then there are others 
who view it much more seriously.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to do in the few minutes I have available is 
talk briefly about the attitude that leads up to this.  For many 
years I have been involved in teaching children.  As many members 
know, I was involved for many years as part of a children's camp. 
Part of our program was to teach them morals and how to behave 
properly.  I also taught for many years in our church in what is 
called family Bible hour.  We tried to relate life decisions to 
some broader principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I emphasized over and over and in which I 
strongly believe is that there is not a single person who at any 
age suddenly one day goes out and commits a serious crime.  I am 
of the conviction that is first practised in one's mind.  What 
one thinks about one becomes.  It has been my observation and my 
experience. I will not give any details but I will shock and 
surprise members by indicating that I am not perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You're kidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  No, I am not.  I have done some things which 
at my age now I regret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Next you will be saying there is no Santa 
Claus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  The jury is still out on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done some things that I now regret, thankfully not many 
and thankfully not any that are very serious, but I still regret 
them.  In each instance when I look back at my own experience and 
look at some of the things other young people did both in my 
generation and in the generation I have observed as I have grown 
older, I believe they practised first in their mind what they 
finally then put their hands and their feet to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at this as a much broader picture.  I believe we need to 
make sure young people growing up and young children like my 
grandchildren who range from age six on down learn to think 
correctly when making decisions.  When I think of young people 
taking a vehicle, there is something behind that which disturbs 
me because in the home I grew up in my parents would not have 
tolerated that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell members about one of the things I regret.  This was 
a minor prank that young people do.  Back in the days when I was 
young it was not as difficult to steal a car as it is now.  The 
electronics were different and I was sharp in those areas.  We 
used to move my uncle's car.  He would park it in one place and 
we would move it maybe just to the other side of the building. 
When he came out we would laugh at him because he was thinking he 
had forgotten where he had left his car.  He would then go 
looking for it and eventually find it.  That was about as serious 
as it got. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to treat with great seriousness the problem of a young 
person being willing to steal a car, drive it away wilfully and 
to not have any intention of bringing it back.  If somebody 
happens to notice that he or she should not be driving this car, 
the police give chase. They then become ready to enter into the 
excitement of a high speed chase without the experience of 
knowing how to handle a car.  By doing so, they put other 
people's lives at risk and risk damaging the car.  This is very 
serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I highly commend my colleague for bringing this forward. I 
really wish members would support it because it is indeed a 
worthy bill.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal government's treatment of many Canadian veterans is 
simply appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 24, 1998 in the House of Commons I asked the 
Minister of Veterans Affairs to finally commit to a just 
settlement with Canada's merchant marine.  I had hoped he would 
make some commitment to act.  I had expected that he might 
indicate a willingness to do something. Instead the response of 
the minister was simply that he would listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the time to listen.  It is the time to act and to make 
a commitment to these Canadians deprived of justice by this 
government.   I have become thoroughly appalled at the Liberal 
government's handling of this matter and of the matter of 
Canadian veterans who were prisoners of war at the Buchenwald 
concentration camp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These brave Canadians played a central role in Canada's war 
effort.  Many lost their lives and their health for our country. 
Families suffered.  Communities suffered.  As a result our 
country was poorer for the loss of so many merchant mariners, yet 
so much richer for the role they played in bringing victory to 
all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has seen fit to provide an ex gratia payment of 
$23,940 each to Hong Kong veterans who were Japanese prisoners of 
war. This payment was promised just last December and strikes me 
as at least an effort to achieve a just settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply a disgrace that this government has betrayed 
Canada's merchant mariners by refusing to compensate them for the 
discrimination the merchant mariners faced upon their return home 
from serving Canada's war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is to be raised tomorrow at the House of Commons 
veterans affairs committee on which I sit.  It is disgraceful 
that this government has abjectly refused to negotiate a 
settlement with these Canadians.  While I am glad that the 
committee may make some headway where the government has failed, 
it is unacceptable that this government has repeatedly rejected 
calls for negotiation on compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assuming that the committee comes forth with a recommendation, I 
worry that this government will then take its time to respond and 
make an announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many more honourable Canadian merchant mariners must die 
before this Liberal government does the right thing and provides 
just compensation?  How many?  It has been estimated that 
merchant mariners are dying at the rate of about 12 per month. 
From where my New Democratic colleagues and I sit, one more death 
before proper compensation is provided is far too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to encourage the 
government to move to improve the health care package available 
to all veterans, especially those whose advanced years make them 
particularly vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I conclude, I am pleased to take a moment to pay tribute to 
Gordon Olmstead, a man who fought for his country and then 
continued to fight for what was right for the merchant mariners. 
The efforts of Gordon Olmstead and others like him helped bring 
about Bill C-61 and helped restore for the merchant mariners 
their rightful place in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's veterans deserve nothing but the best. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans 
Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage the 
hon. member for Halifax West, if he gets a chance, to take a more 
in-depth look at this issue.  As he stated just a few moments ago, 
he is going to get that chance tomorrow at committee starting at 
9 a.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, contrary to some reports, merchant navy veterans 
were eligible throughout the war for disability pensions for 
injuries sustained as a consequence of enemy action.  At the end 
of the second world war, merchant navy veterans qualified for 
most of the post-war benefits provided to armed forces veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they did not qualify for as a rule were the 
re-establishment benefits and there was a good reason for that. 
The reason lay with the fact that the government intended to keep 
the merchant marine operational.  Canada needed experienced 
mariners and offering incentives to quit the merchant marine was 
hardly the way to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 1948 and 1949 it was clear that Canada could not sustain its 
merchant fleet and layoffs began.  Unemployment insurance 
benefits were available and other benefits were awarded as a 
consequence of those layoffs, including access to vocational 
training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will add that armed forces veterans did not qualify for 
unemployment insurance when they were demobilized at the end of 
the war.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take this opportunity to remind the hon. member for

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to explore further the 
government's strategy, if it has any, on dealing with smoking 
among young people.  I have raised this matter on numerous 
occasions.  My question on November 18 about Bill S-13 afforded 
me another opportunity to try to discover if the government had 
any kind of comprehensive strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we dealing with words, rhetoric and old promises?  Is there 
actually a serious plan in place to reduce smoking among young 
people and to deal with a very serious health problem that costs 
all of us an enormous amount of money and loss of health? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-13 offered the government a very constructive proposal, 
an opportunity to put a levy on the industry per carton in order 
to ensure money was available to be directed entirely into 
anti-smoking initiatives and into preventing young people from 
smoking in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the government used procedural wrangling to argue 
that the bill should not be before the House.  It succeeded.  It 
also promised at that time that it would take the issue further 
and come back to the House with alternatives for putting in place 
something comparable to Bill S-13 which adhered to the principles 
of the proposal by Senator Kenny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been nothing, not a word.  There is no sign that a 
process is in place.  We do not know if the Liberal caucus has 
even met on it as was promised and we are waiting anxiously to 
see what will happen.  In the meantime there is a growing litany 
of broken promises on the part of the government.  It keeps 
promising that money will be spent.  It did so in the 1993 
election and in the 1997 election.  There was a promise for $100 
million to be spent on prevention of smoking among young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, we still believe that about $200,000 has been spent. 
There is more rhetoric in the budget but no evidence of anything 
happening.  We also know that on other fronts the government had 
opportunities to act and failed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned before, with respect to tobacco taxes we know 
that American tobacco prices have skyrocketed as a result of the 
November 1998 settlement between the United States government and 
tobacco companies.  Cigarettes now cost as much as $15 more in 
American states bordering Ontario and Quebec.  This means that 
the smuggling threat the government always talks about, which 
caused the reduction in tobacco taxes, has been virtually 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget offered the government an opportunity to act.  It 
failed to do so.  The government also made a great fanfare about 
Bill C-42 and about how it was working on eliminating tobacco 
sponsorships.  It was supposed to have included a grandfathering 
effect, with tobacco companies forbidden to initiate new 
sponsorships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, just a few days ago, du Maurier put out a press 
release bragging about 234 arts groups receiving funding for the 
coming year and many of them being first time recipients.  That 
is contrary to the spirit of Bill C-42. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are talking about taxation policy, whether we are 
talking about education programs or whether we are talking about 
restrictions on advertising, the government has failed to act. It 
has provided nothing but rhetoric and disjointed ad hoc 
suggestions without a comprehensive strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is desperately needed today for the future of our kids and 
for the sake of our health care system is a comprehensive,

compliance with the law eliminating cigarette sales to Canadians 
under 18 years of age.  We are increasing our research efforts 
including monitoring and surveillance activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, we have allocated $100 million to tobacco 
control over the next five years.  This will enable us to 
encourage and support Canadians, particularly young people, in 
their efforts not to smoke.  This will include a media campaign 
using ideas that will work in the Canadian context to 
counterbalance the steady flow of images that make smoking seem 
natural and desirable when it is anything but.

people from starting to smoke and to encourage those who do 
smoke to quit.
