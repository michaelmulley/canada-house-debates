</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ) </B>moved for leave to introduce Bill C-323, an act to amend the 
Employment Insurance Act (Schedule 1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to ensure that 
contributors to employment insurance have sufficient weeks of 
benefits to tide them over until their next job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is to counteract the negative effects of employment 
insurance reform, which has created the so-called “spring gap”, 
the 5 to 15 week period not covered under the present program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, this government's determination to take as

unacceptable behaviour when it comes to determining people's 
insurability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very small family businesses are being horribly harassed at the 
present time, and I trust that decisions on insurability will be 
transferred from Revenue Canada to Human Resources Development

into account the realities of the very small family businesses 
currently being affected by the behaviour of Revenue Canada.

scrutiny by the Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of 
Regulations of which I am a co-chair.

disallow any statutory instrument made under the authority

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.)</B> moved for leave

integrity of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to introduce my private 
member's bill entitled Reform's territorial protection act. I 
wish to thank the hon. member for Elk Island for seconding my 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this enactment is to affirm Canada's sovereign 
indivisibility.  The bill is based on the fact that there is no 
provision in our constitution for the withdrawal from the 
federation of a province or a territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to accomplish three things with the bill.  First, I want 
to ensure that the Canadian federation may not be deprived of any 
part of Canada's territory except with Canada's consent through 
constitutional amendment; second, to ensure that no province or 
territory may unilaterally withdraw from the federation; and 
third, to declare any province or territory cannot declare its 
intention unilaterally to secede from the federation and form a 
separate state.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-327, an act to amend the Farm Income Protection 
Act (crop damage by gophers). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce this bill 
regarding an issue which costs western farmers millions of 
dollars a year.  The bill requires the federal government to 
compensate farmers where they have losses to crops due to harm 
done by such rodents as gophers because the poison which they 
normally use to control these pests has been removed for reasons 
such as environmental protection and so on. Gopher damage costs 
western farmers millions of dollars a year.  It is a serious 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to having the bill drawn and for this protection 
to be given to farmers.  They have had their tools removed from 
them which has caused this damage and this clearly should not 
have been done.

am honoured to present 12 petitions with 300 names on them. These 
signatures are of concerned Canadians mostly from the 
constituency of Surrey Central. They draw the attention of the 
House to the discrimination they declare is caused by Canada's 
old age security system.  The act discriminates against seniors 
from certain countries.  Therefore, they call upon parliament to 
grant old age security benefits to all seniors over the age of 65 
based on the needs of the seniors and not based on their country 
of origin.

Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a 
petition signed by constituents who live in the village of

following recommendations:  to charge young offenders who commit 
serious crimes, for example assault, sexual assault, aggravated 
assault, murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated 
sexual assault and crimes against seniors, in an adult court; to 
not allow Young Offenders Act protection to repeat offenders; the 
Young Offenders Act should protect one-time offenders only; to 
notify the victim and the public about the release of a serious 
crime young offender; and to change the Young Offenders Act to 
apply only to children between the ages of 10 and 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They request that parliament hear their prayer that victims of 
young offenders should have some of their rights as law-abiding 
people protected and that the abuse of the legal system by young 
people be stopped.

persons, asking the government to repeal section 13(5) of the 
Canada Post Corporation Act, which prohibits organizing and 
collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary to the minister told us the other 
day that a legal opinion or a trial court decision had indicated 
that the government was perfectly justified in maintaining this 
section, which contained nothing illegal and did not contravene 
the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that it is a decision by a trial court and a legal 
opinion. However, the strangest thing in this is that the 
minister is making his own law, negotiating with these employees 
and denying them the right to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, because the government is in a clear conflict of 
interest in this situation. I table this petition on the 
petitioners' behalf.

traces of aluminum and quartz in particulate and rain water

safety net framework. Discussions on the long term safety net

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Discussions have taken

the following motion.  I move:

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That when debate on second reading of Bill C-3 ends later this

</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to continue my speech on Bill C-3, the youth 
criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before the House broke on this issue, the government 
likes to do a lot of talking.  The Minister of Justice has talked 
about the youth criminal justice act for a number of years.  She 
has used the phrase “in a timely fashion” and has done some 
tinkering with the youth criminal justice act, but has not made 
the substantive changes that are necessary to make it an 
effective piece of legislation to accomplish the task that it is 
being designed to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I talked about an initiative within my own riding 
being implemented and carried out by an individual named Lola 
Chapman, her youth diversion program, which is an excellent 
program that works very well because it involves members of the 
community.  It sets the structure in place to involve young 
people, who are first time offenders of non-violent crimes, to 
have the option to appear before the youth justice committee in 
order to have a different process than the one that is currently 
in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know now that if a young person is charged with a crime it 
can take up to a year or even more than that before the case even 
gets to court.  The young person is in limbo for that period of 
time.  The issue is not resolved and it is not dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This youth diversion program, which is an excellent program, 
happens within a matter of weeks and sometimes within a matter of 
days of the offence occurring.  It brings the offender together 
with the parties against whom they have committed this act, along 
with community leaders, to come to a resolution of this incident, 
providing some consequences for the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also some follow up with some community service work. A 
person works with the young person, almost in a big brother or 
big sister capacity to help that young person along the way and 
make sure they do not get into further trouble.  It is a very 
excellent program.  It is something that the government should 
consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to present the report from this very excellent program 
happening in my riding of Maple Ridge to the House and table it 
here so that all members could be aware of this excellent program 
and take it back to their own communities and talk to 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a community leader within each riding, the MP has a sphere of 
influence and is able to talk to community leaders, mayors, 
council members, chiefs of police and all sorts of people to 
continue this kind of initiative. 
It is a shame, but that consent was denied by the government.  It 
was a good, positive, proactive solution to the whole issue of 
youth justice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We again see that the government's overall theme seems to be 
“We'll just say what we need to say in order to get the 
headlines and to create a perception that we are working on this 
area”, without putting the meat and bones behind it to actually 
take the action necessary to fix the problem.  We see that with 
the youth justice act as well.  That is the government's 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see that it has called time allocation once again on 
this piece of legislation.  The government went ahead and did 
this rather than listening to ideas being suggested by other 
members or by taking a good report that was from within my 
community and having it available for all members to read. 
Instead, its response is to call time allocation.  That approach 
is simply wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of the country are waking up to the fact that the 
government has the wrong approach.  While it is attempting to fix 
the youth justice system, this bill falls far flat in the area of 
addressing the serious issues and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we have a major concern with is the issue of younger 
people under the age of 12 being helped and dealt with if they 
are running afoul of the law.  Under the current act and the 
proposed act there are no provisions to help young people under 
the age of 12 who are led astray and become involved in criminal 
activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's response is to say that others want to just 
throw young people in jail.  Nothing could be further from the 
truth.  We want to help these people at a younger age before they 
start on the path of getting involved in more serious offences. 
Under the current law there is no way to do that.  This 
government has not addressed that.  Government members stand in 
their place and make scurrilous comments to those individuals who 
suggest these proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Crowfoot, who is a long-standing member of the 
justice committee, has made many good proposals over the years in 
this place on this issue.  Being a former RCMP officer, he knows 
that dealing with people at a young age would help to divert them 
from getting involved in more serious offences.  Yet the justice 
minister and the government refuse to listen to those ideas and 
those suggestions.  That is wrong.  It puts individuals at the 
young age of 10 and 11 in a position of being possibly recruited 
by older kids to get involved in criminal acts because there is 
nothing that can be done to those younger individuals. Older 
teens, in some cases, are exploiting younger children to get 
involved in criminal activities knowing that these younger 
individuals cannot be touched by the law.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice knows it but she does nothing about it. 
Instead, she and the spin doctors of the Liberal government try 
to create this perception that others who would suggest this idea 
are wrong when, in fact, police officers and people working with 
young people are saying that we need a way to help these younger 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know RCMP officers in my riding who say they know who these 
younger individuals of 10 and 11 are and that they are just 
waiting till they turn 12 so that they can hold them responsible 
for their actions.  We know it is a small percentage of 
individuals, but a small group of people can cause a lot of 
damage and harm if there is no system in place to deal with them 
and help them so they do not get involved in these activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without taking the necessary steps to make those changes through 
amendment to this bill, the government is missing a golden 
opportunity to solve a serious problem.  It can say what it 
wants, create the spin and send the people out to carry the 
message that it is doing something about youth justice, but the 
reality is that there are so many weaknesses within the bill that 
the actions that will result will still lead to some serious 
problems.  The government has the golden opportunity with this 
bill now before the House to make the necessary changes needed to 
help solve the problem. 
Instead, what did this government do?  It brought in time 
allocation and ignored suggestions by others to fix this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  That is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  The member for Mississauga West says 
it is not true.  I would like to hear his suggestions about 
dealing with young people who are 10 and 11 and who get involved 
in some serious offences when the law excludes them from being 
dealt with, even through a diversion program which is working 
well within my community.  I do not know if a diversion program 
exists in his community, but this bill does not look at how to 
deal with younger people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should allow younger people to be involved in a 
diversion program.  As a first time offender that would certainly 
help them before they get involved in the cycle.  Yet, that 
suggestion is falling on deaf ears on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the theme.  Whether it is youth justice or any other 
issue, the government seems happy with the status quo.  The 
government does a bit of tinkering to create the perception that 
it is doing something about an issue, when in fact, when we 
scratch under the surface and look at the brass tacks of how the 
legislation applies to people, the government does not change the 
problem substantively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government will not make these changes, the Reform 
Party will continue to champion proactive, positive solutions and 
work in this place to form government.  We will make the changes, 
because the Liberal government will not make the necessary 
changes to address the serious problems, whether they be in youth 
justice or in any other area.  It is wrong that the government 
will not take this approach.  The Reform Party will continue to 
positively, proactively put forward solutions, which the 
government ignores.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleague what he 
thinks is the number one influential factor that would cause a 10 
or 11 year old to commit a crime of either a violent or random 
nature?  I know there are many factors, but which one would the 
member pick as being the greatest influence that would make 
children of that age commit a random crime?  We have read in the 
newspapers recently about the 11 year old in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question.  I know he is concerned about these issues within 
his own community.  It is a difficult question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of different factors that would lead a young 
person of 10 or 11 years of age to get involved in committing a 
violent act.  In my opinion, the number one factor would be the 
lack of love or the lack of support within the family unit.  I 
think that would be the number one factor, but there are many 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that could be done would be to provide a support 
network to support the individual's family, proactively, so that 
it does not get to the point where a child of 10 or 11 years is 
committing a violent criminal act.  We in this House can help by 
introducing legislation which supports family and community, and 
proactively looks at how to deal with individuals and how we can 
support that basic unit of our society, the family, before an 
individual gets to the point of committing a criminal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good question.  There are a lot of other factors, but 
that would be the primary one in my opinion.

Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I

previously when he spoke on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on at great length about the diversion program, which 
has been an excellent program within his community.  He also made 
reference to youth justice committees.  I would like to draw to 
the member's attention that this bill provides for a youth 
justice committee, as did the previous act, the Young Offenders 
Act. 
All of the beneficial aspects which he has brought out are 
already here.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member respond to that?  Has he not read the bill?  Is 
he not aware of clause 18 of the bill?  Is he not aware of the 
comparable section in the Young Offenders Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly I am aware of 
clause 18 of the bill.  What I was referring to was the fact that 
10 and 11 year olds are not able to participate in a diversion 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also aware of the fact that the member is the parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of Justice.  I am also aware of the 
fact that the member had his name on a letter that went to the 
Prime Minister asking him to consider using the notwithstanding 
clause to get rid of child pornography in my province of British 
Columbia.  I know that he voted against that.  He wrote a letter 
to support it and then he voted against it.  He voted with his 
group to keep that precedent setting case in place.  That is what 
I am aware of.  I am aware of many things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Erie—Lincoln should know and be very aware that 
their member supported quashing an opposition motion that would 
have reversed the decision on child pornography.  They need to 
know that.  This government is the government that says one thing 
and does another.  Obviously, this member is one who said one 
thing and did another.  That is what I am aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has not 
answered my question.  Does he not know that clause 18 provides 
for diversion programs?  Has he not read the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has gone on at great length about youth justice committees. 
Diversion is provided for here.  It was provided for in the other 
act.  May he please respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the member for 
Erie—Lincoln could take his earpiece out and listen closely.  I 
told him once and I will tell him again.  I am aware of youth 
diversion programs.  Maybe he did not hear my statement that 10 
and 11 year olds are not eligible to participate in those 
programs if they are not included in the legislation.  He does 
not get it.  The member, who is the parliamentary secretary to 
the Minister of Justice, does not understand that basic fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that his group denied consent for me to table a report 
in this place on the youth diversion program that is working well 
in my riding?  Why did they do that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I hope you will bear with me.  I am battling a bit of a cold 
today, but when I found out that I had the opportunity to speak 
to this bill I decided I had better shake it off because I 
consider this bill, and this debate, and the whole concept of 
issues surrounding youth justice, to be almost a defining issue 
for the country.  How we deal with our young people in trouble, 
our youth at risk, really says a tremendous amount about the 
country as a society and our values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite interesting to hear members of the Reform Party 
speak to this issue.  I think their views provide a total 
contrast to what most Canadians believe is necessary and will 
work in dealing with youth at risk or youth involved in crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contrast is that if they rename or change the title of this 
bill, I think they would call it the youth revenge bill as 
opposed to the youth justice bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything we hear from that side of the House has to do with 
getting revenge.  If we have a justice system for any age in this 
country that is based on revenge, I would suggest that the 
distance we have come as a caring society would change 
dramatically.  We would go back 50 to 100 years to an era when 
that was all people thought about; if someone committed a crime 
there would be revenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is absolutely astounding is that most members of that party 
come from a part of the country where people believe in the 
Bible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  They come from a part of this country 
where they know that the Lord says in the Bible— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The rules of the House require specifically that there be no 
aspersion of motive that is not right to other members.  This 
member and the member beside him are engaging in that big time. 
I ask that you call upon them to withdraw those untruths and 
start dealing correctly here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As all members are 
aware, it is absolutely strictly prohibited for one member to 
cast aspersion on another member directly.  If a member in debate 
may have cast aspersion upon the intentions of another political 
party, that is traditionally, at least in my experience, 
something which happens every day.  If the hon. member for 
Mississauga West is of the opinion that his words were casting 
aspersion on a specific member, I would ask that they be 
withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not mention any 
specific member in my remarks.  I am mentioning a party that has 
had members stand in the House to talk about their ideas and the 
principles of their party.  They have principles, and they say if 
we do not like them they have others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, it is the belief that stems from the Reform Party 
that I was talking about.  I believe that its members believe 
that revenge is the primary motivating factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was about to say before I was interrupted, in the Bible, 
which the members would know better than I, “Revenge is mine” 
sayeth the Lord.  Revenge does not belong in the control of the 
state.  Revenge does not belong as a legal tool in any piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party are attempting to divert what we are 
trying to do here.  If you want a point of order, Mr. Speaker, 
with the nonsense and the antics that go on, it would be the 
opposition failing to show up this morning, trying to not allow a 
quorum.  The opposition members have already said that unless 
they get a national referendum on the Nisga'a treaty—one of the 
most important pieces of legislation and one of the most 
important treaties in this country—unless we agree to some 
cockamamie national vote on the Nisga'a treaty, they will stop 
every bill they can.  They will delay.  They will use whatever 
tactics as a party they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people should know that.  Canadians should know 
that when the opposition members parade around on the front steps 
of parliament hill in Mexican sombreros, it is a sad sight to 
see.  When they drive around the precinct in an antique car 
painted with a Canadian flag, it is a sad sight.  It almost 
desecrates the Canadian flag.  That is the kind of attitude that 
they bring to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who spoke previously, I thought, was being very 
thoughtful until our parliamentary secretary rose to ask him if 
he had read the bill.  Instead of answering, “Yes, I have read 
the bill”, he started on a rant about child pornography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clear attempt in every case in this place to mislead 
the Canadian public about the position of the government or the 
position of an individual member, such as the parliamentary 
secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has said:  “We abhor child pornography. We abhor 
the decision made in British Columbia by a provincial court”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  You don't do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  You guys are fearmongers, fearmongering 
dinosaurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Now they are chirping away, saying 
that we did not do anything.  The truth is, we are appealing that 
decision.  The Supreme Court of Canada and the system of justice 
in this country were put in place to allow anyone to appeal a 
decision with which they do not agree.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken the stand to appeal it.  Would it be 
more effective to have an act of parliament revoke the 
notwithstanding clause, or invoke the notwithstanding clause, to 
say that it does not agree with the court decision?  Or, would it 
be more effective to actually have the supreme court analyse the 
decision and take a look at what possible rational a judge 
sitting on a bench in British Columbia could have, a part of this 
country that I dare say members opposite should know better than? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What possible justification could a justice have?  We would 
presume that the individual has knowledge of the law.  We would 
presume that the individual has integrity.  We would presume that 
the individual looked at the case carefully, but he came down 
with a decision that said it was okay to own child pornography. I 
do not know a Canadian citizen that agrees with that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  If I heard the hon. member correctly, I think he said 
something about my colleague having deliberately misled the 
Canadian people and the House by making some of the statements he 
made.  I do not think it is correct to ever cast— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, I was 
listening very carefully.  That was not the impression I got from 
what he said.  There is no question that the member for 
Mississauga West is accusing the opposition, and specific members 
of the opposition, of misleading the Canadian public as to the 
government's intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think a white glove debate is taking place.  I suspect 
this is probably part of the debate that takes place here day in 
and day out, from one side to the other.  It is casting 
aspersions on individual, specific members that is not 
countenanced.  I do not think casting aspersions on the motives 
of other political parties is something that is particularly 
untoward in our system of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand the 
sensitivity of members opposite.  The fact is that the truth 
hurts a bit from time to time.  All they want to do is rise on 
points of order so they can muzzle me.  That is their intent. 
Frankly they do not like what I say, and I do not really give a 
darn if they like what I say.  I do not say it to please them.  I 
say it to point out a counterargument to what they claim the 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just not true that we have done nothing about that 
decision in British Columbia.  It is just not true.  If a 
political party can stand in the House or out in the community 
and continue to perpetrate a fraud, I do not understand how they 
could possibly object to my pointing that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
member has directly said that members here are not telling the 
truth.  He has said that directly.  He has said that the party 
stands up here.  There is no party in the House; there are 
members in the House.  We stand up as members.  I demand that he 
withdraw that.  What he is saying is untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess we can keep doing 
this all day.  I would point out something that was said in the 
House by the previous speaker, and I am talking directly about 
that member.  I would point out that I disagree.  I consider his 
comments to be perhaps unfortunately inaccurate.  He said that 
the government had not listened to any of the amendments put 
forward by other members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the tragic story of the member for Surrey North.  We 
know the heartache that he feels and we all reach out to him for 
the loss he has suffered.  As a result of his input, and I just 
want to share this, other provisions in the bill would permit 
harsher penalties for adults who wilfully fail to comply with an 
undertaking made to the court to supervise youths who have been 
denied bail and placed in their care by permitting prosecution as 
either a summary or indictable offence.  This measure responds to 
a proposal made by the member for Surrey North.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how we could be more clear.  We have listened to 
that member in committee.  We have listened to that member speak 
in the House.  We know his pain and we think he put forward a 
good idea.  If an adult is charged with the responsibility of 
supervising a young offender and that the young offender is 
allowed to go home under that person's supervision by court 
order, and if the adult individual decides to go to Florida or 
somewhere and leaves the young offender alone then the adult will 
pay a price for it.  I think that is just.  Clearly the 
government is listening to the member opposite who brought a real 
life tragedy into this place and into the bill.  Members can 
stand if they want, but what the member said is inaccurate 
because there is a change in the bill which addresses that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the age issue.  Somehow we should lower the 
age to below 14 for young offenders to be dealt with under the 
new youth justice act.  Somehow we should go to 10 year olds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife Katie and I have raised three sons.  My boys are 24, 27 
and almost 29.  It is hard to believe, as young as I look. Having 
raised those young boys I have had many other young boys around 
and young girls now, thankfully.  If parents have not placed 
their values in young children by the age of seven, I believe 
they have lost it.  I do not believe that once they get past 
seven parents will have a tremendous influence.  I am talking 
about basic core values:  what is right and what is wrong.  If 
others believe that I suppose we could say we should lower the 
age to eight or seven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition party tries to deal only with the sensational 
crimes, and we know them.  We saw a tragic beating in a Toronto 
park last week.  Ten or twelve young people unconscionably beat a 
young boy to death.  What in God's name goes through their minds? 
It is like a pack of animals.  How they can do that is not 
something any of us can understand.  We saw what happened in 
Taber, Alberta.  We saw a young girl beaten to death by other 
young girls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there is a problem in society, but to 
use debate on this bill simply to sensationalize and appeal 
perhaps to the more red neck element in society is disgraceful. 
The bill is allowing for violent young offenders to be dealt with 
in adult court.  Do we want eight year old kids put into jail or 
put into the arms of the police? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Who said that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I hear the hon. member.  Ten year olds 
then.  I admit that the age is 10, but I use my analogy that I 
believe the age of seven is the age where parents have put into 
place the basic necessary feelings, understandings and moral 
values.  If others believe that then the age could be lowered to 
eight, but what kind of society would we have?

</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the terrible shooting in Alberta and the murder in 
Toronto, the vast majority of young offenders do not commit 
murder.  They do not commit attempted murder or manslaughter or 
aggravated assault or rape.  They commit crimes which make us 
wonder where they are headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having raised three young boys myself, as I said, there were 
many times when I wondered where their heads were.  It almost 
seems from about the age of 12 or 13 to about 22 that the brain 
stops functioning, at least in relationship to the parent, but 
somehow we get through that.  We battle through and hope that 
what they were taught from birth to seven years old will get them 
through.  We hope they will not make mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of kids who have made those kinds of 
mistakes.  I believe that we have to base, and this bill does it, 
the justice system for young people on compassion, not revenge. 
We have to base it on rehabilitation, not revenge.  We have to 
base it on the hope and belief that a young person who offends or 
who reoffends is more likely to be rehabilitated than an adult 
and that there must be differences.  Yet we feel rage as a 
society when a young person commits a horrible crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember being in England when a young child, almost a baby, 
was found beaten to death on the railway tracks in London.  It 
turned out that two other almost babies had committed the crime. 
I have said in this place before that my brother-in-law, who is 
an Englishman, says that when the babies start killing babies we 
have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we put those babies into a youth justice system?  Do we 
somehow tell the police they will have to deal with these people? 
What about parents?  What about the education system?  What about 
supporting children's aid?  Foster parents are heroes for the 
work they do in society because while there are exceptions where 
young offenders come from good families very often young 
offenders come from broken families.  Young offenders will be 
abused young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the newspaper account of the women from the Grandview 
Home for Girls in the Toronto papers yesterday.  They received an 
apology from the attorney general of the province of Ontario for 
the abuse.  They are in their forties, fifties and sixties.  The 
oldest one is even in her seventies.  She talked about when she 
was taken into custody, put into a cell, stripped naked at the 
age of 13 and raped.  She cried and sobbed uncontrollably with 
the friends and family who were there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we correct that kind of damage and abuse that occurs from 
that kind of damage?  We can apologize.  The attorney general for 
the province of Ontario did a great thing by standing in that 
place to correct a wrong that happened many years ago.  I am 
frankly ashamed to say we did not do that when I was in the 
Ontario legislature.  We should have apologized to those women. 
Those women cried and said the one thing that moved them to tears 
was that members of the provincial legislature were actually 
looking at them as people, not just statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the one thing about the youth justice bill that I think 
is so important.  We can look at statistics.  We can make law 
based on an age differential of 14 or 12 or 10 or 8, but we have 
to look at individual cases. 
We have to understand what it is that drives a young person to 
actually commit murder or aggravated assault.  I understand what 
drives them to steal something out of a store, shoplift or 
something like that.  It is just a lack of proper functioning at 
the time.  Maybe it seems like a lark. It is not something 
society can accept, but those issues can and will be dealt with 
under the legislation because those kids will not go through the 
court system but, rather, will be dealt with at the community 
level.

whether it is through children's aid, the education systems, 
church groups, or perhaps through providing counselling for 
parents.  We can say to parents that their youngster has a 
serious problem, that their youngster is violating what we 
believe to be important in this country and we want it stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in the bill will make this a more humane and more 
accountable piece of legislation for our young offenders and for 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go to 
questions and comments, it was brought to my attention earlier 
that the member for Mississauga West indicated that a specific 
member had deliberately misled the House.  I did not hear it but 
others have suggested that they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the case, I ask the hon. member for Mississauga West 
to withdraw his remarks.  If it is not the case, we will just 
proceed.  However, rather than go through the blues, I know the 
member for Mississauga West would not want to leave that on the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not say that he 
misled.  What I said was that I believe the statement he made was 
inaccurate and I wanted to correct it and I read from the bill to 
do that.  I did not accuse him of misleading this place.

<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not quite understand why the member for Mississauga West is 
criticizing the Reform members.  The bill before us this morning 
is Reform policy that the government has put into the text of a 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in this House called for the publication of the names of the 
young offenders, as we currently see in Bill C-3?  The Reform 
members.  Who in this House wanted young offenders referred as 
often as possible to adult court?  The Reform members.  Who in 
this House called for harsher sentences and greater repression 
for young people?  The Reform members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why the Liberal member is attacking the 
Reform Party.  This is the very policy that the Minister of 
Justice has included in the bill, a policy that has been tested 
and that does not work. This policy has been tested in Quebec, 
and there is universal agreement that it does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rehabilitation is the way to go.  Nothing in the bill will 
encourage the other provinces, which are not enforcing the Young 
Offenders Act in its present form anyway, to enforce the new 
legislation.  In addition, it will cost millions of dollars to 
implement this new bill, when Quebec has been enforcing the 
legislation for the past 16 years, with convincing results, very 
good results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under pressure from western Canada, the Minister of Justice has 
scrapped the old act and drafted a new one. 
These are not amendments—let us strike this word from our 
vocabulary—to the Young Offenders Act.  This is really a new act 
entitled the Youth Criminal Justice Act.  This is a complete 
change of vocabulary and a complete change of philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government may think that this bill is about public safety, 
but it is mistaken.  In the long run, Canada and Quebec will pay 
for the amendments that have just been introduced.  When young 
offenders re-enter society, they will not be anonymous citizens 
the way they are today when the existing Young Offenders Act is 
enforced the way it was intended to be and funds are made 
available, as they are by Quebec.

country issue.  I do appreciate the fact that the member has 
stated that the province of Quebec is having some success in 
dealing with its young offenders.  I congratulate the province 
for doing that.  In fact, the bill does allow for a great deal of 
flexibility so that all provinces, not just the province of 
Quebec, will be able to deal with it in the context of their own 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me deal with the issue of publishing names.  It was not the

constituents.  Frankly, long before I got to this place, I 
believe people felt that when young offenders commit what we 
would define as an adult crime and are referred to the adult 
court system, why would they not then be dealt with in the same 
way that an adult would be dealt with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear, we are not talking about publishing the names 
of all young offenders.  We are talking about publishing the 
names, in the normal course of the justice system, of those young 
offenders who are dealt with in the adult system.  These are 
people who would have committed murder, attempted murder, 
aggravated assaults or serious crimes against individuals and 
society, and that is why the names will be published.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member opposite makes all kinds of interesting comments.  He 
is obviously a very learned individual and one who is able to 
twist words, to twist meanings and to make things appear 
different from what they really are.  I think it is a rather 
negative thing when somebody does that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one point he made that I want to commend him for.  It 
was not directly related to the act, but it does have to do with 
the overall operation of the House.  He did suggest in his speech 
that the Nisga'a bill was a very important bill that put into law 
the Nisga'a treaty.  He said that it was really very important 
and implied that it would affect all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then would the hon. member not support a referendum?  If it 
will affect virtually everyone and our tax dollars are involved, 
our operations are involved and the local government is involved 
as well, why would he refuse a referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not think that has 
anything whatsoever to do with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I was simply making is that the Reform Party members, 
the official opposition, are using whatever tactics they can to 
delay, to stall, to derail the government's agenda as a result of 
their demand for a national referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it relates to this bill, we think it is important that the 
youth justice bill be passed by the House so that the 
implementation can take place as quickly as possible.  For Reform 
members to try to tie up a bill so significant as the youth 
justice bill over something else that they have already lost is, 
to me, almost unparliamentary.  It is certainly undemocratic.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member in the Liberal 
Party mentioned how truth hurts.  He did talk on the subject of 
child pornography.  The fact is that 70 people on the Liberal 
benches signed a letter asking the government to use the 
notwithstanding clause against the B.C. court decision. Here is 
where the truth hurts.  When it came to a vote, 66 of those 
Liberals voted against their own signature on a written document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House can be assured that during the next election that 
letter will be sent out to every constituency that I can think of 
in order to let them know that the Liberals say one thing and do 
another.

resources.  Sports and youth programs across the country are 
without adequate resources even though the initial intention of 
setting up the lottery systems was for sports and recreational 
and cultural programs, not for general revenues.  Social housing 
is also in a major crisis in the country and the Liberals have 
provided no funding for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are presenting yet another bill.  Is the hon. 
member going to stand up in the House today and say that the 
Liberal government will give not just adequate resources but 
sufficient resources for law enforcement agencies and other 
agencies across the country in order for them to do their jobs 
effectively and bring restorative justice to our young people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, there was a lot of turf 
covered on that particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter that he refers to is obviously on the Xerox machine 
as we speak in order to distribute it, and once again as a party, 
to try to mislead the voters.  The reality is that the people who 
signed that simply said “if necessary”, but that there must be 
an appeal.  There is an appeal.  I am very hopeful that our 
supreme court will overturn that decision.

stating that the provincial government was taking a further $800 
million out of the Ontario education system at the same time as 
we have increased transfer payments and have restored funding for 
health care.  We continue to provide an unconditional grant of 
$950 million to the province of Ontario which could be used and 
should be used for the items that the hon. member talked about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
indeed an honour and a privilege to be able to enter the debate 
on Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to divide my comments into two parts.  First, I 
want to talk about some of the provisions within the bill. 
Second, I want to talk about the justice system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the overall summary statement at the beginning of 
the bill, one would almost get the impression that this is summum 
bonum, the absolute best thing that could ever have happened to 
the youth justice system.  This is what it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment sets out a range of extrajudicial measures, 
establishes the judicial procedures and protections for young 
persons alleged to have committed an offence, encourages the 
participation of parents, victims, communities, youth justice 
committees and others in the youth justice system, sets out a 
range of sentences available to the youth justice court, 
establishes custody and supervision provisions, sets out the 
rules for the keeping of records and protection of privacy, 
provides transitional provisions and makes consequential 
amendments to other Acts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would think that was it.  What else is left to be done after 
all that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of things that I would like to look at. 
Conditional sentences, for example, are possible here.  We know 
that in the past conditional sentences on some of the very 
serious offenders, such as drug traffickers and people who have 
committed manslaughter, have not resulted in any material 
punishment for the people involved.  There have been no serious 
consequences for having committed such very serious offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another position.  Only five presumptive offences have 
been listed here.  They include first and second degree murder, 
attempted murder, manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault. 
These are the big, heavy duty crimes that must be tried in adult 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some serious omissions here.  What about death by 
criminal negligence?  What about bodily harm caused by criminal 
negligence?  What about sexual assault using a weapon?  What 
about hostage taking and illegal confinement?  Those are very, 
very serious offences. 
I do not believe they are any less violent than the ones under 
the section in the act. There is a clear indication 
that amendments to the act are necessary to bring about the true 
intent of what the act is supposed to accomplish in 
terms of its purpose.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to talk about age.  The hon. member from 
Mississauga suggested that we could go down to age eight. No 
one has ever suggested such a thing.  That was the member's 
dream.  We know that 10 and 11 year olds in our society surely 
know what is right and wrong.  They have the ability to make a 
decision, to make a choice and they do so.  We need to deal with 
them seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member suggested that most young people are decent and 
well behaved.  I would hope so. The act is not designed to deal 
with 95% of the people. It is designed to deal with people 
who have chosen to break the law.  That is the problem and that 
is what we are addressing.  Ten and eleven year olds who break 
the law and who have done so deliberately and with forethought, 
need to be dealt with in a reasonable way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we include transitional periods?  Should we have the 
restoration of justice and the rehabilitation programs? 
Absolutely.  Incarceration is not what we are talking about. We 
are not talking about revenge.  We have to inculcate in these 
people a recognition that if they break the law, it is a serious 
offence and society will not condone that type of behaviour.  We 
want to help them to become contributing and successful members 
of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not out of order to suggest that 10 to 15 year olds ought 
to be included in this legislation.  We have seen far 
too many 10 and 11 year olds take advantage of the fact that they 
cannot be touched and are not subject to criminal prosecution. 
It is sad to say but there are some adults who know this and use 
10 and 11 year olds to commit crimes on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to turn my attention to the justice system in 
Canada. I would encourage every member of this House and every 
Canadian to read the book <I>Outrage</I> written by Alex 
MacDonald. He is no ordinary author.  This man has been in the 
business of law and justice for 40 years.  He was the attorney 
general of the province of B.C.  He was a lawyer and a minister 
of the crown.  He sat in this House as a member of parliament. 
This gentleman knows what he is talking about. At the beginning 
of his book Mr. MacDonald says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's legal system is heading for disaster, so preoccupied 
with protecting individuals' rights that it fails to protect the 
rights of society.  More than fair to a few, the legal system is 
less than fair to the majority of Canadians, sacrificing 
time-honoured concepts such as Truth and Justice to an unhealthy 
fascination with process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an amateur who wrote that. This is a 
practitioner in the legal system, one who understands.  The kind 
of legislation we have had presented to us and which is contained 
within Bill C-3 does nothing to change that particular 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number one issue that is missing in this legislation is the 
underlying principles.  There is a whole section in the bill 
dealing with the principles that are involved in this particular 
legislation, but the fundamental principle of the purpose of 
justice is missing.  The fundamental principle is to ensure that 
when the rights of law-abiding citizens and victims of crime 
conflict with the rights of the perpetrator of a crime, obviously 
the rights of the victim should prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the only people who are here to protect society, 
not the law, are police officers, the men and women who enforce 
the law.  They stick their necks out.  They are in danger day 
after day.  What does the government do with these people who 
look after the interests of society?  It slashes their budgets 
and ties their hands. 
It has a revolving door parole system and an unbalanced justice 
system.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does one of these principles say?  I want to draw specific 
attention to one statement of principle in this bill. 
Subparagraph 3(1)(c)(ii) states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) within the limits of fair and proportionate accountability, 
the measures taken against young persons who commit offences 
should— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not shall, but should. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii)  encourage the repair of harm done to victims and the 
community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree.  The operative word is “should”, not “shall”.  If 
this were a principle, it would say “it shall”.  Clearly it is 
not a principle.  If it is, it is one that is so wide open that 
it is meaningless.  It may be more specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another provision in this bill which I am not sure is a 
principle.  I think it is, but it is not found in that particular 
clause.  It is probably the worst possible clause that could have 
been in the bill.  It is the centrepiece of the old Juvenile 
Delinquents Act, the Young Offenders Act and it is contained in 
this bill again.  It is word for word, exactly the same sentence. 
Paragraph 145(2)(b) states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the person to whom the statement was made has, before the 
statement was made, clearly explained to the young person, in 
language appropriate to his or her age and understanding— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the officer saying this to the individual.  The first 
point is that the young person is under no obligation to make a 
statement.  In other words, the individual who is accused of a 
particular crime, apprehended or whatever the case may be is not 
obligated to speak at all.  He can be absolutely silent. This is 
a real difficulty.  What is the result? 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, what kind of a signal is this to send to teens?  It 
expresses one of the shibboleths of our Law, one which the 
criminal defence bar is apparently prepared to defend to the 
death.  Never mind that it contradicts the wisdom of the ages 
when it comes to raising youngsters into responsible adulthood. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the words of Alex MacDonald again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every parent who is wise wants to raise his children well.  The 
hon. member from Mississauga talked about the fact that he raised 
three boys.  That individual knows full well that he did very 
well with his children.  He admitted that and I think that is 
right and wonderful.  The wise parent, and I am sure the hon. 
member from Mississauga knows this only too well, asks when his 
children are in trouble, “What is it that is causing it? Tell me 
the whole story”.  That is what we need to do. 
Mr. MacDonald observes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sensible parents know that the first step in correcting youthful 
misbehaviour is getting the miscreant to own up.  And they know 
that acknowledging wrongdoing is in the best interests of the 
young person, since it minimizes the chance that the offender 
will repeat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, the federal government's lawmakers have yet to grasp this 
concept.  The whole wide world knows that confessing is good for 
the soul.  So why doesn't the Law get it?  Surely a duty to speak 
up serves young people in trouble better than a right to keep 
mum. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to read a particular case into the record.  It took place 
in British Columbia on Vancouver Island and began in 1988. Peter 
is the individual. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wee hours of October 12, 1988, this young man...and two of 
his friends, aged 17 and 23, took a cab from the native reserve 
at Duncan, B.C., to Victoria, some 65 kilometres to the south. 
They had been partying hard and had several drinks en route to 
their destination.  In their possession were two mean-looking 
pellet guns, two “throwing knives” and what the 23 year old 
later called “tools to break and enter”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After arriving in Victoria at about 4 a.m., the threesome wanted 
some more beer and asked the cabby to get them some more.  After 
paying off the cabby, they hailed another cab.  Two of them were 
in the back seat and Peter was in the front. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two in the back seat stuck their guns in the driver's neck, 
but the driver resisted.  In the scuffle for the driver's wallet, 
Peter, who was in the front seat, stabbed him several times.  The 
man died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a friend's house, the young men washed the blood from their 
clothing, but some remained on Peter's.  Later that day, one of 
the youths casually mentioned that they'd killed a cabby.  The 
RCMP were tipped, and all three were arrested. 
At the lock-up, Peter was given the Charter caution and was told 
to call a lawyer and have a guardian come down.  He chose a great 
aunt.  However, before the lawyer arrived—the great aunt was 
there—one Constable Logan engaged Peter in a long conversation. 
Before it was over, Peter told Logan something of what had 
happened.  The other two youths were to hold guns to the cabby's 
neck.  Peter was supposed to sit in the front seat and “just 
stab”.  Logan then drove Peter to a house where he produced the 
fatal knife and the cabby's car keys.  Later that day, at Logan's 
urging, he talked with his lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next morning, Peter had another phone conversation with his 
lawyer.  Then, seeing Logan, he told the officer that he had left 
out some details and wanted to add more.  Again the two men 
spoke, and again Peter confessed— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On legal advice, Peter did not testify at his trial in youth 
court.  He was found guilty of second degree murder, and the 
verdict was affirmed by the appeal court.  However, in 1993, the 
Supreme Court set aside the judgment. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT19"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT19"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court had no doubt that Peter's statements were basically 
true and that Logan had been frank and polite in all his dealings 
with the youth. Nevertheless, it held that Constable Logan had 
slipped up in the way he had obtained the admissions.  Therefore, 
the words had to be treated as if they had never been spoken.  To 
do otherwise would sully the law's fair name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The upshot was clearly that three young men had committed 
murder, at least second degree murder.  Their individual 
complicity might have varied some but that ought to have been a 
matter for sentencing.  Clearing Peter meant that the court did 
not have to deliberate on the serious issue and the real issue of 
the crime.  MacDonald continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal cases, especially those concerning young people, must 
slide away from the adversarial model, with its gladiatorial 
combats and prosecutors devising strategies to out-manoeuvre 
those of the defence.  The presiding judge should lead an 
inquiry, independently if need be, of the two sides—more 
inquisitorial and less adversarial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Legal fairness”, as in Peter's case, all too often gets the 
better of truth seeking. And ignoring truth can grease the 
slippery slope on which a young lawbreaker finds himself, 
hastening a life-destroying future life as a criminal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are very serious observations by the former attorney 
general of the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the truth is sacrificed on the altar of legal 
technicalities and process. Such a system is not a justice 
system.  It is a legal system. It does not generate respect for 
the law, for society's values, for personal responsibility or 
accountability, nor does it engender respect for law enforcement 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. Alex MacDonald then makes this observation.  He talks 
about the legal and justice system as being governed by 
Prodigal's law that process expands to fill the time and money 
available.  That is a very serious indictment. I will use the 
Winnipeg connection in this regard to illustrate how the process 
expands to fill the time and the money available: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984, “Joe”, a 17-year old Winnipeg lad, brutally raped and 
murdered a 3 year old girl.  Her body was found in a garage, blue 
panties at her feet, her rectum torn and bruised, her skull 
fractured and her neck broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as the body was found, the police began to round up 
possible witnesses, among them this 17-year old.  Attending at 
the police station, Joe gave an account of his whereabouts that, 
checked out, proved to be false.  He also tried to shift the 
blame onto someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young man was confronted with shreds of scalp and clothing 
that could be his.  Again, he tried to pin the crime on another 
saying, “Yeah, like I said, he took her to a garage and she was 
crying for her grandmother”, details that could only have been 
known by the guilty person.  He then conceded, “I grabbed 
her...took her to the garage...blacked out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police ceased their questioning, arrested Joe and read him 
his Charter rights.  He conferred with his lawyer for 37 minutes. 
When she left, not asking the officers to stop any further 
questioning, the police resumed their inquiries.  Once more, Joe 
voluntarily admitted to the crime.  On the way to the detention 
centre, he pointed out the apartment building where he abducted 
her, pointed to the garage where he bludgeoned her to “stop her 
screaming” and even pointed out the bloody cinder block he used. 
At the trial, which was held in an adult court, the judge let the 
jury hear Joe's tape-recorded admissions, which he'd made prior 
to his lawyer's visit.  But what he said and what he pointed out 
to the police after seeing his lawyer were ruled out.  Joe was 
convicted of first-degree murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter went to appeal, where the court ruled just the 
opposite, rejecting Joe's admissions made before seeing his 
lawyer and allowing everything he said and did afterwards.  A new 
trial was ordered—

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one trial.  It was appealed.  The appeal overthrew the 
decision and a new trial was ordered.  He was convicted at the 
new trial but it did not end there.  This case began in 1984.  In 
1991, seven years after the crime was committed, a third trial 
was ordered.  Joe was convicted by the supreme court in 1991, 
seven years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What reasonable person could expect that a law like this one 
would take seven years to come to a conclusion?  We need to come 
to the point where we recognize that the values in society need 
to be protected and that the rights of an individual also carry 
with them responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What seems to be developing is that the rights of individuals 
are important but their accountability and their sense of 
responsibility is secondary.  We need to shift our justice system 
to where it becomes a justice system that seeks the truth and 
convicts on the basis of the real issue rather than on the basis 
of legal technicality and process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is a very simple one.  If the hon. member had his 
choice, would it be his opinion that Canada would be better 
served without our charter of rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Of course not, Mr. Speaker.  The 
implication that the charter of rights is the cause of problems 
is not the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that the charter of rights does not include 
accountability and responsibility.  Everyone has rights and that 
is fine, but with those rights comes the need to be responsible 
and accountable because we make choices on the basis of our 
rights and the rights of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My freedom is not pervasive for everybody.  My freedom begins 
with me and ends where somebody else's begins.  We must recognize 
that.  I commend the member for asking me the question so that I 
could clearly indicate the intent of what I was trying to say. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask a short question about diversion programs. 
I mentioned them earlier in my speech and I know the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice does not seem 
to understand the fact that individuals who are 10 and 11 years 
old are not eligible for youth diversion programs as contained in 
the bill.  They are not included in the act.  I would like my 
colleague's comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend the community 
of Maple Ridge for its diversionary focus.  It has done a lot 
more than just bring in a diversionary program.  It also has a 
strong program of restorative justice.  It is a leader in Canada 
in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do I support that, but it is important that with those 
diversion groups and committees emphasis is placed on 
responsibility and accountability.  Individuals need to recognize 
that they committed a crime, intruded into the lives of other 
people, invaded their sanctity and their property.  That has to 
be made clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The diversionary programs do exactly that, so that criminals are 
confronted with the victims, with the damage they did, and 
hopefully a certain remorse can be generated.  A new value system 
can be oriented so that they recognize that not only do they have 
rights but victims also have rights and they need to work 
together. 
That is why this program is so successful.  It is also the reason 
there ought to be a command for this kind of a program for kids 
who are 10 to 15 years old.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
recommend that all Canadians read Alex Macdonald's book.  It is a 
very good book and a real eye-opener.  I commend my colleague for 
bringing it to our attention in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly aware of the reaction of my constituents and how 
they feel about the current Young Offenders Act but also how they 
feel about the proposed new youth criminal justice act.  What is 
the consensus in my colleague's riding?  Has he gone to his 
constituents and presented what the government is proposing, and 
how have they reacted to it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question.  It is an excellent question because it has two 
parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1994 I had the honour to present a petition containing 
about 25,000 signatures that was started by high school students 
in Kelowna.  They asked that the Young Offenders Act be amended 
because it was a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a meeting about two weeks ago in the constituency dealing 
with some of the provisions of the proposed act.  The people knew 
we had the Young Offenders Act and were to have the youth 
criminal justice act and asked what had changed.  That was their 
first reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The name has changed.  Indeed there is more flexibility in the 
new act, and we went through some of it.  One of the points I 
made this morning with regard to the justice system not being in 
fact the justice system but being a legal system is one point 
that they drove home over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point they made was that no matter how good the 
legislation is that is presented to the House we as parents, as 
educators and as leaders in society need to recognize that young 
people have to be taught and shown what is right and what is 
wrong.  It should be incumbent upon every leader in the 
community, teacher, parent, church or whatever group, that once 
they have dealt with young people there should be no equivocation 
that a joyride in a stolen car is an acceptable the right of 
passage into adulthood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we resume 
debate I wish to inform the House that the period for 20 minutes 
speeches has now expired.  Members will have 10 minutes in debate 
without a period of questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph—Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part today in what I believe is a 
very important debate on a piece of legislation that will affect 
our society as a whole.  I know that my constituents have been 
asking for this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act recognizes that the protection of 
the public, people like you and I, Mr. Speaker, and our families 
and loved ones, must be the main objective of any effort to renew 
the youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new act is a balanced approach to replacing the Young 
Offenders Act.  It takes steps to address society's concern about 
violent and repeat youth crimes, as well as the need for a system 
that promotes accountability, respect, responsibility and 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it goes beyond punishing offenders as the Reform Party 
would have us do.  It promotes crime prevention.  It offers 
alternative sentencing methods.  It provides for rehabilitation 
in order to prevent repeat offences.  Quite simply, just a 
punishing will not fulfil these needs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is part of the youth criminal justice strategy 
which focuses on three key areas.  The first is prevention, to 
address the root causes of crime and to encourage community crime 
prevention efforts.  The second is meaningful consequences that 
hold young offenders accountable, help them to understand the 
impact of their actions and allow them to make good on the harms 
they have done to both their victims and the community.  The 
third and very important component is rehabilitation and 
reintegration to ensure that youth who have committed an offence 
receive the treatment and have access to the programs they need 
to prevent them from reoffending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this focuses not only on punishment but also on 
prevention.  Rehabilitation is extremely important.  I agree with 
many of my colleagues in the House of Commons, and many of my 
constituents in Guelph—Wellington, that breaking the law must 
have serious consequences.  However, it is my hope that the 
prevention measures contained in the youth criminal justice act 
will help to lower the youth crime rate and therefore prevent 
years of grief for the offender, the victim and the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that rehabilitation is extremely important.  All too 
often we see a pattern by young offenders.  This act will help to 
break that cycle of jail and crime and jail and crime and jail, 
by giving young offenders access to counselling and other 
programs that will help them to understand that the law must be 
upheld, not broken, and that they can and will be valued members 
of society if they are willing to contribute to society in a 
constructive manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Programs that help to rehabilitate, supervise and control youth 
as they return to their communities help to protect the public 
because these programs help to prevent further crimes.  This is 
something we can all be happy about.  This component in Quebec 
has been extremely positive.  We in all parts of Canada want to 
work on those successes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned previously, where crimes do occur I believe that 
there must be meaningful consequences.  I applaud my colleague, 
the Minister of Justice, on her move to ensure that these 
consequences are proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. 
It is very frustrating for a society to see any offender receive 
a sentence that does not equate with the crime committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes proposed in the youth criminal justice act will help 
to ensure that justice is done.  For example, the age at which a 
youth can be tried in adult court will be lowered from 16 to 14 
years of age.  Those who are convicted and receive an adult 
sentence will have their names published.  Their records will be 
treated as the records of adult offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures are not aimed at putting children in jail or at 
ruining their lives but rather at ensuring that serious crimes 
have serious consequences.  Less serious offences could receive 
community based sentences that will help both the offender and 
the community to recover and move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all cases youth will face consequences that promote 
responsibility and accountability to the victim and to the 
community, as well as to reinforce the values of society by 
helping the offender to understand the impact of his or her 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a few moments to highlight some of the changes 
proposed in the youth criminal justice act because I feel they 
are important changes which are worth noting.  The youth criminal 
justice act will establish a more efficient process.  It gives 
the courts the power to impose adult sentences where serious 
crimes have been committed.  This change, while respecting the 
due process of rights of the accused, also relieves the burden 
facing victims and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The offences for which a young offender could be raised to adult 
court have been expanded to include a pattern of convictions for 
serious and violent offences.  As a parent and a member of the 
Guelph—Wellington community this change gives me great peace of 
mind.  I feel it goes a very long way toward ensuring that our 
streets remain safe. 
Victim impact statements will also be introduced.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important change that I would like to highlight is the 
provision for harsher penalties for adults who willfully fail to 
comply with an undertaking made to the court to supervise youth 
who have been denied bail and placed in their care.  When the 
court places a young offender in an adult's care that adult is 
accepting the very serious responsibility of ensuring that youth 
in his or her care complies with the court's orders.  This is not 
a responsibility to be taken lightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure responds to a proposal made by my colleague, the 
hon. member for Surrey North, and I would like to commend him for 
his efforts on this issue.  I personally feel that this is a very 
important measure that sends a very strong message to parents. 
The role that they play in bringing a young offender to justice 
is an important one and parents must continue to play an active 
role in helping their children to become productive members of 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that the youth criminal justice 
act provides for new ways to deal with minor offences.  Some 
young people are brought into the formal justice system for minor 
offences that are not always best dealt with in a traditional 
manner.  The changes proposed in the bill establish a range of 
informal programs and alternatives for less serious offences. 
These new consequences will still be meaningful, but may not 
necessarily involve jail time.  Instead, they focus on ways to 
repair the harm done to the community and to the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Serious offences will still be dealt with through the formal 
court process.  The youth criminal justice act is a key component 
of the federal government's youth strategy.  I believe this 
strategy will be a success because it involves partners at every 
level of government as well as in the community:  provincial and 
municipal governments, law enforcement officials, members of the 
legal profession, social service and child welfare agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few years the Guelph police service has moved to a 
more community based, inclusive approach to law enforcement.  It 
has been extremely successful.  It has been so successful because 
the community as a whole now feels that it has a greater role to 
play in protecting our society.  I would like to take this 
opportunity to congratulate the Guelph police service for all of 
its wonderful work.  Guelph—Wellington is lucky to have such a 
talented and dedicated police force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the youth criminal justice act helps to ensure 
all of these things:  a justice system that promotes 
accountability, fairness, respect, new measures aimed at crime 
prevention which include the community as a whole, meaningful 
consequences when crimes are committed, and programs that help to 
rehabilitate the offender while easing the pain of the victim and 
society.  I am very pleased to see that these changes are talking 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public, the victims and I want the bill.  To do anything 
less would be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go to the 
next speaker, over the course of the morning, in the rotation 
that we traditionally use, there has been some disagreement on 
whether the rotation has been exactly fair.  What we will do over 
the course of the afternoon is try to get a couple more Bloc 
members into the rotation.  Just so everybody understands, that 
is what will happen.  We will be going back and forth, but during 
the course of the afternoon we will get a couple more Bloc 
members in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise on behalf of my constituents and my party to address 
Bill C-3, an act in respect of criminal justice for young persons 
and to amend and repeal other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought that the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of 
Canada would have used the opportunity provided by the throne 
speech delivered on October 12 to let this very controversial 
bill, formerly Bill C-8 during the first session of the 
legislature, die on the order paper, like so many other bills. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the primary purpose of a throne speech delivered half 
way through a mandate is to allow the government to adjust some 
of its policies, to review certain bills or to let them die on 
the order paper. Such was not the case with this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is reintroducing the same bill, in spite of the 
numerous concerns expressed by the public, particularly in 
Quebec, and is pursuing the same goal, which is to fight 
Reformers on their own turf, on the right, so as to improve her 
party's image in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 does not merely amend the Young Offenders Act, it 
repeals it. 
In it the minister sets out the new principles applicable to 
youth crime, which means that the basic principles of the Young 
Offenders Act, including respect for adolescents' special needs, 
will be replaced by new ones that have nothing to do with the 
specific characteristics of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague responsible for this issue, the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, suggested in a letter to the minister this 
summer, sent after he learned that the government was proroguing 
the session, that she take advantage of the opportunity provided 
by the throne speech to withdraw her bill for the following 
reasons: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your reform has no justification. 
Statistics clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the way the 
law is being enforced in Quebec, based on the special needs of 
adolescents and individual treatment tailored to the specific 
characteristics of the adolescent and not to the nature and 
seriousness of the offence he or she has committed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics in Quebec demonstrate just how right my colleague 
from Berthier—Montcalm was.  As I have already said, Quebec has 
the lowest youth crime rate in Canada.  Yet in her bill the 
minister maintains her focus on seriousness of the offence and 
on repression, rather than reintegration.  Why does she insist 
on this?  What is she hiding, if not a desire to move to the 
right along with Reform, to the detriment of children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, if implemented as drafted, risks marking young people 
for life and turning them into hardened criminals rather than 
putting them back on the right road.  The most intriguing 
element in this situation is the fact that the minister, in 
agreeing to what she calls a degree of flexibility, an opting 
out mechanism, shows that she has some doubt about her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims there is flexibility, because provincial 
prosecutors will have, in each case, to decide whether or not 
they are opposed to the imposition of adult sentences on 14 year 
olds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same government, which intrudes all too often in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction in the name of a sacrosanct national 
standard, will allow, with this bill, differences in application 
that will be left up to provincial prosecutors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, a number of organizations belong to the Coalition 
pour la justice des mineurs. 
They believe the minister is making a serious mistake by making 
repression the focus of her bill.  These organizations include 
the Commission des services juridiques, the Conseil permanent de 
la jeunesse, the École de criminologie of the University of 
Montreal, the Montreal community legal centre, the Fondation 
québécoise pour les jeunes contrevenants, the Institut 
Philippe-Pinel, the Association des chefs de police et pompiers 
du Québec, the Conférence des régies régionales de la santé et 
des services sociaux, the Association des centres jeunesse du 
Québec, the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits 
de la jeunesse, the crown prosecutors' office, the Association 
des CLSC et des CHSLD du Québec, the École de psychoéducation of 
the University of Montreal, the Regroupement des organismes de 
justice alternative du Québec, the child welfare league of 
Canada, the Canadian criminal justice association, the 
Association des avocats de la défense du Québec and the Société 
de criminologie du Québec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite a number of organizations that are close to 
adolescents and that think the minister is making a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example that warrants considerable thought, 
although it is somewhat different.  Last Thursday, in a riding 
next to mine, in the town of Valleyfield, the Association des 
groupes d'intervention en défense des droits en santé mentale du 
Québec was holding a conference on isolation and restraint, on 
surviving and eliminating them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interviewed in <I>La Presse</I>, Dr. Tomkiewicz, renowned world over 
for his work in juvenile delinquency said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Isolation and restraint accomplish nothing.  I cannot see how 
they are therapeutic.  With adolescents, the first thing to do 
is to talk to them, listen to them, get to know them, in short, 
treat them like individuals with their own story, and a capacity 
for love.  Since 1960, I have been reducing the aggressiveness 
of young people through creativity, art, theatre, film and 
photography, and it works. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this took place just recently, last week, not far from my 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will agree that what he has to say bears no resemblance 
to the Liberal philosophy, a policy which I would describe as 
repressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 broadens the group of offenders who may be tried in 
adult court to include 14 and 15 year olds.  It establishes a 
sentence of custody for young people at higher risk and repeat 
offenders in cases of violent offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example I gave earlier is much more consistent with the 
enforcement of the legislation in Quebec and the vision of the 
Bloc Quebecois than the repressive philosophy of the Liberal 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the newspaper article on the conference, several 
other guest speakers shared Dr. Tomkiewicz's views. Among them 
were Gilles Gendron, a professor at the University of Montreal, 
Daniel Michelin, of the Centre jeunesse in Montérégie, and Marc 
Bélanger, of the Commission des droits de la personne et de la 
jeunesse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why this government, which has been spending 
millions on consultations in various fields for the past year, 
supposedly to avoid making any mistakes, is now ignoring not 
only the recommendations of specialists, but the experience and 
excellent results obtained in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we note that the problem with Canadian federalism 
lies more in its implementation than in its form.  That is why I 
hope that the minister will take into account the views of and 
results obtained in Quebec and amend this much contested bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad we have figured out the order of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is probably no other subject that gets Canadians more 
animated than the subject of youth justice, and we are having 
another example of that today.  There are days that the debate 
generates more heat than light, so in that context I would like 
to at least offer some statistical information with respect to 
charge rates. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an international crime comparison, out of every 100,000 
youth, Canada apparently charges about 7,900 with offences, and 
of that 7,900 it incarcerates 447.  Interestingly enough, the 
United States for that same 100,000 youth only charges 5,000. 
Arguably, we have a much more charge based system than does the 
United States, that great bastion of law and order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, the custodial rate per 100,000 youth is 311 in 
the United States as opposed to 447 in Canada.  Again, great 
ironies upon ironies.  We think that we are the softer, gentler, 
sweeter nation, but we incarcerate youth at a greater rate than 
does the United States.  By the way, those figures are exactly 
reversed when it comes to adult sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully that will go some way toward dispelling the myth that 
youth crime in this country is out of control, that we have a 
system that is soft, that mollycoddles these little children and 
that all they need is a good spanking and then they can be sent 
home.  In fact, I would argue exactly the reverse.  On statistics 
alone, we have a charge based system which probably needs to be 
examined.  I think the entire system needs to be examined.  I 
commend the minister for having the courage to put up this bill 
to create these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real fact of the matter is that youth based crime is on the 
decline.  I know that may not be of great interest to editorial 
writers and writers of headlines, but it is true.  Youth based 
crime is on the decline.  It really has absolutely nothing to do 
with legislatures, parliaments and things of that nature.  It is 
a demographic fact.  We are simply producing fewer youth who will 
produce the crime.  That is the good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bad news is that there is another cohort on the way that 
will demographically and statistically start to produce more 
crime.  These are virtual statistical facts.  Again I commend the 
minister for at least, while we are having a downturn in the 
crime rate, dealing with this.  We recognize that she has 
consulted widely and responded quite well, in my view, to the 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems that Canadians see with this issue is that 
we are soft on crime.  If I had a dime for every time that phrase 
was repeated I would probably be able to retire and give up the 
apparently golden pension to which I am entitled, if I last for 
another election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I direct members' attention to clause 6 of the bill, the 
presumptive offences.  I make two notes with respect to the 
presumptive offences.  The first five offences are first degree 
murder, second degree murder, the attempt to commit murder, 
manslaughter and aggregated sexual assault.  The big change here 
is that instead of having these youth tried in adult court, where 
the lawyers get to argue whether they should be put up to adult 
court, the crown will now simply say “Your Honour, I am electing 
and my election at this point is that I am seeking an adult 
sentence for this person”.  At the beginning of the trial that 
issue will be put to bed and the crown, the defence and the judge 
will get on with the trial and decide at the end of the trial if 
the conviction entitles this individual to an adult sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other interesting point is the sixth offence.  This is not 
an offence to which adults are subject.  I am sure it will create 
some interest and controversy at committee.  It is called the 
serious violent offence.  One can get an adult sentence for being 
convicted of a serious violent offence which may not be one of 
the first five offences.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A serious violent offence for which an adult could be sentenced 
to imprisonment for more than two years, which is committed by a 
young person, after clause 41 comes into force, for the person 
who committed the offence, at least two judicial determinations 
will be made under subclause 41(8), at different proceedings, 
that the young person had committed a serious violent offence. 
In other words, this is a bit of “open the door and put the kid 
away” because this person would be convicted at two separate 
judicial determinations as a youth who is, if I may use the 
vernacular, out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the minister has responded in as effective a fashion as 
one could reasonably hope for in the context of our charter of 
rights and freedoms.  It is a creative response to concerns of 
many Canadians that we are pretty soft on youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the minister has not left it there.  She has 
outlined the sentencing principles and purposes.  The criminal 
code contains sentencing guidelines, allowing parliament to speak 
to sentencing judges, indicating the type of thinking that we 
want judges to apply to individuals convicted of particular 
offences.  That kind of pattern is copied in clause 37 with a 
unique direction to the judges themselves.  They are reminded 
that they are dealing with youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of sentencing under clause 41 is to contribute to 
the protection of society by holding a young person accountable 
for an offence through the imposition of just sanctions that have 
meaningful consequences and that promote his or her 
rehabilitation and reintegration into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four principles of sentencing articulated by 
parliament to sentencing judges:  the protection of society, 
accountability, meaningful consequences, and the promotion of the 
individual's rehabilitation into society.   That in turn will 
lead to different sentences from time to time which may be 
different than one would get as an adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other area in which parliament is giving instruction to the 
judges in this matter is under clause 3.  What the judges are 
being asked to consider, which is separate from other sentencing 
principles that they may apply to this particular instance, is 
what was the degree of participation of the young person in the 
commission of the offence.  What was the harm done to the 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will note that we have made considerable efforts with 
the victims rights bill to include victims in the process so they 
have a meaningful role to play.  This includes any reparation 
made by the young person to the victim or to the community, the 
time spent in detention by the young person as a result of the 
offence, and previous findings of guilt.  I address members to 
the clause which concerns serious violent offences.  It also 
includes any other aggravating and mitigating circumstances 
related to the young person and the offence which are relevant to 
the purpose and principles of this clause.  These are the 
guidelines and principles which parliament is giving to the 
judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to this bill arriving in committee.  I look 
forward to the examination of clause 6, as to whether it is 
appropriate.  I look forward to the examination of clause 37, as 
to whether it is appropriate, and whether all of the principles 
have been covered.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
watched with interest during the spring of 1999 as Bill C-68 
began to unfold in the House and speaker after speaker dealt with 
it at great length.  I can tell the House that much of the debate 
at that time made me angry. 
I spent a lot of time listening to this debate and I was very 
upset about what I was hearing from many of the different 
parties.  Frankly, I did not like either the tone or the content 
of much of the debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can now say that anger has been replaced with an overwhelming 
sense of sadness.  I do not know which is better.  I feel in a 
very profound way that we would not be having the kind of debate 
we are having today if we had a better grasp and a better 
comprehension of what we really need to do in the area of the 
criminal justice system as it relates to young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a lawyer and I will be making my remarks in a less 
technical way than some speakers.  I am speaking more as a parent 
and as an inner city resident of a large Canadian city where this 
is an issue of great interest because we have problems with youth 
gangs, street gangs, issues of vandalism and violence.  I get 
many calls to my office regarding safe streets and the problems 
of the youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind members of the House that ultimately this 
is a bill about children.  We have to somehow keep that as our 
primary focus in all of the remarks we make.  That should really 
set the tone for much of this debate.  We have to keep in our 
minds that we are dealing with kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see provisions in Bill C-3 which contemplate 25 year 
sentences for children as young as 14, I am very concerned.  It 
makes me think that the members of this House who are advocating 
this have given up on the idea of rehabilitation and that 
incarceration of young offenders is dealing more with retribution 
than with any hope of rehabilitation.  I remind people that the 
concept of an eye for an eye keeps going until the whole 
community is blinded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the House that it is only within 
this century that we have even recognized the sanctity of 
childhood in civil society.  I am making reference to the fact 
that it was only in this century that we even banned child 
labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up until the early years of this century children went into the 
mines with a fuse between their teeth because they were small 
enough to crawl between the crevices and the cracks.  We saw no 
problem with exploiting children in that way.  They were simply 
little people.  Thankfully, we have gone past that.  We won those 
debates and those arguments, at least in this country.  Although, 
I would point out that it does not seem to bother Canadians much 
in other countries.  The Canadian government has yet to sign ILO 
convention 138, which deals with banning child labour, and it has 
yet to sign ILO convention 87, which deals with the worst forms 
of exploitative child labour.  We would like to see some movement 
in that regard, if we are serious about the sanctity of 
childhood, not just for our own privileged kids, but for kids all 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It remains for Bill C-3 to try to do something to answer the 
question of how we treat children who run afoul of the Canadian 
justice system.  I have heard many ideas in the House.  We all 
know the bizarre spectre of one well known member who wanted to 
go to Singapore to study how to beat children more effectively, 
or what size rod we should use to whack kids with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate has gone from the ridiculous to the sublime.  It has 
gone through the whole range, the whole spectrum, in an attempt 
to criminalize children and deal with kids who run afoul of the 
criminal justice system as criminals.  That will have predictable 
consequences.  We will be the architects of our own issues when 
we treat children in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats are tough on crime, contrary to popular opinion. 
We are also tough on the causes of crime.  That is where we 
prefer to spend our energies.  That is where we believe we get 
the best value for our invested dollar, dealing with the root 
causes of crime.  We all know that the jury is in on the issue 
that chronic long term poverty is one of the key factors in the 
rising level of crime in our communities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why we continue to tolerate chronic long term poverty in the 
richest and most powerful civilization in the world is beyond me. 
Child poverty is a national embarrassment.  Even the government 
is starting to get the message.  It has had 10 years in this 
House of Commons.  I am very proud that in 1989 it was the leader 
of the New Democratic Party, Mr. Ed Broadbent, who moved the 
motion to eradicate child poverty by the year 2000 and it was 
adopted unanimously.  It is very rare to see unanimous 
endorsation for a private member's motion in the House of Commons 
but in 1989 people felt compelled and they felt strongly enough 
about the issue that it was a unanimous vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989, 14% of Canadian children were living in poverty. By the 
same measurement in 1999, 10 years later, and within months of 
the year 2000 which was to be the deadline, the national rate of 
child poverty is 27%. Instead of eradicating child poverty and 
all its predictable consequences, we have seen it virtually 
double. In my riding of Winnipeg Centre, an inner city riding in 
the city of Winnipeg, the neighbourhood of Point Douglas is a 
provincial boundary and the rate of child poverty there is 57.7%, 
almost 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we address the fundamental root causes of crime which I 
argue is poor kids living in poor families, poverty, we are not 
going to be able to design any legislation that is going to truly 
meet our needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that Bill C-3 has many qualities to it.  Many of 
these points were reached by consultation with the community and 
activists in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already drawn attention to one clause which I have 
serious reservations about.  A child as young as 14 years old 
could receive a 25 year sentence for first degree murder instead 
of the current maximum of 10 years for young offenders sentenced 
in youth court.  I find that offensive and I have a great deal of 
difficulty with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an interesting clause which I noticed. Parents or 
guardians could face a jail sentence in serious cases of up to 
two years if they fail to supervise their children who are 
released from custody.  This is an increase from the current 
maximum penalty of six months in jail or a $2,000 fine. Normally 
when a child is charged with a crime under the current Young 
Offenders Act a parent or guardian signs an agreement with the 
court to supervise the child and to enforce certain conditions 
until the charges are heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other changes recommended under Bill C-3. The justice 
system will begin tracking young offenders for years after they 
have been released from jail and force them to take part in a 
probation type initiative that will consist of a period of tight 
supervision and extensive halfway programs.  The current practice 
allows young offenders to walk away with no strings attached or 
probationary restrictions.  Clearly Canadians have spoken that 
they want that tightened up. That provision is in Bill C-3 and it 
may give some satisfaction in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation needs to be a balancing act focusing on 
getting tough with violent repeat offenders and shifting more 
emphasis toward community based programs for youth and families. 
The bill is really a reworking of the Young Offenders Act without 
significantly changing it in a meaningful manner and will likely 
fail to substantially change the current system of youth justice 
or alleviate the public's legitimate concerns about youth crime. 
The NDP has some serious reservations and concerns and I will 
outline some of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have concerns that new provisions for the publication of the 
names of offenders will be more readily available. They can 
release names of young offenders. Those provisions already exist 
and we do not believe that needs to be expanded in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The life sentence of 25 years I have already dealt with. It 
really abandons the concept of rehabilitation if we are 
sentencing a 14 year old child to 25 years in prison.  This is 
retribution. This is revenge. This is not rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On increasing penalties for parents and guardians, again I think 
this is something which most Canadians have strong feelings 
about. It puts an undue burden on the very low income families 
where much of the youth crime and violence actually occurs. 
Because of the connection which I have already pointed out of 
poverty being the main cause of crime and poor kids living in 
poor families, it is going to probably be a low income family 
that is being given this increased penalty. 
That kind of punitive measure on a single parent family for 
instance victimizes the family that much further and drives them 
deeper into poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will place a substantially increased financial and

of what is in Bill C-3 increases the workload of the provinces to 
a very large degree without any compensation or corresponding 
funding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, speaking of 
the present Young Offenders Act, here is what the Coalition 
québecoise pour la justice des mineurs, the membership of which 
has already been listed by my colleague, had to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before doing away with 16 years of practice, adjustments and 
precedent to go in a direction that breaks with almost a century 
of tradition, parliamentarians must ask whether this is a 
worthwhile effort. 
Will they have the courage to defend a piece of legislation that 
is unanimously supported by those who know and use it, or will 
they give in to the lobbyists, who are experts in using 
disinformation to advance a program that is as petty as it is 
reductive? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us summarize the present situation.  First of all, Bill C-68 
was introduced in first reading by the Minister of Justice on 
March 11, 1999.  It was an outcome of the youth justice system 
renewal strategy announced in May 1998.  Bill C-68 died on 
the order paper when the House was prorogued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Speech from the Throne, Bill C-3 was 
introduced on October 14.  Aside from a few changes in form, all 
aspects of Bill C-3 are identical to Bill C-68. 
The Bloc Quebecois and all stakeholders in Quebec are opposed to 
this reform, deeming it pointless and even dangerous, as far as 
its anticipated effects on the reduction of crime in the long 
term are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, reform of the Young Offenders Act is quite simply not 
going over well.  Bill C-3, like Bill C-68 before it, is denounced by 
all those who are in the front lines in the battle against youth 
crime, in other words those most familiar with it: 
criminologists, social workers, and police and legal 
authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are interested in is not a repressive approach but 
rather the expertise acquired in Quebec in implementing the 
Young Offenders Act, which has proven itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only Quebec that is opposed to this bill, however. 
More and more voices are being heard throughout Canada 
expressing opposition to the simplistic policies of this 
government in the field of justice.  They include those of the 
Canadian criminal justice association and the child welfare 
league of Canada, which joined with that of the Quebec coalition 
in calling on the minister to withdraw her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act allowed Canada to substantially reduce 
its juvenile crime rate.  Since 1991, the rate of juvenile crime 
has dropped by 23%.  This same law enabled Quebec to have 
Canada's lowest juvenile crime rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What fate has the Liberal government in store for such an 
effective law?  The wastebasket. Bill C-3 does not merely amend 
the Young Offenders Act, it repeals it.  This means that the 
basic principles of the Young Offenders Act, which include 
“respect for the special needs of adolescents”, will be replaced 
by new principles foreign to the peculiarities of juvenile crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislator's silence will make it clear that taking the 
special needs of adolescents into account is no longer the 
primary rule in juvenile justice.  In fact, the new principles 
are focused more on making young people responsible for their 
actions.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one reads these passages and sees the effectiveness of the 
present Young Offenders Act, one wonders whether the members 
have ever lived with young people.  One wonders how well they 
know them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard some pretty incredible things today.  Can we talk 
about a hardened criminal in the case of a 12 year old?  That is 
what I heard in the House.  Let us stop citing sordid examples, 
which are generally the exception, when what we need to be doing 
is coming to the assistance of these young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The topic of adolescents—because the bill talks about 
adolescents—should not provoke hysteria. 
This House must learn to speak about these children with love. 
The rehabilitative approach we have adopted in Quebec forces 
caregivers to assess children, to get to know them and to 
provide encouragement, because a 14 year old should not go to 
jail, he should not be sent where he will learn all about crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one has a family—particularly a large one, which broadens 
one's expertise—one sees that no one child reacts the same way to 
a given situation.  How can we apply a rigid law to these 
adolescents when, in real life, we know how these young people, 
who have a soul and creativity, react?  They can be saved with 
rehabilitation programs adapted to their reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the member for Mississauga West say that a child's basic 
values are instilled by the age of seven.  It is certainly odd 
that we can talk about rehabilitating adults, but not about 
rehabilitating young people. 
If a child is fully shaped by the time he is seven, then there 
is nothing we can do here.  Adolescence, these days, is longer 
than before, into the twenties according to some studies. 
Parents of grown children are aware of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be said about the 14- to 16-year olds?  Why revise the 
criminal justice system for adolescents when we have legislation 
in hand that has proven itself over the past 10 years and has 
reduced the crime rate considerably? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from the report of a Quebec task force, 
the Jasmin Report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often easier to amend legislation than to change our 
approach to a problem.  It may be tempting to think that tougher 
legislation is the answer to the problems of delinquency. 
Simplistic responses blind us to the full extent of complex 
problems and create the false impression that we are doing what 
is necessary to resolve them. One such simplistic response is 
substituting get-tough measures for educational approaches. 
Doing so, however, loses sight of the fact that adolescents are 
still developing, and lays all of the blame for their 
delinquency on them, as if society and the environment they live 
in had nothing to do with it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill, there are two aspects that catch my attention 
particularly, and to which I object.  First, there is the more 
repressive sentences, where the group liable to the same 
sentences as an adult would be is extended to 14- and 15-year 
olds. 
Second, there is the establishment of a sentence of committal to 
custody for young people at highest risk and repeat offenders in 
the case of violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our society will gain nothing from having young people harden in 
prison, at crime school.  Sooner or later, they will have to 
return to the community.  Our collective security is directly 
related to the success of the rehabilitation of young offenders, 
and abusive incarceration could undermine their chances of 
success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I repeat that the Bloc Quebecois strongly opposes 
Bill C-3 and that it can happily live with the Young Offenders 
Act as it stands, since we apply it in Quebec. 
In order that her bill may truly be flexible, I would like the 
Minister of Justice to permit Quebec to be excluded from the 
application of the new legislation and to continue to apply the 
present legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House 
regarding Bill C-3, the youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find myself at somewhat of a loss this afternoon due to two 
events that have just recently occurred in Toronto.  The first 
case is the senseless beating death of 15 year old Dmitri 
Baranovski.  His assailants are still at large.  His parents are 
facing their worst nightmare.  They had to bury their own child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the memorial to celebrate his life, Rabbi Zaltzman encouraged 
everyone there to chase away the darkness of the violence of 
Dmitri's death.  He urged government to strengthen laws against 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second case, police in Toronto found a 14 year old girl 
bruised and bleeding with cigarette burns down her back after 
enduring two hours of torture from four older teenage girls.  As 
the press reported this morning, she said “All this needs to 
stop. If it was my world—I know that sounds childish—but 
seriously, if it was my world, nothing like this would go on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that sounds childish at all.  I would like the 
House to be able to tell her that we will make it stop, that 
nothing like what happened to her will happen to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of cases like these means that we, as elected 
members, must examine the difficult issues surrounding our youth 
and use our elected office as instruments to chase away the 
darkness of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expect communities, where they live, work and raise 
their families, to be safe, secure and healthy.  They reflect who 
we are.  They also make us who we are.  We want all Canadians, 
especially our youth, to participate fully in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to working with partners to reform the youth 
justice system and so the bill focuses on prevention, meaningful 
consequences, rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents in Oak Ridges have been quite clear.  They are 
very concerned about youth who violently break the law or 
repeatedly break the law.  At the same time, they want a system 
that promotes accountability, respect, responsibility and 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that there is a consequence for every action that we 
take, and my constituents want that to be made very clear to 
young people before they think abut breaking a law.  That means 
that we have to talk about prevention, about addressing the root 
causes of crime and encouraging community efforts to reduce 
crime.  Let us reduce crime by eliminating it before it even 
begins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former educator, I found that if I had to deal with a 
disciplinary situation with one of my students, the best approach 
was one of respect and dignity.  Yes, that is a far distance from 
violent crime, but the principle of respect remains the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our young people must know and understand that there are 
consequences to a crime they might commit and that they will be 
held accountable.  A key principle of the bill is on sentencing. 
The sentence that a youth receives should be proportional to the 
seriousness of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, provisions in the new legislation will allow an 
adult sentence for a youth 14 years old or more who is convicted 
of an offence punishable by more than two years in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also establish a more efficient process that gives the 
courts the power to impose adult sentences on conviction when 
certain criteria are met.  This would result in a system that 
respects the due process rights of the accused, places less of a 
burden on victims and families and would give any court hearing a 
case involving a youth the tools it needs to deal appropriately 
with the case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will expand the offences for which a youth who is convicted 
of an offence is expected to be given an adult sentence to 
include a pattern of convictions for serious, violent offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will extend the group of offenders who are presumed to 
receive an adult sentence to include 14 and 15 year olds.  It 
will permit victim impact statements to be introduced in youth 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these provisions speak to what Rabbi Zaltzman said 
about strengthening laws against violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When youth commit crimes, it is important that there are 
programs and treatment available to prevent them from 
reoffending.  Bill C-3 also includes these elements of 
rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that, yes, young people must be held 
accountable for their crimes, but they are also more likely than 
adult offenders to be rehabilitated and become law-abiding 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would require all periods of custody to be followed by 
an intensive period of supervision in the community that is equal 
to half the period of custody. This would allow authorities to 
closely monitor the young person and ensure that he or she 
receives the help necessary to return safely and successfully to 
their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also require conditions to be imposed on periods of 
supervision.  This could be targeted to the youth's particular 
circumstances, such as attending school, finding employment or 
obeying a curfew.  It could also include abstaining from alcohol 
or drugs, attending treatment or counselling and not associating 
with gang members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the types of measures that my constituents have told 
me that they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will work with our partners:  the provinces, municipal 
governments, law enforcement agencies, the courts, social service 
officials, educators, parents and so many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a reasonable and considered approach.  It includes 
alternatives to the justice system for non-violent offences and 
has built-in flexibility that the provinces have said that they 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the House to use their elected offices wisely 
and to support the motion of the Minister of Justice, the member 
for Edmonton West, that the bill be read a second time and 
referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
By doing so, they will be acting as instruments of light against 
the sorts of youth violence that I mentioned earlier, and they 
will be making it clear to 14 year old teenagers that we want to 
make sure nothing like this will go on again.  If we do that I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is my second opportunity to engage in this debate. 
Before the House prorogued last spring, I had the opportunity to 
speak on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, our 
justice critic, for helping me through the complexities of the 
bill.  Being our justice critic, he has really examined this from 
one end to the other.  He has spent a lot of time on the bill and 
obviously in committee as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After having stepped through the bill, after having read various 
articles from across the country and after having heard some 
expert testimony, my feeling is that there is a great 
disappointment in the bill.  It is nothing more than a tinkering 
with the old bill, the Young Offenders Act.  The government has 
basically taken the old bill and added to it.  I will get into 
some of the areas where I think there has been improvement, but 
there is nothing more than tinkering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one of the earlier speeches I gave on the bill, I referred to 
York Regional Police Chief Julian Fantino.  I know my colleague 
from Ontario would know the man.  He is highly respected in his 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote him where he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many police officers and citizens right across Ontario, are 
frustrated with the Young Offenders Act because it seems 
primarily concerned with the rights of offenders...It's 
disappointing that the federal government won't take the 
opportunity to right this wrong and introduce a much tougher law 
to serve as an effective deterrent to youth crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean that we have to be tougher in terms of 
punishment, but I think we have to be tougher in terms of how we 
deal with it in the programs we offer to help some of these young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice bill has provided high expectations 
for us but with very poor results.  One of the difficulties with 
it is identifying and differentiating between violent and 
non-violent offenders.  It should be putting emphasis on 
prevention and treatment, which it does not.  It also does not 
provide the resources to our provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we basically have is the federal government setting the 
rules for the provinces.  We have seen this in so many other 
pieces of legislation.  It sets the rules but does not provide 
the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witness the Canada Health Act, Mr. Speaker.  In your home 
province of Alberta today there is a raging debate on what the 
premier of Alberta wants to do in terms of health care and the 
delivery of health care services.  It is being criticized in 
Ottawa by the health minister, a member of the very government 
that has gutted health care in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that provinces now have to go to extraordinary 
measures to make up for the lack of funding in health care.  What 
we have now is the health care minister criticizing the premier 
of Alberta for what we might call radical surgery.  I am not sure 
if it is that radical, but he is certainly entertaining doing 
something we have not seen done before.  The point I am making, 
which reflects directly on the bill, is that the government sets 
the rules but does not want to provide the funding.  At the end 
of the day, what kind of change will it initiate?  I think it 
will be minimal at best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we have heard in the House is that we should 
lower the age of the young offender.  That has not been 
meaningfully addressed in the bill.  There is a lot of evidence 
to suggest that some of these younger people have to be tried in 
adult court because we are talking about violent, and in some 
cases, very violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec is probably the best model for the rest 
of Canada to follow in terms of how it addresses young offenders. 
The province of Quebec has a lower rate of youth crime than any 
other province in the country.  It is willing to put money where 
its mouth is and that has delivered some very credible results 
for that province.  We cannot expect all the provinces to be able 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, there is a great disparity within the country in 
the delivery of health care.  We regrettably have poorer 
provinces.  Thankfully, we have provinces that are doing very 
well and those provinces that are doing well can deliver the 
services much more effectively than the poorer provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in health care, we have that same disparity across the 
country and a lack of support from the federal government to make 
the youth justice system work.  The provisions within the bill 
end up providing the provinces with less than 50% of the 
administration cost of implementing the youth justice system. 
In some cases it goes down to about 35% funding by the federal 
government, so it is placing a real burden on the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough made some very 
interesting comments and I think it is worth quoting some of 
them.  On March 11 he expressed his reaction to Bill C-3.  First, 
he questioned the effectiveness of the new act tabled in the 
House and said it could be more forceful but was not.  He accused 
the federal government of employing smoke and mirrors in the 
hopes of giving the appearance of strengthened legislation. He 
questioned whether Bill C-3 responded adequately to Canada-wide 
pressures to be tougher on young criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time he said he was disappointed that the federal 
government did nothing to lower the age of accountability to 10 
years from 12.  I mentioned that was proposed by our party during 
the 1997 election.  In February 1998 the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough tabled a private member's bill, 
Bill C-313, amending the Young Offenders Act in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the member, the PC Party had been calling on the 
federal government to lower the age of accountability to 10 years 
of age.  When a growing number of crimes are being committed by 
children as young as 10 years of age, there must be a mechanism 
to bring young persons into the system at the earliest point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that this bill will put more pressure on 
police officers.  It will mean more dialogue among police 
officers, children's aid societies and their parents.  It will 
take officers off the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know consultation has to take place which in itself is good, 
but at the end of the day it means that more officers will be 
involved in the dialogue between children's aid societies and 
parents, which means that fewer officers will be on the street to 
enforce the act we talking about today.  That goes back to the 
question of funding by the federal government.  Again it writes 
the rules but does not want to provide any funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government must start to listen to debate in 
the House and not simply throw something up with the traditional 
smoke screens and mirrors as it is accustomed to doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-3 respecting 
Canada's youth criminal justice act.  I am pleased the bill has 
finally arrived before the House of Commons.  I just hope the 
Liberal government and in particular the justice minister are 
open to listening to what members of the House and the justice 
committee have to say about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge that there are some positive aspects to the bill. 
I agree with the comment that we should approach youth justice 
with a balanced approach.  Each situation will have similar but 
different aspects that must be dealt with case by case.  Not 
every crime should have the same punishment, but every crime 
should be punished and society should feel that the offender has 
been dealt with in a way that brings justice and the chance to 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's youth must be held accountable for their actions. 
Surely they should understand why they must feel remorse and have 
a desire to right their wrong wherever possible.  I support the 
premise of diversion or what the minister has called 
extrajudicial measures.  My colleagues from Crowfoot and Surrey 
North have done a great deal of work in this area. 
They have seen diversion work firsthand and believe in it.  I 
have also had constituents write to me with their support of this 
means of justice.  I believe there is merit in this type of 
justice program and would support its implementation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act of being confronted by those who have been wronged 
should bring young offenders face to face with the consequences 
of their actions.  Criminals of all ages, especially youth, need 
to know that when they steal, vandalize or commit some other 
vicious act, they are affecting someone else's life.  Someone had 
to save to buy the television, the car or the house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To wantonly commit a criminal act without realizing the impact 
on victims and their families is not right.  Youth who commit 
criminal acts must understand what they have done to someone 
else's life, how they have violated the person's rights, and the 
measure of stress and distress they have wrought for their victim 
and their victim's family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I have many more concerns for the bill than I do 
accolades.  While we all acknowledge that the old Young Offenders 
Act had its flaws, I do not really see how the replacement bill 
truly corrects the many flaws many Canadians have pointed out 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear and read about extreme violence in many cases involving 
youth crime today.  We certainly do not have to look at our 
friends south of the border, either.  We have our share of high 
school violence and riots, youth shootings and beatings, drive-by 
shootings, car jackings, hate crimes, as well as intimidation, 
shoplifting, and break and enters.  The list continues ad 
nauseam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only a short drive from my home to Victoria where Renna 
Virk was savagely beaten and left to drown.  This past week we 
were all shocked to hear of the swarming of a Toronto youth, a 15 
year old lad, allegedly over a cigarette, and now he is dead. 
What a sad commentary on the state of our nation and some of its 
youth that there is even a climate anywhere in the country for 
that to occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past number of years Canadians have become more and more 
appalled at our justice system and particularly at young 
offenders, or what the bill calls youth justice.  Even young 
people themselves look at the Young Offenders Act with disdain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the problem with age discrimination, for instance. 
Young people know they can basically get away with anything, 
including murder, until they turn 18.  This is absolutely wrong. 
This makes our youth justice system a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those aged 16 and 17 need to be treated as adults.  These young 
people ask for the opportunity to drive, to get a good paying job 
and participate in the adult world.  With these rights and 
privileges must come the acceptance of not some but all adult 
responsibilities that go with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned that 10 and 11 year olds will still not be 
held responsible for their criminal actions in the bill.  We do 
not want to have 10 year old children in jail, but we do want to 
ensure that children of this age receive the help they need.  For 
the Minister of Justice to infer otherwise is ridiculous and 
certainly not worthy of further comment by this member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leaving children of this age strictly to the child welfare 
system is not a reasonable approach for either the child or the 
welfare system.  Violent youths require more than a child welfare 
system can offer them.  Putting these youth into the current 
welfare system takes badly stretched resources and thins them 
ever further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need to ensure that these children are rehabilitated 
prior to developing any further or more serious criminal habits. 
By offering younger children a rehabilitative process that 
teaches respect and discipline and reinforces positive learning 
skills, the end result will be a person who contributes to 
society rather than takes from it.  The cost to rehabilitate 
today is much lower than the cost of incarceration tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next concern I have is for the other end of the juvenile age 
group.  Those youth 14 and 15 who commit a serious offence should 
be moved into an adult court.  They need to realize the enormity 
of their actions.  They need to take responsibility.  They need 
to understand that there are consequences.  This is a part of the 
learning and maturing process.  As they grow and take on greater 
tasks, they must also accept the greater responsibilities that go 
with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately our society has degenerated in many aspects.  One 
cornerstone is the family.  One aspect of the bill I am somewhat 
pleased to see is the movement toward the recognition of the 
rights of victims.  I believe that the bill and our justice 
system as a whole could move a lot further in this recognition.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end I encourage members of the House to review the 
victims rights bill drafted by the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford.  He has worked on the issue passionately for 
years, and this is one rights bill that deserves our attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we cannot talk about youth without recognizing the 
impact on the family.  Our society has been sliding away from 
strong family values for some time.  I believe some of our youth 
crime problems are directly related to the breakdown of the 
family unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore encouraged that the bill sets out the compulsory 
attendance of parents at court if the judge considers their 
presence to be in the best interest of the youth.  People are 
busy and oftentimes a wake up call is needed in order to 
reorganize and reset their personal priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am further encouraged that there are possible consequences for 
the parents who fail in their obligation to court directives with 
regard to the supervision of their children.  Wilful disregard by 
parents of court orders puts others at further risk from their 
children's actions and sets a poor example for their children to 
follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government must accept its share of the 
responsibility for the breakdown of the family unit.  High 
taxation has driven many families to the brink of financial 
destruction.  When mom and dad are struggling to survive it does 
not take much for the cracks to appear:  financial cracks, 
emotional cracks, cracks in all levels of our temperament and 
patience.  Before long these cracks widen and people, our 
children, begin to fall through them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will obviously not resolve all the problems.  Nor is it 
intended to.  The bill should be one more piece of the building 
block to strengthen and support families in society, but I do not 
believe it will do much to accomplish this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some minor tinkering with the Young Offenders Act 
in order to arrive at the youth criminal justice act.  The Young 
Offenders Act needs a major overhaul. The justice minister has 
long promised a comprehensive bill to address the needs expressed 
by all Canadians from coast to coast. I believe Canadians are 
disappointed with the timid actions to date, and in this bill 
those actions continue.  The interest of Canadians has not been 
fully addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately at this point I will not be able to give my 
support to the bill, but I hope in committee the government 
listens to the suggestions and recommendations of people and in 
the end we might be able to support it as a whole.

many times have we heard the Liberal government say that 
education is an investment in the future, that youth must have 
opportunities and that the knowledge based economy is our 
salvation?  Well, consider this. 
Students are worse off now than they ever were.  Tuition fees 
have risen by 126% since 1990.  Students are graduating into debt 
and poverty.

anniversary of the adoption of the UN Declaration of the Rights 
of the Child.  Its drafting began in 1979, the International Year 
of the Child.  Canada is proud to have played an active role in 
drafting this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is also proud to have been in the first group of 
countries to ratify the convention in December 1991, after 
consultation with provinces, territories and national aboriginal 
organizations. The convention now has the highest number of 
states parties, 191, making it the mostly widely accepted human 
rights treaty in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The convention has become the rallying point for children's 
rights, mobilizing not only governments and UN agencies, but 
civil society, including NGOs, academics, professionals, and more 
important, children and youth and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adoption of the convention has created momentum for 
strengthening international standards, for instance with new 
agreements. However much we have accomplished 10 years after the 
adoption of the convention, we all recognize the tremendous 
efforts that are still required.  Too many of the world's 
children still face daily hardships and fear.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding was designated as a transitional fund riding back in

the immigration minister has no idea where to find them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Versatile Tractor in Winnipeg is the last tractor manufacturer in 
Canada.  Now that Ford New Holland and Case are merging, the U.S. 
authorities have ordered them to divest themselves of the tractor 
lines at Versatile, leaving virtually nothing at the Winnipeg 
plant.  This will cost us 700 good jobs and it will drive a stake 
through the heart of the farm implements industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Industry.  What was the role 
of our federal government in the U.S. anti-trust hearings and the 
final deal?  What steps did it take to represent our interests, 
to protect our jobs and to protect our important farm implements 
industry in Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member, 
this is an issue which is very important to the government.  It 
is front and centre to this industry.  Certainly we are always 
staying on top of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is another issue.  The federal government gave Versatile 
$45.5 million in R and D money to develop the very lines of 
tractors that we are now about to lose, such as the TV-140 
bi-directional tractor, one of the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Manitobans scramble to find a new buyer for the Versatile 
plant, perhaps the minister responsible for western economic 
diversification can tell us if the federal government is prepared 
to offer similar grants and loans to new companies in order to 
attract industrial development that would compensate for the loss 
of the Versatile technology and for the loss of these 700 jobs in 
Winnipeg. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel (Secretary of State (Western Economic 
Diversification)(Francophonie), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to work with the companies to try to retain the jobs 
and to see if we can expand the plant.  With respect to 
additional investments, we will look at those when they are

Mr. Speaker, while the director of CSIS continues to give the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it took three years for the solicitor general to 
table that document.  That is hardly a smooth, well working 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSIS is investigating itself.  A newly appointed inspector 
general will report to him.  The director who initially failed to 
notify the appropriate watchdog, SIRC, and covered the tracks of 
the agent will be trusted to provide co-operation throughout the 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the solicitor general really believe that this in-house

will truly expose the failings of his department? 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what my hon. colleague does 
not understand.  The director informed me.  There is a process to 
follow.  He indicated that the inspector general was conducting 
an investigation.  He indicated that CSIS was conducting an 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know in the House that SIRC has a mandate to review all

government has ensured that these principles and the act as a 
whole are consistent with the values of Canadians and with the 
best interests of young people.  They will act as a clear guide 
to judges and police in dealing with young offenders.  For 
example, the preamble reinforces values Canadians want to see in 
the youth justice system:  accountability, respect, 
responsibility and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed act clearly states that the protection of society 
is the primary objective of the youth justice system and that 
this goal is best achieved through prevention, meaningful 
consequences for youth crime and rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed act contains a statement of principles that clearly 
provides that young people must be accountable for their actions 
and that consequences should reinforce respect for social values, 
encourage reparation to victims and the community and be 
responsive to the circumstances of individual offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has carefully listened to the concerns of 
Canadians in all parts of the country about youth crime and how 
our justice system responds to it. We know that Canadians expect 
government to reinforce values of individual responsibility and 
accountability.  We know that families and communities must be 
relied upon and supported in the raising of responsible healthy 
youth. We recognize that Canadians expect youth sanctions to be 
proportionate to the offence.  At the same time sanctions must 
take account of age and other individual factors as well as the 
impact on victims and the need, the desirability for 
rehabilitation and reintegration of young offenders back into the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep in mind as we debate this bill that young people 
are not the enemy. They are just as often victims of crime by 
youth and by adults.  As every parent knows, raising healthy, 
happy, responsible children is a wonderful yet complex challenge. 
It requires care, sensitivity, common sense and a clear sense of 
values and priorities.  Similarly the task of addressing the 
problem of youth crime requires a clear sense of purpose and 
values and the capacity to respond to the individual situations 
of each youth and his place in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal justice system must be able to respond to various 
contributing factors to youth crime.  Simplistic lock them up and 
throw away the key responses are not effective. In fact they have 
been demonstrated to be more likely to contribute to repeat 
offenders than to reduce that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would know that.  In the early nineties our territory in 
Western Arctic and the riding of Kenora—Rainy River of the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development were deemed 
to be the two highest areas for recidivism, for repeaters of 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, while dealing firmly with violent youth crime, will 
just as importantly support the rehabilitation of youth in 
trouble with the law, the vast majority of whom are not involved 
in crimes of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really must examine the bill in the context of the reality of 
youth crime as it exists in Canada.  I draw attention to the 
recent statistics demonstrating that youth crime overall has been 
in decline in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1991 and 1997 the charge rate for young people saw a 23% 
decrease.  It is a small number of youth, comparatively speaking, 
who are involved in serious or violent criminal acts. 
The majority of charges against youth are for non-violent 
property crimes.  In 1997 for example, 82% of charges laid 
against youth were for non-violent crimes such as theft, drug 
possession and contempt of court orders.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this not to minimize the seriousness of these offences, 
but rather to point out that we know the majority of young people 
who come into conflict with the law do so temporarily.  With the 
guidance of society they are redeemable.  They are capable of 
changing their lives and becoming productive, responsible members 
of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that 18% of charges laid in 1997 were for violent 
crimes, representing a 2% drop from the previous year. But we are 
not complacent about this encouraging statistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of violent crimes, this bill will ensure 
accountability and appropriate penalties and treatment for young 
offenders. For example, the bill will create an intensive custody 
sentence for the most high risk youth who are repeat violent 
offenders or who have committed murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault.  These sentences are 
intended for those with serious psychological, mental or 
emotional illness or disturbances.  The sentence would require a 
plan for intensive treatment and supervision of these youths and 
would require a court to make all decisions to release them under 
controlled reintegration programs.  Federal funding will be made 
available to support the provinces in establishing and operating 
this new sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 will permit victim impact statements to be introduced 
in youth court.  It will extend the group of offenders who are 
presumed liable for receiving an adult sentence to include 14 and 
15 year olds.  It will also allow an adult sentence for any youth 
14 years or older who is convicted of an offence punishable by 
more than two years in jail if the prosecution applies and the 
court finds it appropriate in the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to custodial and reintegration measures, the bill 
will generally require that youth be held separately from adults 
to reduce their exposure to adult criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 would permit publication of the names of all youths who 
receive an adult sentence.  In addition, the names of 14 to 17 
year olds given a youth sentence for murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter, aggravated assault, sexual assault or repeat 
violent offences may be published.  Publication will be allowed 
if a youth is at large and is considered by a judge to be 
dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill will deal firmly with crimes of youth violence, 
it will also ensure that the criminal justice system has the 
flexibility to deal with the many other cases involving 
non-violent offences.  In these cases, alternatives to custody 
are often the best means of promoting rehabilitation and 
reintegration with the support and assistance of the family and 
community.  We know that young offenders are much more likely 
than adult offenders to be rehabilitated and to become 
law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past five years there have been approximately 3,500 to 
4,000 youth in custody on any given day.  In 1997 only 25% of 
young offenders in Canada were dealt with through processes 
outside the formal justice system.  By comparison, the rate was 
53% in the United States, 57% in Great Britain and 61% in New 
Zealand.  Our system has relied too heavily on custody as a 
response to the vast majority of non-violent youth offences and 
we have reaped the negative reward of repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the 13th report of the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs entitled “Renewing Youth Justice”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the young offenders convicted in youth court in Canada in 
1993-94, 40% were repeat offenders and 25% were persistent 
offenders with three or more prior convictions.  Moreover a 
significant proportion of adults serving sentences in provincial 
jails and federal penitentiaries “graduate” from the youth 
justice system.  These data buttress the findings from empirical 
research, which have shown consistently that harsh penalties do 
not change the incidence of crime post-release.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as a member of parliament, I find it appalling that I 
have to rise to defend the Young Offenders Act, effective 
legislation the government wants to get rid of. Bill C-3 is as 
useless as it is dangerous. As usual, the government is taking 
the easy way out to change legislation that is quite successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act led to a substantial drop in youth 
crime. Strangely enough, the justice minister gave us very 
convincing numbers in this regard when she introduced her new 
bill in May 1998. According to her, youth crime has decreased by 
23% since 1991. She also talked about a decrease in violent 
crimes since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act must be judged by its results and not on 
the basis of a misconception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be irresponsible to reform youth justice without taking 
into account all the relevant aspects of this issue. Since it 
protects certain basic concepts, such as life and physical 
integrity, the Young Offenders Act plays a key role in 
consolidating public confidence in our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, parliamentarians have the responsibility to respond 
quickly to concerns expressed by the public by making 
appropriate legislative amendments if necessary. However, they 
must first and foremost see to it that the public has the 
information it needs to have a good grasp of problems as complex 
as youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the federal justice minister has failed in her duty to 
provide that information. By campaigning for a stricter law, the 
minister is wrongly suggesting that the present system is flawed 
and is using that as an excuse to hide her own lack of 
leadership. In fact, Bill C-3 shows that it is easier for the 
Liberal government to sacrifice good legislation than to promote 
the effective approach it favours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To properly understand the reason behind the current amendments 
to the Young Offenders Act, we must go back to the 35th 
Parliament to look at the first Liberal attempts at turning the 
Young Offenders Act into a scapegoat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 28, 1994, the current Minister of Health and former 
Minister of Justice stated in the House that the move to the 
right responded to election commitments.  I scarcely need to 
point out that these commitments were certainly not aimed at 
Quebec voters. In fact, it is hardly a well-kept secret that the 
Liberal Party's intention was to win over the clientele of the 
Reform in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By passing Bill C-37 at that time, the Liberal government was 
introducing into the Young Offenders Act a whole series of 
automatic provisions which would greatly affect the fragile 
equilibrium of the youth justice system. 
By allowing 16 and 17 year olds to be automatically referred to 
the adult court system, this government watered down once again 
the specific nature of the youth justice system. At the rate 
things are going, soon the only connection it will have with 
youth will be in its title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing in the same vein, in May, 1998, the Minister of 
Justice introduced her youth justice renewal strategy. In 
particular, she announced her intention to extend the referrals 
to 14 and 15 year olds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parties involved in Quebec viewed this with alarm.  Some 
asked “Where exactly does the government get the information 
that stiffer sentences were going to have any impact whatsoever 
on the crime rate?”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec stakeholders were bang on. Not only was the reform 
not necessary, but the solutions being put forward by the 
minister are misguided and risky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 19, some fifteen organizations from Quebec publicly 
reaffirmed their opposition to Bill C-68. The Association des 
centres jeunesse du Québec, the Commission des droits de la 
personne et des droits de la jeunesse, the Conseil permanent de 
la jeunesse and the Association des chefs de police et de 
pompiers du Quebec, to name just a few, held a press conference 
at which they reaffirmed Quebec's consensus and flatly opposed 
the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message was a very straightforward one. They told the 
minister they wanted nothing to do with her bill. 
They rebutted the minister's claims that her flexible system 
will allow Quebec to enforce the legislation as it sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminologist Jean Trépanier, a recognized youth crime expert in 
Quebec, was scathing, when it came to the minister's much-touted 
flexibility. At the press conference, he said “The so-called 
flexibility seems to be a political trick. Quebec's judges 
cannot ignore sentences handed down in other courts”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cécile Toutant, another very respected voice from Quebec, also 
took aim at certain of the bill's measures. 
This criminologist, who is responsible for the youth program at 
the Pinel institute, condemned the new measures allowing for the 
automatic imposition of adult sentences on 14 and 15 year olds. 
According to Ms. Toutant, the time served in jail has nothing to 
do with the protection of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very large coalition in Quebec is opposing Bill C-3. The youth 
justice coalition now includes about 20 organizations that work 
with young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who will have to live on a day to day basis with the new 
legislation do not care about the concerns of this 
election-minded Liberal government. They are the ones who will 
have to implement the new act. The spokesperson for Quebec's 
youth centres association was very clear when he said that if 
the bill is passed, we will have a real mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers do not want that mess. 
Therefore, we will strongly oppose Bill C-3, which is a prime 
example of lack of political courage. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-3.  For years 
the Reform Party has tried to implement and give the government 
constructive suggestions to improve our youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am going to focus, in part, on the issue of prevention. 
The most important thing the government can do in dealing with 
youth crime is to prevent it.  It need not look any further than 
the work that has been done in Canada and in other countries for 
ways to prevent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the antecedents of crime.  Children who are 
incarcerated frequently have a common denominator.  Many of these 
children have endured lives of trauma.  They have been subjected 
to drug abuse, violence, improper nutrition, or a combination of 
the above.  Many have been subjected to drugs and alcohol in 
utero, which have produced an epidemic of fetal alcohol syndrome 
and fetal alcohol effects, not only in the general population, 
but also in the sub-population of those children who are 
incarcerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this does not exonerate them from the crimes they have 
committed, it gives us an understanding and an insight into why 
these children have committed offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent neurological and neuroscience experimentation, 
particularly using the positron emission tomography unit, shows 
very clearly that the most important development of the brain 
takes place in the first six to eight years of life. 
During that period of time the neurons in children's brains 
develop the important connections which enable them to understand 
and process information properly, to empathize, to have sympathy 
and to develop appropriate interpersonal relationships with 
others.  If in that developmental stage children have an 
opportunity to develop without trauma and abuse, in a proper 
environment, in a loving, secure environment, with adult care, we 
would have children who have the best opportunity of developing 
interpersonal skills which will enable them to become integrated 
members of society as adults.  If damage occurs during the 
development of the brain there is the risk of numerous 
psychological problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked in jails both as a correctional officer and as a 
physician.  I was struck by the number of children who have been 
subjected to lives which we would not want to wish on anybody. 
We know that subjecting children to those kinds of traumas during 
their developmental stage will likely result in future problems 
and we need to prevent that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A head start program or an early intervention program works very 
well.  If we look at the program in Moncton, in which the 
Minister of Labour and her husband were leaders, the program in 
Michigan, the Perry preschool program, and the program in Hawaii, 
the healthy start program, we see some dramatic results.  The 
Hawaii program is an early intervention program which makes sure 
that children have their basic needs met and it strengthens the 
parent-child bond.  They saw a 99% drop in child abuse rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the programs in Moncton and Michigan, which have 
been in existence for over 25 years, we see that there was a 60% 
drop in youth crime, a 40% reduction in teen pregnancies, less 
dependence on welfare and fewer kids dropped out of school.  As 
an aside, in my province of British Columbia this is a serious 
problem, with 30% of students dropping out before their time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that an early intervention program uses 
existing resources to strengthen the parent-child bond, teaches 
parents to be good parents and ensures that children have their 
basic needs met.  A loving, secure environment, proper nutrition, 
freedom from trauma, abuse and violence will give us the best 
chance of having children who will become integrated members of 
society and who will not run afoul of the law.  Ultimately there 
was a $6 to $7 saving for every dollar that was put into these 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the Minister of Justice, whom I know has been a very 
big supporter of this, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Minister of Health will work with their 
counterparts and use the motion that was passed by Reform in May 
1998 calling for a national head start program, which would 
ensure that all children across Canada have, if they so choose, 
access to the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program would not only be for so-called traditional high 
risk families.  It would not only be for the poor and the 
impoverished, because there are huge numbers of children in some 
of the most affluent environments of our country who are treated 
as little more than pieces of furniture.  While those children 
may have a Mercedes Benz in the driveway, it does little to help 
them have the loving, caring, secure environment with proper 
parenting and good adult supervision that they require to develop 
that neurological and psychological base which will enable them 
to be productive, integrated adults of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the ministers to work with every member of the House to 
make sure this becomes a reality.  If they do not act, if they 
fail to deal with this now, they are planting the seeds for 
future problems.  The solutions are out there.  Canadians have 
been leaders in head start programs.  We have been leaders in 
prevention.  Now all that is required is for the government to 
take the bull by the horns and deal with the problem in a 
productive, cost effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the issue of dividing the Young 
Offenders Act.  Reform for a long time has been calling for ways 
to deal with the Young Offenders Act in a much more expeditious 
way.  We divide up two populations of people.  One group consists 
of habitual violent offenders, whom we believe should be 
incarcerated so they will not harm individuals in the public 
domain. 
The other people we should look at are first-time non-violent 
offenders.  We should try to find alternative ways, such as 
restorative justice, to give these people the best chance to 
leave the cycle of crime, punishment and recidivism that is far 
too prevalent in the young offender, and indeed the adult system 
that we have today.  My colleague from Surrey, British Columbia, 
has been a leader in that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How people are defended in our legal system is another issue 
that is very important to the people in my province.  Our system 
right now is very costly.  I personally propose that a public 
defender system be looked into. It would get rid of the expensive 
nonsense that is taking place in our courts today where lawyers 
use and manipulate the system to ensure that cases are dragged on 
far too long, sometimes to the detriment of their clients.  There 
are better ways of doing this.  We need to look at a public 
defender system that ensures the accused has a safe trial and is 
represented properly, but that there are savings to the 
taxpayers.  We need to have a more efficient system that will not 
clog up the judicial system as it does today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our courts across the country are clogged.  They are clogged in 
part by the bureaucratic and legal entanglement that we have 
allowed to creep into the system.  A public defender system is 
not the magic bullet that will cure this but it would go a long 
way in streamlining the system so that we have a fair judicial 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to to look at the American experience. When it 
compared a public defender system to one where individuals had 
the right to access government-paid individual lawyers, it found 
that the public defender system provided just as good a defence 
for the individual.  There was no difference in sentencing, and 
there were huge savings to the taxpayers.  The public defender 
system is something the Minister of Justice could look at and 
implement if she so chose to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corrections side is another issue that is very important to 
the people in my province.  Because of a lack of resources in my 
province, it is eliminating psychologists, psychiatrists, 
counsellors and anger management counsellors who are necessary to 
ensure that the people in jail have the treatment they require so 
they do not commit other crimes and be convicted in the future. 
The province is now firing all those people and letting the 
correctional officers have a one-week training course so they can 
become counsellors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The correctional officers do a fantastic job of being 
correctional officers but they are not counsellors.  As a result 
of this short-minded, myopic plan that the government has, the 
bedrock of our rehabilitation is being removed.  We will sow the 
seeds of future problems if we do not address this problem right 
now.

people are our future. We rely on them to built a better future 
for our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-3, the federal government wants to reform the youth 
criminal justice system and turn it into a system based on 
repression and not what it should be based on, reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the Bloc Quebecois is very concerned about the issue 
of youth violence. I have two teenagers who are still going to 
school, and I sometimes worry about the violence in the schools 
and in our society. This is why me must educate our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As adults and parents, we have a duty to make our children aware 
of all the violence surrounding us. Towards this end, our 
society has developed very effective tools to try to eradicate 
adult violence as well as youth violence. All my colleagues 
would agree, I am sure, that Quebec is considered a real model 
in the fight against youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has the lowest youth crime rate in all of Canada. Why? 
Because Quebec authorities have been able to implement the Young 
Offenders Act effectively in keeping with the new social 
realities in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government made a very positive commitment to invest 
in crime prevention and social rehabilitation, instead of 
building prisons as the right wing in western Canada would have 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act is very good legislation that has had 
very positive effects in Quebec. It should be left intact, at 
least in Quebec. If the rest of Canada wants Bill C-3, good for 
them, but everyone in Quebec is against changing and replacing 
the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3, just like its predecessor, Bill C-68, is being 
challenged and rejected by the majority of those in Quebec who 
work directly to fight youth crime: criminologists, social 
workers, police officers and lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Coalition pour la justice des mineurs, which is made up 
of organizations as credible as the Conseil permanent de la 
jeunesse, the Fondation québécoise pour les jeunes 
contrevenants, the Association des chefs de police et pompiers 
du Québec, the Conférence des régies régionales de la santé et 
des services sociaux, the Commission des droits de la personne 
et des droits de la jeunesse, the Société de criminologie du 
Québec, and many more, is opposed to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition to Bill C-3 is not only coming from Quebec. In the 
rest of Canada, more and more people are speaking out against 
this bill, including the Canadian Criminal Justice Association 
and the Child Welfare League of Canada, just to name those two. 
We can even say without hesitating that the former justice 
minister of this government is also against this reform of the 
Young Offenders Act, since he said during question period on 
April 28, 1994, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not think for a moment that violent crime is going to be 
resolved in this society by tinkering with statutes or changing 
acts. The fact of the matter is that the criminal justice system 
itself is not going to end violent crime. It only deals with the 
consequence of underlying social problems. It is crime 
prevention that must have at least the equal focus of the House 
of Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since all the partners in the youth justice system in Quebec and 
Canada have opposed this reform, how can the Minister of Justice 
explain and justify it? The explanation is quite simple. Believe 
it or not, it is electioneering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sole objective of the Minister of Justice is to woo the 
electorate in Western Canada away from the Reform Party. That is 
the real reason behind Bill C-3. The reform she advocates cannot 
be explained any other way. Government statistics speak for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote a few. Youth crime is declining in Canada. Between 
1991 and 1997, it dropped by 23%. Since 1995, the number of 
young people charged with violent crimes has gone down by 3.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the national crime rate reported by the police for all 
age groups had dropped another 5%, and this for the sixth 
consecutive year. As a result, the rate was the lowest it has 
ever been since 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of young people charged with Criminal Code offences 
has gone down 7%, continuing the general downward trend seen 
since 1991. The number of young people charged with violent 
crimes has decreased by 2% for the second consecutive year. I 
should also emphasize that a majority, or 53%, of the crimes 
young people are charged with are property crimes, while 20% are 
violent crimes. And the list goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is bragging that Bill C-3 is a model of 
flexibility, and that the provinces will be able to keep their 
own preferred youth justice system. That is completely false. 
There is no flexibility whatsoever in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Coalition pour la justice des mineurs represents 18 
organizations.  It studied Bill C-3 and made a stunning finding, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus the alleged flexibility given the provinces in applying the 
law is nothing more in fact than a series of limited powers 
resting on the shoulders of the crown prosecutors.  Nowhere in 
the bill do we find confirmation of the right of the provinces 
to apply their own model. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a press conference held by this group of organizations with 
an interest in the situation of young offenders, lawyer Jean 
Trépanier, a criminologist and member of the Quebec bar 
association's sub-committee on young offenders, was very clear in 
his criticism of the flexibility of Bill C-3.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to him, the so-called flexibility touted before the 
bill was tabled seems to have been a political ploy.  Judges in 
Quebec will not be able to disregard sentences handed down 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people I have just quoted are not members of the Bloc 
Quebecois.  They are not involved in politics.  They are experts 
and they are unanimous:  Bill C-3 must disappear.  That is the 
bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aberration in this reform of the youth criminal justice 
system is that the age threshold for the imposition of an adult 
sentence is 14 years. 
The question that arises is the following: What study or 
statistic is the Minister of Justice drawing on when she 
includes such a provision in her bill?  I put the question. 
Naturally, I will be given no answer, because no statistic or 
study has shown that imprisonment has a real impact on crime 
rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Justice had done thorough and documented 
work, she would have seen in a number of studies that violent 
delinquents can be rehabilitated.  If she thinks that leaving 
14- or 15-year old adolescents to waste away in a cell will help 
young people return to society normally, she better think again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such practice is ineffective.  Imprisoning a 14- or 15-year old 
means opening wide the doors of the school of crime, which is 
what prisons are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has proven that rehabilitation is the key to success for 
young offenders. 
Why would the Minister of Justice not even consider Quebec's 
youth criminal justice model then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-3, the minister is destroying 16 years of very 
positive practice in the area of youth criminal justice. What 
for? Only to pick up a few votes in Western Canada. This is 
incredible and unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another totally pointless provision of Bill C-3 is the one 
allowing the names of young offenders to be published. Why not 
write “wanted” under the picture of those kids while at it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would recommend that the minister consult her colleague, the 
Minister of Health and former Minister of Justice, on that 
subject. On June 20, 1994, during question period, he stated and 
I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions to which the hon. member refers are intended to 
ensure that when young people make a mistake of that character, 
yes they are punished and yes they have learned a lesson, but 
they are not through the publication of their names in the media 
stigmatized for life, prevented from completing their education 
or from gaining employment. Surely that is in the public 
interest in this country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should make the same statement in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that there is no doubt that the 
federal government should withdraw immediately from the 
administration of criminal justice and leave it to the 
provinces. Thus, justice would truly serve the people, and not a 
government which wants to buy votes at the expense of public 
safety in Quebec and Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise today and speak to Bill C-3, an act to 
amend the old Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by asking members to consider the concept of 
justice.  When we talk about the youth criminal justice act, 
which is essentially the Young Offenders Act, it is really 
important that we take the time to examine some of the terms that 
we throw around fairly loosely and really see what is inside 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first term I want to start with is the whole idea of 
justice.  What does justice mean?  Everything I have ever read 
and my common sense tells me that there are a couple of things 
inherent in the idea of justice.  The first one is that there 
should be punishment.  The second one is that it should be 
proportional to the crime that was committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both in this legislation and in the old Young Offenders Act, I 
find that these two components of the concept of justice are 
sometimes missing.  We do not see punishment sometimes, certainly 
not proportional, to the crime that has been committed. 
Let me explain what I mean by that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT59"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT59"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545
<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Young Offenders Act and under Bill C-3, the new youth 
justice act, we see maximum sentences for crimes that in some 
cases may seem okay, such as 10 years for murder, but very often 
we do not see sentences that are meted out that really do fit the 
crime.  When a young person takes another person's life, steals 
the rest of that person's life, the 50 or 75 years ahead, it 
seems inappropriate to me that sometimes we hand out sentences of 
three years or five years, but so often that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder the justice minister is saying that the Young 
Offenders Act is easily the most offensive piece of legislation 
in the eyes of the public today. It was the justice minister who 
said that.  I am not saying something that is simply my opinion 
or the opinion of members of my party.  We have heard it from the 
lips of the Minister of Justice.  It really is reflected in the 
public today, the idea that too often we see sentences handed 
down that really are not justice in the minds of the public 
because they do not punish people for crimes they have committed 
and there is no proportionality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no recompense in the form of some kind of appropriate 
punishment for the years that are stolen from people in the event 
of a murder. Sadly, that leaves the families left behind bitter. 
They feel victimized again when these sentences are handed down. 
That would be the first criticism I have of this legislation.  It 
does not deal with that old concept of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anybody believes we should be overly harsh.  I do 
not think anybody believes that we should throw the book at a 13 
year old because he was shoplifting.  That is ridiculous.  We do 
not want to do that. We think that the idea of alternative 
measures is good.  In fact, it is one that we proposed a number 
of years ago.  The government is desperately trying to take some 
credit for it, but it was a Reform Party initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that everybody should have a second chance providing 
the crime is not too serious.  They should have the chance to 
admit responsibility for something they have done and ultimately 
try to make up for it.  In doing all of that perhaps they may 
learn a lesson that what they have done has hurt the victims of 
their crimes.  It is very important that we continue to embrace 
that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked recently in my community with victims of crime who have 
gone or who are about to go through this process.  They could see 
the merit in it.  I am proud that members of my caucus have 
proposed this, as the member for Crowfoot has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other issues I want to touch on.  In Bill C-3 there is 
a lot of rhetoric but there is very little in terms of new 
aspects that would give comfort to the public.  One of the 
biggest criticisms the public raises whenever we have new 
criminal justice legislation with respect to young people—and it 
seems like we have had a lot but they never seem to get it 
right—is the fact that we are not supposed to talk about who has 
committed these crimes.  In some cases they are violent crimes. 
Many people argue that the public does have a right to know who 
these people are when these crimes are committed and they are 
convicted of them.  There is some common sense and merit in that. 
There are a couple of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason is very straightforward.  If somebody has committed a 
serious crime, armed robbery or even murder, and is sentenced, 
gets out of jail and we never do learn the name, in some ways 
that may put the public at risk.  People should have the right to 
know that their neighbour has committed a very serious crime. 
Then they can take some steps to protect themselves.  Sadly, the 
history in Canada is that there are certain instances where 
people have been convicted of extraordinarily serious crimes, 
have preserved their anonymity because of this law and have gone 
on to commit heinous acts. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT60"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT60"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could tell a story that would probably break everyone's heart 
about that happening in British Columbia in the past but I do not 
have the time. It is extraordinarily important that we restore 
the idea that people who have committed a crime and have been 
convicted of it be held accountable as well by having their name 
published, known to the public.  That is an important aspect of 
justice.  Sadly we do not see it addressed here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about the issue of 10 and 11 year old 
children who all too often end up committing what would be crimes 
if they were old enough to be convicted of them. Again the youth 
justice bill does not address that issue.  It does not deal with 
it.  We know from reading the newspapers that there are many 
instances of young children who commit crimes. They are caught 
burning buildings down for example.  In some cases they are even 
being recruited by older young offenders to help them commit 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a good idea to give the authorities the authority to 
deal with 10 and 11 year olds in the law.  It does not mean 
putting them in jail.  It would be a good idea to allow the 
authorities to use alternative measures to deal with these 10 and 
11 year olds so that they could go to them if they have done 
something.  If they admit their responsibility, they could face 
their victim.  The victim could explain to them just what kind of 
harm these young people had done to their lives.  Hopefully if 
they have a conscience, they will feel some guilt and some sense 
of shame. It will help them to avoid a life of crime and a lot of 
heartache down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government for reasons that are not clear to me has not 
addressed that.  I do not understand it.  We know that the public 
is anxious to give the authorities some way of dealing with these 
young people who are doing those sorts of things. It is very 
disappointing to me and my colleagues that we are not doing this. 
I would argue that we are really doing a disservice to young 
people when we allow this to go on without any kind of recourse 
in the form of giving authority to police to deal with this. 
Ultimately we condemn them to repeat their mistakes over and over 
again.  Not only does that hurt the victims; obviously it does, 
but it hurts those young people too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could deal with them when they are 10 and 11 we would have 
a better of chance of turning them around than when they are 15, 
16 or 17 years old.  I would argue that the government has failed 
when it comes to recognizing that important flaw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I want to say again that the government too often argues 
that violent crime is a thing of the past in Canada or at least 
that it is on its way down and it is not a big issue any more. In 
my riding this year, we had the horrible murder of Jason Lang 
allegedly at the hands of a 14 year old boy.  It behoves all of 
us to take the issue of violent youth crime seriously.  We cannot 
pretend that this is no longer a problem.  It is a problem.  It 
is happening too often.  We have seen other examples, recently in 
Toronto for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not pretend that this is not happening any more.  Let us 
take these issues seriously.  It is our job as legislators to do 
that.  Unfortunately this legislation simply does not do it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to speak in this debate and to 
point out some of the misinformation from the Reform member 
opposite.  I do not think it was deliberate.  Perhaps it was only 
the lack of time on the part of the member for Medicine Hat to 
read the entirety of the bill or to fully understand what is 
contained in the bill. He referred to the fact that there was 
nothing about an authority for the police to exercise 
extrajudicial measures for example, and I will speak to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope to cite the specific sections in the bill for the 
information of the member and so that the greater public may be 
fully informed as well. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I do that let me just say by way of preamble that Bill 
C-3, the new youth criminal justice act, was introduced in the 
House earlier this year precisely to fulfil the government's 
commitment. The bill was introduced by the hon. member for 
Edmonton West, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of 
Canada, to replace the Young Offenders Act.  We have something 
here that is new, in fulfilment of the government of Canada's 
commitment to reform the youth justice system in Canada for the 
betterment of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interests of youth and all concerned, we would like to 
distinguish better between violent and non-violent offences, to 
provide appropriate measures to deal with both levels of 
offences, to strengthen efforts to rehabilitate our young people 
who committed these crimes and to encourage the use of effective, 
meaningful alternatives to custody for non-violent offences 
committed by our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, this bill addresses some of the concerns raised by the 
hon. member for Medicine Hat.  I hope he will take this into 
account in his further commentary on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also add that this bill was developed after extensive 
consultation with provincial and territorial officials, front 
line workers in the field, police, legal professionals, judges, 
members of the academic community and non-governmental 
organizations.  What that means is that following extensive 
consultations with all these groups of individuals, what we have 
in this bill in a real sense is the distilled wisdom of these 
experts on this issue.  This bill also has built in respect for 
federal and provincial jurisdictions, that is, flexibility on the 
part of any province to give it part of its own creation, so long 
as it fulfils the thrust of the total bill itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that when the bill was tabled earlier this 
year by the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of 
Canada, she said: “Canadians want a youth justice system that 
protects society and instils values such as accountability, 
responsibility and respect.  They want governments”—meaning all 
levels of government—“to help prevent youth crime in the first 
place and make sure there are meaningful consequences when it 
occurs”. The new youth criminal justice bill has been designed 
precisely to achieve these goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go to the principles of the bill, let me define so that 
it is clear in the minds of Canadians what we mean when we speak 
of youth.  In this bill youth refers to a child and to young 
persons.  The difference between the two is defined clearly in 
this bill in clause 2, Interpretation.  It states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“child” means a person who is or, in the absence of evidence to 
the contrary, appears to be less than twelve years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“young person” means a person who is or, in the absence of 
evidence to the contrary, appears to be twelve years old or 
older, but less than eighteen years old— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very clear understanding of what we are speaking about 
in terms of the ages encompassed in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I will speak to the general principles of the bill itself. 
There are four principles.  It is very critical that we let 
Canadians know about the principles, because when we understand 
the essence of the principles, we understand better the thrust of 
the bill itself.  I am convinced that when members opposite 
truly, fully understand and acknowledge the beauty of the 
principles, no more criticisms will emerge.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first principle is that the principal goal of the youth 
criminal justice system is to protect the public by preventing 
crime, by addressing the circumstances underlying the offending 
behaviour of young persons, by ensuring that young persons are 
subject to meaningful consequences for their offences, by 
rehabilitating young persons who commit offences and by 
reintegrating them into society.  Who can quarrel with the first 
principle of the bill to protect the Canadian public by those 
various means? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle is that the criminal justice system for 
young persons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize 
the following: first, by fair and proportionate accountability 
that is consistent with the greater dependency of young persons 
and their reduced level of maturity; second, by enhanced 
procedural protection to ensure that young persons are treated 
fairly and that their rights including the right to privacy are 
protected; and third, by greater emphasis on rehabilitation and 
reintegration.  Who would disagree with this principle that 
recognizes the difference between a youth and an adult, between a 
child, a young person and an adult? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third principle is that within the limits of fair and 
proportionate accountability the measures taken against young 
persons who commit offences should: first, reinforce respect for 
societal values; second, encourage the repair of harm done to 
victims and the community; third, be meaningful for the 
individual young person; fourth, respect gender, ethnic, cultural 
and linguistic difference; and fifth, respond to the needs of 
young persons with special requirements.  The essence is 
self-explanatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth and last principle is that special considerations 
apply with respect to proceedings against young persons in 
particular.  In this principle we see very clearly that the bill 
addresses the interest of the accused because that is the 
Canadian judicial principle.  It also addresses the issues of 
victims and the concerns of parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here a bill that addresses the totality of what we ought 
to do were we to really advance the cause of the youth justice 
system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to extrajudicial measures, the following principles 
are very clearly stated on page 7 of the bill in clause 4, which 
I will read for the record: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) extrajudicial measures are often the most appropriate and 
effective way to address youth crime; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) extrajudicial measures allow for effective and timely 
interventions focused on correcting offending behaviour; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) extrajudicial measures are presumed to be adequate to hold a 
young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour if 
the young person has committed a non-violent offence and has not 
previously been found guilty of an offence; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) extrajudicial measures should be used if they are adequate to 
hold a young person accountable for his or her offending 
behaviour— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extrajudicial measures have been designed to provide an 
effective and timely response to the offending behaviour, 
encourage young persons to acknowledge and repair the harm caused 
to the victim and the community, to encourage families of young 
persons including extended families and the community to become 
involved in the design and implementation of those measures, to 
provide an opportunity for victims to participate in decisions 
related to the measures selected, to receive reparation, and to 
respect the rights and freedoms of young persons proportionate to 
the seriousness of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this new youth justice act we have truly the essence of 
Canada.  Lastly, if I may conclude on this point, even warnings, 
cautions and referrals may be done not only by police officers, 
which the member for Medicine Hat thought was lacking but is in 
the bill, but also by prosecutors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened intently to the member opposite who said that the 
bill reflected the Canadian reality well and respected Canadian

statistics, to find out that the situation is completely the 
opposite of what the member just said: the crime rate has 
actually declined.

society, through a coalition, is expressing its opposition to 
this bill. Even if others members have already listed them, I 
believe it is important to name the various groups in this 
coalition to show representative it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the Commission des services juridiques, the Conseil 
permanent de la jeunesse, the Centrale de l'enseignement du

the Centre communautaire juridique de Montréal, the Fondation

</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes a great many people who think this bill is nonsense. 
Let us first look at the facts. Statistics from Statistics 
Canada or other bodies—the justice minister is aware of these—show 
that, between 1991 and 1997, the number of young people charged 
has dropped by 23%. It did not go up, it did not stay the same, 
it went down by 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charges against young people for violent crimes has dropped by 
3.2% since 1995. Young Canadians convicted of criminal offences 
are incarcerated at a rate four times higher than adults, and 
twice as high as American youth. What is the government trying 
to achieve? It wants to go even further. It makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the numbers for one year. 
In 1997, the rate of police reported crime decreased for the 
sixth year in a row, falling 5%. This decline resulted in the 
lowest rate since 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rates decreased for almost all violent offences, including 
sexual offences, which stand at 0.9%. Robberies dropped by 8%, 
homicides by 9%. The number of young people charged with 
Criminal Code offences is down 7%, which is consistent with the 
general downward trend recorded since 1991. The number of young 
people charged with violent offences has dropped by 2% for the 
second year in a row. It should also be noted that the majority, 
or 53%, of charges against young people involve property crimes, 
while 20% involve violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violent crime is down and yet the minister persists with her bill. 
Violent crimes include homicide, attempted murder, physical 
assault and sexual assault, other sexual offences, kidnapping 
and robbery.  The rate of such crimes decreased by 1.1% in 1997. 
Not too impressive, at first glance, but this is the fifth 
consecutive year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of young people charged with crimes of violence has 
gone down for the second year in a row.  It dropped by 2% in 
1997.  In the course of the last decade, the number of young 
people charged with homicide has remained relatively stable at 
approximately 50 a year.  The national homicide rate dropped 9% 
in 1997, reaching its lowest level since 1969. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go on and on citing statistics, but I want to get back 
to the remarks of the member opposite, who said that the 
government was responding to Canadian reality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is what the bill was doing, it should be geared down, 
because things are improving.  The youth crime rate is 
decreasing, but tougher measures are being introduced.  What a 
reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments are political in nature.  The statistics show an 
increase in the crime rate the further west one goes.  It would 
seem that the crime rate is higher in certain areas of the 
country.  The Reform Party members, coming from the west, are 
reacting to this state of affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice, probably with an eye to re-election, is 
taking account of the political climate that exists in that 
region of Canada.  She is, however, the Minister of Justice for 
all of Canada. 
In Quebec, all the organizations I named at the beginning of my 
speech are opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec justice minister, who represents my riding, has been 
fighting a battle this is far from over and will only be when 
the federal justice minister withdraws the bill. The Quebec 
minister introduced an amendment that could somehow exempt 
Quebec from this bill, but this amendment was not considered in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all the representations made and the support given by 
all Quebec organizations involved in this area, Ms. Goupil was 
not able to bend the will of the federal justice minister. 
Apparently, ideas from Quebec are not as good as if they came 
from western Canada, which is closer to her. She wants to get 
re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that bodies of public opinion that may prevail 
in a particular region or are fuelled by the media can influence 
justice to such an extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes jump in my seat, in the morning, when I read the 
first seven or eight pages of some newspapers. We see pictures. 
Not those of young offenders, of course, because it is not 
allowed in Quebec. So far, it has not been allowed elsewhere in 
Canada either. But what does this bill intend to do? This bill 
will do away with this anonymity. It is going the other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that this is what the minister intends to do. I 
certainly hope it is not, but there seems to be a shift toward 
publishing the pictures of young offenders under the age of 18 
in certain newspapers, in Quebec and in Canada, with all the 
consequences this could have on their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my youth, I was taught a number of basic principles that I 
never forgot. 
We must remember what our parents taught us. The other day, I 
was talking about the catechism, which sets out the nature of a 
mortal sin. Three conditions must be met. It must be a serious 
offence, committed with full awareness. They must also be wilful 
consent. Is a 12 or 14 year old fully aware of the seriousness 
of what he is doing? No. Who in the House has not, in his or her 
youth, done something rather stupid, something that he or she 
regrets now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> They should stand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> I do not dare do what by the hon. member for 
Jonquière just did by asking those who did not commit anything 
stupid before the age of 18 to stand up. Perhaps there would not 
be many. I do not want to cast too many stones because, if I 
were to look into my own past, I might find something wrong, but 
surely not anything serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, a bill to increase should follow an increase in 
crime. Yet, we see the opposite happening. Youth crime has 
decreased. Yet, the minister wants to cave in to Reform 
arguments to ensure her re-election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-3, an act to amend the 
old Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should have been before the house in the early 1990s.  I 
say this in reference to my former career as a mayor in Manitoba. 
The municipalities have been lobbying the government since the 
early 1990s to make the appropriate changes.  There have been 
numerous resolutions from municipalities at the local level, as 
well as through the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  It 
was all for naught obviously.  It has taken almost ten years to 
get a bill to amend the Young Offenders Act to this floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that there is a huge difference between violent 
offenders and those who are not violent offenders.  We need to 
keep that separate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember at one time the solicitor general's department sent 
out survey forms to all of the municipalities, asking them what 
they thought were the necessary changes.  Most of us, willingly 
and co-operatively, filled out the forms and sent them back. 
Unfortunately we never heard from the solicitor general's 
department.  I do not know whether that was surprising or not 
back in the early 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again, with society changing, the rules need to change 
to keep up with the changing society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most common reference to the Young Offenders Act came from 
our enforcement people, the RCMP, telling the municipalities that 
they do their job and catch the violators, but their hands are 
tied because of the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that in recent times small-town Canada, always 
thought of as being a safe place to live, has been waking up to 
the real surprise that it is not such a safe place to live.  Even 
in my own small city of Dauphin we have encountered very violent 
youth crimes.  One example was when youths got together and broke 
into a senior's house.  They robbed and battered that senior 
citizen, who subsequently passed away.  This is the kind of 
experience that is traumatizing small-town Canada, which does not 
really know how to deal with the turn of events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vandalism is another issue that I hear about constantly wherever 
I travel.  My riding is very large.  I deal with about 80 
municipalities on an ongoing basis.  Vandalism is so bad that it 
has reached the point where the police will not even bother to 
deal with it.  In fact, it is so ridiculous that during the 
summer break when I left Ottawa to return to my home riding in 
June, lo and behold, as I approached my property, the side of my 
garage had been spray painted.  I later found out that it was 
done by a youth gang in the community.  Believe it or not, I live 
kitty-corner from the police station, within shouting distance. 
I can see the police station from my front yard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kinds of concerns that Canadians have, certainly 
in my riding of Dauphin—Swan River.  The Young Offenders Act 
needs to be amended.  It is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week during the break I met with a dozen municipalities at 
a group meeting with the RCMP to talk about this very issue of 
youth crime and police matters.  There is no doubt that over the 
last few years a lot of problems arose because of cutbacks to the 
RCMP.  It is my understanding that this year, from looking at the 
estimates, the budget has been increased by $11.8 million. 
Then I noticed that the government levied an extra $35 million 
for gun registration.  I really wonder which is more important in 
this country, registering people's firearms or looking after our 
RCMP, which is badly needed.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consolidation of our police force has also created a 
problem.  I would say that consolidation came as a result of 
cutbacks in the budget.  Over the past year we have heard in the 
House the many instances when police had to basically park their 
cars and their other vehicles because of the lack of funds to 
operate and repair them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes down to the very point that people in this country, 
whether they live in cities or in small communities, want to live 
in a safe community.  We all want to see a police presence. These 
were the concerns raised by the collective group of 
municipalities that I met with last week.  They want the police 
to have the ability to enforce the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all right to take a preventive approach.  We all believe 
that prevention is the best approach, but there are situations 
that arise which go beyond prevention.  Things happen, laws 
become breached, people get hurt and property gets damaged.  How 
do we deal with these people who do not follow the rules of 
society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act, as it currently operates, does not 
work.  We are told over and over again that it does not work.  In 
other words, the police need help as much as the citizens of this 
country.  They need the help of this House putting together good 
legislation that will serve the people in a responsible and 
effective manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have encountered many instances of vandalism.  For example, a 
small business had its front window broken.  Who became the 
victims?  The whole community became victimized.  Unfortunately, 
we are all victimized because of the unaccountable and 
irresponsible behaviour of youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point there seems to be no way in which society can deal 
with these youth.  In fact, it is so bad that in the small town 
of Birtle, Manitoba, the chamber of commerce had to hire a night 
security guard to patrol the main street of the community, 
believe it or not, because there was so much vandalism.  The 
businesses were literally being penalized through the cost of 
vandalism.  They found that hiring a security guard to do the 
night watch changed it totally.  In other words, they are doing 
the job that the police should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why this government has not reversed the 
numbers when it comes to gun control and the budgetary 
requirements of the RCMP.  Perhaps it can rethink that one before 
the estimates come before the House next month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act has been criticized for many, many 
years.  There is no doubt that violence in many cases cannot be 
prevented, but we believe prevention is the best approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the lack of change another thing the Young Offenders 
Act has created in some communities in rural Canada is the sense 
that a curfew is necessary.  It is really unfortunate that some 
communities need to think about looking for tools and other 
vehicles to help the police do their job.  I know that curfews 
are probably not the whole answer, but they may be part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the repealing of the Young Offenders 
Act and establishing a definition of juvenile offenders within 
the criminal code.  Amendments should be made so that the Young 
Offenders Act would include young offenders aged 10 to 15, 
serious offenders aged 14 and 15, with offenders 16 and over 
tried as adults.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act should also permit public access to 
court proceedings in cases involving 14 and 15 year old offenders 
and in cases where the public's right to know supersedes the need 
to protect the youth's identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as 
follows:  the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, Bill C-80. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
today we are debating the youth criminal justice act.  This is 
not the first time that I have had the opportunity to debate 
changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the day I listened to hon. members discuss this.  I 
heard members opposite suggest that it has taken an awful long 
time to get these amendments to the House.  I am sure the record 
will show very clearly that there have been three separate bills 
to amend the Young Offenders Act over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act was first adopted in 1984.  There have been three 
separate phases of amendment to that statute over the years.  I 
would count this substantial rewrite by the Minister of Justice 
as the fourth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that prior to the Young Offenders Act in 1984 
there was a predecessor statute which dealt with young offenders. 
It had a slightly different name.  It was called the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act.  That statute provided a procedure for dealing 
with young offenders who committed crimes and breached the 
criminal code, some would say just as effectively, less or more 
effectively than the way we handle them now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is clear that our society, in modern times, has 
always had a statute to provide separate intervention and 
distinct measures to deal with young offenders.  Whether we call 
them juveniles, children, boys and girls, non-adults, young 
adults, teenagers or adolescents, we have always in modern times 
had a statute to deal with them.  There was nothing radically 
different about the Young Offenders Act of 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I arrived in the House in 1988.  Over the years after 1984 there 
continued to be a need to amend the statute, at least this is 
what Canadians told us.  I was not in government then, but the 
government of the day accepted that changes were necessary. There 
were amendments dealing with some of the sentencing provisions 
for the more serious crimes, some of the procedures for the 
publication of names and that type of thing.  All of these were 
attempting to improve the working of the statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was clear in the early days that, while the government had 
passed the statute, the burden of administering it fell to the 
provinces.  Going back 15 years one may question whether 
sufficient consultation took place prior to the passage of the 
Young Offenders Act in 1984 with reference to the role of the 
provincial administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the provinces that have to carry the financial burden of 
dealing separately with young offenders.  It is only in a small 
number of cases that young offenders make their way into the 
ordinary criminal courts, which are provincially run.  It is 
rarer still that they would find their way into a federal 
penitentiary, where anyone sentenced to two years or more would 
be confined.  Most youth who get into trouble with the law are 
dealt with by provincial authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard members opposite go through all of the old paradigms and 
clichés. 
They have referred to the absence of accountability.  They have 
stated how bad and ineffective the Young Offenders Act is and 
that it lacks accountability.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each one of us has an ugly case we can cite.  We have all bumped 
into a policeman somewhere across the country who has said “My 
hands are tied.  We could not do anything.  He was a young 
offender”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, to be sure that policemen had responded to the complaint, 
had made an arrest, had laid a charge, had appeared as a witness, 
if he or she was a witness, and saw the conviction, I do not call 
that having one's hands tied.  I do not call that doing nothing. 
I do not call that zero response.  That is precisely how we 
respond to anyone who is charged with a criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often heard members in the opposition suggest that the 
Young Offenders Act is the cause of the crime.  They have said 
that it is the Young Offenders Act which is at fault.  Rarely do 
they point the finger at all of the other causes of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in the House knows that the criminal code is not the 
cause of crime.  It is not the criminal code that is the cause of 
a bank robbery.  It is not the Young Offenders Act that is the 
cause of a crime.  The Food and Drug Act is not the cause of drug 
smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act is not the cause of the crime that is 
committed.  There are other causes out there.  From time to time, 
I think some of us simply want to shoot the messenger, not 
understanding what the messenger is and not understanding the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme in the criminal code, the theme in youth justice is 
intervention, societal sanction for anti-social criminal acts 
committed by an adult or youth.  The Young Offenders Act, the 
Juvenile Delinquents Act and this new youth criminal justice act 
provide appropriate levels and intensity of intervention when 
crimes are committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that crime rates are now dropping.  This may 
make the invective a little less sharp, but this is recognized as 
a good thing.  Who gets the credit?  It is certainly not the 
government members and it is certainly not the opposition 
members.  Crime rates drop because the causes of crime drop. They 
are demographic, economic and administrative.  We can always give 
some credit to our police forces that good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the level of intervention and also the 
intensity of that intervention in the youth criminal justice act. 
It is a combination of society's response under the criminal code 
and under the youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act, as does the current act which we 
hope will be replaced, provides different classes and different 
intensities of intervention based on the seriousness of the crime 
and the age of the offender.  Most people would accept that a 
minor criminal offence committed by a 13 year old could be dealt 
with differently than the same relatively minor criminal offence 
committed by a 16 year old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new act, as generally the old act attempted to do, the 
higher the age of the convicted young person and the more serious 
crime that he or she is convicted of the more intense the 
intervention will be.  There are all levels of intervention. 
Hopefully, the first thing is getting caught and having to deal 
with a parent or two.  However, if by some misfortune a parent 
was not there for some of our youth, they would still have to 
deal with the police, the court and a judge.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act provides flexibility. I think it is worth noting for our 
provinces that for the more serious crimes, the level of 
intervention is dictated by the attorney general of a province. 
The scheme of intervention is arranged by the attorney general 
not by the Government of Canada.  That allows provincial 
flexibility in addressing this type of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two or three provinces do have successful regimes of Young 
Offenders Act intervention now.  Quebec has been mentioned here 
as one province that does.  The act is not intended to interfere 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective in these amendments is to provide an act for 
Canadian youth that provides a firm intervention, including hard 
time if it is appropriate.  This will be in the hands of a judge 
so that the youth will not, hopefully, continue in a life of 
crime and can become a contributing member of our Canadian 
society.

<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address today such an important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A renowned geneticist, Albert Jacquard, once said that a prison 
in a city means that there is something wrong in that city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are dealing with a somewhat special kind of crime, 
youth crime. I think we all want to reduce crime in our 
communities. Obviously, this is a worthy and desirable goal. 
However, I do have some misgivings and some concerns about the 
measures to reduce crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing today with Bill C-3, which proposes a system I 
cannot agree with. Previously, when young offenders were 
arrested, they got some kind of special treatment. Instead of 
sending offenders under 18 years of age directly to prison, we 
directed them towards different facilities, in the hope that 
they would be able to get back on to the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill says is  that we want to treat young offenders 
more harshly, to treat them as adults, depending, of course, on 
the seriousness of the crime. Yet we have to understand what 
impact that could have. I know there are hon. members here in 
this House, or members of their family, who have been victims of 
crime. And I know how frustrated or vindictive they must feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see these deplorable crimes reported on the front page 
of the newspaper, we have every right to think that it does not 
make sense and that something must be done. I agree, except that 
the easy way to solve this problem is to say that these young 
criminals must pay. They must pay like adults do and must be 
held responsible. There is certainly some logic in thinking this 
way, but actually it is false, and the statistics are there to 
prove it. Instead of talking about harsher sentences for young 
offenders, we should be talking about the root cause of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week, we will be celebrating—although it will not really be 
a celebration—the tenth anniversary of the House's resolve to 
eliminate child poverty by the year 2000. Child poverty has 
nearly doubled since the House expressed that resolve. 
Why I am saying that? Because sometimes, and very often in 
disadvantaged areas, young people are unable to benefit from the 
physical and moral support of their father and mother. These 
young people are more likely than others to become juvenile 
delinquents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a connection between the increase in poverty 
and the increase in crime. It may be the most important factor, 
and what we really should be discussing today are issues related 
to the root cause of crime. Unfortunately, we are not doing that 
because the minister has introduced a bill which will provide 
for harsher sentences, which I think will in no way benefit 
society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we lock up a young offender with other criminals, we are 
sending him to a school for crimes. He will be with individuals, young 
people and criminals, who are already frustrated with society, 
and who do not necessarily feel like respecting it. It is a 
little bit like sending him to a school for crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rather we talked about alternatives to the prison system 
instead of contemplating putting a bandage on a wound. Yes, 
there is a wound; yes, crime is a problem. But let us see how we 
can heal the wound rather than putting a bandage on it, hoping 
it will solve the problem. I cannot support this approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying today is not born out of emotion, it is borne 
out by facts. My colleagues mentioned it before me: in Quebec we 
have had, and still have, a more preventative way of dealing 
with young offenders, in order to rehabilitate them. It works. 
The numbers are there to prove it. We have them. We can prove, 
based on statistics, that our way is better. I do not like to 
quantify human behaviour, but in this case, it clearly shows 
that the approach of Quebec is the best in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that is before us today would have us believe that we 
should set all that aside, that its way of doing things is the 
right way. Unfortunately, its approach, which owes something to 
the Reform Party, is going to become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is deplorable, especially since in Quebec there is 
a consensus against this bill. 
If the federation were as flexible as some people claim, we, in 
Quebec, could say: if you want to try this approach, go ahead. 
But we, in Quebec, have our own approach, we believe in it and 
we want to carry on and even improve it, and we would like to 
have the opportunity and the freedom to maintain our approach 
toward crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I seek unanimous consent so that Quebec can opt out 
of this measure and continue to ensure its criminals are dealt 
with the same way as today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek the unanimous consent of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Unfortunately, I did not

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay: </B>Mr. Speaker, what I was saying is Quebec's 
approach is original. It works, and the numbers are there to 
prove it, and it seems to me that Quebec ought to be able to 
continue with this approach. If the rest of Canada wants to deal 
more severely with its young offenders, so be it. It does not 
bother me. What I want, and this is why I seek the unanimous 
consent of the House, is for Quebec to be allowed to continue to 
proceed in its own way, and the rest of Canada to do as it 
pleases.

flexible federalism? If I were a federalist, I would consider 
flexibility as an asset, because each province could have its 
own system and become a testing ground of sorts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this bill is all for standardization, and it will eliminate 
good programs. What a disgrace, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you think a 14 year old who never reads a paper and does not 
know what is going on in politics will say to himself before 
committing any crime that, with Bill C-3, if he commit a crimes, 
he will spend more time in prison? Let us get real. It will not 
change anything.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often, young criminals are economically disadvantaged, they 
are less educated and are not too well informed. Do you think 
stiffer legislation will have an impact? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies in the U.S. confirm this. Stiffer legislation does not 
reduce the crime rate. I am all the more troubled by this 
because I am the youngest member in the House. If we do not deal 
with our young criminals the way we should and if we send them 
to the school for crime, we will be turning them into real 
criminals. 
Since they are young, we will have to put up with them for many 
more years to come, and fighting against crime will cost us even 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this bill goes against common sense. I cannot overstate 
how much it goes against common sense. I would like to ask the 
members in the House to take note of the numbers, of the 
consensus and of a way of doing things that has been proven to 
work. This bill does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the rest of Canada wishes to do as it pleases, if it believes 
that there is a better way, let it do so, I have nothing against 
that. But I cannot accept the rejection of a way of doing things 
that has been proven successful. It is not perfect, of course, 
and we are trying to improve it, but I think the rest of Canada 
should have followed this example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I have the impression that, for political 
reasons, the justice minister only wishes to show us that she is 
backing down, or that this is the Liberals' balanced approach. 
Maybe she wants to show us, like Reform, that the Liberals can 
give a little to the left, a little to the right, I do not know. 
I do not know what is going on in the minister's head, but I 
find it unfortunate, and I am disappointed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
a real opportunity for me to be able to speak to the youth 
criminal justice act.  We can only hope there is some justice in 
this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is any justice when on a regular basis the 
House leader of the government leaps to his feet and moves 
closure on absolutely anything he chooses.  Here we have another 
bill that is at least 190 or 200 pages long.  We have had up to 
this point less than five hours of debate on it, and the House 
leader comes into the House and says that there is important 
stuff on the agenda.  We have yet to see any of this important 
stuff.  We have all looked over the agenda, the order paper and 
the Projected Order of Business, and none of it seems that 
crunchy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think that an amendment to the youth criminal justice 
act would be worthy of more than six or seven hours of debate. 
There are 301 members in the House.  How is it possible for this 
bill to be adequately debated at second reading in less than 
seven hours? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short answer is that it is absolutely not possible.  It is 
just another one of the government's absolutely arrogant, 
terrible, miserable ways.  I am searching for a word because I am 
trying to keep within parliamentary language.  It simply says 
that it has the majority and will use closure whenever it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when closure was only brought to bear under the 
most dire of circumstances.  It was something that had never been 
used in the House.  For years and years and years closure was not 
a tool.  We have to thank Pierre Elliott Trudeau for the 
unabashed use of closure.  He used to say “It is 3 o'clock on 
Wednesday. I think we will call closure.  Why not?  We will call 
closure”. He did not need any more reason than that and the 
Liberal House leader today does not seem to need any more reason 
than that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Scarborough—Rouge River in his speech talked 
about how we must prevent youth crime and how penalizing young 
people was not the answer.  Let us go along with the assumption 
that people should be held accountable for their actions.  That 
is on the basis that I want the House to think about the remarks 
I will make on behalf of one of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About four years ago I was going through downtown Leduc and I 
stopped in a little shop called Crafts and More.  I went in and 
introduced myself as the member of parliament for Wetaskiwin and 
met a very nice lady named Donna Rowe.  She said “Am I ever 
surprised to see you.  You are the first federal politician who 
has come to see me in my shop.  As a matter of fact your visit is 
quite timely because I have a story to tell you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is Donna Rowe's story.  I want the House to bear in mind 
that Donna Rowe is not talking about penalizing anyone.  She is 
talking about one of the other words in the bill and that is 
justice.  She is on a search for justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two young people in their early teens who were known to the 
police—in other words they had records—broke into her late 
model, half-ton truck with a camper on top.  It was custom 
painted to match her trailer.  It was used in her business and 
was her sole vehicle.  It was also used as a family vehicle.  It 
was an essential part of her life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two young people cannot be named because they were under 
the age of 18 and therefore apparently not responsible for any 
action they took.  We might think that is a fairly bold 
statement, but as the House hears what I have to say I believe I 
will bear that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They took her vehicle.  That can come about in a lot of 
different ways.  They were not, by the way, but let us suppose 
they were barefoot, there was snow on the ground, the vehicle was 
running, the door was open, and it was nice and warm in the 
truck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, they smashed the window.  They got in.  They hot-wired the 
truck.  They got it running.  They drove it until it would not 
drive any more.  Then they got out of it.  They kicked everything 
off it that they could: the mirrors, the lights, the windshield, 
the windows, the dials and the dash.  They ripped everything off 
it that they could.  Then they found a knife and slashed the 
seats and tried to set the truck on fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was just a couple of kids out having some fund, I guess, 
before they went to choir practice, scouts or whatever.  They 
were nice young guys but they were known to the police.  They did 
have records, but we cannot mention that because they were under 
18 and therefore not accountable, I guess, for the things they 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Rowe was devastated.  She felt violated.  She felt as 
though her security had been breached.  She felt terribly 
inconvenienced, but she said “Thank heaven we have insurance”. 
She went to the insurance agent who said the truck was unfixable. 
It was an absolute total wreck and a write-off.  The agent then 
asked how much she would take as a payout and offered to pay her 
out on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She knew she had to do something, that she had to replace it 
because she needed a vehicle.  She received a payout from the 
insurance.  What do we suppose happened to her insurance 
premiums?  Did they go down because she had tough luck and had 
fallen on hard times?  Hardly.  They went through the roof 
because she made a claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She told the insurance company that she did not cause the claim. 
Her vehicle was stolen.  They said “We don't give a rat's 
patootie”. 
It considered it a claim.  A claim is a claim is a claim.  She 
was treated the same way as if she were drunk and wrapped her 
truck around a telephone pole.  Her rates would go up.  She said 
she had no control over the situation.  They broke into her 
vehicle, stole her vehicle and drove off.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What did Donna Rowe want from this situation?  Did she want to 
have these guys flogged in front of the post office on payday? 
No.  She wanted some justice and accountability.  Were either of 
those young people asked to pay restitution to her so she could 
replace her vehicle?  No.  As a matter of fact her lawyer said 
that he did not even feel they owed her an apology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No apology was needed, I guess because they were young people. 
The judge gave each of them one year of open custody and one year 
of probation. 
What is the difference?  What is open custody?  Does that mean 
that they cannot steal cars on Tuesdays and Thursdays?  What does 
it mean?  Neither one of them got any time.  They made no 
restitution.  They made no apology.  They were not penalized in 
any way.  They had open custody:  “Away you go, see you next 
week” or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Mrs. Rowe wanted was some justice and accountability.  She 
felt that the justice system completely let her down, and she 
will forever and ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is there in the bill to allay the fears of Mrs. Rowe and 
people like her?  I know of a lot of other instances.  It is a 
shame that I have such a short time to talk about them because a 
lot of other people have come to me with very similar stories. 
It is not about punitive action taken against people.  It is 
about their doing something for the victims.

<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was not really intending to speak in this particular 
debate, but I am one of those on this side who happens to be 
doing his House duty today.  I have taken the opportunity as a 
result of that to look at this legislation and to give it 
particular attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an area of the legislation that especially interests me 
because of my background.  I am a former journalist, and actually 
a police reporter at one time, and I spent a portion of my youth 
covering crime for newspapers.  Any legislation has its flaws and 
has its merits.  I do think that this bill, when it comes to the 
question of the publication of the names of young offenders, has 
taken a few positive steps in the direction of expanding the 
publication of these names, not as far as I would like it to go 
but it has still advanced the cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people will say or wonder why it should be an issue, 
the publication of the names of young offenders.  The thought in 
the original Young Offenders Act was that young people, because 
we wanted to give them every opportunity to be rehabilitated, 
should have the full protection or as much protection as possible 
from publicity so that they would have every chance of putting 
their lives together as adults and to become good citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this universal ban on the publication of the names of young 
offenders—and the ban comes with teeth; the newspapers and the 
television stations that would dare publish these names can be 
subject to severe penalty if they do so—has come with some 
costs.  One of those costs is that sometimes when young offenders 
who are well known to be repeat offenders and violent offenders 
were at large in the community, there was still no effective way 
to alert the community that these dangerous young people were in 
the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, there is an instance in my own riding of the local 
newspaper, the Hamilton <I>Spectator</I>, that dared a few months 
ago to run a picture of a dangerous young offender who had 
escaped custody.  The newspaper took it upon itself to actually 
run that photograph to alert the community that this young person 
was at large. 
There is an ongoing controversy in the community right now as to 
whether the newspaper really overstepped the bounds.  I have to 
say that on the face of it, the newspaper broke the law, but I 
think the newspaper has a legitimate argument that it broke the 
law in the public interest and we cannot go around breaking laws 
so the law must be changed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, Mr. Speaker, one of the very positive attributes of 
this bill when it comes to the provisions for the publication of 
names is that it does provide in clause 109(4) if the police 
officer concerned or a youth justice court determines that a 
young offender at large is dangerous to the community or is in a 
state of escaping custody, then the youth justice judge or peace 
officer can seek an order to release the name and presumably, the 
photograph of the young offender to the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that this is a very obvious and 
very necessary provision in this legislation.  It is a very 
positive step indeed.  I am sure my home newspaper will feel 
vindicated that the legislation is moving in precisely the 
direction that the newspaper determined was in the interests of 
the community to go.  I have to give credit to the newspaper even 
though I cannot countenance breaking laws.  At least the 
newspaper showed a lot of courage to look after the community 
interests and published the picture of what appears to be a very 
dangerous young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, this legislation also takes a 
step backward, in my view, when it comes to the issue of the 
publication of the names and identities of people who are young 
offenders.  Previous to this legislation, or as it exists now 
before this legislation passes, we have provision for a young 
person who is facing charges on a very serious crime, murder or 
other serious crimes.  We can transfer that young person to adult 
court to be tried as an adult.  This legislation changes that 
around and says that particular young person can remain in youth 
court and be tried for adult sentencing.  If you understand, Mr. 
Speaker, the young person charged with, say, first degree murder 
who could face a life sentence, instead of going to adult court 
would stay in youth court and if convicted, would face that adult 
sentence which could involve life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem in that is that under the current system, if that 
young person being tried for a major crime is transferred to 
adult court, that court proceeding is done in the open.  The 
media would be able to follow that trial from its beginning to 
its conclusion.  If there was a conviction, we would be able to 
see the history.  It is very important that the public would have 
had the opportunity to see through the media the progress of that 
trial leading to a very serious sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, at least in my view, in trying to make the system 
work better, and I accept that the government is trying to do 
something positive here, but in moving it back to youth court, 
the government is providing for publication of the identity of a 
young offender convicted of a very serious offence, an adult 
offence with an adult sentence, only after the conviction and 
only on sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that I think that the government 
has to look at that clause very carefully.  I am not one who 
actually likes very often to cite the charter, but I have a 
genuine concern that when one is on trial for one's life, whether 
one is 16 or 60, that trial should be an open process.  All the 
way along it should be an open process.  Unfortunately the act as 
amended with this provision of moving serious offences from adult 
court back to youth court makes somewhat of a mistake.  I do hope 
that the justice committee, when it reviews this legislation, 
gives serious consideration to that one particular clause.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just another thing, Mr. Speaker.  There is another clause here 
that spells out that young people who are victims of the crime 
committed by the young offender are not allowed to have their 
identities released either and nothing should be done to identify 
those young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a funny situation where the Reform Party, with all due 
respect, is constantly talking about how we must pay attention to 
the victims of crime.  Here we have a case where, and I 
acknowledge that it is a very difficult issue for the government, 
if the victims of the crime are young people, they cannot have 
the satisfaction of being known to be the victims of the crime, 
because if they are known to be the victims of the crime, then we 
have the possibility that the young offender could be identified. 
Again, this is sort of the judgment of Solomon.  We want to 
protect the identity of the young offender, yet we take away 
something from the victim of the young offender's crime.  Again, 
I think that is something that needs to be at least debated in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is one general shortcoming that the bill does not 
address on the issue of the identification of young offenders. It 
is something that in my own experience I would like to see 
changed.  I do not think perhaps I could persuade the justice 
committee to change it now.  I really do think that we should 
have considered in the legislation the possibility of publicizing 
the identities of young offenders who have been convicted of 
summary offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite were talking on several occasions about young 
people doing vandalism and this kind of thing and getting away 
with it.  They get a slap on the wrist or whatever in the court 
systems, and there seems to be no decent control on these people 
who do these petty crimes.  Indeed, I think there is a great 
problem in our schools for young people who resort to acts that 
would be considered crimes of the type that would be dealt with 
by summary conviction.  These are lesser crimes we might say, 
minor assaults and that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the real control on doing this kind of 
thing, as it was when I was young, is the danger that one's name 
would appear in the local weekly newspaper and one's parents 
would find out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is something that we should look at again and 
consider.  It is not just a matter of banning the publication of 
serious offences.  We should also consider the possibility that 
maybe we should allow the publication of identity for minor 
offences.

to speak on this bill today. Personally, I regret having to 
address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should never have had a debate on Bill C-3, and the 
justice minister is well aware of that. Over and over again, we 
have seen that it is not the Young Offenders Act but rather its 
implementation that leaves to be desired. Those who implement it 
appropriately succeed where others fail. Nevertheless, the 
Liberal government is being stubborn and is about to reform the 
spirit of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, before the bill was ever introduced, I would have 
liked the House to address some very basic issues. How is it 
that a 12, 13, 14 or 18 year old can become an offender? We 
never asked ourselves that question. We do not need to be a 
psychologist or a psychiatrist to answer that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young people have gone through something that makes them 
feel unloved. They end up in a gang and seek some kind of 
recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in grade school, some fourth or fifth graders show signs of 
being—and I hate the word—bad seeds and on their way to becoming 
offenders. And nothing is done about it. 
If we had the decency to take care of those young people, they 
would never end up in court.

teachers. They do not have the time to take care of their 
students and some of them see themselves as mere numbers in the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act was passed in 1982 and came into effect 
in 1984. It did not come up overnight. It is the result of 
several decades of thinking. In fact, one has to go back to 1857 
to find the first measures giving special status to minor 
offenders. In 1908, we established the first youth justice 
system. 
The Juvenile Delinquents Act was designed to put young people 
back on the right track by minimizing their responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have successful legislation and it is in our 
province that the delinquency rate is the lowest. When a young 
person is punished and sent to prison, the older inmates will 
show him ways to commit crimes with minimum consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1970s, Quebec adopted two social measures that 
proved very useful with respect to the Young Offenders Act: 
legal aid and social services reform. In 1974, the first set of 
measures aimed at solving problems outside the judicial system 
was implemented. Now, the federal government wants to give the 
act more teeth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard our friends in the Reform Party say that the names of 
young offenders should be published in newspaper or mentioned on 
the radio. Going to that kind of extreme is unworthy of 
responsible citizens. 
As I said earlier, responsibility starts in elementary school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is reported that 1.5 million children do not eat their fill. 
This year, in Quebec, there was a campaign to buy pencils for 
pupils in elementary schools. Some parents cannot afford to buy 
pencils. This is serious. Some children have nothing to eat for 
lunch. They see their schoolmates go to the cafeteria and take 
money out of their pocket to buy fruit and chocolate while they 
have nothing to eat. I do not know how that would make us feel. 
I do not know if we would not feel rebellious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying, “Let us have stricter laws. Let us 
send them to jail and it will solve the problem. They will have 
time to think in jail”. We should ask ourselves what kind of 
thinking one can do in jail, other than becoming tougher and 
trying to find ways of getting out of there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there is help available in our prisons. There are 
highly qualified people who try to help, but when someone is 
seething with revolt, it takes more than six months or a year to 
get over it. It takes years and, during those years, someone has 
to be close by, I would say every day. When a tree is sick, what 
do we do? We put a protective coating on it. When a young tree 
is not growing straight, what do we do? We do not stick it in 
the garage. We leave it outside and stake it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should do the same thing with young people, that is give them 
support instead of locking them up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Given the wording of the House order, I think you would 
ordinarily find consent in the House to see the clock as 5.30 
p.m. when Private Members' Business would commence.  However, we 
would not commence Private Members' Business until the member was 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that we suspend to the call of the Chair.  It would 
not be later than when the hon. member, who is prepared to 
proceed, enters the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, may I simply leave the matter in your hands?  I 
suggest we see the clock as 5.30 p.m. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do 
not know exactly which procedure to use, but I suggest to the 
House that instead of pretending it is already 5.30 p.m., we 
have 15 more minutes to continue the debate on Bill C-3. This 
way, members who have not had the chance to speak could do so 
until 5.30 p.m., since we have the time. And when 5.30 p.m. 
comes, we will not have to fib, it will be the truth. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Joliette has made a suggestion which makes great sense. However, 
the order that we adopted earlier today specifically said that 
the debate would be concluded at 5.15 p.m., which we have done. 
The debate was concluded at 5.15 p.m. in order to provide for 15 
minute bells, but the vote was deferred until some other time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 15 minutes was not used for bells, the suggestion by 
the member for Joliette just plain makes sense.  Unfortunately, 
we have already gone past that point. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I submit the following for your 
consideration: could you ask for unanimous consent to continue 
the debate until 5.30 p.m., before disposing of the suggestion 
made by my colleague? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Yes, except that we 
have already put the question and have disposed of the debate. 
Had that been done earlier through unanimous consent, we could 
have done it.  However, the horse has already left the stable so 
we cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent to see the clock as 5.30 p.m.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 5.30 p.m., 
the House will not proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's order paper.

<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-207, an act to amend the Criminal Code to prohibit coercion in 
medical procedures that offend a person's religion or belief that 
human life is inviolable, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill 
C-207, an act to amend the Criminal Code to prohibit coercion in 
medical procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summary of the bill reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment protect the right of health care practitioners and 
other persons to refuse, without fear of reprisal or other 
discriminatory coercion, to participate in medical procedures 
that offend a tenet of their religion, or their belief that human 
life if inviolable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to ensure that health care providers, 
particularly nurses, will not be forced to participate against 
their will in such things as abortion procedures or acts of 
euthanasia.  The bill does not prohibit abortion itself, but 
makes it illegal to force another person to participate in an 
abortion procedure against their will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are legislative protections for health care workers 
already existing in many jurisdictions, including 45 out of 50 
states in the U.S.  But, incredibly, in Canada we do not yet have 
any legislative protections in either provincial or federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is tragic, because the need is great.  There have been 
clear violations of the basic human rights and labour rights of 
nurses working in our country.  Many have been denied employment. 
We have had conversations with and correspondence from different 
ones. They have been denied a promotion or have been dismissed 
for refusing to participate in abortion procedures.  Other 
nurses, fearing the loss of a job and possibly a career, have 
violated their consciences in order to keep their jobs.  This has 
created a great deal of psychological pain, since they entered 
that profession out of a desire to help and to heal, but now find 
themselves coerced into inflicting what their hearts tell them is 
the ultimate form of harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation facing nurses is described quite well by the 
organization called Nurses for Life.  At least five things need 
to be kept in mind when considering the plight which a number of 
nurses in our country today find themselves in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we need to keep in mind that although it is sometimes 
claimed that abortion is strictly a private matter between a 
pregnant women and her physician, nurses know that it is never 
the case.  Doctors do not function without nurses who are 
intimate participants in assisting the doctor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just had a little baby boy who was born last Sunday evening. 
The doctor came in at the last moment.  It was the nurses, those 
wonderful, gallant health care workers, who were there 
throughout, helping and assisting my wife until the birth. The 
doctor finally came in at the very last moment.  We know the 
nurses are the ones who are intimately involved, as they are at 
the abortion stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that while doctors are free to perform or not 
perform abortions, and while pregnant women in our country are 
free to undergo or not to undergo an abortion, nurses have not 
been given the same freedom to choose whether or not they want to 
participate in this procedure.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, unlike doctors, we need to keep in mind that nurses are 
employees of hospitals.  Their employment and their income is 
therefore dependent on their remaining in the good graces of 
hospital administrators in a way that doctors' employment and 
income is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we need to keep in mind that even in the rare instances 
where nurses' employers accommodate their conscience right, these 
respect-for-life nurses can be singled out as non-conformists, 
who are not “team players”.  This greatly inhibits their chance 
of promotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it is becoming increasingly difficult for nurses to 
choose areas of practice in which they can avoid the problem of 
assisting in abortions, since the procedures are often performed 
more increasingly in wards other than obstetrics and gynaecology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These concerns express the frustrations of hundreds of nurses 
across the country who have been unjustly coerced in one way or 
another.  We have had contact with a number of them.  Most of 
their stories have never gained the light of public attention. 
Some have, of course.  One notable example involves the 
mistreatment of nurses at the Markham Stouffville Hospital in the 
Toronto area in Ontario. Eight nurses were dismissed from the 
hospital in 1994 because they would not assist in abortions. 
They took their complaint to the Ontario Human Rights Commission 
and waited five long years for a hearing, during which time one 
of those nurses died.  At the last moment, right before the 
hearing that was scheduled for this year, the hospital agreed to 
settle.  In addition to providing financial compensation to those 
nurses, this much delayed justice, the hospital also agreed to 
draft a strong policy statement protecting the conscience and the 
labour rights of nurses still at the hospital.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation pro-life nurses face in the workplace is clearly 
unacceptable.  There is evidence at every turn that nurses are, 
or ought to be, entitled to legal protections.  There is 
precedent for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, section 2 of the charter of rights and freedoms 
guarantees freedom of conscience and religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, these freedoms are also listed in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act and in provincial human rights legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is precedent in the fact that case law in both 
charter cases and in human rights cases overwhelmingly supports 
the protection of freedom of conscience and religion in our 
wonderful country of Canada.  The nature of the various rulings 
in those cases indicate that if every unlawfully dismissed nurse 
were to lodge a formal complaint against her former employer, the 
employers would probably lose.  However, why would we want to put 
those nurses through that stress, through the great cost and 
through the time before they get some justice for the situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four, another precedent in terms of legal protection for them is 
the Code of Ethics of the Canadian Medical Association which 
clearly acknowledges the principle that health care workers 
possess—in this case it is doctors—conscience rights. It states 
that physicians are “to inform the patient when their personal 
morality would influence the recommendation or practice of any 
medical procedure that the patient needs or wants”.  The wording 
clearly implies that while doctors must inform their patients of 
their personal convictions, they in no way have to abandon those 
convictions. In the matter of abortion, for example, doctors are 
required neither to perform abortions nor even to refer clients 
to abortionists.  Therefore, doctors have that protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, as a precedent, medical facilities have acknowledged that 
nurses possess conscience rights.  It is kind of scattered, 
sporadic and piecemeal in the country.  I have already mentioned 
the Markham Stouffville Hospital in the Toronto area, which is 
the most recent example of a hospital drafting and implementing a 
policy statement to protect nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first key statement in its policy reads “All nurses with a 
religious objection to performing, or participating in, first 
trimester termination of pregnancy will be exempt”. Subsequent 
clauses repeat that affirmation for second and third trimester 
abortions.  The only exception made to this policy is when a 
pregnancy accident has put the mother's life in danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with this kind of clarity from the charter, from human 
rights acts, from the Canadian Medical Association and the policy 
statements of selected hospitals, nurses' rights are still being 
violated to this day.  Why is this?  Why have these laws and 
policy statements not been sufficient?  There are reasons why 
they are not sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with the charter.  The charter cannot protect 
nurses from coercion in the workplace because it simply was not 
designed for that purpose.  The charter can only be used to 
attack laws that are inconsistent with charter rights and says 
that the current violation of nurses' conscience rights is not 
being driven by any specific provincial or federal law.  There is 
nothing to attack by means of the charter.  The charter is 
therefore unable to help nurses in their present plight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the charter is of little help, what about human rights acts 
and commissions?  Unfortunately, they are also insufficient. 
Human rights commissions attempt to remedy injustices after the 
fact, usually years after the fact.  They are ineffective at 
preventing people from losing their jobs. In addition, they only 
address abuses that are brought forward by people with above 
average initiative who are familiar with their legal rights and 
are persistent, are like bulldogs, are obsessed and obstinate 
about getting some justice for this situation.  As a result, many 
people would grow faint-hearted and not pursue it and injustices 
would go completely unnoticed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the whole, human rights commissions, because they are slow 
and reactive, are unable to provide nurses with the immediate 
proactive protections that they need to stay employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, we should consider the effectiveness of hospital policy 
statements.  The problem here is that so few hospitals or health 
districts have such statements.  I have mentioned the success 
story at the Markham Stouffville Hospital.  However, we need to 
keep in mind that hospital adopted that policy only when it was 
on the brink of a hearing before the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission. 
It did the right thing, finally, but very reluctantly. Without 
pressure it would never have acted.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why separate and explicit conscience legislation for 
health care workers is needed.  I believe it is the 
responsibility of the federal government. We need legislation 
such as Bill C-207. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is limited in scope but it would provide some relief to 
nurses from the immediate threat they are facing today. In the 
future we will need more comprehensive legislation than this 
bill.  I want to elaborate on that important point using the U.S. 
experience as an instructive example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conscience laws in the United States are uneven and create 
only a patchwork of protection for health care workers.  Of the 
45 state laws currently in place, some apply only to abortion 
while others apply to additional procedures. Some laws apply only 
to individuals while others apply to institutions as well.  Some 
laws provide substantive protection while others provide only a 
legal cause of action for the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main reason for this unevenness is that the U.S. 
legislators, like legislators in other jurisdictions, have had as 
their goal the remedying of specific concrete threats to 
conscience rights as they have arisen.  As we so often do, they 
have legislated in a reactive mode.  Of particular note are the 
conscience laws passed in many states between 1973 and 1982. They 
were good but they were in reaction to other supreme court 
rulings at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislating in a reactive mode has meant that in the U.S. 
there has not been a comprehensive, well thought out, well 
designed legal approach to protecting the freedoms of conscience 
and religion in the field of health care.  Most conscience clause 
statutes protect the right to refuse to participate in only one 
or two procedures.  These laws do not deal with emerging ethical 
issues like those relating to physician assisted suicide, 
fertility treatments or medical experimentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ultimately need a comprehensive approach that will be able to 
address these rapid changes in technology. Some supporters of 
abortion on demand have scoffed at the idea of conscience rights 
as though it were merely a concern of pro-lifers.  But as science 
marches on and as it marches forward, a surprising thing is going 
to happen.  Mark my words.  More and more people working in the 
health care field are going to find themselves facing troubling 
ethical decisions.  Nursing ethicist Patricia Wall of McMaster 
University was right when she cautioned that ethical problems 
faced by health care workers are bound to snowball. They very 
well will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of reproductive technologies alone, increasingly 
sophisticated scientific developments may eventually offend even 
the most laissez-faire physicians.  Without proper legislation 
there may come a day when no physician feels free from coercion 
to violate his or her conscience.  If the health care customer is 
always right, then physicians and other health care workers will 
be forced to follow the dictates of those customers.  It will not 
be what the doctor has ordered that will be important, but what 
the customer has ordered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an approach that will bring together ethicists, 
scientists, attorneys, politicians, physicians, nurses, 
administrators, religious leaders and others able to contribute 
to the construction of a comprehensive approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question would be:  Why is the Liberal government not doing 
anything proactively to address this need for comprehensive 
legislation?  Why is it that we cannot get a basic elementary 
bill like Bill C-207 passed in the Canadian House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government will not allow a vote on this bill so it 
will not become law.  It is tragic.  It went before a committee. 
One hundred MPs from all parties signed a petition to have this 
bill debated. I am confident the bill would have passed with a 
free vote in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to express my appreciation to those nurses who 
wrote to me and with whom I had conversations in support of my 
efforts to present this bill in the House.  To them I express my 
sincere hope that future developments, social, political and 
technological, will one day refocus public attention on this 
issue of conscience rights for health care workers and that 
justice will eventually emerge for those presently being abused 
by medical employers with government approval.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first blush, one might think that this is a matter for the 
Minister of Health, but there is much more to the bill than 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also refers to the justice field and must also take 
into consideration the context of federal-provincial relations. 
In the many debates on this topic, it is often forgotten that 
the federal government, the provinces and the territories have a 
long tradition of working very closing together when it comes to 
the health care sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, there is the social union agreement signed at least 
one year ago by the federal government, nine provinces and three 
territories.  This agreement is one of the very important 
results of this co-operation. 
And, as it says in the preamble to the framework agreement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following agreement is based upon a mutual respect between 
orders of government and a willingness to work more closely 
together to meet the needs of Canadians. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is critical for the federal government to acknowledge that 
the regulation of health care professions and the development of 
employment standards for health care professions are areas of 
provincial and territorial jurisdiction.  Why is this important 
as far as Bill C-207 is concerned?  This bill deals with 
education and employment standards in health care.  By law and 
according to the federal-provincial-territorial framework, these 
are areas of provincial and territorial responsibility.  It 
therefore follows that to attempt to trump provincial and 
territorial jurisdiction through the creative use of the criminal 
code runs against all legal and policy protocols in health. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-207 is to amend the criminal code in order 
to provide better protection to health care practitioners 
against any reprisals resulting from their decision not to 
perform certain medical procedures for religious or ethical 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes that the following three situations be 
considered offences: an employer who refuses to employ a health 
care practitioner and dismisses him for religious or ethical 
reasons; a health care educator who refuses to admit such a 
person to courses in a field of health care; and an officer of a 
professional association who takes similar action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that Health Canada does not have a 
mandate to intervene in any case that is exclusively provincial 
or territorial.  Health professionals are subject to private 
provincial or territorial legislation which has been passed to 
enable them to self-regulate the delivery of their professional 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the majority of these professionals are required to 
adhere to a code of ethics adapted to their profession.  Such 
matters do not fall under Health Canada's jurisdiction, or that 
of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the Canada Health Act is not to direct or 
control professionals, their employers or those training them, 
but to ensure that the Canadian public has reasonable access to 
insured and medically required services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the provincial laws, each administration is 
protected by provincial and territorial human rights 
legislation, which not only constitutes a dissuasive element 
with respect to discrimination or reprisals, but also represents 
a suitable way of handling the type of violation we are talking 
about. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further consideration that is important when reviewing Bill 
C-207 is the appropriate application of the criminal code.  The 
criminal code is the ultimate statement of our fundamental values 
expressed as prohibitions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, therefore, it ought to be used as a last resort, not 
the first one, when legal sanctions affecting the health field 
are involved.  There are other legislative vehicles at both 
levels of jurisdiction that are appropriate for lesser offences.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when there is clearly a serious offence involved, the 
federal government has tended to use the criminal law power 
expressed in health legislation in preference to the criminal 
code for health matters. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the contents of Bill C-207 were to fall within federal 
jurisdiction, which they do not, the criminal code would not be a 
suitable legal vehicle for regulating the performance or not of 
work related tasks on a day to day basis. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would strongly encourage all those with an 
interest in the issues raised by Bill C-207 to make a serious 
study of these issues in relation to compliance with the 
established jurisdictions over these matters.  It will then be 
seen that the criminal code is not suitable to the issues 
raised, in particular the ones raised by Bill C-207. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A debate is also required on the ethics of health care delivery, 
which might yield some pertinent legal elements.  Such a debate, 
however, would also have to take into consideration and respect 
areas of provincial jurisdiction, provincial legislation, and 
federal-provincial agreements in this area. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

an important and sensitive matter, it remains an issue that falls 
outside the jurisdiction of Health Canada and the federal

the member's intentions are good and I am going to mention some 
of them in my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced in the first session of this parliament. 
At that time it was Bill C-461.   It is a non-votable bill.  It 
seeks to protect the right of health care practitioners and other 
persons to refuse without fear of reprisal or other 
discriminatory coercion to participate in medical procedures that 
offend a tenet of their religion or their belief that human life 
is inviolable. There is nothing wrong with that intention at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prohibition of coercion by health care employers, educators and 
professional associations, if found guilty, they are to be on a 
summary conviction.  I am not sure what this bill does but I want 
to remind the House that the criminal code already includes 
clauses for the protection of medical practitioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point has to be taken as well in this debate that the 
Canadian Medical Association's own code of ethics as well as the 
physicians' charter both include stipulations that afford health 
care practitioners, and the important phrase is health care 
practitioners, the right to not perform procedures with which 
they disagree.  That is already in their code and charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to the physicians' charter is important.  This is 
what every doctor in the country lives by.  The preamble states:

</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of Canadian physicians, in partnership with their 
patients, is to provide the best health care possible. This 
Charter expresses what Canadian physicians need to achieve this 
goal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this preamble the physicians are reminded that although 
they have a tremendous duty to their patients, the medical 
community and the rest of society, they also are responsible to 
themselves, above all.  That means that physicians are exempt—an 
important word—from performing procedures that go against their 
own personal values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that—and this is important to 
remember—physicians can and often do refer patients to other 
doctors or health care practitioners in order for them to get the 
care they desire or deserve.  A physician can refer to other 
physicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In section 2 of the physicians' charter, clause 7 states that 
physicians need to be able to practise medicine in accordance 
with professional and personal standards within the bounds of the 
Canadian Medical Association's code of ethics.  Through this 
stipulation within the physicians' charter, health care providers 
have their rights and personal values protected.  The key word is 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charter deals with a quality of life for Canadian 
physicians.  It states that physicians in this country have to be 
able to balance the demands of their profession with their own 
need for quality of life and personal health maintenance. 
Therefore, clause 18 within that section states that physicians 
need to be free from harassment, discrimination, intimidation or 
violence, both in training and in practising medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coercion, as mentioned in this bill, has already been dealt with 
through that section of the physicians' charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  That is nurses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member will have a 
chance to conclude and continue the debate, so I would remind him 
to exercise the kind of restraint that most of us do during 
Private Member's Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for his initiative, but as the government 
member stated, most of this falls under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really disappointed.  I know the member believes firmly in 
this.  That is his right.  That is why he was sent to this House. 
But why would the Reform Party stay away in big numbers?  There 
is not one single member of the Reform Party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must remind the 
hon. member that we do not comment on the presence or absence of 
members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, to phrase it another 
way, which may be parliamentary, there is not one single member 
of the official opposition here except the mover of the bill. 
That tells us something about his lack of support within his own 
party and it tells us a lot about that party and its commitment 
to this very issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I would like to draw to the attention of people 
watching that I have received a lot of support from all members 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  It is a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  It is not a point of 
order. Once again, I would ask all hon. members not to comment on 
the presence or absence of members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I apologize 
for referring to the absence of Reform members in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  The comments of the member are very offensive when we 
are dealing with something as serious as this.  We have had 
members from all parties in the House support this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid the 
member is debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member who put 
forward this bill is a member of the very party that denied us on 
opposition day the other day by simply denying unanimous consent 
to continue the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that, again, he is the only member of his party 
here debating this very issue.  Where are they?  Back home?  What 
is the problem?  Why would they not— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  This will be the last 
point of order on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have listened to 
the comments of the member and I think you should shut it down. 
He should finish his speech.  We have had good support from all 
members— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I would again warn 
the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have nothing 
against the member in terms of his commitment to the issue, but 
the point that I have been attempting to make is that widespread 
support is needed on a bill which is before the House.  I cannot 
see widespread support on the other side of the House.  I cannot 
see widespread support on this side of the House. Basically, the 
problem is that it goes into what is generally considered to be 
provincial jurisdiction.  On that basis alone I do not think he 
will get the kind of support he is seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to the bill and some of the facts the member has 
presented to the House are open to debate in terms of the 
protection that health care workers, doctors and nurses, are 
afforded today through the charter of rights and through their 
individual rights as working Canadians.  That is very much 
respected today and we want to see that kind of respect and 
defence of individual rights continue.  I believe that under the 
current legislation that is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although his intentions are good, I do not believe that this 
bill will add anything to the debate.  On that basis I will sit 
down and allow the sole member of the Reform Party to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I will recognize the 
hon. member who presented the bill for his five minute reply, 
which will end the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to 
begin by thanking members on the government side of the House who 
supported this bill.  Although they are not here in body, I know 
they are here in spirit and they are supportive of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate in our present system that we have a scenario 
where private members' bills are slotted at the end of the day, 
late in the week, when individuals have to catch flights and 
things of that sort.  These are individuals from the New 
Democratic Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party. 
There were some 100 signatures collected in support of this bill. 
The bill also came in by way of the draw and that is why we are 
having this discussion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I think is really quite questionable about our system is 
the fact that if we go into committee with a bill that has the 
support of at least a third of the members of the House, in 
principle the bill should come before the House.  It should be 
voted on, it should be tweaked, it should be amended, it should 
be changed and improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly welcome the member from the Conservative Party 
who spoke previously for the contributions he would make there. 
He would listen to the various witnesses from Nurses for Life and 
various health care workers and he would find that we do not have 
protections in our country at this time for nurses, the men and 
women who serve alongside, but who are in a different position 
than physicians. Everything that he had to say concerned 
protections for, in his own words, physicians.  Physicians are a 
lot different than nurses.  That is the focus.  That is the 
particular matter under discussion here today. 
I want to thank and encourage others who work in the health care 
profession and those who are in training institutions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall a day some months ago when I had an aboriginal girl 
come into my office.  She was pretty emotionally shook up.  She 
was coming to the completion of her term of study.  She asked me 
“What can I do in the situation I am caught in?  I am supposed 
to do a study of certain modules or elect certain modules as I 
come to the end, and it appears—I do not know and I have to find 
out—that I have to be involved in an abortion procedure”.  This 
was an aboriginal girl and from her background, whether religious 
or not, sanctity of life, respect for life, was important.  She 
had the feeling that she would be coerced or forced into an 
abortion procedure or be denied completion of her program.  I 
have talked to doctors and to others, and it seems that in some 
schools at least, students are forced to be involved in this as 
part of their training program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member who spoke prior to me mentioned, it is not 
covered.  We have too many nurses, too many individuals, who call 
and tell us that this is a problem. It is not something that we 
can simply leave.  It would no longer be a problem if it were 
something the provinces could deal with.  It needs the broader 
protection of the federal government.  It should be in the 
criminal code, as we are suggesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are better ideas in terms of the protection of health 
care workers, we are certainly open to them, but nothing has been 
forthcoming so far.  We would gladly do what we could in defence 
of and on behalf of good health care workers who dedicate their 
lives to the profession or specialize in the area of bringing 
life into the world.  They do not want to be involved in abortion 
procedures.  It is not banning abortion; it is simply saying that 
others cannot be forced into being involved.  It is saying that 
others cannot be forced into being involved in euthanasia.  We 
hope to have a bill in place some day to deal with the 
reproductive technology that greatly troubles health care 
workers.  It is ethically troubling for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, as I conclude my remarks, I want to thank members of the 
House who may even be viewing this in their offices or in their 
homes on CPAC, especially members from the government side of the 
House.  Obviously they would not be the minority, but there are 
good members of that party which have given their support, as 
well as members of the Conservative Party.  In fact it was the 
deputy House leader from the maritimes who seconded this bill. 
It was this member's own colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank members of my party, a good number of them, 
maybe the most significant amount of those 100 signatures, as 
well as members from the NDP.  This issue needs to be dealt with 
and we will do that in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I appreciate the thanks, but I would remind the member 
that his own caucus is missing this debate and I am very 
disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I have been very 
patient with the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member for Wanuskewin like to complete his 
remarks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have completed my 
remarks.  I simply want to assure members on all sides of the 
House who have these concerns at heart that we will continue to 
try to improve the bill in different ways such that it reflects 
and protects workers.  It would appear at this point that our 
only recourse is to bring it into the criminal code so that there 
is broad, uniform protection across the country for health care 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There being no 
further members rising for debate and the motion not being 
designated as a votable item, the time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has expired and the 
order is dropped from the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to 
address a matter that I raised in this House on October 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I raised a question and brought a matter to the 
attention of the Minister of Health pertaining to the very 
serious and broad issue around food safety. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I specifically asked the government about its intentions with 
respect to Bill C-80, which was legislation tabled in parliament 
last spring but not dealt with before the summer recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interim a most unusual development occurred.  The 
extraordinary public display of concern by 200 staff people in 
the Department of Health took place.  Two hundred scientists in 
the health protection branch, knowledgeable about the area of 
food safety and food research, spoke up publicly.  That is 
unheard of.  For that large a group of employees within the 
government to go public with their concerns suggests to me and to 
members of my party that there is a very deep rooted serious 
problem within the Department of Health that has not been 
addressed and continues to fester and cause concerns for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those scientists went public on September 30 of this year.  They 
called upon the government to reverse its decision with respect 
Bill C-80 and with respect to the whole erosion of the food 
safety approach of the government.  They were very clear about 
the problems associated with Bill C-80 and about a number of 
other developments that have raised serious concerns among 
Canadians regarding the quality and safety of our food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically they talked about aspects of the bill that need to 
be addressed by the government.  For example, fundamental to 
their concerns is a matter pertaining to a conflict of interest 
in the inspection and surveillance of our food safety system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shifted responsibility from Health Canada to 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency which is a step removed from 
direct accountability to parliament and involves a serious 
potential conflict of interest, being an agency that is 
responsible both for the promotion and marketing of food as well 
as for the inspection and safety of our food supply.  They 
believe Bill C-80 will take us a step further in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also raised concerns about the failure of the government, 
which is shown in Bill C-80 as it was tabled last spring, around 
ensuring that genetically engineered foods are safe.  They 
suggest that the legislation will open the floodgates and allow 
for biotechnology to take place at a very rapid pace in the 
country without any kind of in-depth research being done to 
determine the long term impact on human health, on production 
patterns and on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also believe that the bill will neutralize the Minister of 
Health and prevent him from carrying out his legislated statutory 
obligations under the Food and Drugs Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have many other concerns, all of which I am sure the 
government is fully aware of.  However, I want to use this 
opportunity today to ask:  Given these concerns, will the 
government not just simply put Bill C-80 on hold but actually 
take it right off the agenda and look at restoring the teeth— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that hon. 
member's time time has run out. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the Minister of Health has taken 
the question raised by the member for Winnipeg North Centre very 
seriously.  He also took very seriously the petition signed by 
over 200 employees of the food directorate, and told them that 
food safety is vital for the minister and the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employees of the food directorate recently met with senior 
management, and the minister totally supports the dialogue that 
followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel as well that the recent appointments of Dr. Le Maguer, an 
internationally renowned scientist, to head the food directorate 
and of Dr. Mohamed Karmali, a former member of the science 
advisory board of Health Canada, as head of the Guelph 
laboratory and specialist in diseases of the digestive tract, 
signal clearly Health Canada's commitment to scientific 
excellence and to the renewal of the food surveillance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to reiterate the commitments made in the October 12 
throne speech on strategic investments in health research and 
technology, and in the improvement of Health Canada's Canadian 
food safety program and the investments that will modernize our 
health protection activities to better mirror our changing 
world. 
These ongoing commitments to food safety justify the $65 million 
announced in the last federal budget.

effectiveness of the agency's activities in the area of food 
safety. Health Canada is very diligently fulfilling these 
commitments.
