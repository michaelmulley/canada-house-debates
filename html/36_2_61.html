<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (B), 1999-2000 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>A message from Her Excellency the Governor General transmitting 
supplementary estimates (B) for the financial year ending March 
31, 2000, was presented by the President of the Treasury Board 
and read by the Deputy Speaker of the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  We just heard the message saying that the Governor 
General was recommending some additional spending.  I would like 
to ask the President of the Treasury Board if such spending is 
justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  This is not a point 
of order.

Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I have the honour to table, in

<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  Last night the 
government gave notice under Motion No. 8 that it would be 
embarking on an unprecedented attack on democracy in this place. 
I do not wish to eat into the time of the NDP on their opposition 
day, but this is an outrageous act on behalf of the government. 
It is shutting down debate not only in the House but in 
committees.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker himself or herself, by virtue of this move, will be 
brought into the fray and be asked to participate and rule on 
amendments that may be brought forward in the House.  This will 
limit debate.  This is an attack on the use of committees in 
terms of their reports being brought forward and the ability to 
file amendments will be severely curtailed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It creates two classes of members in this place:  special 
privileges that can be afforded to members who are cabinet 
ministers versus those who are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tools of parliament will be circumvented by virtue of this 
motion that has been brought forward and notice given by the 
government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this matter, we would respectfully put forward 
that the Speaker should rule on the privileges of the members of 
the House who have been severely undermined by virtue of the 
government House leader in his attempts to shut down all 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the official opposition was given an opportunity 
under the Nisga'a debate to exercise a certain amount of 
privilege, and yet what we have seen is another party in the 
House being severely limited in its ability to do the exact same 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you consider this unprecedented 
attack that has been embarked upon by the government House 
leader.  This is, I would suggest, severely infringing on the 
ability of members of parliament to do their work in this place, 
to do their work on behalf of their constituents and on behalf of 
all Canadians in ways that are unprecedented.  They are limited 
on very important pieces of legislation that affect everyone in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to consider Motion No. 8 before 
this is brought to the House for a vote.  I would ask the Speaker 
to rule as to whether this motion is in fact in order at all, 
because this puts the Chair, you, Mr. Speaker in a position 
where, as a referee, you are being asked to put on the government 
team's jersey and play for that side.  Mr. Speaker, I suggest 
that this curtails your credibility and your ability to do your 
impartial work in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These motions being brought forward, five in total under Motion 
No. 8 under government business today, once again severely 
undermines the ability of this place to operate in a coherent, 
fair and equitable fashion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am aware of this motion.  I read the 
order paper, as the hon. member did today.  I see that not only 
he but a number of other members of parliament want to intervene 
on this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am faced with two things.  The first is that this motion is 
not before the House at this point.  I do not know if this is the 
motion that will be presented for discussion.  I do not know if 
it will be added to and I do not know if it will be changed. 
Until it is before the House, I would prefer to hold any kind of 
decisions or even debate on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I am faced with is that in normal 
circumstances, in our practices here in the House, when we do 
have an opposition day we usually give all kinds of leeway for 
the people who have presented the motion to have their day in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to this particular motion, I am aware that there are 
difficulties for some members of parliament.  The motion is not 
before the House, so I will keep in mind what the hon. member has 
said thus far.  However, I would prefer to receive opinions and 
advice from the House when the motion is before the House. 
It is not there.  Therefore I will not hear them today and we 
will go on with our normal business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House calls upon the government to stand up for the 
Canadian value of universal public health care by announcing 
within one week of the passage of this motion a substantial and

</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret any inconvenience this may have caused hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for reading 
aloud the very important motion on health care which the NDP 
opposition has placed before the House today.  Every member of 
the House will have an opportunity to vote on it before the day 
is out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to indicate at the outset that I am very pleased to 
share my time with the member for Winnipeg North Centre, the 
hardworking health critic of the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion, on which every member of the House will have an 
opportunity to indicate where they stand before the day is out, 
deals with the undisputed number one priority of the Canadian 
people namely, health care, and more specifically the threat to 
health care that is currently a reality in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week we saw a budget introduced in which the government of 
the day indicated to Canadians that their priorities do not 
count.  How else can we interpret a budget that makes available 
one dollar in tax cuts for every two cents allocated to health 
care?  The government knows there is a serious health care crisis 
happening across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan in the 1940s Tommy Douglas took the first 
important step toward the introduction of a universal, publicly 
funded health care system for Canadians.  He issued some very 
important advice.  He said not to ever ever make the mistake of 
thinking that the enemies of a universal health care system will 
have gone away.  They may have gone into the shadows, they may be 
hiding out, but there will always be those who take the view that 
they personally or their friends can benefit from a for profit 
health care system; a health care system that takes no account of 
whether people happen to live in a province where health care is 
available to them on the basis of need, or where people do not 
have money in their pockets to purchase the health care services 
they need.  There will always be people who will want to benefit 
from a two tier health care system that looks a lot like that 
health care system to the south of us today in the United States 
of America.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was very good advice, because we have today the political 
fight of our lives under way to ensure that we preserve and 
strengthen through change a universal public health care system, 
the single greatest achievement of Canadians.  I think it is the 
very thing Canadians value most about being a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may think that fight is taking place between the federal 
Liberal government and some Canadian premiers, notably the 
premiers of Ontario and Alberta. The Canadian people know better. 
Canadians know that the fight is taking place between those who 
value and will work to preserve and strengthen the universal 
health care system and those who place it in jeopardy.  They know 
that those who have put it in jeopardy include on the same side 
of this battle the federal Liberal government of the day, the 
Conservative governments of Ontario and Alberta and others who 
would seize the opportunity that the federal Liberal government 
has created to tear down that universal health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first blow to that system was given in the 1995 federal 
Liberal budget but we do not have time to talk about how we got 
into this mess.  As members of parliament elected to represent 
Canadians who value our universal health care system, today we 
need to stand and vote to preserve and strengthen that system. 
Every single member of the House will have the opportunity later 
today to indicate which side of this battle he or she is on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we do not have a lot of time before that universal 
health care system slips away, in order to move quickly and 
dramatically we must take some very specific concrete steps.  Our 
motion sets out three steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must first take urgent fiscal action.  That means restoring 
the cash transfers for health care to a minimum of 25% of health 
care spending over the next two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the federal government must take the necessary steps to 
prohibit private for profit hospitals.  We have to draw that line 
in the sand.  The federal Liberal government knows perfectly well 
that Ralph Klein and his government have been busy moving in that 
direction.  At this very moment they are preparing to take the 
next step that would allow for the operation of private for 
profit hospitals.  It is the thin edge of the wedge. We have seen 
what has happened with eye clinics in Alberta. Canadians have had 
their eyes opened to what that means in terms of a two tier 
system.  We cannot allow that to happen in Alberta.  We cannot 
allow Mike Harris who is watching with glee to think he too can 
move in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the federal government must stop other health services, 
such as home care from being privatized as well.  In the province 
of Ontario the excellent home care services that were beginning 
to be put in place, beginning to be integrated into a 
comprehensive home care system have been torn down.  Why have 
they been torn down?  Because the federal Liberal government gave 
Mike Harris the permission he needed to do it.  It cut so much 
money in unilateral cuts to health care starting in 1995 and 
still has not restored those lost funds.  The Harris government 
said, “We are going to take this as permission to begin 
delivering home care at the lowest possible cost. We are going to 
shift it on to a private system”.

workers like the VON, the St. Elizabeth Society and the Red Cross 
have literally been thrown on the human scrap heap to make way 
for privatized home care.  It is not a pretty picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today every member of the House, including every member from the 
provinces of Ontario and Alberta who knows what an ugly picture 
that privatized home care is, has the opportunity to make it 
clear that he or she is prepared to stand and fight for what 
Canadians want, and that is a universal, publicly funded health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that every member of the House understands that is what 
Canadians want and we know that the health minister will stand to 
say “Yes, but it takes money”.  Then let us talk about the 
money. Yes, it takes changes.  Let us talk about the changes. 
But let no member of the House use the excuse of cowardice or 
dithering or delaying to fail to stand in his or her place today 
to support the NDP opposition motion that is before us to 
strengthen and preserve through change the health care system for 
which Canadians have worked so hard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
applaud my colleagues in the NDP for bringing forward the debate 
in the House today on what clearly is Canada's number one 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I would point out to the hon. leader of the 
NDP that they have really chosen to attack two provincial 
governments.  I would point out in particular that the 
Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris has put more 
money into health care than any other provincial government in 
Ontario's history, far more than that of the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member aware of that fact? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Madam Speaker, the first thing I 
would do is welcome a member of the Progressive Conservative 
Party into the health care debate.  Canadians have been waiting 
all week for that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Definitely I want to point out, to help remove any imaginary 
barriers to Progressive Conservative support for this resolution, 
that we were very careful not to mention Mike Harris and Ralph 
Klein in the resolution because we certainly did not want to give 
them an excuse not to come forward and make it clear that members 
of the Progressive Conservative caucus as well support a 
universal public health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who imagines that Mike Harris is on the side of 
universal public health care simply has not been watching what 
has been going on in this country and in the province of Ontario 
for the last five years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, there is no question that this debate is more 
important than any other matter we are dealing with in terms of 
the future of the country.  Universal public health care is the 
defining characteristic of Canada.  It is a unifying force.  It 
is the way we ensure that the Canadian values of compassion and 
caring, of co-operation and community are translated into action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that over the last few years under this 
government we have lost much of what gives us a sense of Canadian 
identity.  We have lost much of our nationhood.  We have lost 
many of the tools to control our own destiny and many of the 
programs which Canadians cherish.  This debate is really about 
taking back Canada, about getting control over our own destiny 
and knowing that if we lose medicare we lose the ties that bind 
and we throw overboard completely the moral and social values 
without which our society would become a ruthless jungle.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are at the crossroads.  We are at the fork in the road. 
We are standing at the precipice.  The direction we go in the 
days and weeks ahead will determine what path we take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to look at why we have medicare and what it 
means to Canadians.  My leader pointed to Tommy Douglas, the 
founder of medicare, and said that the concept of medicare is 
about our values and our sense of fairness.  I can think of no 
better way to get across that point than to go back to the words 
of Tommy Douglas, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had I been a rich man's son the services of the finest surgeons 
would have been available.  As an iron moulder's boy, I almost 
had my leg amputated before chance intervened and a specialist 
cured me without thought of a fee.  All my adult life I have 
dreamed of the day when an experience like mine would be 
impossible and we would have in Canada a program of complete 
medical care without a price tag.  And that is what we aim to 
achieve—the finest health service available to everyone 
regardless of ability to pay. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this debate it is also very important to look to our 
neighbours to the south, to look to the American model of health 
care.  That is very much at the heart of this debate, and where 
we are headed unless the government is prepared to act today.  Do 
we want a society like the United States, where some 43 million 
people are without any kind of access to medical services?  Do we 
want a situation where families in this wealthy country of Canada 
make difficult decisions about whether to fill a prescription, 
take a sick child to the doctor, or get a regular checkup? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years back I had the opportunity to be on a fact finding 
mission in the United States.  I was struck by the horror stories 
of what people had to endure because they did not have a 
universal public health care system.  I was struck by one story 
of a woman who needed a liver transplant.  Her health insurance 
plan did not cover this particular intervention.  The family had 
to come up with $150,000 in cash just to get on the donors list. 
The first organ transplant did not take.  The family needed 
another $50,000 cash to get on the donors list again.  The woman 
who went through that operation died.  The family was left facing 
a bill of $400,000, of which only a portion was covered by their 
insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we want that kind of situation in Canada?  Is that not where 
we are headed unless we can somehow convince the government to 
act and act now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to remember what happens when governments 
delay, when political paralysis sets in and when we do not act 
immediately when the first signs of danger appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to a speech made by Stanley Knowles in 1958 in 
Gimli, Manitoba.  He said: “The Liberals promised health 
insurance in 1919 but had no intention of starting it until 
1959”.  Stanley Knowles had a good sense of humour.  He went on 
to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently, it was Mr. Mackenzie King's reading of the Bible, 
about the children of Israel having to wander in the wilderness 
for 40 years that prompted him to require the people of Canada to 
wander in the wilderness of high medical costs for 40 years 
before making even a start in this field. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we actually have the spectacle of the present Liberals 
having Canadians wander again in the wilderness and of creating 
the horrific possibility of losing medicare because of inaction 
and political paralysis.  We are here today with this motion 
because we want the government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus of our motion is a federal budget that has been 
universally condemned by health organizations from one end of the 
country to the other, and by every provincial premier responsible 
for delivering health services to Canadians.  The daunting 
challenge before us today is to somehow give expression to the 
desperation, the anger and the grief of those who are forced to 
cope with the inadequacies of our health system, especially as 
they listened to the finance minister's message on Monday.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are stretched and stressed to the breaking point, 
trying to care for themselves or finding a way to pay for care 
for their loved ones, are the people we are speaking on behalf of 
today; those who know in their hearts that with an improved, 
fully funded, comprehensive health system, someone they knew, 
someone they loved, could have lived a longer and better life. 
The motion today is about just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today is about stopping the slide to two tier health 
care.  The motion today is about stopping Ralph Klein, who at 
3.45 p.m. today, eastern time, will stand in the Alberta 
legislature and introduce a bill to allow profit care in Canada's 
hospital system.  That is the measure of this federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is the green light to Premier Klein, Premier Harris 
and other advocates of two tier American style health care.  It 
is no coincidence that Premier Klein waited until the Liberal 
budget came down.  He knows there is no money to back all the 
Liberal talk.  He says “Let us roll up our sleeves and get on 
with two tier medicine”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no coincidence either that the day after the budget the 
Reform Party told Canadian TV viewers—and I quote from the 
finance critic for the Reform Party—“Obviously we are going to 
have to look beyond the money and start to entertain some private 
sector solutions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want American style health care.  They know 
that for profit medicine is not going to answer their needs. 
Premier Klein has offered no proof that private for profit health 
care is any more efficient than public health care.  The Minister 
of Health has refused to stand and take him on, do the right 
thing and stop private for profit health care before it is too 
late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, and all the studies show, that private health care 
typically costs more, provides lower quality services and fewer 
services, reduces accessibility and fairness and drives up the 
public cost in other jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today is about the future of medicare.  It 
is an opportunity for the government to change course and do the 
right thing.  Ever since the budget was delivered Liberals have 
been saying that they know this is not enough.  Did they not know 
that before Monday?  Did they not know there was a crisis?  Why 
did they not act in this budget?  Why are they waiting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us an opportunity to show that medicare could be 
a model for all countries in the new global economy.  After all, 
when we are talking about medical care we are talking about our 
sense of values.  Do we think human life is important?  Do we 
think the best health care which is available is something to 
which people are entitled by virtue of belonging to a civilized 
country?  The answer from Canadians is a resounding yes.  The 
question is:  Why can the Liberals not see it?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member, after taking a careful look at the 
proposals from Ralph Klein—and I hope that the NDP will do the 
same—that his proposals are a far cry from being what they have 
in the United States.  They are not that comparable.  I wish the 
NDP would take a little closer look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the Liberal government was responsible for 
causing this dilemma in the first place.  There is no way that it 
will restore the money that it deliberately took out of health 
care since 1993.  However, government spending is phenomenal in 
so many areas.  If the health minister needs money, the 
government will have to stop some of the silly spending that is 
going on, some that I know the NDP approve of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to do little things for culture and for art, but when 
we get down to the necessities of life, what would she request 
the government do in terms of not spending money?  What areas 
would she like to see cut out in order to provide more money for 
health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would make 
several comments in response to the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first comment has to do with the American style of health 
care referenced by the member.  If anyone has had any indepth 
involvement with people in the United States, they know just how 
precarious the system is and just how many people are left to 
suffer because they do not have access to health care and do not 
have insurance coverage.  It is not uncommon to hear about people 
dying on the operating table because they did not have the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were all shocked when Reformers stood in the House over the 
last couple of years and said things like “I can get better 
health care in Florida than I can get in socialized Canada”.  We 
were shocked when the Leader of the Reform Party, just a month 
ago, stood up in the House and said “We should look at private 
sector investment in health care”.  We were shocked this week 
when the finance critic stood up before Canadians and said “We 
have to look at opening up health care to private sector 
involvement and investment”.  That is not the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also be clear that when it comes to this budget in terms 
of spending, what we really ended up with is a Reform style 
budget with all the focus on tax cuts and very little on the 
priorities of Canadians, the number one priority being health 
care.  What we have in this budget is two cents for every dollar 
in cutbacks, in tax rollbacks from the government.  Is that a 
response? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the provinces want is a commitment from the government to 
restore transfer payments; the money it took out in 1995. The 
provinces are quite prepared, on the basis of that commitment and 
that determination, to get back to a 50:50 partnership, to in 
fact work to strengthen medicare, to restructure medicare and to 
improve medicare.  We have to do it on the basis of a financial 
commitment from the federal government and the political will to 
truly preserve and strengthen medicare. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I agree with some of the things the hon. member said.  I 
certainly agree with the last point about the Reformers and how 
they want an American style two-tier medical system, which is an 
absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, where I do not agree with the hon. member is that we on 
the government side have made a commitment to Canadians that we 
will protect the health care system in Canada because it is an 
underlying value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why the hon. member does not ask her leader, whom I see 
is in the House, the hon. member for Halifax, why in 1997 she 
said we should add an additional $1.5 billion.  In 1998 she said 
we should add another $2.8 billion.  Excuse me, that is not 
nearly enough and we on the government side have added a great 
deal more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their party platform in 1997, the NDP members argued that 
there should be $79 billion additional spent in Canada.  How much 
of that was earmarked for health?  It was 10%.  Now we hear from 
the hon. member opposite all these nice words.  My question to 
her is simple. 
Why does she not put aside this petty politic stuff, and do like 
the Canadian Medical Association and others have said, and get 
all the people together to work on long term solutions?

a question back to the member.  Is two cents on the dollar a true 
commitment for something as fundamental as medicare and universal 
health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cut $6 billion out of transfer payments in 1995. 
That has left a cumulative shortfall of $21 billion.  This budget 
puts back two cents of every dollar in taxes which means that if 
all goes well the government might be up to a 15% share of 
funding for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows full well that the commitment of this party is 
for a 50:50 partnership.  That is what we want to see. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
intend to share my speaking time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by saying that I am delighted to have the 
opportunity to participate in the debate today on a matter of 
prime importance to Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about today, Canada's health care system, 
represents a tangible expression of this nation's shared values. 
It is something that lies very close to the heart of our 
country's sense of self. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that Canadians cherish medicare because to us it 
is about more than just doctors, hospitals and medical treatment. 
It is about the way we want to live.  It is about being part of 
this country.  Canadian medicare is about the promise that we 
make to each other as Canadians, that in times of need we will 
look after each other regardless of wealth or of privilege, and 
so it is a subject of fundamental importance to each of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of the Canada Health Act, the principles on which 
Canadian medicare is built, are as sound today as they were 
decades ago when they were enshrined in federal law.  Their 
soundness derives not just from the social equity, which is 
obvious, but also from the economic advantage that the single 
tier, universal coverage provides to Canadians and Canadian 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again the economic comparative advantage of Canadian 
medicare is demonstrated, and we must never lose sight of that 
fact.  As sound as these principles are and as strong as the 
arguments are for preserving those principles, we have problems 
in practice of which every Canadian is aware.  It is clear that 
the status quo is unacceptable.  It cannot continue.  There are 
people who are waiting too long, waiting hours in the emergency 
ward, waiting months for referral to a specialist, waiting a year 
for a long term bed, waiting what seems an eternity for someone 
to answer the call button in the understaffed hospital ward.  The 
status quo is not on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as we look for answers we must be careful to 
distinguish the real solutions from the false ones.  We must 
resist the siren call of the private parallel system which is not 
the answer. Private for-profit medicine is not the intelligent or 
effective response.  The private parallel provision of medical 
services is less effective, more expensive and, frankly, is 
inconsistent with the basic principles to which this nation is 
committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the answer lies in renewing medicare, in finding new ways 
to provide services of quality to give Canadians and their 
families access to quality care in a timely fashion within the 
principles of medicare, within the principles of the Canada 
Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed? 
I suggest two things are needed:  first, the proper level of 
financing; and second, innovation and change, ideas and hard work 
to bring about the kind of structural changes that are necessary 
to adapt the principles to modern realities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT14"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT14"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in terms of financing let us set the record straight on 
the contribution of the Government of Canada to our medicare 
system.  Public spending on medicare every year approximates $60 
billion.  We transfer to provinces a total of about $40 billion, 
including equalization.  If we subtract the equalization it is 
$30 billion in transfers this coming fiscal year through cash and 
tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking historically at the utilization by provinces, just over 
half of that transfer is devoted to health care, about 54%, 
almost $17 billion.  If we add the $3 billion that Canada spends 
directly for health care services for Canadian forces and 
aboriginal persons, it is over $20 billion.  One-third of total 
public spending on health care in the country every year comes 
from the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be honest about the facts on financing.  Let us tell the 
truth about role of the Government of Canada.  One-third of all 
public funding on health care is contributed by the Government of 
Canada.  The cash portion of that contribution, the cash portion 
of the transfers to the provinces has increased by fully 25% over 
the last two years as a result of the very budget measures that 
party is today attacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said it would take two things to save and strengthen medicare. 
The first is the proper level of financing.  The second is hard 
work with ideas and innovation to make the changes we must make 
so that services are provided and are accessible to Canadians in 
keeping with standards of quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective must not be, as the NDP would seem to suggest, 
simply to make the health care system more expensive by spending 
more.  Our objective must surely be to improve its quality and 
access to services by making the changes needed.  That means 
long-term sustainability.  It means learning from the provinces 
by looking at what they have done to innovate in recent years. It 
means sitting with the provinces, learning from their experiences 
and developing a shared agenda of common priorities, because one 
thing is certain, we will not succeed in this effort unless we 
work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat with provincial ministers and I can say that year 
after year at the end of our meetings we produce a virtually 
identical list of common priorities of what has to happen to 
resolve the issues facing medicare.  I have spoken and written 
about these issues at length in the past.  Today is not the day 
to go into detail about them, but I will say, by way of summary, 
that the provincial priorities for innovation and change, 
priorities that I share, include new ways of delivering primary 
health care, that is to say the first line of family health 
services in communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changing the way the primary health care is delivered is 
fundamental to restoring accessibility to medical services in the 
country.  The second is broadening the availability of home and 
community care to reflect the reality of what happened with the 
downsizing of the hospital sector and the increased reliance on 
care outside hospitals.  Provinces are moving in that direction 
as well.  Many of them have made very significant investments in 
home and community care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has now come to broaden that effort and to weave home 
and community care into medicare as an integral part of health 
services.  In reality it is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is a focus on quality care.  The Canada Health Act 
does not speak of quality or standards of care.  It talks about 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time this spring we will produce a comprehensive 
report on outcuts in the health care system, measuring how it 
performs and with that measurement, which will allow us to manage 
better, we can work toward public discussions of quality in 
health care in Canada using information technology to monitor it, 
to track it and to integrate the various parts of our health care 
system so we can give better service to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has a crucial role to play in all this. 
It is a role of leadership.  It is a role of co-ordination.  It 
is a role of bringing constructive ideas to the table and of 
supporting the provinces in their own efforts to innovate and 
resolve these difficult issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I make no apology for the fact that some weeks ago I put some 
ideas on the table.  I think it is my responsibility to lead a 
national discussion about where we go from here.  The Government 
of Canada will be there throughout to do its part.  I proposed 
meetings in the near future with my provincial counterparts so 
that we can work toward a plan of action, implementing the 
changes that we have all recognized for some time are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now move from resolution to action.  That is what I think 
we must do on behalf of the people of Canada.  If that action 
requires a greater contribution from the government, if it 
requires a long term financial commitment from the government, as 
the Minister of Finance has said and the Prime Minister has 
always said, the Government of Canada will be there to do its 
part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying that the status quo is not acceptable. 
We have to change in order to preserve medicare, to save and 
strengthen its principles.  The choice is not between the status 
quo and a private for profit system of medicare.  That is not the 
choice we face.  The choice is between the status quo, which is 
unacceptable, and a renewed medicare operating within the 
principles of the Canada Health Act to do a better job.  A 
country that had the wit to invent it can surely find the will 
and the ways to preserve it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to address the question of the 
financial contribution of the federal government.  The minister 
and his colleagues have said time and time again over the last 
two days that the cash does not matter.  They have actually tried 
to deflect attention by throwing in everything but the kitchen 
sink in the federal contribution toward health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1993, when the government was in opposition, the Liberals 
criticized the Conservative government for changing the formula 
and said very clearly that it was the cash that matters.  In the 
1997 budget on page 65 the government said that it was the cash 
that counts in terms of program spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question is for the minister.  Why does the cash not 
count today?  Does he not realize that it is the glue that holds 
our health system together?  It is the only way to stop the 
privatization forces under Klein, Harris and the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a second question.  The minister and his colleagues are 
concerned and committed to stopping two tier Americanized private 
health care.  Do they not recognize that by being passive, by 
aiding and abetting Alberta's privatization agenda, as they did 
when they allowed the 12 point agreement on private health 
services to take place, they are part of the problem?   In order 
to truly support and enhance medicare they have to dissociate 
themselves from that position, rescind that agreement and go 
forward, fully supporting the principles of the Canada Health 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Madam Speaker, the cash does matter. 
That is why in each of the last four budgets we have increased 
the cash very significantly, as I mentioned, by 25% over the last 
two years.  The cash does matter and it has increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just the other day the Minister of Finance announced $2.5 
billion which will result in a permanent increase of $500 million 
a year in the cash floor.  That will be $15.5 billion a year in 
the cash transfer to provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address another point the member raised.  She talked 
about the passive role of the Government of Canada.  We do not 
take a passive role.  I reacted immediately to the proposals of 
Mr. Klein by saying that we would look at them very critically. I 
expressed concerns when I wrote to the minister of health of 
Alberta.  We are awaiting the tabling of the legislation later 
today.  We will examine it carefully to determine whether it is 
consistent with the Canada Health Act both in letter and in 
spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have aggressively proposed that ministers meet quickly to 
act, not just speak, on points of common priority in order to 
improve medicare.  I do not think that is passive.  That is the 
Government of Canada fulfilling the role it is intended to serve 
of leadership, co-ordination and working constructively with 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I will say is that I know we cannot succeed if we 
rely on personal attacks. 
I am not speaking now about members opposite.  I am speaking of 
other participants in the debate.  We will not advance this issue 
on the basis of personal attacks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not too long ago that I was in the real world working and 
watching politics as a citizen.  I can recall how disappointed my 
neighbours and I were when we saw politicians engage in personal 
attacks.  It is very dismaying because it signals that they are 
not focusing on the public interest.  They are not at work on 
what will make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to all my colleagues in this debate that we set aside 
personal attacks, that we focus on what Canadians are interested 
in, which is long term solutions to their medicare system, and 
that we work together in a constructive fashion to get those 
changes in place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
health minister invites us to look at what is happening in the 
real world.  In the real world there are growing waiting lists. 
There are crowded emergency rooms.  There are ambulances that 
cannot get into hospitals and are being turned away.  There are 
people who cannot afford the soaring cost of pharmaceuticals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the real world the federal Liberals reduced their previous 
contribution of $18.5 billion down to $12.5 billion.  How could 
the health minister not acknowledge that the government has not 
even restored the level of cash contributions to health care 
spending to what it was when the Liberals took office?  How can 
they, in the real world, pretend that is not so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Madam Speaker, it has increased and we 
are contributing one-third of all public spending; but let me go 
beyond money to the second part of the equation which is the 
changes that are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the New Democratic Party talks about problems in 
emergency rooms.  If she will go there as I have done and speak 
to the people who run hospitals, who run emergency rooms, and ask 
them why, they will give two reasons.  The first reason is that 
family physicians, as hard as they work, cannot be on duty 24 
hours a day.  If we call them when their offices are closed there 
will be a tape machine saying go to emergency.  That way we get 
too many people at the emergency department who ought to be 
served in a different way in another place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is that there are people on stretchers in 
emergency departments waiting for admission to hospital who 
should be upstairs in beds and cannot go there.  The beds 
upstairs are taken by people who should be moved out of hospital 
into home and community care, which does not exist.  If we want 
to resolve the problems with emergency rooms and stop ambulances 
being turned away, we will buy into the agenda of the provincial 
ministers of health, which I support, to change primary care and 
to add home and community care where it is needed across the 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity that today's motion offers to join my 
colleagues to reinforce for all Canadians our government's 
absolute commitment to health care and to present the facts about 
the federal government's contribution to health care in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our priority is clear and concrete.  It is to work through 
partnership with all orders of government and all stakeholders to 
provide Canadians in every region with the health care system 
they need and the health care system they rely upon. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 is based on previous budgets.  It provides for the 
injection of an additional $2.5 billion dollars into the Canada 
transfer for health and social programs in order to help the 
provinces and territories fund health care and post-secondary 
education. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we add this new $2.5 billion to the $11.5 billion CHST 
investment in last year's budget specifically for health care, we 
find that the cash portion of the CHST will reach $15.5 billion 
in the coming year, almost 25% higher than last year.  This is 
the fourth time that the federal government has been able to turn 
better finances into a better quality of life through greater 
support for the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget provides an additional $1 billion in 2000-01 and $500 
million in each of the following three years.  The provinces and 
territories will have the flexibility to draw from the $2.5 
billion that is being added to the CHST as they see fit.  They 
can draw upon it to meet the most pressing needs in hospitals or 
universities or at any time over the course of four years as they 
see fit. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have said that this additional $2.5 billion for the CHST 
transfer is small potatoes.  I cannot agree because $2.5 billion 
is not an insignificant amount of money.  It is even more 
significant when added to the funding increases we made in 
previous years.  As I just said, because of our CHST investments 
in the 1999 and 2000 budgets, in the coming year CHST cash will 
be almost 25% higher than last year.  This is just the CHST cash 
portion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many Canadians forget, because our critics often try to push 
it aside, the fact that federal support for the CHST also 
includes tax points.  Tax points are converted into cash and paid 
to the provinces.  They are the same as cash.  Members opposite 
need to understand that.  When the value of tax points is taken 
into account, total CHST transfers in the coming fiscal year will 
reach $31 billion, a new all time high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada health and social transfer has been fully restored to 
1993-94 levels.  At the same time the federal government's own 
direct program spending is down $4 billion from the levels when 
we first came into office.  This clearly demonstrates our 
commitment to health and the priority we attach to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an abstract issue.  What is a tax point transfer?  As 
hon. opposition members should be aware, it simply means that the 
provinces can collect a portion of the taxes that would otherwise 
go to the federal government.  Put differently, it allows the 
provinces to collect a higher share of taxes while federal 
revenues decrease by the same amount.  Ultimately the individual 
taxpayer still pays the same amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an excellent reason why the provinces accepted these 
tax points and why they hang on to them today.  I have not heard 
the provinces saying that they do not want the tax points.  Why 
is that?  It is because as the economy grows so does the value of 
these points.  While there have been economic ups and downs, each 
of those tax points is worth much more today than when the 
programs they fund were introduced.  In other words, it is a form 
of federal assistance that keeps on giving and keeps on growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear calls for the federal government to hand over 
billions more for health and social programs, we should remember 
that this ignores the fact that provinces enjoy significant 
additional revenues from tax points already in their pockets each 
and every year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The excellent performance of Canada's economy has significantly 
improved the value of the two other main transfers to the 
provinces and the territories. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments to less prosperous provinces, for example, 
are up $500 million for this year over last year's budget 
projection, taking entitlements to $9.8 billion from the $9.3 
billion previously projected.  Territorial formula financing is 
nearly $100 million higher this year than was projected, taking 
entitlements to about $1.4 billion from about $1.3 billion 
previously projected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we combine these major transfer programs, the CHST, 
equalization and territorial formula financing, we see that total 
transfers to the provinces and territories will reach an 
estimated $39.4 billion this year.  This will allow the provinces 
and territories to strengthen health care, post-secondary 
education and other social programs important to Canadians.  The 
provinces can use the equalization payments for health care, 
education or social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to look at federal transfers in terms of 
the contribution to estimated provincial and territorial 
revenues.  I will give just a brief rundown.  In 2000-01 federal 
transfers will account for about 45% of Newfoundland's estimated 
revenues.  The corresponding figures for the other provinces and 
territories are approximately as follows:  40% for P.E.I., 42% 
for Nova Scotia, 37% for New Brunswick, 25% for Quebec, 20% for 
Ontario, 35% of the provincial revenues for Manitoba, 22% for 
Saskatchewan, 17% for Alberta, 20% for British Columbia, 81% for 
the Northwest Territories, 94% for Nunavut, and 71% for Yukon. 
These are significant contributions to the economies and the 
provincial revenues across Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that federal assistance for health care 
does not begin and end with transfers.  For example, almost half 
of the grants from the federally sponsored Canada Foundation for 
Innovation have gone to health research.  It is now a $1.9 
billion foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good health and effective health care are much more than an 
issue of hospitals and clinics.  My colleague the Minister of 
Health has spoken very eloquently today and many times before on 
this subject.  This is why the 1999 budget announced an 
additional investment of $1.4 billion in health information 
systems, research, first nations and Inuit health services and 
health problem prevention. The 1999 budget also provided 
significant funding for a number of other important health 
initiatives like the national health surveillance network, the 
Canada health network and a variety of other initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's commitment to a strong health care system is a 
key priority and the reason that increasing funding for health 
was a central theme in the 1999 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments both federal and provincial recognize the necessity 
of ensuring that Canada's health care system continues to meet 
the needs of its citizens into the future. The federal government 
has invested significant amounts of money in the CHST. However, 
money alone will not solve the long term health care problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the report of the National Forum on Health to the Prime 
Minister not too long ago, it was noted that by international 
standards Canada's health care expenditures appear high among 
industrialized countries.  Only the U.S. spends a higher share of 
its GDP than Canada and we know the reason. A full 30% of health 
care expenditure in the United States has been on administration, 
filling out forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa cannot do it alone.  This is particularly important as 
Canada's baby boomers approach their senior years. This is why 
the federal and provincial health ministers have agreed to meet 
in the spring of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I can speak for all my government colleagues when I say 
that our priority is to help sustain a health care system that 
meets the needs of all Canadians.  This is why we will continue 
to apply the values of partnership and co-operation, values based 
on the recognition that health care is the responsibility of all 
of us. This is a responsibility I am confident will never be 
abandoned by the government and my party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the member 
opposite quoted a figure that is absolutely false.  He talked 
about the international rankings of Canada in terms of health 
care expenditure.  He quoted figures from 1993 when the Liberal 
government took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would like to talk about Canada's 
international ranking in terms of expenditures on medicare today 
in the year 2000. I will mention them in my speech because I do 
not think the member knows what Canada's ranking is today. 
Internationally, where do we stand today in regard to 
expenditures on health care as a per cent of GDP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Madam Speaker, the National Forum on 
Health which was convened a couple of years ago did a vast amount 
of research.  Experts in health care compared our expenditures in 
Canada.  They looked at a variety of issues. They concluded that 
the per capita expenditure on health care in Canada was greater 
than most other countries with the only exception being the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties opposite talk about the health care system in the 
United States.  We all know the problems with accessibility which 
my colleague the Minister of Health and others have quoted. Not 
only are there problems with accessibility but there are the 
administrative costs in the United Sates.  Because it is 
privately funded, many patients in hospitals and clinics end up 
filling out forms ad nauseam because the health care insurers are 
not anxious to pay the claims. 
Fully 30% of the cost of the health care system in the United 
States is administrative costs.

question raised by Reform, it is absolutely clear that this 
country spends— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
How often do you have to stand in this House to be able to be 
recognized?  You only recognize people within three feet of your 
chair.  I am tired of this. This is not the first time this has 
happened.  You only know three members by name in this House and 
those are the only ones you recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  A lot of members are 
interested today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, we have been up at this 
end of the House at least six times.  Now listen this one out. 
You recognize about three people in this House.  You have done it 
for the last three speeches.  Is it not about time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please. First of all it is 
the privilege— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Are you going to recognize the same 
three people over and over and over again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  The truth is we have a point here as well 
and we have the right to bring it to the floor as well. That is 
why we are here.  That is why we are elected.  If you cannot do 
that, let us bring in a Speaker who can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I ask the member to 
please listen to my reply.  That is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  This is not the first time that this 
has happened.  How many times do I have to stand up in this House 
to be recognized?  I have made my point.  The next time, Madam 
Speaker, please give me the sense of fairness to recognize me and 
recognize someone else— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I remind the hon. 
member that it is the privilege of the person who is occupying 
the chair to choose whomever he or she wants to recognize.  Right 
now I have recognized the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am glad to hear 
that the Conservatives are interested in getting involved in this 
debate.  I look forward to hearing what they have to say about 
universal public health care on which they have been particularly 
silent, perhaps given the previous Conservative government's 
record on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help out the Liberal member in response to the Reform 
question, in fact Canada's expenditure in terms of health care as 
a percentage of our wealth is at about 9%.  That is quite a bit 
lower than the 14% or more that is spent in the United States as 
a percentage of wealth.  That is the best reason of all why we 
want to hang on to a public universally accessible health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is simple. We can argue all we want 
about tax points and what the share is but the fact is there is a 
shortfall of $4.2 billion in cash transfers. My question relates 
to the purpose of our motion. Will the government restore the 
cash that it took out of the system in 1995?  Will the government 
commit to an immediate share of 25% and a long term commitment of 
a 50:50 partnership?  Will the government finally live up to its 
seven year old election promise for national home care?  Finally, 
will the government take every measure possible to stop private 
for profit health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member opposite still 
has not got it.  I thought I had made it quite clear that tax 
points are the same as cash.  The hon. member continues to quote 
the cash.  The reality is that the CHST funding has been fully 
restored to 1993-94 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the United States, Americans comment on our system 
and we want to keep it that way.  It is one of the principal 
tenets of the government.  It is one of the principal tenets of 
our party.  Canadians can be guaranteed that our government will 
continue its commitment to health care in Canada.

going to approach the issue of international ranking in the 
middle of my speech today but just so we do not lose some of the 
audience, in 1993 Canada was in second place in international 
ranking.  The member was accurate.  The National Forum on Health 
did quote accurate figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time we have slipped to fifth place in the world. The 
U.S. is still at the top.  We have been passed by Germany,

dropping in terms of international comparison.  For the 
edification of the member across the way, internationally we are 
not in second place any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician, normally I would approach a debate on health 
care with a big smile on my face.  When I came to parliament it 
was an opportunity for me to try to express what it is like to be

much enjoyment that would give me.  I felt I would be able to 
bring some common sense to the debate.

spending on health care.  My Liberal colleagues will leave 
because they do not want to hear this.  I can understand their 
not wanting to listen to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not start from 1993; I will actually start from 1994 when 
it is fair to say that my Liberal colleagues had a responsibility 
for the spending in that year.  In 1993 they had just been 
elected. I will not comment on the previous spending.  In 1993 
boondoggle prone grants and contributions—when I say grants and 
contributions, these are programs that can be misused—totalled 
just under $14 billion.  The expenditures for health from that 
party totalled $7.5 billion.  This is CHST cash for health; I am 
taking out the post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we went along, the Liberals said there were terrible problems 
with the deficit, that they had to drop those important 
expenditures and they dropped them.  The CHST component for 
health plunged from $7.5 billion down to $5.5 billion.  That is 
the CHST cash component for health.  What happened to the 
boondoggle prone grants and contributions component?  It dropped 
a little, from $13.75 billion down to $12.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were the priorities of the election ready Liberal crew. 
Boondoggle prone grants and contributions went as low as $12.5 
billion. The health portion of the CHST went well down below $6 
billion. Is that a messed up priority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the last member did, I am going at this from the financial 
component only.  Let us count the tax points and cash.  Let us 
compare 1993 with today.  Let us do it per capita.  What really 
matters to the Canadian public is how much money we have per 
person for transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993-94 before the cuts took place there was $636 per capita 
on the cash component.  In 1999, the last year we have accurate 
figures for, the cash component was $483 per person in Canada. 
I will use the tax points in the broad figure.  When they started 
there was a total of $28.991 billion in transfers.  It dropped 
down to as low as $25 billion, and this year it is just again 
reaching the point.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interim, what happened to the per capita expenditures? 
Almost $30 billion was spent on foolish expenditures, stupid 
expenditures if I could be so bold as to use a stronger word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grants and contributions were mishandled.  The audit told us 
that.  In the Prime Minister's riding I call them Shawinigan 
shenanigans.  There was a golf course, which was not a high 
priority.  There were sawmill funds.  A special friend of the 
Prime Minister's stepped up and said “We can get you funds”. He 
is being investigated because he is an unregistered lobbyist. 
There were funds for a lit fountain in the Prime Minister's 
riding, instead of emergency care, organ transplants and 
compensation for hepatitis C victims.  We have RCMP 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did this budget do?  It rewarded the minister of HRDC.  It 
gave her more money.  There was no mention of the problem, no 
retreat, no apology to the Canadian public and no commentary to 
the ministers of health for the provinces saying “We think 
grants and contributions are more important than health care”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the role of the finance minister?  He is the overseer of 
the public purse.  We trust him to look at the overall 
expenditures of the government.  We trust him to say that health 
care is a high priority.  We trust that, as soon as funds are 
available, he will put those funds into health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He sets the broad policy by funds available.  What did he do? 
In the next four years there will be $2.5 billion.  What does 
that mean per capita?  It is $83 per capita.  If we only consider 
the health component, it is half of that, or $41.50 per capita 
for health.  That is the figure to which I would like the public 
to pay attention, the per capita expenditures of the federal 
government for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not apples and oranges; this is a specific comparison. 
If we look at 1993 and we look at 2000, we will not be impressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister should lead by example.  When he was on this 
side of the House he said that if there were problems in a 
department there would be no excuses.  There would be no way the 
minister would get out by blaming somebody else.  There would be 
no cover-ups.  The minister would take the responsibility.  His 
responsibility, in my view, would be to remove incompetence from 
his cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that medicare is under stress.  I will go over the 
three big reasons for that.  The debt the country undertook in 
the last 20 or 30 years is robbing us of a lot of money which we 
would normally put toward our social programs.  Interest payments 
on the debt amount to $35 billion or $40 billion a year.  That 
debt is a significant reason our health care system is under 
stress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at our debt paydown and compare it to other 
countries.  Australia was in trouble with its debt.  It looks 
like Australia will have its debt paid down in three years.  If 
the U.S. continues on its track, in 11 to 12 years its debt will 
be paid down.  Where are we in our debt repayment program?  If we 
continue like we are going, our debt will be paid down in 150 
years.  If I delivered babies I would have to be here for six 
generations to see that take place.  That is a significant issue 
for our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other big problems. 
We have an aging population.  The baby boomers who will be coming 
through the system will create a big bulge.  What we are doing 
today is not sustainable and the health minister has finally 
recognized this.  He is saying that the status quo is not good 
enough.  That is a tough thing for a health minister to say, 
because that can raise all kinds of spectres of terrible things 
happening.  The status quo is not good enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I started my practice, organ transplantation was something 
that was done experimentally.  I now see people having such 
things as hip replacements, extending their useful lives for 15 
to 20 years.  Those are very expensive things that were never 
even thought of when I started my practice.  MRIs and ultrasounds 
were experimental.  Now, although they are expensive, they are 
valuable and they do extend people's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an academic discussion.  This is not a financial 
discussion.  This is really and truly a discussion about 
individuals.  I wish we could stop talking about the system and 
start thinking about the patient.  If we could do that I think we 
would have a much better chance of fixing the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future of medicare, frankly, is in doubt.  There are long 
waits, inferior technology, anxiety and brain drain.  Some of our 
finest nurses have left the country.  They were turned away from 
secure jobs because the funding was not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hesitate to go into the finances of this problem because it 
sounds like that is where my interests lie.  That is not where my 
interests lie.  However, I hear comments from the health minister 
which are inaccurate and I want to raise them.  He says that we 
spend $60 billion in Canada on the public component of health 
care.  What he omits to say is that our total expenditure on 
health care is touching on $90 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the concerns of my NDP colleagues who fear 
privatization, who fear the U.S. style of health care.  That is 
not the way to go.  However, they should recognize and accept 
that 30% of our health care dollars in Canada today are private. 
There are many things which are not covered by medicare, such as 
plastic surgery, cosmetic changes and, in some provinces, sex 
changes.  There are new technologies, such as new prostate 
therapies, which are not covered.  Some of them should not be 
covered and maybe some of them should be, but 30% today is 
private. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my colleagues raise the spectre of two tier American style 
health care I ask them only to do one thing:  look at the 
balance of the world, look at Europe, look at Scandinavia, look 
at all of the other industrialized countries and find a country 
other than the U.S. to compare us with.  Compare us in terms of 
private versus public expenditures on health and compare us with 
Europe.  There is no other industrialized country in the world 
that has given the public purse the monopoly on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to the comparison of international expenditures. 
To be accurate, this is 1997.  It is not today.  The latest 
figures are not available to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare Canada in terms of its public spending, taxpayer 
funded spending, on health care.  We are 10th in the world and 
falling.  My colleagues ignore that completely.  Other countries 
are spending more for public health care than Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take France as an example.  France is in third place, 
spending 7.1% of its GDP on the public component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is Canada in private expenditures?  We are in seventh 
place, at 2.8%.  Fifth place overall, 9.2%; tenth place in 
public, 6.4%; seventh place in private. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleagues in the NDP who fear the U.S. style of two 
tier health care, I do not like it, but let us look at the 
innovative changes that have been taking place in Europe.  Look 
at those and ask if there is something we can learn in those 
jurisdictions, because I think we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the response of the provinces to this budget in 
relation to health?  There has been a pretty vigorous 
denunciation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personality conflicts and politics aside, what do the Liberal 
provincial governments in Canada have to say about this budget? 
I can sum it up.  I will sum it up by giving it a thumbs down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it all just about a political battle?  I do not think so.  I 
think that it really and truly is because the provinces are faced 
with dealing with an aging population.  They are faced with 
dealing with a population that is rising in numbers.  They are 
faced with dealing with this new technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the federal health minister's response?  He says 
that money is not the only thing; it is one component, but we 
need physically to go at this with new proposals.  Now there is a 
point on which we can agree:  new proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are his proposals?  He says that we need to have national 
pharmacare and that we need to have national home care.  His 
promise is that, if the provinces will come along, he will fund 
50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not eerily familiar to a promise that was made back in 
the 1960s?  I remember it well.  The federal government said it 
would fund 50% of medicare.  The provinces said “That is a 
pretty good deal.  We will buy into that”.  Then the funds 
started drying up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the provinces enter into any program with a federal 
government which pulled the plug on funding soon thereafter? 
They are not stupid.  They can remember.  I am not surprised that 
the provincial response has been one of great hesitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to talk for a moment about a subject which we might 
say is not exactly covered here.  I am going to talk about 
hepatitis C.  As the previous health critic for our party, I 
fought vigorously for hepatitis C compensation for all victims of 
tainted blood.  I do not get a chance to speak of this daily, as 
I did for a long time, but I want to bring it up today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been one penny in compensation from the promise 
made by the government to hepatitis C victims.  Not one penny has 
gone to them.  It has been two years.  Who is happy?  The lawyers 
are happy.  The lawyers who have been involved in this process 
are real happy because their funds are going up.  The victims' 
funds have not been disbursed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government chose the wrong mechanism.  It chose a legal 
argument, rather than saying that if the regulators had failed it 
had a responsibility and would transfer funds to those poor souls 
who were injured.  It chose a legalistic mechanism.  That 
legalistic mechanism was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget Joey Haché, a young man who came to the 
House.  He stood here and said “I am going to be the Prime 
Minister's conscience”.  He continues to be the Prime Minister's 
conscience.  He rode across the country on a bicycle to raise 
awareness for hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but think, in the order of priorities, what do the 
grants and contributions in the billions of dollars to get 
elected have to do with Joey Haché and the victims of hepatitis 
C?  They have nothing to do with Joey Haché.  I am profoundly 
disappointed that the victims have not been taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on health care is here whether we like it or not. 
There are people who will tell us not to look at anything related 
to private insurance and not to look at anything related to the 
comparison of the most efficient use of resources.  I simply say 
that today in Canada we do not have a one tier system.  Our 
system is at least three tiered.  We have a tier for the average 
Joe, we have a tier for the athletes and the politicians and we 
have a tier for those who are plugged into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who can leave and quickly get services outside 
this country.  That tier is one which I want to capture and keep 
here in Canada.  I want those individuals to feel that they have 
the highest quality of care here in Canada, if the wait is too 
long here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on medicare can turn into a slanging match.  I think 
it is fair to say that there is a fear in Canada of the U.S. 
style of medicare.  That is a fear which I share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at Europe and let us get a Canadian made solution to 
make this program sustainable.  If we do not, we are going to be 
criticized forever.

at this point that I do not appreciate the words that he used 
before nor his conduct, and it is not the first time.  I would

Speaker, I think if you check the record my words were very 
conducive to the language we normally use in the House.  I was 
upset by the fact that this has happened time and time again. 
However, I will get on with the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one simple point I want to make to the member for 
Macleod.  Is there some symbolism here in the sense that the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance was the person 
who shared his speaking time with the Minister of Health?  Does 
that not send us a message? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not get a sense that there is a sort of 
tug of war going on between the Minister of Health and the 
Minister of Finance in terms of who really sets the agenda for 
the health minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying, in a sense, is that a leadership race appears 
to be taking place on the front benches of the government side. 
It also appears that the finance minister is winning this war at 
the expense of the health minister and at the expense of ordinary 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I sit down, I do want to congratulate the member for his 
reference to the hepatitis C victims.  We should be talking about 
that very issue more than what we are today, but I am glad to 
hear the member mention them.  They do need our help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have had lots of time to 
get to know the member who just rose in his place and recognize 
that he has a great interest in the health care system as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be fair to say that there is a tug of war going on. 
There is a leadership battle going on, which is pretty evident to 
anybody in the country who is watching the debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is inappropriate for the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Finance Minister to follow the health minister. 
There is a significant financial component to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there in fact some kind of mini battle going on between the 
finance minister and the health minister with leadership 
aspirations?  It is pretty evident that would be the case.  Would 
it allow health care to be pushed off to the side?  I hope not. I 
cannot imagine anybody wanting to have a political future in the 
country who did not take health care seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I object, however, to the use of figures that are inaccurate.  I 
would debate the parliamentary secretary vigorously on figures 
that are outdated.  I do hope that he will get updated figures 
when he comes into the House.  If I have one objection, it would 
be just that.  Updated figures would be really nice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
member for Macleod beseeched members of the New Democratic Party 
to accept the reality that private spending is now greater as a 
proportion of health care spending in the country than what the 
federal government is spending; in other words, what started out 
as a 50:50 partnership between the federal government and the 
provincial governments has now dropped to below 14%.  The member 
for Macleod is absolutely right when he says that a big part of 
the spending on health care has now been shifted onto the 
shoulders of families who are sick.  It is like a tax on the sick 
and the elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister understands why the New Democratic Party 
will not accept that as reality.  That is as a very unhappy and 
unfortunate outcome of the federal Liberal government's 
withdrawal from its responsibility to adequately fund the health 
care partnership on a 50:50 basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member speaks about how many of these additional expenses 
are paid for privately and that he accepts that. 
Does the member for Macleod accept the recommendations of the 
National Forum on Health which reported to the government prior 
to the 1997 election and urged that pharmacare costs be contained 
and that pharmacare and home care both be moved into place as 
part of the integrated universal public health care system? 
Clearly the government does not accept those recommendations, but 
does the spokesperson for the Reform Party on this issue in 
debate this morning accept it?

answer to a direct question.  No, I do not.  I do not accept the 
fact that we should be moving toward new programs when the 
program that I consider to be the most important is at risk.  I 
would fix medicare before I would branch off into other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is room for specific home care programs.  The specific 
home care programs that I think the federal government should be 
looking at are to take people very quickly from the hospital, 
post-operatively with some of the new operative procedures we 
have, and have them cared for at home.  This makes economic sense 
and it makes people sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I did not ask the NDP to accept the 30% private.  I 
asked them to simply acknowledge the 30% private.  We have a 
complete lack of frankness and openness on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also ask the NDP to find me another country in the world that 
has a greater proportion of public-private or a lesser proportion 
of public-private and then compare them with how we are doing. 
Compare them in terms of waiting lines, technology and brain 
drain.  If we do that we will walk arm in arm as it relates to 
this health care debate rather than having what I consider to be 
a slanging match. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want a frank, open and honest debate and, except the position 
of the NDP that any change in private would be awful, I would 
like to make sure that the debate recognizes that there is 30% 
private today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member for Macleod 
speak about a slanging match.  What we heard in his speech was 
precisely that.  He talked about stupidity, about things 
mishandled and about all the kinds of terms that one would expect 
better from the very people who said that they would bring a 
fresh start to parliament and a new way of doing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the member's protestations to the contrary, he and his 
party are the very ones who would bring Canada to a two-tier 
American style health care system.  Canadians reject this.  They 
reject it out of hand and they reject it for all the right 
reasons.  He can deny and deny this but the reality is that those 
Reformers opposite, those holier-than-thou's, are always on the 
bandwagon of wanting to bring in two-tier American style 
politics.  Even when it comes to the 17% flat tax, their right 
wing soulmates, the Republicans in the United States, the 
evangelist rednecks, have rejected this kind of nonsense.  Yet, 
there they are clinging to it like they so desperately want to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that Canadians see through that nonsense.  They see 
through the Reform's flat tax nonsense.  They see through its 
ridiculous two-tier American style nonsense.  Those people who 
claim they want to bring a fresh start to parliament are the very 
ones who would bring it down.  We on the government side will not 
have any part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is a physician.  I was a medical orderly and put 
myself through university by proudly working as a medical

put aside the petty kind of nonsense that the hon. member 
opposite was slinging around and that we should work together on 
something as fundamental and as important for all Canadians as 
our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simple.  Why does the member not come clean right 
here and now and say that he and his party will put aside the 
petty politics, put aside all that kind of nonsense and work 
together for the appropriate long term solutions that are 
necessary in order to fix the system?  This is an underlying 
value of Canadians and this is something that Canadians want to 
see happen.  Why will he not do that?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure that those who are joining us clearly 
understand the meaning of this motion. At one point, we feared 
that the NDP might get carried away and go for national 
standards, but I am pleased to see that it is not the case. I 
will summarize the motion and ask the NDP leader to pay a great 
deal of attention to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is that this House calls upon the government to stand 
up for the Canadian value of universal public health care by 
announcing within one week of the passage of this motion a 
substantial and sustained increase in cash transfers for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with the beginning. Between 1994 and 2003, the 
period for which data are available, we see—as is often pointed 
out by the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, who is our 
finance critic and who has been holding the fort in a remarkable 
way since the Bloc arrived here—that transfer payments to the 
provinces will been cut by $33 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are listening to us must know that those who are 
telling us about co-operative federalism and who think that a 
federal-provincial conference was held to discuss these issues 
are wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Callously, irresponsibly and without warning, the Liberals, who 
have brought us one of the blackest periods of federalism this 
parliament has ever known, decided unilaterally to cut 
provincial transfer payments.  What happens when $33 billion are 
slashed?  Zeros start showing up on the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the provinces are responsible for 
providing services directly to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention in passing that the Constitution makes it very 
clear that it is not the federal government that provides 
services to the public.  What is the federal government's role? 
My friend the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry knows.  Its 
responsibility is limited to aboriginals—not that they are 
unimportant—and veterans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cut provincial payments by $33 billion and the 
result was to threaten the delivery of services to the consumers 
who need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite a remarkable state of affairs.  Federal-provincial 
diplomacy has reached a point not often seen in recent years. 
All provincial governments, whether New Democratic, Progressive 
Conservative, or Parti Quebecois, are unanimous in their 
conviction that things have to be changed and are demanding that 
the federal government restore transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Quebec has a very advanced health care system, which 
is a very valuable legacy of the quiet revolution.  A few days 
ago, and I am sure the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry will 
recall—Claude Castonguay, who was one of the fathers of the 
health care system and no sovereignist, as everyone knows, 
appeared before the committee studying Bill C-20.  He noted the 
originality of the Quebec health care system and expressed 
concern at the federal government's totally obstinate refusal to 
reinstate transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very specific.  When we speak of transfer payments, 
I want it to be clear for those watching us at home that it can 
mean health care, post-secondary education or income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago at the meeting held in Hull, the Premier of 
Quebec asked for roughly $1 billion per year for health care, 
just for the transfer payments.  We agree, it should be annual. 
On this point, I want to be perfectly clear: this is for Quebec 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1994 and 2003, $33 billion will have been cut.  It was 
initially to be $45 billion, but then a few crumbs were handed 
back.  Of the $33 billion annually for health, the Premier of 
Quebec sought the return of $1 billion for Quebec, at the 
premiers' conference. 
This billion dollars was traditionally split between health and 
the other transfer terms, that is education and income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec minister of health, Pauline Marois, a member of a 
government that is giving Quebecers very good government in the 
national assembly, has shown what these cuts to the transfers 
mean. What does restoring $500 million in health transfer 
payments mean for Quebec? The $500 million we hope to get on an 
annual basis for health represent one quarter of the operating 
budgets of Montreal's hospitals. This is not peanuts. It 
represents half of the budget for all of the CLSCs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CLSCs, as I explained yesterday—I will be brief, but I 
apologize to those members who are hearing this for the second 
time—are an innovative idea in North America. They form a front 
line service available to citizens at each stage of their lives, 
from birth to burial, from perinatal care to home support 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $500 million represents close to half of the budget for all 
of the CLSCs or the total budget for home support services. This 
is where that money is important, and I will get back to this in 
a few moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Life expectancy is longer than ever before. We no longer just 
have seniors, but also older seniors. Quebec society is 
different from the others in that it is ageing faster. If we 
look at the various age groups, we can see that, proportionally 
speaking, Quebec society has more members who are 60 or more. 
Eventually, we will have more people 85 and over than other 
societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example that will clearly show the situation. It 
will take 35 years for the proportion of Quebec's population 
aged 65 or more to go from 12% to 24%. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all intents and purposes 35 years from now one-quarter 
of Quebecers will have reached the 65 and over category. 
It will take the rest of Canada 45 years to get to that point and 
Germany 65 years.  The population of France, our motherland, the 
Republic, will be there in 65 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is not to show how erudite I am but to establish the 
link between the importance of restoring health transfers and 
the urgency of providing care to a changing clientele. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to what we will do with the $500 million and the 
importance of seniors in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sum of $500 million would mean that home support could be 
continued.  We know that Quebec has begun the shift toward 
ambulatory care, the goal of which is to provide services in a 
community setting.  Hospitalization is avoided as much as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that all opposition party members  will agree with me 
that this $500 million we are demanding should be restored.  I 
hope Liberal members will agree as well, but I must admit that 
we are not too optimistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This figure of $500 million is four times the annual budget of 
the Hôpital Sainte-Justine, a children's hospital.  It is three 
times the budget of the Royal Victoria Hospital.  It also 
represents, and this is important, one quarter of the cost of 
pharmacare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot say often enough how pressing this is.  If, as 
parliamentarians, we were to close our eyes and ask ourselves 
what the public wanted most right now, the answer would be more 
federal funding for health.  That is the simple fact of the 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see some Liberal members who seem to be— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Asleep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> My colleague says asleep.  I would have said 
lethargic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want people to understand is that there are structural 
pressures on the system. 
I need to point out to hon. members that $500 million more would 
be required just to keep the system afloat, without any change 
in service delivery, without one single additional person 
receiving one single additional service, if in the year 2000 we 
were to decide that exactly the same services would be delivered 
in 2001.  The natural growth of the system is 4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we say that the number of seniors among the population of 
Quebec will keep increasing, this has a number of implications. 
I have researched this and will share my findings with the hon. 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the parliamentary secretary is joining us.  I trust, and I 
say this in the friendliest way possible, that we will be able 
to count on the hon. member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies.  He is 
my friend and I mean no disrespect, nor am I making any partisan 
remarks. I simply hope that we can count on him, as parliamentary 
secretary, to vote for this motion, since it is votable and that 
he will speak up very loudly to make this government restore the 
transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Quebec Liberals do not speak up in this debate, we will 
have no other choice but to conclude that they are spineless 
creatures, doormats.  But I do not wish to think such a thing, 
because there is still time for them to get hold of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pressures on the system in 1998-99 resulted in 50,000 more people 
left on stretchers in emergency departments than in 1994-95.  It 
will be no different in 2002-03.  That is why more money needs to 
be put back into health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Pauline Marois has said, this does not prevent us from having 
a debate—in fact, she has called a summit on this—and it does not 
prevent us from rethinking the way we are going to deliver 
services.  It is not true, however, that we can afford not to 
restore transfer payments for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to remember that this is our money.  My colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot is going to prompt me with the exact figure 
for the taxes we send to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Thirty-one billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Thirty-one billion dollars yearly.  It is our 
money, after all. This is where we realize that the money we send 
to Ottawa does not serve our best interests.  Because, if we kept 
this $31 billion at the national assembly—and this is one aspect 
of sovereignty, as we know, sovereignty being defined as the 
ability to keep our taxes and to decide our own foreign policy 
and to have one government—not all of it, but a very large part 
of it would be established as transfer payments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of radiation oncology, it is important, because 
it is related to cancer.  In the case of radiation oncology—I 
would ask the member for Québec not to leave; I am not done—the 
need increases dramatically, particularly in the case of people 
over 50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to ask in the House which of my 
colleagues were baby boomers, there would be a lot of people 
casting shadows.  There are a lot of baby boomers, that is 
people between the ages of 46 and 66.  The hon. member here is 
one, and our colleague could manage it if we gave him a chance. 
What I am saying is that new cases of cancer increase annually 
by 3%. This is important and it is not surprising; the baby boomers are 
reaching an age where they will be looking for this type of 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Radiation oncology requires millions and even billions of 
dollars in investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say as an aside that I will be visiting all the 
hospitals in Montreal during the week's break we are about to 
take.  I will meet some 20 organizations to make sure we are all 
in tune, those of us representing Quebecers in this House, and 
that we will come up with a very specific set of claims.  I will 
propose to my caucus a plan for a tour in April or May. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cardiology is not a simple matter either.  People's needs 
increase after the age of 50.  There are more bypasses among 
older people. 
I can mention some eloquent figures: over the past 10 years, 
there has been a 3.6% annual increase in heart surgery—this is 
very important, and we all know people who are concerned by 
this—there has been a 260% increase in balloon angioplasty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to salute our colleague, the Bloc 
Quebecois House leader, and wish him a speedy recovery. We know 
that he is listening to us, and we miss him. He works very hard 
with us and he follows our proceedings from a distance. He also 
shares our indignation about this government, and I offer him, 
on behalf of this House, our best wishes for a full recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On either side of humanity, the situation is not any less 
acceptable. 
In other specialities, a longer life expectancy and a higher 
number of seniors increase current needs and create new ones. 
There is a type of medicine—and I know this very technical aspect 
will be of great interest to my colleagues—that has been 
developed in recent years, in connection with orthopedics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Orthopedics concerns those who have problems with their hips, 
articulations, etc. I know there are many members of this House 
who have problems articulating, but this is not what I am 
referring to. I am talking about those who have problems with 
their legs or their hips. In a society with an increasing number 
of seniors and older seniors, a medical specialty developed, for 
which training is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say it again. 
When there is a demand, as there is from the NDP—the Progressive 
Conservatives will, I think, support the motion, as will the 
Bloc Quebecois, and I hope the Liberals will wake up in time—when 
there is a demand that transfer payments be restored to their 
previous level, it is because large amounts of money are needed 
to keep the health care system running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider what Mrs. Marois said.  She said that the Martin 
budget offered $2.5 billion over four years—is this not 
ridiculous, and I hope the parliamentary secretary is paying 
attention—when, at the premiers' conference, Quebec alone said 
that it needed $1 billion a year.  The provinces are being 
offered $2.5 billion over four years.  Is this not a far cry 
from what the premiers said they needed?  They have three 
reasons for demanding that transfer payments be restored: 
obviously, they need enough money to run the system. 
Pauline Marois reminded us that Quebec's share of this 
$2.5 billion would cover the cost of running the system for only 
three days a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason they are demanding this money is because they 
have to buy new equipment.  Gone are the days when it was 
possible to buy specialized medical equipment for a few thousand 
dollars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of dollars in investment are required.  This is also 
necessary because of the new types of care being developed. 
There are new health-related problems that require funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to express one wish in closing.  I believe we can 
work together in this House, as we have in some other areas, 
shipbuilding for one.  My colleague has shown us it is possible 
not to be partisan, whether we are Liberals, Conservative, Bloc 
Quebecois, Reform or NDP. I believe that the government is going 
to find an extraordinary path of co-operation if it wishes to 
restore the transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling upon it to do so, in the name of our seniors, of 
those in hospital, the staff of the CLSCs, and all those who 
keep the system running but are running out of steam, and not 
because the Government of Quebec has not done its part.  I have 
here a list of the investments by the Government of Quebec in 
the past few years.  It has done a great deal, considering the 
means available to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec can be counted on to do its utmost, and 
I am sure that the next budget by Minister Landry will focus on 
health.  But we will not be able to face up to the challenges to 
our social and health systems if the federal government does not 
put its shoulder to the wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a partisan issue.  The Bloc Quebecois, like all 
other parties here in this House, is going to work along with 
the government, but I beg it to loosen its purse strings and 
restore the transfer payments. 
Our fellow citizens are begging for this.  It is the 
government's primary responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague opposite 
who I know has a great interest in health care.  He sits on the 
health committee and contributes in a very positive and 
meaningful way most of the time.  Unfortunately that is not so 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today he is talking a bit about all kinds of outrageous things 
in terms of what the federal government is doing.  Quite frankly 
he is wrong.  What we are doing is putting aside the kind of 
money that is necessary, certainly in the short term.  More 
important, and this goes exactly to the heart of where the debate 
is going, we need to bring all provincial and territorial 
partners to the meeting in May with the federal health minister 
to start looking at a long term solution with long term 
objectives and at a focus in terms of where we want to go with 
our health care system.  It is not always about throwing money at 
the problem.  It is about how do things better, differently, and 
innovatively, given the technology and change in circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. gentleman commit today to working closely with the 
federal government to ensure that Madam Marois and the people of 
Quebec who want to work closely will do the same in a positive 
and meaningful way?  I remind him that not so long ago the 
Canadian Medical Association said that it was time for us to put 
aside petty politics.  It is time for us to get beyond the 
partisanship.  Health care is way too important for Canadians 
wherever they live in this great and fantastic country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the hon. member commit today to working hard and 
effectively to try to bring about the kind of long term solutions 
that are necessary for Quebecers and all other Canadians?  After 
all, this is a Canadian issue.  It goes to the very heart and 
soul of what it means to be a Canadian.  It is an underlying 
value that we cherish, respect and want to improve on every 
chance we get.  I know the hon. gentleman has no choice but to 
agree with everything I said. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot take any more questions, 
because I have to go to a committee meeting, but I will answer 
this one with particular care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the hon. member who just spoke—he is a friend of mine, in 
spite of the fact that he sometimes gets upset at me—is the chair 
of the Standing Committee on Health. He is the one person in 
this House who is in the best position to convince the federal 
government to restore transfer payments. I would like him to 
stand in his place and give us, in the respect of his oath of 
office, if that oath means anything, a single instance where the 
Quebec Minister of Health did not co-operate with the Canadian 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know full well that the Quebec government used up all its 
health resources. The problem is that the money is in Ottawa, 
but the needs are in Quebec. This is the problem with the 
political system in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the hon. member's duty? As a member from Ontario, his 
duty is to put pressure on the federal government so that fiscal 
justice can be achieved and transfer payments restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is done in the next budget, all the members of the 
National Assembly will be grateful to the hon. member. Finance 
minister Bernard Landry will solemnly rise and say “We have 
$500 million extra for health, and it is coming from Ottawa. 
This is no handout, it is our taxes”. In fact, it is our taxes 
now but, unfortunately, we are not getting what we should be 
getting out of the $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parti Quebecois government at the national assembly always 
co-operated when the situation warranted it. The issue is one of 
finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, as I said and as the Quebec minister of health has 
said, this does not mean we cannot have a collective thinking 
process on how to structure health care. Some people question 
the regional management structure, while others wonder about 
certain types of care. The Quebec government is ready to 
participate in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member to do the right thing—he should not 
leave, because I am not finished—and put pressure on the federal 
government to restore transfer payments for health. This is the 
way to go if this government wants to have some credibility with 
the provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to continue the discussion 
about health with the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was perhaps not here this morning, or perhaps he followed the 
debate from outside the House, as we all do occasionally— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The 
member, my former union president, was elected in 1997.  He is 
well aware that he may not refer to the absence or presence of 
members in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is quite 
correct, but the Chair was here earlier and in the Chair's 
opinion if a member can dish it out the member also has to be 
able to take it.  It is not a one way street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the comments of the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve he very 
obliquely mentioned absence or presence and since both were made 
in a spirit of friendly debate I chose to ignore it.  The member 
for Frontenac—Mégantic is quite correct.  If I am going to apply 
the rules I would apply them impartially and that would have 
caused me to interrupt the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for noting that 
if you had enforced the standing orders, you would have had to 
interrupt the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve earlier.  Thank 
you for this clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the debate began the Minister of Health gave an overview 
of the amounts transferred to the provinces, to Quebec and the 
other provinces.  We will not repeat all the figures he 
mentioned, which are public knowledge, but transfers are now up 
to an unprecedented high of $31 billion, if cash transfers and 
tax points are taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These transfers have increased by 25% in the last two years. 
These are substantial increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the Minister of Health also offered to work at 
getting funding increased but said that the government would be 
working on putting new ideas together for renewing the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to point out that this is pretty much how Mr. Landry, 
Quebec's minister of finance, sees things.

This is money transferred by the federal government.  We left 
it in Toronto because we have to discuss in Quebec how we are 
going to use this money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Marois, his colleague, said “I have no time to keep up with 
what is happening in finance.  I am looking after health”.  Mr. 
Landry said yesterday and today “This requires some thought”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is reiterating remarks by the Arpin commission report 
released last September.  He is repeating thoughts of the former 
minister of health, Mr. Castonguay. 
He is reiterating the comments by Mr. Dutil, the head of the 
federation of general practitioners, who said it will take some 
thought and an attempt to find new ways to organize health care 
services rather than just having money thrown around here and 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the people of the Bloc say that Ottawa has the money and 
the provinces have the needs, I would like to point out that 
right now over $800 million intended to meet the needs of Quebec 
is sitting in Toronto.

that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would caution our colleague from 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies against overly simplistic reasoning, 
which has a tendency to cloud the basic issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in Quebec, not its minister of finance, not the Bloc 
Quebecois members, not the Minister of Health, wishes to see 
another debate on the reorganization of health services, and the 
hon. member is well aware of this. As for what our colleague has 
said about the supposedly dormant funds, I wish to repeat what 
the Quebec minister of finance has already stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has made a considerable effort, through careful use of 
its surplus in an extremely difficult exercise of managing 
public funds.  It kept these monies in trust as a contingency 
reserve fund, reminding us that next year's demand on the health 
system will be around 13.5% higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lesson that needs to be taken from this is that the 
Government of Quebec has allocated a very considerable amount of 
resources to operating and maintaining the Quebec health system, 
and that the amounts it can fund independently are insufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking for some honesty from the hon. member.  At the time 
of the budget speech, I met a former minister of this House, 
Brian Tobin, in the lobby.  How is it that all provinces, 
regardless of political allegiance, even if they are represented 
by former federal Liberals, are demanding restoration of the 
transfer payments of the federal government?  Is the hon. member 
not a bit rattled by seeing such a common front as is rarely 
seen in federal-provincial diplomacy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appealing to the good faith and good will of the hon. 
member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is no question about it that health care is in a 
crisis in this country.  There are two reasons for it:  one man 
and one party, that man being the Prime Minister of Canada and 
that party being the Liberal Party of Canada, aided and abetted 
by two others, the Minister of Finance who is the real health 
minister and the Minister of Health who is a secondary player in 
this equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget the Liberal Party, the Government of Canada, brought 
down the other day is basically an insult to the intelligence of 
every living, breathing Canadian.  If we take a look what the 
government is putting back into health care, the numbers speak 
for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every premier in the country, regardless of political stripe, 
has just simply told us that the money this government puts back 
into the system over the course of the next four years will run 
the system for three days.  In the province that runs it the 
money put back into the system would amount to about $15 million 
this year.  In a small province like New Brunswick with only 
slightly over 700,000 people that will run the system for three 
days.  At $5 million a day, in three days that money is used up. 
That tells us how much the government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What amazes me in this debate is that it has been the 
Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance who has been on 
his feet this morning more than anyone else. 
It is quite obvious that the finance minister is speaking on this 
issue.  He is the one who is setting the tone for the government. 
He is the one who is calling the shots.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it is a leadership game being played out within 
the Liberal caucus. On the front benches of the Liberal Party 
that debate is being carried out between the health minister and 
the finance minister.  That leadership race is being carried out 
at the expense of every single Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they are on their feet it is always with patronizing 
platitudes.  They do not talk about the real issues.  They do not 
talk about the crisis.  They try to comfort it in a sense. 
Basically what they said this morning was, “We are going to look 
for some long term common goals.  We are going to talk about 
innovative, co-operative kinds of ideas that might lead us down 
the road in the right direction”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are tired of that.  The Liberals have been in office for 
seven years.  If they were serious about fixing Canada's health 
care system they would have started on the day they were elected 
back in 1993.  But what did they do?  By themselves they 
systematically and intentionally took $17 billion out of the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite it being the so-called health budget last year, at the 
end of four years we are going back to the same levels of funding 
for health care that we had in the early 1990s. Right now we are 
10 years behind the times.  Let us look at some of the 
statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I should also point out that I am splitting my time 
with the member for Shefford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are shortages of nurses, shortages of beds and shortages 
of doctors.  There is a shortage of pathologists.  That is 
important because pathology is at the root of diagnostic 
medicine. We have to know what is wrong with us before we can be 
treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is factual, right out of the Library of Parliament.  I 
issued a report on this.  In 1993 there were 1,200 pathologists 
in this country and as I speak the number is down to 1,000.  In 
the meantime the Canadian population has grown.  It is an aging 
population.  There are fewer people to diagnose what is wrong 
with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it was yesterday that the president of the United 
States mentioned that over 50,000 Americans are dying because of 
the wrong diagnosis.  The same thing is happening in Canada. 
Unfortunately we have not commissioned a study but that is just 
an indication of how bad the system is. There is only one party 
to blame.  There is only one Prime Minister to blame.  That is 
today's Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk as they may, the Liberals cannot get out from underneath 
the problem.  They messed up. They are very reluctant to admit it 
and even more reluctant to do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the premier of Ontario had to say about our present 
health minister.  I am quoting Mike Harris out of the Ottawa 
<I>Sun</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with Mr. Rock three years ago at the first ministers 
conference.  He thought after three minutes of being health 
minister he was smarter than every other premier, every other 
minister of health, every other department of health, the OMA, 
the nurses' association, said Harris. But he has no ideas, no 
initiatives.  He's given us nothing.  Now it seems like he's 
convinced the Prime Minister and Paul Martin that he has a secret 
plan to miraculously deliver better health care for fewer 
dollars. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he has a plan, would he please tell us what it is?  Tell us 
what it is.  The Liberals do not have a plan.  They have no 
ideas.  Day to day they stumble along making it up as they go 
along.  That is exactly what the Canadian Medical Association has 
been saying for seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to know where we are going.  We have to know where the 
funding is and how much is going to be there at the end of the 
day.  We cannot continue on these one and two year ad hoc 
programs in terms of funding and direction.  That is exactly what 
the Liberals have been doing. 
Exactly what the Liberals have been doing is making it up as they 
go along with no long term plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not too many weeks ago on the CBC news show <I>The Magazine</I> 
many of us saw the program on health care in Canada and cancer 
patients.  The government is what we would call penny wise and 
pound foolish.  Think of it. We are sending cancer patients, 
women with breast cancer, men with prostate cancer, people with 
other forms of cancer from Ontario to Cleveland in the United 
States of America for treatment.  Where it becomes so bizarre it 
is almost hard to believe is that the treatment in the United 
States costs something in the order of $20,000 per patient.  In 
Canada we could do the same treatment for $3,000 a patient.  Why 
can we not do it?  It is simply because of the draconian cutbacks 
that have been systematic and ongoing for seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Penny wise and pound foolish; the Liberals are living examples 
of that.  How they can stand on their hind legs in this place and 
support that budget is beyond my belief.  This is a debate that 
has to happen, should happen and has to be ongoing. The Liberals 
have absolutely nothing to brag about in that budget, 
particularly on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting into the finances of the budget, everything is three or 
four years down the road.  The hidden message is “Vote for us 
and in four or five years you might get a tax break if we are 
still in office”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way to run a country.  It is not the way to run 
a health care system.  There are 10 premiers that back me up on 
that statement.  Every premier including the Liberal premier of 
Newfoundland says that our system is broken and is going to 
disappear unless the federal government does something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are in the driver's seat. It is their 
constitutional responsibility to fix health care. They set the 
rules.  They have to work with the provinces to make sure that we 
sustain the best system in the world.  That best system in the 
world has been eroding for the last seven years.  It is the 
number one issue on the minds of every Canadian. Canadians know 
our system is disappearing before their very eyes. It is time we 
took the Liberals to task for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It starts and stops right at the feet of the Prime Minister. The 
buck stops there.  He has to take his duties seriously.  He has 
to give some direction to the finance minister and the health 
minister.  They had better stop playing those childish leadership 
games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one or two weeks it will be pretty obvious to the national 
press when they sort this stuff out that it is playing out 
exactly as I say it and as we see it.  It is one minister versus 
the other to become the leader of the Liberal Party, one at the 
expense of the other.  At the end of the day, every one of us is 
paying the cost in terms of health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the member from the Progressive Conservative Party for 
his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made reference to the many people in the province of Ontario 
who have had to go to Cleveland to seek some kind of medical 
care.  I take it from his comments that he condemned that and he 
thinks that is a bad thing.  I concur with him on that. I remind 
him that it was the NDP health minister who refused to allow that 
company to move into Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a non-partisan issue, an issue that goes to the heart of 
what Canadians believe the health care system should be.  We have 
learned many things from different experiments in different 
provinces in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member as equally offended by the fact that in the 
province of Ontario not for profit organizations like the 
Victorian Order of Nurses have been driven out of the health care 
service system so that private companies can contract that 
service from the government?  I would like him to comment on that 
practice in the province of Ontario.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member's 
question. The point we are all trying to make in the House today 
is that the federal government is forcing the provinces to take 
extraordinary measures to deliver primary care.  I believe the 
NDP health critic has spelled this out herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the difficulties is that the provinces deliver primary 
care but the federal government basically sets the rules and 
tells them how much money they are going to get to deliver the 
care.  No premier is going to deny any citizen the care that he 
or she deserves.  The federal government is forcing the provinces 
into a corner to do the very thing they do not want to do. Mike 
Harris and Premier Klein say they do not want to do this. The 
Liberals want to pretend they invented health care. When health 
care was invented in this country it was a 50:50 equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You had better come to Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I am touching a 
sensitive nerve because one man is going absolutely ballistic. He 
is going ballistic because he knows I am telling the truth.  They 
are the ones who have taken away the funding.  He is going 
ballistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> You should be extricated from the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, please identify that 
member by name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
New Brunswick Southwest has a way of bringing out the best in 
people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on some 
of the statements made by the member for New Brunswick Southwest. 
He talked about Mike Harris. Mike Harris made some choices. He 
said his priority was tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year our government put $11.5 billion into health care and 
this year we are putting in another $2.5 billion. We hear about 
the investments the Ontario government has made in health care. 
They are one time severances.  They are one time restructuring 
costs because the health care system has been gutted.  The Harris 
government laid off 10,000 nurses and a couple of years later 
hired them back on.  I guess that is why the Harris government 
has to increase the budget of the health care ministry in the 
province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am staggered and I am sure the hon. member if he were candid 
would also be staggered by the way the health care system is 
used.  There are people at different levels of the health care 
system and they are not really at the appropriate level.  If we 
could move people from acute care hospital beds to a lower cost 
delivery system, it would save the health care system millions of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make one final point.  Let it be clear that once 
the health minister has sat down with his colleagues, we are also 
prepared to come to the table with more cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it has taken the Liberals 
seven years to figure out that they have to work co-operatively 
with the provinces. This is an indication of how poor they are in 
terms of management of health care issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who but a Liberal could use those figures and get away with it? 
They brag about putting $11.5 billion back into health care. 
This is true. But the member conveniently forgets that the 
government took $17.5 billion out of the system.  With the money 
that is going in this year and the money that went in last year, 
we are going to be back to levels that we enjoyed 10 years ago. 
In the meantime, the population is aging and the population is 
growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Our own program spending is down $1 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just cannot believe the 
hypocrisy of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The other day it was ruled that hypocrisy was unparliamentary.  I 
would ask the hon. member to withdraw and while he is at it, he 
should remember that Mike Harris is nothing more than a two tier 
health care lover and so are they. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have been around 
the circle on hypocrisy a number of times.  I will go around the 
circle once more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a member refers to another member as a hypocrite, that is not 
parliamentary. If another member says that the minister was 
hypocritical, that is not parliamentary.

opinion unparliamentary.  It is the form and the context of the 
use of the word.  The word hypocritical has meaning.  It is a 
perfectly good word in the English language.  We do not want 
words to be used to directly attack another member.  The most 
innocuous of words can be unparliamentary if they are used in an 
unparliamentary fashion.

seconds to get everybody excited for the next speaker.

<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to 
congratulate the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest for his 
excellent speech. Like him, I support the motion tabled by the 
NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do, however, have some reservations about the second part of 
that motion, which deals with private hospitals. At this point I 
cannot totally reject this idea, since I have not yet looked at 
the pros and cons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, all Canadians are concerned about the current health 
care situation in the country, because no one knows when he or 
she will need such care, and the situation is getting 
increasingly worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care system is in terrible shape and it continues to 
deteriorate quickly, because of this government's complicity. 
Indeed, let us not forget that the problem began when the 
government eliminated transfer payments for health, in 1994. In 
addition to this mess, the government is ignoring the provinces' 
cry for help. It is as if the government thinks it is the sole 
keeper of the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this week's budget, the Minister of Finance boasted about 
allocating an additional $2.5 billion to the Canada health and 
social transfer, to help the provinces and territories fund 
post-secondary education and health care. 
That is pitiful.  The minister is trying to cover a huge open 
sore with a bandaid.  This government has once again refused to 
return the cash portion of the Canada health and social transfer 
to the 1993-94 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A single payment of unused funds does nothing for the long term 
stability so vital to our health care system.  The funding under 
the Canada health and social transfer must be returned to the 
1993-94 level.  Right now there is a shortfall of over $4 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate the effect of this underfunding I will use Quebec 
as an example.  How will the fine gift from the federal 
government be used?  Of the $2.5 billion offered on a silver 
platter, Quebec expects to receive one quarter of these 
transfers, $600 million, which it may get in four annual parts 
of $150 million. 
Half of this amount will go to the health care network, while 
the other half, $75 million, will go to education and income 
security.  I simply want to point out to the government that $75 
million does not go a long way in the health care network in 
Quebec or anywhere else in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This money represents, according to minister Pauline Marois, 
three days' worth of activity in the network.  This is 
practically nothing.  Quebec's health care budget is worth $13 
billion and increases by $500 million annually due to population 
aging.  I am giving the example of Quebec here but in the field 
of health care the situation is similar across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is not making a real commitment to 
health care.  The measures announced are stop gap ones.  His 
$2.5 billion increase does not fix the problems his government 
has caused.  This is why we have to get back to the base figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's health care system is deteriorating because of the 
Chrétien government's unilateral decision to slash cash 
transfers to the provinces by $17 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want from the government is long term enrichment of the 
CHST cash transfer floor.  This, in my view, is the only way to 
get the health care system back on track.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has long been demanding that 
health care funding be restored to pre-cut levels, which is the 
core idea behind the NDP motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our task force on poverty, and during the consultations we 
held in various Canadian cities last spring and summer, I 
listened to many Canadians who are living in poverty or who work 
with people living in poverty.  These people are suffering 
terribly and will suffer even more with an outmoded health 
system that is unable to respond to real needs. Once again, 
those who are worst off will likely be the hardest hit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is not going to disappear tomorrow, and those who are 
already disadvantaged have greater health care needs.  Their 
precarious existence means that their diet is poor.  They are 
therefore vulnerable to all sorts of illnesses.  And because 
they are ill, they must take medication.  Too often, 
unfortunately, they cannot afford it.  It is a vicious cycle: 
greater needs and fewer services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is the same for the homeless, who are often coping 
with mental health problems.  The result of health cuts is that 
they can no longer remain in institutions and end up on the 
street.  They are unable to look after themselves properly and 
their conditions therefore worsen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there is an organization called La maison 
arc-en-ciel that helps these people re-enter society. However, as 
a result of the cuts there is no longer enough money to reach 
full efficiency. As a result the poor are penalised because of 
this government's inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the aging population in Quebec costs an 
extra $500 million a year and the situation is the same nation 
wide. The needs of this category of citizens will increase 
constantly. It is therefore imperative to get more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for this government to help the provinces and 
the territories. The government must increase health transfer 
payments substantially and consistently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister acknowledged the need to invest more money 
in the health system. However, his government refuses to 
increase payments to provinces. 
It wants to have its say on the issue before increasing its 
contributions. Once more,  this government wants to centralize 
and control. When will it understand that this is an 
encroachment and that provinces are opposed to that. What we are 
witnessing is the emergence of an unhealthy federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A professor at the University of Ottawa, who returned from 
Belgium yesterday, mentioned that in Brussels 10 patients who had 
been on a waiting list for quite a while were called in for their 
surgery. Of the 10, 9 had already died and the only survivor had 
moved to another country. Is that the kind of health care this 
government wants for our country? It seems we are heading very 
rapidly in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I reiterate my support for the NDP motion and I urge 
the government to act immediately. Our health system is sick. 
Is the government going to wait until the system gets terminally 
ill? It must act now; it is urgent.

would like to ask my colleague from Shefford to comment on the 
fact that about 18 months ago, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs said that it was necessary to make Quebec starve. Of 
course, while starving Quebec, he and his government also have 
also starved all of the provinces, with the result that they now 
form a united front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seldom seen such unanimity on the part of all the 
premiers on any subject. They have urgently demanded a meeting 
with the Prime Minister to have transfers restored to what they 
were before the government cuts of 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague from Shefford to tell us if she senses 
a relationship between the desire to starve Quebec and the fact 
that the drastic if not savage cuts to health are making all 
Canadians suffer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques:</B> Madam Speaker, yes, I believe that by 
his statements, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is 
carrying on the strategy of provocation used during the last 30 
years by the government to get its way. It uses provocation 
tactics against Quebec, it tries to find solutions, but in the 
end it does not find any, which is detrimental not only to Quebec 
but to the whole of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government should listen to what the needs are. I 
do not know if it is whether it has difficulty understanding. If 
businesses did not listen to what the needs of their customers 
were, they would go bankrupt. 
We have a government that is not listening to what the people's 
needs are and that is continuing to manage the country's affairs 
as it pleases, that is by invading provincial jurisdictions. 
Ultimately, this leads nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that after listening to the comments made by all the 
members the government will finally understand that the situation 
is critical and that it must take action immediately.

Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of my 
colleague.  There was one area I was not clear on and it may have 
been something I missed in the translation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member indicated that she would be prepared to support the 
motion but that she had some concerns with the last portion of 
our motion.  As I read that, it is that the government take the 
necessary steps to prohibit private for profit hospitals and stop 
the growth of private for profit health care in Canada.  I just 
wonder if she as a member of the Conservative Party could 
elaborate on what aspects of that she has some trouble with me. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques:</B> Madam Speaker, yes, it is true there is 
a part of the motion I do not immediately accept. I do not think 
we can simply suggest that privatization be rejected without 
further study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often decisions are made without thorough consideration. We say 
we dismiss this issue because it cannot be done. However, have 
some studies been done? Have we thoroughly considered the issue? 
This is often a problem with governments; they implement 
programs, but never examine their impact. Finally, at the end of 
the program, they come to the conclusion that it did not work. 
We have no system to assess its impact during or even before its 
implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, I am not willing to dismiss a private system out 
of hand, because it has not been thoroughly examined. We must 
examine the issue and, if we realize this is not really the 
solution, then we can dismiss it. But if we do not thoroughly 
know the issue, we can say we should simply examine it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is an honour and pleasure for me to rise today in the House of 
Commons to speak to the motion introduced in the House by the New 
Democratic Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proud legacy of this party is that of Tommy Douglas who 
brought into the country in Saskatchewan the first medicare 
system amid great opposition.  It has been mentioned today by the 
member for Winnipeg North that he spoke about it at the time and 
said that we should never ever forget that once this system was 
introduced it would continue to be under attack.  There will 
always be those waiting in the shadows who see money to be made 
in the health care system regardless of what it means for the 
health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with another member of the New 
Democratic Party.  I know the Minister of Health would love to 
take 10 more minutes to try to clarify some of the muddy waters 
we have heard about already today, but I will be sharing my time 
with a member of my party who will be speaking to protect our 
health care or medicare system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the history of this place is written, I think historians 
will look back on budget 2000 introduced by the government and 
its effect on health care and say that it was a watershed budget, 
that it was a turning point in the history of the Liberal Party 
and Liberal ideology.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not long ago that the Liberal Party once saw a role for 
government in the lives of Canadians.  That should not surprise 
to anyone because that is the attitude of Canadians; that is the 
ideology and culture of this country.  That is why we had such 
proud institutions, such as the CBC and passenger rail services, 
as a notion that there should be a good standard of living for 
all Canadians and, more than anything, there should be protection 
of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member 
for Winnipeg—Transcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ideology in the country was that no matter where we lived, 
whether it was in the east, the centre, the north or the west, we 
would be entitled to quality health care and equal health care. 
This is what made Canadians proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last five to seven years the government has chipped 
away at those values.  It has chipped away at the cultural 
institutions.  It has chipped away at the notion of regional 
economic expansion.  It has chipped away at some of the ideas of 
the founders of the Liberal Party, people like Monique Bégin and 
social scientists like Tom Kent.  People who once had a role to 
play in that party do not anymore. Regrettably, the Canadian 
public tolerated that because we were told there was deficit.  We 
were told that we had to sacrifice many things on the altar of 
deficit reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Minister of Finance began talking about how many 
surpluses he had and that budget after budget after budget 
resulted in a surplus.  That is why I say this budget introduced 
this year marks a profound turning point in this country.  The 
paltry sum of money allocated to protect health care in the 
country in a time of surplus means that the government has 
decided to support or allow the beginnings of a two-tier health 
care system.  I predict it is something that Canadians will not 
allow to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal funding to the provinces was once a real 
partnership.  Today the Minister of Health and his parliamentary 
secretary talked about convening a meeting of ministers to work 
in partnership.  The federal government has lost much of its 
moral authority to influence the way those policies will develop 
because of the reduction in spending.  A partnership where the 
federal government pays 15 cents of every dollar to health care 
is, what we would call in the business community, a minority 
shareholder position.  It is not in a position to influence the 
real direction of where health care will go.  If it is not in a 
position to do that then it has abandoned the leadership role 
that is so necessary and that should be exercised by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer payments to the provinces have been cut and cut and 
cut.  In 1993 the cash transfers to the provinces were $18.8 
billion.  The explanation for that was that the government had to 
fight a deficit.  However, it has not been restored to the 
previous spending levels nor will it be restored.  There is also 
no projection for its restoration to the same level of funding, 
at least not as far as the government's figures show and not as 
far as the government can foresee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we know is that the federal government has relinquished its 
leadership role and cut its funding to the provinces by about $4 
billion or $5 billion from where it was in 1993.  How have 
Canadians reacted?  From every part of the country and from every 
political leader in the country there has been condemnation.  The 
British Columbia minister of finance said “I must also say that 
the federal finance minister falls far short of the need for 
funding quality health care and education which British 
Columbians have told me is their top spending priority”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Manitoba Nurses Union said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget didn't go nearly far enough.  Ninety million dollars 
is enough to keep the doors open (on health care) and not much 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's not really sufficient.  It is a one-time grant and there is 
no commitment for long-term federal funding, and without that I 
don't know how we will protect medicare. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not partisan statements.  This is not a member of the 
House attacking the government for political reasons.  This is 
someone who works in the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that he will meet with the partners in health 
care.  Let us see what they are saying, and they are from every 
political stripe.  From my own province of Nova Scotia, Premier 
John Hamm said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the provinces were expecting the “full meal deal” on health 
care....  Instead, we got crumbs. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province, where we face a deficit of close to $500 
million, the premier said that we needed a specific amount for 
health care and we did not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP finance critic in the opposition party in Nova Scotia 
called the budget a betrayal of Nova Scotians and suggested that 
it may work in provinces where there is a robust economy but not 
in the have-not provinces in the country.  That is where the 
federal leadership is falling down.  That is the betrayal to the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal leader, a former parliamentary secretary to the 
minister of health, Russell MacLellan, said that the $2.5 billion 
transfer increase was woefully inadequate and would accentuate 
real problems in health care in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Tobin, another Liberal, the only sitting Liberal premier 
left in the country, said that this was woefully inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on and on.  It is not just the New Democratic 
Party saying that there is a problem here.  This transcends 
political partisanship.  I will be watching very carefully to see 
how the Liberal members of parliament, the ones from the 
provinces where their own provincial leaders have condemned this 
budget in terms of health care, vote.  I am sure their 
constituents will also be be watching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the leader of the New Democratic Party said today, the motion 
has been particularly crafted so that every member of the House 
who believes in a publicly funded medicare system can show their 
support to Canadians for that.  It calls for three things, things 
that the Minister of Health has said here today and has 
recognized need to be incorporated in health care funding.  It 
calls for more funding.  I think the Minister of Health said in 
his own statement that we needed more funding.  He said that it 
needed some ideas, and we have not diminished that.  There is 
nothing in this resolution that says we are not open to new 
ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it says is that there will be “a substantial and sustained 
increase in cash transfers” to the provinces, which the Minister 
of Health has said he is prepared to look at.  It further states 
“by taking the steps necessary to prohibit private for-profit 
hospitals and to stop the growth of private for-profit health 
services in Canada”.  The Minister of Health has said that he is 
not favour of that either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that this resolution does not in any way 
contradict what the Minister of Health says he wants to do, I 
will be hoping and watching to see him stand in favour of the 
motion when it comes to the vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member talked about how the other provincial governments 
and leaders dealt with the budget just tabled in the House and 
with the inadequate amount of dollars that flowed from that 
budget to the health care system.  Could the hon. member just 
expand on that a little bit more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now told that the Minister of Health and the Minister of 
Finance have said in some news reports that, eureka, there may 
well be some more dollars available that they will put into 
health care if and when the health ministers sit down with them 
and talk about the system and how they will put those into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have an awful lot of confidence in the 
co-operative federalism that has been demonstrated by the 
government previously and on other issues more so than health 
care?   Does he believe that the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of Health will negotiate in good faith? If they were, 
then why were those dollars not mentioned prior to the budget 
being formulated?  All of a sudden they are backtracking a bit 
and saying “Of course, there is more money there if in fact we 
can negotiate the way that should be distributed”. Would the 
hon. member please like to expand on that topic just a bit?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do think there will 
be more money forthcoming to health care but not because it is in 
the works now.  I think it is because of the reaction that the 
Canadian public had to this budget.  I might also say that it is 
because of the opposition, led by this party in the House of 
Commons, that there is a wave beginning.  The government has 
recognized that and is now saying “Yes, there will be more money 
for health care”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for the provinces to do any kind of long term planning, 
the extra money should have been announced on the day of the 
budget.  I honestly do not understand why a sitting government 
would not say that it was going to do that and that <I>x</I> 
amount of dollars would be allotted for that.  If it is there, 
surely Canadians should know about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of co-operative federalism, I hope that the 
health ministers, the premiers and the federal ministers can put 
aside differences to ensure that this most important program for 
Canadians—I think the most important program in the country—is 
protected and preserved.  I hope those things will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why it has taken so long to pull everyone 
together.  I have only been in the House for two and a half years 
but in that time I think we all saw that the health care system 
was crumbling and that we could have done this a little more 
expeditiously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am very glad to have the opportunity to debate this 
motion today.  I am glad to see the Minister of Health here.  I 
think that is what ministers should do on opposition days; hear 
out the opposition.  I hope that I will have his ear for just a 
few minutes and be able to pass on to him some observations of my 
own and those of my party with respect to what has happened to 
medicare over the last several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by saying that I have been an observer of what is 
happening to Canada's health care system for a long time.  I was 
the NDP health critic from 1980 to 1984 in the lead-up to the 
Canada Health Act.  I remember very well being in the House 
speaking at the close of the debate on the Canada Health Act.  I 
want to commend the health minister of that day, Monique Bégin, 
for bringing in the Canada Health Act, albeit after considerable 
encouragement on the part of the opposition, which she herself 
acknowledges in a book about her experiences at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the debate at that time, I said—and I regret to 
say that it has come true—that no amount of standards, no amount 
of principles, no amount of ideals with respect to medicare would 
save medicare in the absence of adequate funding.  In the end, we 
can have a Canada Health Act as strong as we like in terms of 
enforcement and in terms of its ideals, but if the publicly 
funded health care system in this country, that we call medicare, 
is slowly but surely starved to death, these principles will mean 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot get the kind of health care that we want and need 
when we go to the publicly funded health care system this creates 
two problems.  First, there is an immediate problem.  We cannot 
get the health care that we need.  We cannot get that diagnostic 
test, we cannot get the bed that we need or whatever the case may 
be.  We cannot get the treatment that we need. But it creates a 
longer term problem for the system beyond the problem that it 
creates for an individual and that is, it builds pressure on the 
body politic to create an alternative to that system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more Canadians, both those with money and those without 
very much money, begin to wonder about whether or not it would be 
in their interest to have another system that they could go to 
when the public system fails them as a result of it being slowly 
starved to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is taken advantage of by two groups of people, the 
insurance companies and the multinational health care 
corporations that never liked medicare in the first place. 
The more that medicare is starved to death, the more an 
opportunity is created for them to make an argument for their 
kind of health care system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It creates an opportunity for politicians of various right wing 
ideologies, like the Harris' and the Kleins, who see in the slow 
starvation, at least that starvation which is attributable to the 
federal government, a political excuse for doing what they want 
to anyway.  It sets them up nicely as politicians who would like 
to create a context in which they could bring in more private 
funding of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Minister of Health that this is a genuinely 
dangerous situation.  We had a crisis in the late 1970s and early 
1980s with respect to extra billing and user fees, and that was 
solved through the Canada Health Act.  But we have a crisis of an 
entirely different order, a kind of metacrisis now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the Minister of Health, in all sincerity, that there is 
a real danger that medicare will be fatally wounded on the watch 
of the Liberal government, on the watch of the minister.  I do 
not think that is something the minister wants to have on his 
record.  I do not think it is something that he wants.  I caution 
him not to let it happen by stealth, not to find out that some 
day he is in a position where this is going to happen whether he 
wants it to happen or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, unfortunately, what happened in the context of the 
federal budget is that the day which I do not think the Minister 
of Health wants, which certainly we in the NDP do not want, has 
been advanced.  That day has been brought closer.  The 
possibility of medicare being fatally wounded on the Liberal 
watch has been brought closer and made more likely.  We will see 
today.  I think it is today that Premier Klein will be bringing 
in legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may argue, and certainly Mr. Klein will argue, that 
this is totally in keeping with the Canada Health Act.  We can 
get lawyers on either side of this one, but I think most 
Canadians would say that what Mr. Klein has in mind and what Mr. 
Harris is musing about is against the spirit of the Canada Health 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if it can be argued by the minister, by Mr. Klein and by 
Mr. Harris that this is somehow not technically a violation of 
the Canada Health Act because these hospitals will still be paid 
by the publicly insured system, it will bring these private 
hospitals into being.  Once they are there, do we not think that 
they will begin to have a political presence, that they will have 
a presence in medical and health care communities?  It will be 
the thin edge of wedge.  It will be the wide edge of the wedge. 
This will be very, very significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the minister that I think he needs to revisit the 12 
point plan which a former minister signed, she says under duress, 
with the province of Alberta.  He needs to come down hard, but he 
needs to come down hard with money, and not for the sake of 
Alberta.  As far as I am concerned, Alberta is a big culprit in 
this.  Alberta could solve all of its medical problems tomorrow 
by simply having a sales tax like every other province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to Alberta, it is not a question of limited 
resources, it is a question of ideology.  But I will tell the 
minister that in a lot of other provinces it is not a question of 
limited will or ideology, it is a question of limited resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot say that it cannot afford to carry 50%, 
while at the same time, by implication, say that it expects the 
provinces to carry 75% of the load.  It just will not happen.  It 
cannot be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even provinces whose governments are committed, whose premiers 
are committed with every cell of their bodies to medicare, will 
not be able to do it.  At some point public demand to transcend 
or avoid waiting lists, et cetera, will be too much and other 
options will have to be sought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I say to the minister.  We are in a very, very 
dangerous situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The original insight behind medicare was that medical decisions 
would be made on medical grounds; not on market grounds, not on 
the grounds of profitability or seeking profit, but to take 
medicine out of the marketplace and make medical decisions for 
medical reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened over the last 20 years, slowly but surely, is 
that medical decisions are not made for medical reasons any more. 
They are not made according to the market, but they are made for 
fiscal reasons.  That too goes against the spirit of medicare, 
because the spirit of medicare was to make medical decisions 
medical, not market and not fiscal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a situation where too many medical and health care 
decisions are being made for fiscal reasons.  If we want to 
restore the spirit of medicare, then we have to have enough 
resources in the system so that doctors and other health 
caregivers can begin to make those decisions; not on the basis of 
what the finance ministers of the various provinces say or what 
the federal Minister of Finance says, but on the basis of what 
they know their patients need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going to a private for profit health care system will not do 
that either.  There are health management organizations, HMOs, or 
whatever they are called in the United States, in which all kinds 
of decisions on procedures and treatments are restricted or not 
available because of the profit strategies of that particular 
health care corporation, so it is a delusion to think that is a 
solution.  What we need is what we had, a health care system 
where people got what they needed because they needed it and 
there was adequate funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not adequate funding at this time.  The $2.5 billion 
extra that we got the other day in the budget is not enough, and 
I think the health minister knows it is not enough.  But it is 
not enough to say that it is coming.  It has to come soon and it 
has to come in the form of re-establishing a real federal 
partnership with the provinces.  Otherwise the minister can have 
all of the meetings he likes with his provincial counterparts, 
but if he does not have the moral high ground, if he is not 
willing to reclaim the moral high ground—and unfortunately money 
has a lot to do with that—then it will just be an endless series 
of seminars where our medicare system keeps getting worse and 
worse.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened to the comments of 
the member opposite with great interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, our Minister of Finance has indicated that he 
is prepared to come to the table once the Minister of Health has 
met with his provincial colleagues and has worked up some kind of 
plan to make sure that the health care system will operate as 
efficiently as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not stand in the House and claim to be an expert on health 
care, but we would all agree that health care delivery is a 
provincial responsibility.  If there are problems in the deliver 
of the health care system, that is a provincial issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  Is there a funding issue or a finance issue? 
That is what is under debate in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity in the late 1970s to work on health care 
cost containment.  I am speaking now as a citizen of Canada.  It 
was amazing.  We looked at health care from the acute care bed, 
which is the most expensive part of the health care system, right 
through to intermediate care, long term care, home care and home 
makers, down to where someone needed a helping hand to make 
lunch.  We looked at the low cost solutions and the very high 
cost solutions.  That was 20 years ago and we still do not have 
it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have patients in acute care beds who should be in home care. 
We have elderly patients in acute care beds who should be in long 
term care or extended care.  We all know that.  I know it is not 
an easy problem to solve.  I accept that.  However, we have to 
deal with this and other issues, like prevention, promotion and 
lifestyle issues, on which we have made some progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite said 50%.  My question to him is, 50% of 
what?  Where are health care costs going? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member raises a lot 
of things that people have talked about in the House for a long 
time.  I would agree with them that we are facing a demographic 
situation as well as a number of other things which have put 
pressure on the health care system.  Technological innovation, 
demographic circumstances and all kinds of things have converged 
to put pressure on the health care system.  Nobody is denying 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we are going to work together, federally and 
provincially, then there has to be a commitment to equal burden 
sharing while we solve the problem.  That is all I am saying. 
This is everybody's problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has used the federal spending power and 
the Canada Health Act to lay down certain conditions and to be 
involved in medicare, and we do not quarrel with that.  If there 
are problems to be solved, as the member has identified, and I 
think identified well, then people should do that in a collegial, 
partnership, sharing kind of way; not by saying “There is a 
problem and until we solve it you guys carry 75% of the problem 
and when we get it solved maybe we will go back to 50:50”.  I do 
not think that is a viable approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that we still do not have right some of the 
things that were wrong 20 years ago.  I would agree that there 
are many people in acute care beds who should be in long term 
care.  That is a question of money.  It is a question of creating 
those long term care facilities and beds.  Or, it is a question 
of home care.  It is probably both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am concerned about when I listen to the Minister of 
Health and the Minister of Finance is that some months from now 
they will say to the provincial ministers of health “We want to 
have a national home care program.  This is where we want to put 
our money”.  The provincial governments will say “Wait a 
minute.  Why should we trust you to cost share this thing with us 
when the last thing you cost shared with us you pulled out of 
unilaterally?”  Then we could have—and this is the scenario I 
am afraid of—the Minister of Health saying “We wanted to have a 
national home care program, but the provinces would not let us. 
We offered to work with them, but no, they did not want to do 
it”, the same way it was done with the national day care 
program, which was pinned on the provinces.  They said “We 
wanted to have a national day care program, but we talked to the 
provinces and they were not interested”.  I can see the same 
kind of scenario developing with another national program, 
whereby we would get more politics and not the re-infusion of 
money into the system which is really needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as other matters, there are many people who go to the 
hospital and before they know it they are out, whereas 20 or 25 
years ago they would have stayed two, three, four or five days. 
Let us not pretend that nothing has happened.  There are many 
people who do not spend anywhere near the amount of time in 
hospital they used to.  We have done all of that and we still 
have a problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for St. Paul's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before the House is generally about health care and 
the condition of health care and how we address the challenges of 
health care today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I had the opportunity to listen to the debate and I 
was most impressed with the presentation of the health minister 
with regard to resisting getting into the trenches with others in 
pointing fingers at who is at fault.  It was a responsible 
approach to saying that we have challenges, we have the 
opportunity and we are committed to addressing those challenges 
and to working in co-operation with all of the stakeholders in 
the health system of Canada.  I congratulate him for taking the 
high road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's principal responsibilities come under 
the Canada Health Act.  I think most members will know that the 
Canada Health Act contains five principles.  Those principles 
are:  universality, accessibility, portability, comprehensiveness 
and publicly funded.  If we think about the Canada Health Act, it 
really is expressing a value statement for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told at one time that about 75% or more of the health care 
costs in the lifetime of a human being will be incurred in the 
last year of his or her life.  When we consider the enormity of 
the costs at the end of our years, we wonder whether there would 
be an automatic pressure to save money by simply reducing our 
standards of health care, reducing our care for the aged and 
asking why would we spend the money to prolong death rather than 
spending it elsewhere to extend life.  It is a significant 
ethical issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have made their choice with regard to the ethics of 
our health care system.  We have people who are living longer and 
we continue to invest in our health care system to make sure that 
Canadians not only live longer, but they live a high quality of 
life throughout all of their years. 
Those are some of the underlying principles.  It is not just 
about dollars.  It is about the values that Canadians hold.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Forum on Health did two years worth of work.  It 
had the best experts in Canada in health care delivery.  It went 
across the country and consulted very broadly.  It came to the 
conclusion when it reported to the health minister and to 
parliament that there were enough funds in the system.  It said 
there many areas within the health care system had dollars which 
could have been spent much more wisely and productively in terms 
of getting healthier outcomes for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that was the first instance in which it was time for 
the federal government and the provinces to sit down to start to 
discuss how to plan for the health care system in the future, 
knowing that we have an aging society and that our lifestyles, 
stress and activity levels make us more at risk for having health 
needs.  The world changes and people change but our values do 
not.  Our values have remained firm and consistent.  We want to 
provide quality care in terms of medically necessary services for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few issues were raised by the National Forum on Health on 
which I believe the health minister has already had consultations 
with the provinces.  On the issue of privately funded services, I 
understand that over 70% of health care expenditures in Canada 
are financed from the public purse with the remaining coming from 
private sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say the public expenditures are too high and should 
be restricted to a basic array of services, basic bare bones, 
medically necessary life threatening type activities, emergencies 
or obstetrics type stuff.  Others say we need to maintain a high 
level of public funding for health and, if anything, the funding 
should be expanded to cover services that go beyond physicians 
and hospitals, which has been traditionally federal 
responsibility or federal obligations with regard to funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Forum on Health also raised the issue about whether 
there was enough money.  From an international perspective it 
found that the Canada health care system did not appear to be 
underfunded and was one of the most expensive systems in the 
world.  These are issues which have to be agreed upon with the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also the combination of health reform and fiscal 
restraint to give rise to rationing and issues around the fringes 
of the principles of the Canada Health Act.  It is important for 
Canadians and legislators to look at these issues and at how 
Canada is evolving and responding to the health care needs of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have made it very clear that health care is their 
number one priority.  The Government of Canada responded in the 
last budget with $11.5 billion for health and a further $2.5 
billion in budget 2000.  That is not the end of it.  That is the 
beginning of supporting our health care system.  Very clearly a 
scope of discussion is necessary for the federal government and 
all the stakeholders, the provinces, the territories and others, 
to address a broad range of issues to ensure that the health care 
priority of Canadians is being met in a co-operative and 
collaborative fashion by all stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the remaining time I want to talk about my experience in the 
health care system.  Before I became a member of parliament I was 
a member of the board of trustees of the Mississauga hospital for 
about nine years.  During that period I acted as treasurer for 
some five years and one year as the vice-chair of the board.  I 
did have an opportunity to deal with all aspects of financing of 
health care funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my experience after nine years on the board of trustees of 
the Mississauga hospital I developed a sincere and deep respect 
for our health care professionals.  Doctors and nurses in Canada 
have the highest standards for which we could ever ask. 
In a number of cases we were faced with issues where corners were 
being cut.  Not in one instance do I remember the medical staffs 
or the nursing staffs saying that they would compromise the 
quality of their work.  They would rather not do the procedures 
or not attempt to do the job unless they could do it to the best 
of their ability.  The professional code of conduct of our health 
caregivers is absolutely irrefutable, and I want to make that 
known.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea of a health care crisis is possibly more show 
than anything, only from the standpoint that our health care 
system is an enormous system with many stakeholders and many 
aspects to it.  Things do not happen very quickly in the health 
care system.  It is a gradualist approach.  It is a reflecting 
strategy as priorities move and things happen within our value 
system.  We negotiate, compromise and discuss ways in which we 
can meet priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a tremendous improvement in the health care system 
not only in technology but also in medicine, the pharmacare side 
of things.  Hospitals and medical procedures can now be performed 
in ways which were never contemplated before.  The average length 
of stay for a patient at the Mississauga hospital actually went 
down from approximately 6.8 days per patient to 4.2 days.  The 
average length of stay went down significantly.  This means that 
bed days were saved and that money for the hospital and our 
health care system was saved.  This had no impact on the 
re-admission rate. The work that was done showed that it was 
taking advantage of new technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this period the Mississauga hospital reduced its beds 
from 650 to 600.  At the same time it actually served more people 
with less beds in their catchment area by making this move, again 
showing the progress of our health system.  Not only are the 
lifestyles of Canadians changing but also the technology in 
medicine in Canada is changing.  It means that there has to be a 
constant dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Minister of Health for making a firm 
commitment to interim funding for health care as well as a firm 
commitment to deal with all stakeholders to ensure a safe and 
healthy system for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member mentioned that the health care system was not just 
about dollars, that it was about more than dollars, that it was 
about the value Canadians hold.  This motion is about the value 
of our publicly funded health care system.  I am sure many 
Canadians right across the country were looking to the budget to 
support that system and to give some real meaning and input into 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the honour of meeting with several people in my 
constituency last week regarding mental health issues.  There was 
quite a cross-section of people representing various interests 
including the police, young peoples associations, community 
mental health workers, doctors and so forth.  The one common 
concern that came out of this meeting was the lack of resources 
to provide adequate health care for those suffering from mental 
illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we refer to the values that Canadians hold, they can be of 
no value unless we attach value to the health care system and 
support it with the proper resources.  What would be the hon. 
member's comments in this regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of our seniors have difficulty with the high cost of drugs 
and dental care.  A gentleman asked me the other day if I could 
get the federal government to provide some kind of dental care 
program so seniors could meet the high cost of having their teeth 
looked after.  These are small things to people, but they are all 
part of Canadians taking control of their lives.  People feel 
they have lost control and that control is being put more and 
more into the hands of the private for profit corporations and 
companies.  Would the hon. member comment on my remarks?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, in answer to the hon. 
member, there is no question that this is not a matter of 
dollars.  We found out that the province of Ontario had $3.5 
billion available and only used $800 million.  We found out that 
Newfoundland also did not use all the money it was provided in 
the last budget, as well as Quebec and another $800 million. It 
is very clear that in those three provinces, and I suspect in 
others, the pressure with regard to it being not enough money is 
really not the point.  There is a much broader question being 
raised and the money thing seems to be the proxy for the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raised an interesting issue, though.  In a situation 
where home care facilities or community care is not available, 
hospital beds are used by people who are looking for long term 
care facilities.  I believe that home care is a very important 
part of the long term solution to alleviating the pressures on 
existing hospital services.  I for one, and I think other members 
will share the view, think that we have to look very carefully at 
home care as one of the solutions that we should discuss with the 
provinces.

week the finance minister has been huffing and puffing about how 
he has delivered Canadians from high taxes and hidden tax grabs. 
Curiously, though, his budget made no mention of lowering gas 
taxes which make up almost half the price of a litre of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister must be too busy to explain that the 
current gas price crisis can partially be blamed on the fact that 
the government refuses to remove an excise tax that was put in 
place in 1981 to pay for the creation of Petro-Canada.  This tax 
costs Canadians an extra 8 cents per litre every time they fill 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 19 years this tax has been in effect the government has 
skimmed approximately $30.4 billion from Canadians.  The original 
cost of Petro-Canada was $1.46 billion.  That is an extra $28.9 
billion that the government has quietly been pinching from 
Canadians over the last 19 years.

<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
government tabled a budget with two cents for health care for 
every dollar in tax cuts.  Now, not surprisingly, it has swung 
into full damage control.  Now it is hinting, no, no, there will 
be more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the finance minister if there will be more money for 
health care.  With the health care system in such crisis, why is 
the government withholding it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
if the leader of the NDP wants to talk about money, let us talk 
about money.  The NDP's own platform in the 1997 election said it 
wanted a floor of $15 billion in cash for the CHST.  We have 
exceeded that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP members said they wanted to restore $7 billion for health. 
We have doubled that already.  On November 4, 1998, the leader of 
that party in the House called for an additional $2.5 billion for 
health.  Since then we have invested over $14 billion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
talked cash this morning and we will talk cash again.  Let us 
talk changes.  The health care system does need change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we will talk money 
again but let us talk about the change the minister says we need. 
Very conveniently he omits the references to the home care and 
the pharmacare promise and the money needed for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the government to be a leader in the changes that are 
required if we hope to maintain a Canada-wide health care system. 
Federal cash is the ticket of admission to participating in those 
changes.  No cash, no clout.  No clout, no Canada-wide health 
care.  Will there be more federal cash, and if so when and how 
much? 
<P><A NAME="LINK148"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as to clout and cash, as I mentioned yesterday the Government of 
Canada now contributes over one-third of all public health 
spending in the country every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also emphasize that apart from the additional money we are 
working constructively for the kinds of changes that are needed. 
The provinces recognize it is not just a matter of money. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minister Bernard Landry's statement yesterday made it clear.  He 
said “The problem in health is not a problem of money, it is a 
planning problem, a management problem”.  I fully agree.

Mr. Speaker, it seems that wherever the Prime Minister's good

sure to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Minister for International Trade please explain how 
the addition of these two individuals to the board of directors

<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

very well earlier, I will look into that file very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that the Export Development Corporation has a very 
good record of helping Canadian companies to export around the 
world.  Are we against exports?  No.  EDC is doing a wonderful 
job assisting a lot of Canadian companies to do better on 
international markets, and I will look into this particular file 
later on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK152"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there are a few basics the minister should keep in 
mind.  For example, René Fugère is under criminal investigation 
by the RCMP.  Neither Mr. Fugère nor Mr. Champagne has registered 
under the Lobbyists Registration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister for International Trade.  Why is 
his department even dealing with these individuals?  For the sake 
of the integrity of the system and of saving taxpayer money, will 
the minister suspend this loan until we get to the bottom of 
this, until the air has cleared? 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear 
that the EDC is working on a commercial basis with a lot of 
Canadian companies.  It is helping Canadian companies do well in 
international markets, exporting Canadian goods and creating job 
opportunities in this country.  The EDC made a profit of $118 
million last year for the Government of Canada.  It is doing a 
great job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will look into the particular file which the opposition 
party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Fugère first popped up four days before the last 
election, announcing a big grant in the Prime Minister's riding 
before that grant had ever been approved.  Since then he has been 
directly connected with at least four other grants of public 
money.  He is under RCMP investigation for unregistered lobbying. 
Now we find that with his appointment to the board, another 
company magically receives a transfusion backed by the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government please explain to Canadians why their money 
is anted up so promptly for this friend of the Prime Minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find the opposition a little repetitive 
today.  It is unfortunate that the budget is not able to provide 
them with opportunities to put questions of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made it very clear that I will look into the specific 
file of the hundreds or thousands of files that we have.  Members 
of the opposition did not indicate that they would be raising the 
matter of a particular file.  I will look into it and report back 
to the House.  I am confident that the EDC is doing a wonderful 
job for Canadian companies in international markets. 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a news flash for the government.  We are going to 
keep asking these questions until we get answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is something from Earth Canada's website after the Prime 
Minister's friends joined its board:  “Meetings were held in 
Ottawa in connection with the export financing of future sales”. 
Boy, were these meetings ever successful.  They netted a $10 
million line of credit from the Export Development Corporation, 
backed by the Canadian taxpayer.

two lists, one obtained under the Access to Information Act and 
the other from the minister, with two sets of figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first list, Household Finance received $2,505,000 in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

there are no master lists.  Indeed, we have collected the 
information from seven different databanks.  The information does 
change.  Companies have name changes.  There are circumstances 
when companies do not survive.  The lists may change with a 
specific request made.  The 10,000 pages that we presented to 
parliament last week are there.  I would be glad to confirm the 
difference in the information the hon. member has if she wants to 
provide me the details.

<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem 
is far more serious than the minister is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list obtained under the Access to Information Act referred 
to a payment $2,505,000.  The director of the East Montreal

</I></B></P><P align=left>Fugère and Champagne seem to be magnets for taxpayers' money,

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it about the minister's relationship with these guys

<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade,

This is ridiculous.  I have said that when he really wants an 
answer, instead of making cheap political shots as the opposition 
likes to do, he can serve notice on a particular file so we can 
look into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the member that I have every confidence the EDC

helping Canadian companies do well in international markets. 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
surely the minister does not expect us to believe that he has not 
heard of René Fugère lately.  His name has been in the papers 
every day.  We have talked about him every day in this place.  He 
should have some sense that Mr. Fugère has been very involved 
with his department in the last little while; in fact, in both of 
the departments he has overseen in the last little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that this man has been involved in an RCMP investigation 
and that Champagne has been involved in an investigation about an 
illegal trust fund, why is it that these people can come to his 
department, no matter which department it is, and wring 
taxpayers' money of his pocket? 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let us make it clear.  There is an arm's 
length relationship between the EDC and the Department of 
International Trade.  We should be careful, this is not the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell that these people have never been in government and 
probably never will.  If they think a minister just gets out the 
cheque book and writes a cheque, that is irresponsible. 
Canadians deserve better information than this.

Speaker, we now know enough about the Alberta legislation on 
private for-profit hospitals, to be tabled in one hour's time, to 
realize that Premier Klein's bill is contrary to the Canada 
Health Act.  We know it is a clever ruse and that it is a crafty 
strategy.  It separates out some procedures done in hospitals and 
it establishes overnight stay patient surgical facilities.  It is 
truly a Trojan horse for the privatization of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister now act immediately to close the door to 
two-tier health care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I understand that the legislation will be tabled later today.  It 
has not yet been released publicly.  I have already told the 
House that I will look very carefully at that legislation.  I 
have already expressed real concern about many aspects of this 
proposed policy.  I raised serious questions with the minister of 
health of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member and the House that as soon as we 
receive that legislation we will examine it very carefully to 
determine whether it complies in letter and in spirit with the 
Canada Health Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister will know, as we know, that the act very 
clearly opens the door to private for-profit health care in 
Canada.  It is a dangerous precedent and I would hope that he 
would have a more definitive answer today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will also know that the best defence against the

two-tier health care is cash for health care.

takes more than just money. It takes the additional money.  It 
takes planning, ideas and constructive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is very disappointing about the NDP's position is that by

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to the motion.  It calls on the government 
to stand up for our most cherished value but unfortunately it 
picks a method which will not work. We need to look at the whole 
health care crisis as one of planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget in terms of the initial possibility provided a 
$3.5 billion infusion as well as the other $8 billion.  There was 
an opportunity for the provincial and territorial governments to 
begin some planning.  Also the 1999 budget provided real money 
for investing in health information systems that would begin to 
look at what was committed in the social union framework 
agreement in terms of dealing with information that could help 
Canadians understand how their health care dollars are being 
spent, by whom and with what results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening with the provinces is similar to when I had to 
try to explain to my father why I was asking for a raise in my 
allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not quite understand this crisis.  We heard time after time 
in the finance committee that this was a crisis of mismanagement 
not a crisis of dollars.  Patching it with more infusions in a 
piecemeal way will not remotely help our health care system. It 
reminds me of Michael Ignatieff's statement that the most 
important barrier to progressive movements in this country is 
some sort of nostalgic vision of a paradise in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is not going to fix it without an absolute commitment to 
real reform. Time after time the finance committee heard, even 
from the employer committee of health care of Ontario, that 
putting more money into the health care system even if it were 
available is not the answer.  International comparisons indicate 
that the total level of financial support for Canadian health 
care as a percentage of gross national product is among the 
highest in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We emphasized the need to start focusing on an integrated system 
of delivering health care rather than continuing to support the 
current system of inefficient, cost ineffective suppliers and 
stakeholders.  Our focus is for the best quality health care at 
the lowest cost, a goal which we believe is shared by all levels 
of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Health Care Association said it was aware that 
money alone would not solve all of the challenges facing the 
health care system. We have to commit to do things differently. 
The federal government must set an example. The pointing of 
fingers in all levels of government should stop.  We have to 
regain our position as the moral authority but that is not done 
by continuing to patch a system that needs real reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Monique Bégin in her speech to the health care economists at the 
Emmett Hall lecture last August said that we have to remember 
that between 1985 and 1995 Canada had increased its total health 
expenditures dramatically without offering better services, or 
more services, or different services to the public. Canada had 
become and still is the second most expensive country in the 
world in terms of total health care expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to figure out what does and does not work and stop doing 
what does not work.  It is a concern of mine that continuing to 
patch a system that is inherently not a system, a patchwork quilt 
of non-systems, is a huge barrier to progress. It is a huge 
barrier to the ultimate sustainability of the the system.  It is 
too important to get on with real accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we listen to Doug Angus of the University 
of Ottawa and Queen's University who said that significant cost 
savings are valuable.  His 1995 paper said that there would be a 
$7 billion in savings in the system if people were in the right 
level of care.  We need to benchmark better practices and share 
those across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to invest.  Hopefully the CIHR will do that.  The 
Council for Health Research said that we can no longer just do 
disease based health research. 
We have to do real research on the health care system itself to 
ensure we effectively use our health care dollars in health care 
delivery.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This nation needs a plan.  The plan must be based on 
accountability.  It cannot be some romantic vision of doing 
things the same old way.  We have to do things differently.  The 
<I>British Medical Journal</I> reported that if the airline system 
were run the same way the health care system is run in North 
America in terms of accountability, a 747 would be coming down 
once a week and we would be doing something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If 20% to 30% of admissions for seniors are because of drug 
interactions that are totally preventable, we should be moving on 
those policies.  The minute the smoking rate comes down in youth, 
we see a decrease in dollars for prenatal care, for premature 
babies and for post-operative pneumonia.  Removing scatter rugs 
from the homes of seniors would dramatically prevent broken hips. 
There are serious issues we have to get on with in terms of 
prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am totally frustrated when childhood asthma goes up that 
people just ask for more respirators. We cannot do this. Air 
quality goes down, childhood asthma goes up.  We have to deal 
with the air quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extraordinarily important to note when looking at this big 
underfunding crisis, which unfortunately is supported by our NDP 
colleagues across the way, that the underfunding is going to get 
us into big trouble. The evil dark forces from the Fraser 
Institute to some of the medical associations are crying. In 
terms of Alberta and Ontario, I believe they are desperately 
trying to break medicare.  They are trying to show us that there 
will never be enough money, that the government pockets will 
never be deep enough and that the only possible solution is 
privatized medicine and user fees.  We know user fees do not 
work.  They are only a deterrent to the most fragile in our 
society, the pregnant teens and the fragile diabetics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private hospitals cost more money to society.  I was in Alberta 
last month when the Calgary hospital was blown up.  It is 
extraordinary that we ended up with this worry about waiting 
lists.  At least seven operating rooms were blown up and now 
private operating rooms are needed to help with the waiting 
lists.  This is not okay and I must say I am not sure that it was 
by accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolute mismanagement or misplanning. Even Duncan 
Sinclair said that the hospital restructuring process in Ontario 
was done backward.  If we build up the community support, we will 
eventually need fewer hospitals and fewer beds.  Doing it in the 
opposite order creates a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A crisis has been created similar to what Michael Decter talked 
about in that there would be a huge crisis if bank branches were 
closed and people were not taught how to use ATMs.  It is exactly 
the same in closing hospitals without having the supports and 
services in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be smarter.  We have to talk about real outcomes in 
health care.  How much money we spend is no longer good enough. 
Mr. Harris spent $400 million in the severance package to lay off 
nurses, $400 million to hire them back and $200 million to pay 
the consultants to tell them how to fire them and hire them back. 
This is not good spending of health care dollars.  I do not want 
$1 billion spent that way and I do not think we should give him 
another $1 billion so he can do the same thing again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extraordinary that we are in a position of being 
blackmailed to give people more money when there is no evidence 
as to how it is being spent.  Canadians want it to be spent 
properly.  They do not want us throwing money at things if it is 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union framework agreement says that we will share 
best practices with transparency and accountability. When I 
chaired the World Health Organization's breakfast on TB, Canada 
did not submit its TB numbers for last year.  We have a zero at 
the World Health Organization because the provinces would not 
hand in their TB numbers.  This is not co-operation.  It is no 
way to plan a health care system and we have to get on with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Harvard medical school professors have shown us that in the for 
profit hospitals the costs were 25% higher than in the not for 
profit hospitals.  That is not in keeping with the social union 
framework agreement. 
In the social union framework agreement we promised that there 
would be an equitable way of looking at things.  I am hugely 
enthusiastic and optimistic.  We can have a perfect health care 
system with 9.3% of the GDP.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe all members of the House have the same 
objective of ensuring that the health care system is available to 
all Canadians and has no financial barriers to it.  We have a 
serious problem.  As the member knows we have an aging 
population.  The population of people over the age of 65 will 
double in the next 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ralph Klein is proposing in Alberta that if the public system 
cannot take care of patients he will pay those in the private 
sector to provide health care services.  Then people on waiting 
lists will get medical care when they need it at a cost lower 
than the cost in the public system.  How will this damage the 
public system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows 
perfectly well that there is no evidence to show that a private 
health care system is cheaper.  The evidence we have seen from 
around the world shows the administrative costs in a public 
system are at 9%.  In a private system the costs are at 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My major concern is that human beings, the physicians and the 
caregivers, are seduced to the private system, which makes the 
public system waiting lists longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another concern about the private system.  My experience 
is with the tiny ones that exist in Toronto.  What happens after 
hours in private hospitals?  Who looks after the complications? 
The patients go straight back into the public system with even 
less accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we want a system that is properly organized, not one 
that will actually allow doctors to be seduced into a private 
system with no accountability.  In a for profit system the 
administration costs go up for some reason. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened to my colleague carefully.  In her answer just now she 
clearly indicates that she is opposed to private for profit 
hospitals in health care.  I take it she has no problem with that 
part of the motion which we in the NDP put forward today.  I know 
she agrees that public health care is cherished by Canadians, so 
she does not have a problem with the first part of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a problem with the motion where it calls for 
substantial and sustained increases in cash transfers to the 
provinces?  She talks about a partnership and sitting down with 
the provinces and getting the best ideas.  If the federal 
government as a partner is only putting in 15 cents on the 
dollar, does it not lose the moral authority to direct how the 
health care system operates? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the 
member's comments on the private sector.  I do not agree that 
cash transfers without accountability is the answer at all. 
Canadians do not want us to be pointing fingers and dividing up 
loonies in fifteens and thirties.  Nobody really cares.  It is 
the same taxpayer.  Whether it is a tax point or a cash transfer 
or anything, people want the system to work.  We as the federal 
government should be able to share in the best practices across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hugely worried.  We planned a system last year which was a 
five year plan in terms of health care dollars.  Because they 
mismanaged they get to come back asking for more cash, more cash, 
more cash, when they did not put in the information technology 
and there are not accountable.

fault that Women's College Hospital on Wellesley was being closed 
when the reduction in the transfer in that year was $1.3 billion. 
His 30% tax cut was $4.9 billion.  He had more than the ability 
to absorb that.  I think Canadians are starting to get it, that 
this is not about more and more and more.  It is about doing it 
better.

listened to the member talking about the potential for losing 
doctors to the private system.  I think she called it being 
seduced into the private system and away from the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for her opinion on what is happening right now with 
Canadian doctors being seduced into the private sector.  It is 
even worse than that.  They are being seduced into the private 
sector in the United States.  We are losing all kinds of doctors 
to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a lot of those doctors 
are coming home.  The reason for that is that in Canada we 
understand that the social determinants of health are 
extraordinarily important.  Good doctors have to work on poverty, 
violence and the environment.  There is a huge disincentive in 
terms of family for doctors to want to stay there very long, and 
the best and the brightest are coming home. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the NDP for bringing the motion to the floor of 
the House.  It is the most important issue affecting Canadians 
today.  While we have a different way of getting to our end 
point, our end point is the same.  We want to make sure that all 
Canadians have access to health care when they need it and not 
when the bottom line allows it, which is contrary to the 
situation of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recognize that we have a problem.  What are we asking 
for?  The problem is that the demand on our health care is 
exceeding and stripping our ability to supply the resources. That 
is why provinces like Alberta and Ontario are looking at ways to 
ensure that their people, their citizens, will get health care 
when they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking personally as a physician I can tell the House that too 
often Canadians are not getting the health care they need. For 
example, people in the province of Quebec are waiting 14 weeks 
for essential cancer treatment.  It is the same situation as in 
the province of British Columbia.  Some are being forced to the 
United States at a cost that is far greater than what it would 
cost in their own provinces.  Why?  It is not because the 
provinces do not want to provide the system but because they 
simply do not have the money to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now every tenet of the Canada Health Act is being 
violated.  I will just go through them for the House.  On the 
issue of accessibility, is waiting 14 weeks accessible health 
care for essential cancer treatment?  Is waiting six months for 
open heart surgery accessible health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first day I walked into my hospital at Christmas when I 
worked for a week, I did not think it was fair that 12 out of 14 
beds in my emergency department were filled with patients waiting 
to get into the hospital.  They were not geriatric patients but 
people waiting to get into the ICU because they had unstable 
angina.  There were patients with compound fractures, sick 
children who needed admission to the hospital for investigation, 
and many other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It is because we do not have any beds.  Why?  It is 
because the hospital does not have any money to open hospital 
rooms.  It does not have money to pay for nurses.  That is why 
people are not getting accessible health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next day we had a disaster.  A bus full of children was hit 
by a logging truck.  Only two of them were critically injured. 
Let us imagine if more were injured.  We would have been in a 
situation that I do not even want to comprehend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to the myth of universality.  Quebec has 
not signed on.  Although 90% of the people of the province of 
British Columbia have done, so some 10% of people have no health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of portability, can people take the same health 
care from one province to another?  In theory, yes, but in 
practice they cannot because different things are covered in 
different provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of public administration, one-third of all health 
care dollars spent in the country today comes from the private 
sector, from people's pockets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not have access to home care.  They do not have access 
to dental services.  They do not have access to certain drugs or 
only have access if they have dollars in their pockets.  The 
nonsense portrayed by members on the other side who say that we 
have a single tier system is absolute bunk.  We have had a 
multi-tier system for years and it is getting worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in my earlier question, the population is aging. 
The cold hard reality is that the number of people aged 65 will 
double in the next 30 years.  People use 70% of health care 
dollars after the age of 65.  As they get older, the number of 
people who are working declines.  This means the tax base 
declines substantially.  As our demand goes up, our tax base goes 
down.  We have more expensive technologies today than we had in 
the past and that will be the case in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discrepancy between supply and demand will widen.  Who will 
be hurt but the poor and the middle class?  The rich will always 
have an opportunity to purchase their health care when they need 
it.  They will go south or will have connections so that they can 
jump the queue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about facts and not rhetoric.  We have to put 
politics aside.  For too long the health care issue has been used 
as a political football by members on various sides.  Hide behind 
the Canada Health Act and we are looked upon as the great white 
knight that will defend the health of Canadians.  Try to propose 
alternative solutions and we are labelled and branded as enemies 
of the state.  Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not a person in the House wants an American style health care 
system.  Everyone in the House is committed to a health care 
system that enables all Canadians to have access to services when 
they need them.  The question is how do we do it.  If we 
recognize the facts I just mentioned then we must recognize that 
we need more money in our system.  As other members have 
mentioned, we need to do other things, but the cold, hard reality 
is that we need more funding.  That funding will not come from 
tax dollars that we will be able to raise now or in the future. 
Therefore, how do we get the money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak personally.  If we amend the Canada Health Act to 
allow private services to strengthen the public system, not 
detract from it or weaken it, we will be able to access some of 
those resources.  Canada is among a small family of countries 
including Cuba and North Korea that do not allow private services 
to occur by legislation?  What a great group to be in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If private services are used intelligently and have proper 
restrictions placed on them to address the issue of manpower so 
that medical personnel are obligated to work, say, a minimum of 
40 hours a week in the public sector, Canadians will have access 
to the medical personnel they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we allow a private system to work in parallel and separate so 
that there is no co-funding, we will ensure that people have a 
choice.  If people want, they can access the private system or 
the public system.  Ultimately the people on the private system 
will take pressure off the public system and there will be more 
money available within the public system on a per capita basis. 
The most impoverished people in the country who do not have a 
choice could then access the public system quicker than they 
could today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it unequal?  Yes, it is.  I would argue it is better to have 
an unequal system that provides better access to health care for 
all Canadians than we have today, particularly the poor and 
middle classes.  Then we would be on the right track.  At the end 
of the day the only reason to change anything would be to ensure 
that the poor and middle classes have health care when they need 
it. There would be a better health care and better access than we 
have today.  The government is certainly not doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to trot out and say that it is defending 
the status quo.  If a person in the province of British Columbia 
is injured while working he or she jumps to the top of the line 
in the public system.  That is not fair.  Public money should not 
be available so that a certain group, say the rich, have quicker 
access than the poor.  If they are to legislate this area, and I 
personally advocate that they do, they have to ensure a complete 
separation.  Not a nickel of public money, not a nickel of 
taxpayer money, would be used in the private system. 
A private system must be completely separate from the public. If 
we could do that we would get away from what has happened in 
England and in the United States where people can queue jump 
within a public system.  I and every member of the House would 
completely and utterly oppose that to the end of our days.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also look at the issue of manpower.  Within the nursing 
profession there will be a lack of 112,000 nurses in the next 10 
years.  In my profession, the physician population, we have an 
enormous lack of specialists, which will only get worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one takes the case of nephrology, we will have an enormous 
lack of nephrologists, that is, kidney specialists, and as our 
population ages and as the case of end stage renal failure 
expands, we will have a greater demand for those specialists. 
Where will they come from?  They will not materialize overnight. 
With the cutbacks at the universities we are not able to keep up 
with the physician or nursing populations that will be required 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A colleague from my party made the very cogent observation that 
people are going south.  Why are both nurses and doctors going 
south?  It is not necessarily because they want more money, 
although certainly some of them do. It is because most of them 
are sick and tired of having to tell patients “I'm sorry, your 
surgery is cancelled today, it will be done in six months”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one wants to look into the eyes of a patient at 8 o'clock in 
the morning and have to say that the operation cannot be done 
that day because the OR has been shut down due to the hospital's 
lack of money.  It is crushing for the patient.  It should never 
ever happen in this country but it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must talk about specific solutions to deal with this problem. 
We cannot hide behind the rhetoric any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One sidebar and one potential economic opportunity for the 
solution I mentioned is that patients from the United States and 
international patients will be able to come to Canada and receive 
private sector health care.  This would be an incredible boon in 
terms of job creation and it would generate billions of dollars 
to Canada's medical system.  Yes, it would be a private system, 
but billions of dollars in our country generates thousands of 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not allow that to happen?  We do not allow it to 
happen because of a philosophical myth that the government 
continues to portray.  If we do that we will be able to reverse 
the brain drain that has been occurring for so long, keep our 
medical professionals in the country, the doctors, nurses, techs 
and others, and we will have an infusion of capital into our 
medical system.  If we do not do this, the situation we have 
today in the country, which is far less than desirable, will only 
get worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members from all sides to please put aside the rhetoric. 
It is no use trying to scare the public by saying that the 
private sector is the demon that will destroy the public system. 
It could if it was not dealt with properly but we can channel a 
private system to ensure that it will strengthen the public 
system not weaken it.  It is not difficult to do and it can be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Tommy Douglas, a man I greatly respect, saw what we have done 
to our health care system today he would be rolling in his grave. 
He would be appalled because it was never designed to do what we 
are asking it to do today.  It is not and never was designed to 
be all things to all people.  It was designed to ensure that 
Canadians got their essential health care when they needed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, when we are asking for many other things, such as 
alternative medicine, home care, dental services and pharmacare, 
things that will cost billions of dollars, where will we get the 
money?  The cold, hard reality is that we do not have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the health minister starts trotting out solutions, such as 
24-hour call lines and saying that geriatric patients are the 
reason hospital beds are full, is, to put it kindly, naive.  It 
is true that there are some patients who occupy acute care beds. 
It is true that the geriatric population puts a great strain on 
the system. 
However, the people waiting in the emergency departments for a 
hospital bed are people who need ICU, people who need their 
fractures treated, people who have medical problems that are 
complex and simply cannot be treated at home.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister likes to say that with technologies getting 
better, laparoscopic surgery patients will be able to go home 
earlier.  That is true if it is done properly.  What is happening 
now is patients are being discharged earlier and are sicker and 
the responsibility for their care is placed on the shoulders of 
families who do not have the wherewithal to treat them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very disheartening to look into the eyes of an 80 year old 
woman who is taking care of her 85 year old spouse who is sick, 
sicker than she is I might add.  Both are ill but she is forced 
to deal with this.  We need to look at other ways not only from 
the funding perspective, which I focused this speech on, but also 
into some other intelligent ways of dealing with various 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue is to take a cold, hard look at administration.  In 
some hospitals administration has expanded dramatically.  That 
needs to be cut down.  On the issue of the geriatric population, 
I can only implore the health minister to look at the experience 
of Saskatchewan.  It has incorporated a very intelligent program, 
an outreach program that has brought geriatric people with 
medical problems into centres where they have had basically one 
stop shopping.  Many of their health care problems have been 
treated and dealt with there so that they can go home.  The 
bottom line is a higher quality of health care for them, a higher 
quality of life, which is the most important, and also the saving 
of millions of dollars to the health care system.  We need to 
look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disingenuous to claim that by defending the status quo and 
by just saying that we need to make changes without expressing 
what those are only enables this issue to go around in a big 
circle once again.  The only way we will solve this is for the 
health minister to bring together his provincial counterparts and 
say “We can't allow this to occur any longer.  We've got to stop 
the political nonsense and start putting patients first”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning of my speech, too often patients have 
been put last on the list of priorities but politics have been 
put as the prime priority because it has been far too attractive 
to stand and defend the status quo and say limply that we want to 
have changes without addressing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at experiences in other countries.  If we look 
at the European experience, they have allowed private services to 
occur but also support the public system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to look at prevention.  I proposed a national 
headstart program in the House in 1997 which passed.  It was on 
models in Moncton; Ypsilanti, Michigan and in Hawaii.  An 
integrated approach to that would save billions of dollars and 
save thousands of children's lives.  It is a practical and 
pragmatic approach.  I know the Minister of Labour has been 
leader in this in her town of Moncton.  I commend her for the 
outstanding work that she and her husband have done for many 
years.  However, this motion, although passed, has been moribund 
because the government has failed to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said to the Minister of Health, the Minister of HRD and 
the Minister of Justice that they should get together with their 
provincial counterparts and look at all the programs they have 
that deal with early childhood intervention.  They should 
rationalize these program, throw out what does not work, keep 
what does and have a seamless integrated approach for our 
children that starts at the prenatal stage and deals with the 
medical community at time zero, deals with the mentorship program 
that has worked in Hawaii and also the school system up to the 
age of eight.  If children grow up in a loving and secure 
environment where their basic needs are met, they will have the 
greatest chance of growing up to be productive and integrated 
members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I filmed for my television program an outstanding 
young woman who has a program called the Sage project here in 
Ottawa.  For roughly $7,000 she educated 550 immigrant children 
who did not know how to speak English.  Those children have all 
gone on to post-secondary education and all of them have done 
well.  Some of these children were on the lowest socioeconomic 
rung in our society. 
Many of them come from impoverished backgrounds and abusive 
situations, but the beauty of it is that she has focused on the 
basic needs of children.  By using volunteers, she has managed to 
save the lives of 2,000 children in Ottawa by giving them a head 
start.  She has done this with no government money and only a few 
thousand dollars.  It is a model that can be used all across this 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to deal with prevention is to start even before a 
woman becomes pregnant because then we could address issues such 
as fetal alcohol syndrome, which, incidentally, is the leading 
cause of preventable brain damage in our country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked in jails, both as a guard and as a physician.  I 
can tell the House that the number of people in prison suffering 
from FAS or FAE is epidemic. This is irreversible brain damage. 
The average IQ of these people is 67.  Their cognitive functions 
are impaired and their learning functions are impaired.  They 
have emotional difficulties and cannot function properly in 
school.  They are ostracised.  Many, unfortunately, turn to 
crime. They are often in home situations that are less than 
desirable. They have a one way ticket to a life that none of us 
would wish upon anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a preventable problem and I do not hear a peep from the 
other side.  I implore, plead and beg the ministers on the other 
side to use the head start program, listen to their cabinet 
members, look at the three models I have described, Moncton, 
Ypsilanti and Hawaii, and work with members from across party 
lines to do what they said they would do for kids.  They should 
use existing resources to employ the head start program.  The 
House has adopted it, supported it and passed it.  They should do 
it for our children and do it now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I enjoy the debates of my colleagues, both in the 
House and in the medical profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to say that patients come first as far as our 
health care system is concerned, but profit, never.  When the 
member made the comment that not a penny was coming from the 
public purse for private health care, I must remind him that when 
a profit institution exists through our tax system, some money 
does come from the public purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he said that doctors have gone to the United States.  I 
must say that it has been my privilege to have trained in the 
United States and decided to be a Canadian.  Just because we have 
an excellent medicare system it does mean that we have to settle 
for the status quo?  Of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health has made it clear that we have to go 
forward and institute meaningful reform.  What he said earlier 
this afternoon was that money alone, important as it is, was not 
the only means for a solution.  He said that we must have 
leadership and that leadership means we must have ideas, vision, 
planning and good management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised that the member debating did not consider the 
option in his debate that we can reform the health care system 
and make it even better without creating a parallel private 
system.  For example, we can have a national health information 
system.  We can re-orient our practice guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member opposite if his party is opposed to the CHST 
transfer.  Is he committed to a full privatization if he believes 
that this is so good?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all we support 
access of patients to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned that the minister talked about meaningful 
change.  He said we want to talk about reform, ideas, vision, 
planning.  What reform?  What vision?  What ideas?  What 
planning?  I have not heard a single reasonable specific 
suggestion from the minister ever on how we can ensure that 
people will have access to health care when they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is not all of the answer but it is part of it.  When every 
single hospital in Quebec is running a deficit, no one can tell 
me that all of those hospitals are mismanaged. Those hospitals 
and the nurses and doctors in them are trying to cobble together 
a system for the people of Quebec but they do not have the 
resources to do the job. No one can tell me that when I cannot 
find a pillow for a patient with congestive heart failure in the 
emergency department that it is good health care, or that money 
does not make a difference.  We need both.  We need ideas for 
reconstructing our health care system and we need the money to do 
the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put it in a nutshell.  The member knows full well what I 
am talking about.  There is the aging population, the more 
expensive technology, the fact that we are asking for more, that 
we have more demand, the fact that our tax base will shrink 
because more people will be retired than working.  Those are the 
facts and that is where the squeeze exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put patients first.  Is an institute that puts 
patients first and makes a profit a bad thing?  Will we begrudge 
that?  That is not the issue.  The issue is to make sure that no 
Canadians will be deprived of health care because they do not 
have enough money in their pockets.  All of us would support that 
to the end of our days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not support is the system right now where governments 
prevent Canadians from getting access to health care because they 
are withdrawing and withholding support because they do not have 
the money.  And because governments do not have the money, 
patients are not getting access to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1960s people did not have access to health care because 
they did not have money in their pockets.  Now it is governments 
that are depriving people of health care because they do not have 
the money in their pockets.  Surely there is a middle ground.  I 
have articulated it.  We want to make sure that patients get 
health care.  I have shown them the way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's remarks; it was a very 
good speech.  I want the member to comment on the ad hoc 
approach, the undisciplined approach, the year by year, day by 
day approach the government has taken in regard to health care 
for seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister this morning when he was in the House talked about 
this new idea of co-operation and getting together with the 
health ministers. The government has had seven years to do it.  I 
wonder why the government has waited so long to come up with this 
so-called meaningful dialogue with the provinces.  Obviously the 
provinces are the primary care givers and an important part of 
the equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to couple the lack of funding with the biggest issue 
before the House in the last month or so, the difficulties within 
HRDC.  If we look at the estimates the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has received an additional $1.3 billion 
this year alone.  Health care, supposedly the number one issue in 
Canada, is receiving $2.5 billion over four years. The other 
point is the minister of HRDC is receiving $200 million in 
discretionary funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is there this disjointed approach within the present 
government in terms of addressing the number one issue, yet 
giving back money to a department that has clearly mismanaged 
what it does have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague has been 
a very strong spokesperson for better health care for Canadians 
for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot answer some of the questions and only the government 
can answer some of them itself.  We would all be very interested 
in knowing the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government has waited seven years is absolutely 
outrageous.  For reasons I do not understand, on the issue of 
health care the government has been in intellectual purgatory for 
a very long time. 
That is a crying shame.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague has worked with me on the issue of organ 
donation.  We gave the government a plan supported by our 
respective parties that would save 175 lives a year.  The plan is 
there.  What has the government done?  Nothing.  It has done 
nothing on this issue.  It is a motherhood issue and it has done 
nothing on it which is absolutely bizarre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of why the government has a piecemeal approach, I 
want to reiterate that it has been far too attractive for the 
government to hide behind the Canada Health Act and say, “We are 
the defenders of health care.  We are the defenders who make sure 
that people have access to health care when they need it”.  It 
has been far too attractive for the government to do that because 
that is what Canadians want.  But it has been done at the expense 
of invigorating and changing our health care system so that 
Canadians do get access to health care, so that they are not 
financially deprived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who get hurt the most by the government's inaction 
and posturing are the poor and middle class.  That is a shame 
because none of us in the House want to see that happen.  Again 
health care is a political football and it has been used to 
political advantage instead of to the patient's advantage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
enjoyed the debate on health care today. It is healthy for us to 
get down to the nitty-gritty of what makes the health care system 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These days we are remembering the first anniversary of the death 
of my aunt who was in a publicly funded hospital in Saskatchewan. 
I wanted to say that because otherwise people would think that 
this has to be Ralph Klein's fault.  But she was in Saskatchewan, 
the home of medicare.  Basically she got terrible care.  I hate 
to say this but it is true.  She fell out of bed after having a 
stroke, not once, not twice, not three times but four times 
because there was no staff available. When she rang for help no 
one came. Finally she tried to get out of bed herself in order to 
go to the washroom and she fell and injured herself terribly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally her family said enough of this.  They moved her from 
that publicly funded hospital to a care centre that is operated 
by a religious organization. She got excellent care there until 
she passed away about a year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how we cut it, there is deep trouble in the public 
health care system when for whatever reason, and whether it is 
the federal or the provincial government that is involved, there 
is not enough money to hire enough staff so that people who are 
in hospital can be looked after in a reasonable fashion.  It is 
atrocious that the Liberal government with all its cuts to health 
care has hampered the ability of provinces like Saskatchewan to 
provide health care for its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces simply do not have the money.  They are still forced 
to send taxpayers' dollars to Ottawa and they do not get them 
back in proportion. I would like the hon. member to comment on 
the actual funding part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is the 
government has ripped out $21 billion from transfers to the 
provinces over the last seven years while it has been hammering 
the provinces and continues to hammer the provinces to ensure 
that people get the health care when they need it. That is the 
cold-hearted reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said before, we cannot say to the taxpayers that more money 
will be forthcoming in the future to cover all that we ask for. 
Certainly the government should put back what it has taken away. 
That is the minimum obligation.  We will continue to fight the 
fight to ensure that happens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds—Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
your information I will be sharing my time with the hon. member 
from Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak on the opposition motion, which I consider 
very important. I too have concerns about access to necessary 
health care, including emergency room services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crowded emergency rooms create numerous problems involving 
various factors. As we know, there is a shortage of doctors 
after hours, there are not enough beds available, and a good 
number of the available beds are occupied by patients requiring 
long term care because home care and community services do not 
meet the needs of these people. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are but a few of the reasons why emergency rooms may have 
to turn back ambulances for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the health minister already said, this long-standing situation 
is unacceptable. That being said, we cannot logically deal with 
the issue of short term hospital services without studying the 
whole care program. We need an integrated health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To increase accessibility, we have to change our practices and 
our way of delivering health care services. However, we must 
make appropriate changes that will ensure the future of our 
medicare system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned by my colleague, the Minister of Health, two 
elements are essential. First, a change is needed in the way 
primary health care services are delivered in our communities. 
Second, home and community care must be provided so as to ensure 
that long term, rehabilitative and chronic care beds are 
available as required, and to free beds for short term care in 
hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are also the main priorities that health ministers have 
indicated at their last annual meeting. We all agree on the need 
to resolve those urgent concerns. Now we must take action. We 
need a plan to implement these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If primary health care were provided in a different way in 
communities across the country, the problem of crowded emergency 
rooms would be resolved. 
Different models were proposed. However, if we do not change the 
way primary health care services are provided, we will not meet 
the needs of the communities. We will not succeed in alleviating 
the pressure on the emergency rooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not put the emphasis on prevention and health 
promotion, we will not be able to take maximum advantage of the 
skills of all the health care providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we must agree first on the kind of reform needed to 
provide integrated and full primary health care services. Then 
we must develop outside hospitals ways of dealing with those who 
need home and community care. I think there is a direct link 
between the availability of home and community care and the 
pressure on the hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If emergency wards are crowded, it is due in part to the 
shortage of space caused by patients who cannot go home, but do 
not have access to chronic, rehabilitative or long term care 
beds. They are stuck there and they occupy the beds that those 
on stretchers in the emergency wards could use. In this respect, 
home care is one solution among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through facilitation, co-ordination and co-operation, the 
government will help the provinces and territories to implement a 
clear and coherent vision of a renewed, integrated and 
comprehensive health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about funding. As we know, the premiers expressed 
the need for additional funding for the health care system and 
will continue to do so. Last year the federal government invested 
$11.5 billion in health care through the Canada health and social 
transfer, or CHST. It was the most important one-time investment 
ever made by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased federal funding for health care was provided to the 
provinces and territories to them alleviate immediate public 
concerns, such as overcrowded emergency rooms, long waiting 
lists and diagnostic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, budget 2000 increased by $2.5 billion over four 
years CHST funding for health care and post-secondary education. 
This increase raised the level of transfers to $15.5 billion for 
2000-01 and subsequent years. 
Through the increase in cash transfers, coupled with increasing 
tax transfers, the CHST will reach an all time high of 
$30.8 billion in 2000-01. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 2003-04, total transfers to the CHST should reach 
$32.7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased federal transfers will provide for a stable growth of 
transfers and will ensure that high quality health care will be 
available to anyone who needs it.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have fully restored what was commonly known as the health 
component of the CHST to the levels existing before the spending 
reduction period of the mid 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is not only about money, it is about the way this 
money is used. It is crucial to understand that the Canadian 
medicare system will not be able to give Canadians an 
appropriate access to quality health care in the years to come 
if it is not renewed considerably through co-operation and 
innovations. Status quo is not an option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the management and delivery of health care 
services, innovative approaches to renewing Canada's public 
system of health care will be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the challenge will be to find a way to accomplish this 
while maintaining the fundamentals of medicare. Through the 
health transition fund, the Government of Canada provides funds 
for innovative pilot projects, based on four priorities, 
including primary health care, home care and community care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many projects funded by the HTF look at ways to improve the use 
of emergency rooms and access to alternative services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HTF projects allow us to collect and analyse data on what works 
and what does not. We must cope with change, learn from the past 
and use the knowledge we gain from the pilot projects carried 
out across our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, in order to settle the crisis in the emergency 
rooms, we must start by dealing with primary health care, home 
care and community health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, the Minister of Health wrote to his provincial 
counterparts, proposing a meeting in May to develop a plan that 
would make these items a reality. The minister will certainly 
keep you informed of any new development arising from this 
meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that the answer is not simply to increase funding. The 
federal government, the provinces and the territories must work 
together. 
If we keep on doing what we have always done, we will continue 
to achieve the same results, with emergency rooms turning away 
ambulances and problems regarding accessibility to services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the necessary resources, incentives and environment to 
implement changes that will allow us to improve our health care 
system and to provide Canadians with a comprehensive, integrated 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are proud of their health care system, which was built 
over the years. We will protect it and make the changes 
necessary to ensure that it remains a part of our Canadian 
heritage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my hon. colleague's comments regarding 
our motion and the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the importance of pharmacare, home care and 
community care.  I would be the first to agree that those are 
very important aspects of our health care system. I am wondering 
if the hon. member has any comments as to why the government 
would not have given something very concrete in providing 
assistance or resources for those areas of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the budget has indicated that further down the road 
there will be discussions with the provinces around some of these 
issues.  Knowing that the budget was coming up and knowing that 
health care was the number one priority of Canadians right across 
the country, I am wondering why we are looking further down the 
road.  Why could there not have been some leadership taken prior 
to the budget to establish a very clear indication of the 
resources that would be available to assist provinces with these 
very important areas of concern? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It sounds as if this is an afterthought, something left hanging 
out there, something that is up to the provinces to initiate.  I 
would suggest that the federal government has the responsibility 
to show leadership and make sure there is a good national 
standard of health care right across the country.  Leadership 
should be taken by the federal government to ensure that those 
kinds of programs are put in place and are properly resourced.

for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very good question, but the member knows that this is 
a funding issue and not a leadership issue. We know that there 
is a provincial jurisdiction in that matter and that we cannot 
move forward without a consensus of all provincial and federal 
health ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, my home province, we are ahead of all other Canadian 
provinces in that we have local community service centres or 
CLSCs as well as home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have thus taken a shift to ambulatory care, which is very 
important and quite appreciated by the people. But, before 
applying this to all provinces, there must be consensus and true 
dialogue between the provincial ministers and the federal 
minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask my colleague a question and make a comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1969, if hon. members will recall, the federal government's 
share of the health care system costs in Canada was 50%. Today, 
in the year 2000, its share has dropped to 15.3%, and that 
includes the new investment of $2.5 billion. This is quite a 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the American system, people have to pay to get 
real health care. This is what Canadians want to avoid. Since 
the the budget was brought down in the House on Monday, 
Canadians from all across the country have expressed their 
opinion and the premiers of all the provinces indicated their 
disagreement with the way the federal government supports health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, if the federal government contributes only 15%, 
the provinces have to kick in 85%. Can we imagine what that will 
cost the provinces? If the federal government really wants to 
preserve health care and avoid privatization, is my colleague 
across the way ready to admit we are facing an urgent situation, 
especially when we consider the reactions of the Premier of 
Alberta, of Premier Mike Harris and of the Premier of 
Newfoundland, Brian Tobin? He said “We will have to come to 
Ottawa to get the money, because this makes no sense 
whatsoever”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were the words of an important member of the Liberal 
Party, a man who is respected by the Prime Minister of Canada. He 
supported the other premiers, who claim that there is not enough 
money for health care. There is nothing more important than 
health. Health is what matters. We need the federal government 
and its 50:50 partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst for his question.  I totally agree that we should 
not fall for what the Reform Party and the Progressive 
Conservative Party propose on this issue. We have to maintain a 
public system open to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the funding issue, I think we should question quite a 
number of things, but the main issue is that we must put the 
patient first. This is what is missing now. In Canada, there are 
too many technocrats, who deal with all sorts of things, and the 
patient is not the major concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When provinces get the opportunity to do whatever they can to 
make the patient the top priority and when the medical and 
nursing stakeholders return to the decision making circles 
within provincial governments, then I am sure we will have the 
necessary funds to provide adequate medical services to people.

government places on health care, particularly with regard to 
federal transfers to the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 18, for the fourth consecutive year, our government 
chose to increase transfers to the provinces and territories 
through the Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 2000 budget, we announced the transfer of a further $2.5 
billion to the provinces and territories to be used over four 
years for post-secondary education and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $2.5 billion is in addition to the greatest investment in 
the history of our government that was announced in the 1999 
budget, an investment of $11.5 billion for health care alone.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The 2000 federal budget proves once again that the health of 
Canadians and the future of their health care system are among 
the federal government's top priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada health and social transfer is the most important 
federal transfer to the provinces. It provides cash transfers 
and tax points to the provinces and territories to support 
health care, post-secondary education, social services and 
welfare programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada health and social transfer is a block funding 
mechanism. 
It allows provinces and territories to grant funds to social

Because these last few weeks in my region, 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue, the members of the Parti Quebecois have 
often talked about the issue of federal transfers, and I wish to 
present a summary of what was said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2000-01, the Canada health and social transfer to provinces 
and territories will reach a new height, $31 billion. Of this, 
there will be $15.3 billion in tax points and $15.5 in cash 
transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A transfer of tax points is an important part of the ongoing 
support provided by the federal government to provincial and 
territorial social programs. 
A tax point transfer occurs when the federal government reduces 
its tax rate and allows the provinces to raise their tax rate by 
an equivalent amount. With such a measure, the provinces can get 
more revenues without increasing the total tax burden of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By next year, CHST transfers to provinces and territories will 
be $960 per person and, by 2003-04, $985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends of the Parti Quebecois in Abitibi-Témiscamingue should 
know that, under the CHST, the Government of Quebec will obtain 
$992 per person in 1999-00, $1,026 in 2000-01, $1,011 in 2001-02, 
$1,024 in 2002-03 and $1,038 in 2003-04. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as the government has said many times, we cannot stop 
there. The challenge facing the health care sector does not 
involve only money, it primarily involves changes to the health 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its last throne speech, the government reaffirmed its 
commitment to move forward with its provincial and territorial 
partners and with the health care sector on common priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those priorities include testing of innovations in integrated 
delivery of services in areas such as home care and drug 
insurance, making sure that citizens from every region of 
Canada, and rural areas in particular, have improved access 
through a modern health information system to up-to-date 
information on health issues and treatment options, to enable 
them to make better informed choices, and protecting the health 
of Canadians by strengthening the Canadian food safety program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge for the government is to identify what changes are 
required and how the various governments can co-operate to meet 
the health needs of Canadians now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government took the commitment to protect the five 
tenets of health care as stated in the Canada Health Act. These 
are: public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, 
portability and accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They reflect the will to give all Canadians reasonable access to 
insured hospital and medical services in accordance with the 
prepayment formula and under the same conditions everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past year, the health ministers of Quebec and the other 
provinces made substantial progress in identifying what must be 
done to meet the short and long term health needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They acknowledged unanimously that co-operation was the best way 
of ensuring Canadians of access to quality care and to the 
information required to make informed decisions for enhanced 
health and well-being.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that dollars and cents are not enough.  There must be 
investment in health care in order to have an accurate idea of 
the quality of care provided and the extent to which the system 
yields good results as far as health is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quality of care is not merely a matter of funding. 
Consideration must also be given to the efficiency and 
appropriateness of care, treatment and services delivered to the 
Canadian people, and the integration of those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal, provincial and territorial governments cannot 
afford to use our limited resources for health care in an 
inefficient manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the federal government is vigorously in favour of 
striking a partnership for reforming and renewing the health 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial and territorial ministers of health have been 
invited to meet together in May of 2000 to discuss three key 
issues that must be settled in order to fully resolve the 
recurring problems in the system and to restore public 
confidence in health insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue is this: to change the way primary care is 
delivered, in order to improve access and to adapt human 
resource-related policies in order to facilitate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second: to enhance home and community care and to examine 
national objectives in order to integrate these types of care 
into the health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third one: to strengthen co-operation between the federal 
government, the provinces and the territories in accounting for 
the system's performance for the Canadian public, in releasing 
information on the results obtained and in establishing the 
bases for public debate on the standards for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the 1999 and 2000 budgets have shown, the federal government 
recognizes that stable and predictable federal funding in the 
health sector is important to ensure the provinces and 
territories can meet the immediate needs of their residents and 
plan for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada health and social transfer provides this stability 
and predictability by guaranteeing an annual financial transfer 
of $15.5 billion starting in 2000-01 and an overall transfer that 
will increase to nearly $33 billion in 2003-04. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the governments stopped debating about levels of 
funding of six or seven years ago and began facing challenges of 
the Canadian health care system before them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, like the provincial and territorial 
governments, recognizes that in the future decisions on 
investments in health care will have to be based on a plan 
reflecting this desire of Canadians, that the approach to health 
care will have to be better integrated, new resources will have 
to be used to meet this need of Canadians, which is to have a 
quality system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to work together to achieve this shared objective of 
revitalizing our health care system so it will provide 
accessible, viable and high quality health care to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, to the nurses, hospital staffs in Canada and to all 
the doctors who, today, are caring for Canadians, I say thank 
you for your support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik talk about the health 
care system, about the billions and billions of dollars that the 
federal Liberal government has put into health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some more percentages.  I do not know whether my 
colleague remembers that, in 1969, when the Liberal government 
was in power—the governments that followed did the same thing—it 
began to make cuts, with the result that transfers to the 
provinces are now 15% of what they were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member agree with me that today in Canada our children 
or our parents have to wait for treatment in hospital corridors, 
that people have to wait six months for cancer treatment or for 
a heart operation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my sisters-in-law was operated on for cancer in Quebec City 
in January. 
She had to go to Augusta in the United States for her 
treatments.  She had to stay five weeks and the treatments cost 
Canada or Quebec $18,5000.  Here in Canada we are not even 
capable of treating our own citizens.  I would like to know 
where the member stands on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree that the federal government should change its 
approach to provincial transfer payments so that our parents and 
our children do not find themselves stuck in hospital corridors 
waiting for care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, the NDP member told us about 1969 
and made reference to the province of Quebec. He told us about 
how his sister-in-law had to go to the United States for an 
operation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 Quebecers paid $28 billion in taxes to the federal 
government, which then gave back between $34 billion and $35 
billion to the province. Quebec always stood to gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is deplorable to see patients in hospital corridors and 
people being transferred to the United States. But we learned 
one thing yesterday: it is not strictly a matter of money. 
The fact is that Quebec left money dormant in the 
Toronto-Dominion Bank, in Toronto. Meanwhile, the Quebec minister 
of health, Pauline Marois, was making every attempt to get money 
in February of last year. There was none for the hon. member's 
sister-in-law. The money was dormant in Toronto and people were 
not receiving the treatments they need. This was dereliction of 
duty on the part of the separatist government in Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is easy to 
assess the situation in Quebec when we are not there to look at 
the finances, but the problem is the same for Quebec and the 
other provinces. Quebec is not the only one in that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is money in trusts and there are funds for ad hoc needs, 
but this does not allow the provinces to set up a longer term 
management structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, some money is in trust and some is in the Quebec 
government's overall budget. The Minister of Finance decided to 
use the surplus money, not the money in trust, because that 
money will be needed next year to meet the 4% annual budget 
increase for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before making such comments, the member should look at what the 
federal government has done to the provinces. The Liberals may 
boast about the $2.5 billion over four years, but this is not 
what the provinces need to meet the requirements relating to the 
restructuring of our health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, one day people will talk about 
the Quebec minister of finance and his statement that “the 
health problem is not a matter of money”.  That is what Mr. 
Landry said yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has referred to trust funds.  The amount was put 
in trust by the federal government, but Quebec could have 
immediate transferred that amount of $842 million for the care of 
all those people lined up in hospital corridors or on waiting 
lists, instead of sending them to the States.  That is quite a 
substantial amount, $842 million, not to mention the interest. 
One has to remember the interest.  We learned this last evening, 
12 months after the federal government gave the money in question 
to the province of Quebec. And they talk of shortages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not just talk about trusts. Let us talk about the region 
of Abitibi—Témiscamingue. 
I have an excerpt here from a daily newspaper in the 
Vallée-de-l'Or region, the <I>Parlemenu</I>.  The article by Denis 
LaBrecque addresses the shortage of physicians in remote areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region is far from Quebec City and far from Ottawa, and 
there is a shortage of doctors.  In part, the article reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the health, education and business sectors 
met together in Val-d'Or Tuesday evening to address the 
situation.  At the same time, they reviewed all of the 
initiatives taken to date in an attempt to remedy the situation, 
none of them as yet successfully. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solutions must be sought together.  With all the political 
parties and all the provincial governments, new approaches must 
be found. 
Let us move on this, and perhaps we will manage to improve 
things for those who are sick. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in this debate, because I feel particularly 
concerned as a Bloc Quebecois member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are debating a motion from the NDP asking that 
adequate moneys be put back into health to meet the various 
expectations in that sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of members addressed this issue, including some who are 
doctors by training. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT77"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT77"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Depending on which party we represent, we have a different 
reading of the situation. The Liberal Party—a fellow member who 
is a doctor addressed the issue—tends to put the blame on public 
servants, on those who manage health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I would rather agree with the opposition's reading 
of the health care situation. Obviously, this view does not 
agree with that of the Liberal Party. Members from opposition 
parties who have some experience in the health sector told us 
that there is also a serious funding problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean there is no need to review our ways of doing 
things, to adjust. We know that several factors are disrupting 
the traditional ways of doing things in the health sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about this issue, before dealing with our minor 
disagreement with a Liberal member about the $841 million in 
trust that were given by the Liberal government and that were 
supposed to be spent within three years. We could ask why the 
Liberal government is not putting back into the Canada social 
transfer moneys that come back year after year, to meet regular 
expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are non recurrent amounts and the provinces probably have 
a hard time anticipating the necessary margins to deal with very 
urgent problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dynamic in the health care sector in Canada and particularly 
in Quebec is such that a greater adjustment will be required for 
the ageing population. Fortunately for Quebec, although 
unfortunately in other ways, we have the lowest infant mortality 
rate of all Canadian provinces.  That having been said, funding 
is needed so that we can meet the need for more health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in Quebec the mortality rate is 4.6% for every 
1,000 births while in Canada it is 5.6% or 5.7%.  Earlier, I was 
a bit insulted to hear the Liberal member say that in Canada, 
and in Quebec in particular, they are doing a poor job of 
managing their budgets, that they are not spending them on the 
right services and that our health care system is not effective 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would qualify this. 
If, for instance, our infant mortality rate is lower than the 
rest of Canada's, this means that our health care services—we 
must not be too partisan—generally meet the population's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For five years now, there have been cuts to the system that have 
gone a long way towards eliminating the deficit.  We know that 
public finances are in very, very good shape in Canada.  The 
surplus was originally estimated at $95 billion, and is now 
estimated at $137 billion.  Some put it at around $167 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such a large surplus, this government could have committed 
a much larger amount. But it announced $2.5 billion, again in a 
trust, that the provinces will be able to spend over a four-year 
period. 
It may well have thought this was enough but I think that the 
needs of the health care system are much more pressing than the 
government wants to admit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is increasing pressure on demand.  We know that there 
have been demographic changes, technological developments and 
the emergence of new needs.  I will go into this a bit later on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major changes have been made to the organization of social and 
health care services in a very short period.  Quebec had no 
choice.  It was already behind other countries and some 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Significant gains were made in the move to ambulatory care and 
in the increased efficiency of the health care network. 
However, there are weak spots and sectors to be consolidated, 
waiting lists for surgery, emergencies to be recognized, human 
resources to be shouldered and equipment to be replaced.  All of 
this brings with it the challenges of rectifying the situation 
in the health care sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The network's financial situation must also be rectified and its 
functioning improved.  We agree on that. 
However, the federal government has to help with financial 
support for the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the course of the health care system, we see that, 
between 1975 and 1994, public spending often grew faster than 
did the public purse.  Since 1994, the Government of Quebec has 
taken major steps to balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care spending increases by 4% annually.  In the coming 
years, we will have to come to terms with this urgency to meet 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the trust fund in Toronto, a certain 
perspective is required on the demands that will be made in the 
coming years, and this involves a variety of reasons, which I 
can give later.  The population is ageing and this will lead to 
increased demand in various areas of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shift to ambulatory care means moving some medical 
procedures out of hospitals. We know we have to learn how to 
better deal with the new demands on the health care system. We 
have to increase the proportion of actual day surgery as 
compared to potential day surgery from 72% to 88%, bring down 
the hospitalization rate for surgery from 32.8 to 23.9 per 
1,000, and lower the total number of hospitalizations by 11.5%. 
This is the approach we have to follow with regard to the shift 
to ambulatory care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average hospital stay needs to be shortened. In medicine, it 
should be 7.5 days instead of 8.8, and in surgery, 8.2 instead 
of 8.7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still room for improvement to better deal with these 
new demands and meet the challenges of the shift to ambulatory 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a financial point of view, since 1994-1995, the Quebec 
government has been trying to put a lid on its expenses while 
still doing a good job, and it has worked. I will not get into 
the details of the cases reported on a daily basis by the papers 
over the last couple of years. I believe the Quebec government 
is trying hard to bring some measure of efficiency to the health 
care system while giving it the tools necessary to respond 
quickly and appropriately to health care needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the institutions experiencing financial difficulties, 
there has been a significant effort to streamline operations. 
However, it has not been enough to offset the impact of the 
upward pressure on costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with dealing with new technology. We are faced with 
dealing with a more expensive approach to care than 20 years 
ago. 
The shift to ambulatory care has allowed the streamlining of the 
system, but other factors are putting upward pressures on 
expenses, namely demographic changes, the development of new 
technologies, and new needs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that the number of people over the age of 65 will be 
60% higher in 2011 than it was in 1991, and the increase will be 
even greater for the 85-plus age group. In 2011, there will be 
84% more people aged 85.  In 2030, 25% of Quebecers will be over 
the age of 65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the changes that have just been made in the 
health system are intended precisely to respond to the fact that 
the population of Quebec is ageing more rapidly than elsewhere 
in Canada and other countries as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a table here which illustrates the fact that it will take 
35 years for the percentage of the Quebec population aged 65 or 
over to rise from 12% to 24%. 
It shows 35 years for Quebec to reach that level; Canada, 45; 
Germany, 65; France, 70 and England, 75.  There were many 
children born at a certain time in our history.  A number of my 
colleagues are baby-boomers, and they will reach the honourable 
age of 60 or 65 in about another ten years and be users of the 
health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The population of Quebec is ageing at an amazing rate.  This 
must be addressed.  A strategy is needed for the approach to 
health care, but money is needed as well, in order to support 
all the new technologies and all the new methodologies.  It is 
said that the ageing of the population of Quebec will be twice 
that of the European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health system is experiencing the pressures of demographic 
change.  I will explain the implications of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the emergency departments, for example, there were 50,000 
more people lying on stretchers in 1998 and 1999 than there were 
in 1994 and 1995. 
Of these, 56% were age 75 and older.  The reason for 
overcrowding in emergency rooms is that more people have been 
going there since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In radiation oncology, needs are increasing rapidly, 
particularly for people over 50.  The first baby boomers have 
already reached that age.  New cases of cancer are increasing at 
the rate of 3% a year.  We must be able to respond to this 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true in cardiology.  Needs are increasing, 
particularly from age 50 on.  More coronary bypasses are being 
performed on seniors.  The number of heart surgeries is 
increasing by 3.6% a year and there has been a 260% increase in 
angioplasties in the last ten years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other specialties, the fact that people are living longer and 
that there is an increase in the number of very elderly people 
is adding to needs. 
The number of cataract surgeries has increased by 8% in the last 
three years, and 30% in the last two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an increasing need in various specialties to cope with 
all those who need treatment and who require new technologies, 
more doctors, and more people who are able to respond adequately 
to all these emergencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a boom in the 1980s, particularly with respect to 
medical technologies, drugs and information.  For example, 
medical imaging technologies now allow speedier and more 
effective intervention but cost more.  The Liberal member who 
says that we are not capable of spending money effectively has a 
short term view of what is going on in the health care sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She really does not know what is going on.  She really must not 
be familiar with the new dynamics, the new pressures resulting 
from demographic change or the system's difficulties in meeting 
these needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending on medication can be said to have increased, and Quebec 
is a leader in this area with a drug plan.  There are also new 
requirements in the field of health, new problems have arisen, 
such as AIDS, Alzheimer's disease and related illnesses.  In 
1999, there were 66,183 such cases, and today there are 103,783. 
Some people require more services in their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking at the annual 4% increase in spending in the health 
sector, we must also look at all the new dynamics.  We cannot 
say it is the fault of the provinces for having badly managed 
health services.  We must take a new tack in dealing with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think anyone is acting in bad faith.  There are new 
dynamics, perhaps they were unforeseen, but they must be dealt 
with in the coming years. With the money we get from the federal 
government, more has to be done with less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada social transfer was higher in 1993 than it is today. 
When we are told the figure will be $2.4 billion compared with 
what we were given prior to 1993, when there were fewer 
requirements, I can understand why everything is going awry.  I 
can understand as well that the problem does not lie in Quebec 
alone.  It is present in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard members of the NDP, the Reform Party and the 
Progressive Conservative Party from all regions of Canada 
describe the same problem. Therefore, I am a little disappointed 
to hear overblown speeches that are disconnected from the 
reality of everyday life, this for the sole purpose of boasting 
about giving $2.4 billion, again in a trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A trust is not what will enable us to implement long term 
strategies to determine how much hospitals can spend on supplies 
and on staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are certainly prepared to look at the situation, but we still 
need money to support those who work in the health sector. We 
hear that some people feel exhausted and belittled. I think that 
even nowadays the pay, the work and the achievements of these 
people should make them feel appreciated. 
A decent salary allows a person to take a vacation and to feed 
his or her children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at the health sector as a whole and not use a 
piecemeal approach to avoid doing our duty. If we ask a lot from 
the federal government, it is because we give it billions of 
dollars in taxes, $31 billion to be precise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have a lot more to add, but I will conclude by saying 
that the way the government intends to fund the Canada social 
transfer, that is in an ad hoc fashion, through trusts, will not 
allow the provinces to plan in the long term and to meet long 
term needs in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about our ageing population. We need to pay attention to 
this phenomenon, as we may be the next ones to ask for adequate 
care, because of health problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate my colleague from Quebec for her eloquence. I 
thought her speech was just brilliant. However, I also heard 
brilliant but demagogic speeches from certain Liberal members, 
in particular with regard to the $842 million being mismanaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard my colleague say, at the beginning of her speech, that 
she would get back to that issue, but I suppose she got carried 
away and did not have time to do so. 
I want to give her the opportunity to give us and particularly 
to give our colleagues opposite an explanation about the 
headlines which we saw in the newspapers today and which have 
been used extensively by our political opponents to try to show 
us once again that we are incapable of good management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague to make a brief comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
giving me extra time to explain what a malicious deed the 
setting up of the trust by the government really was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the federal government invested $3.5 billion in the 
last budget and gave the provinces the right to spend this over 
the following three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments also planned to inject some funds into the 
financial area, and Quebec had decided on a figure of $2 billion 
in investments.  Initially, its plan was for $1.7 billion, plus 
an additional $300 million for health during fiscal 1999-2000 and 
2000-2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec made that investment. Instead of taking 
the $841 million from the fund—knowing that it will need this 
money for the next budget, investment in health being far from 
over, for all the reasons I have given—the Government of Quebec 
is going to have a surplus because the government made that 
investment. The Government of Quebec is going to draw upon the 
surplus instead of the trust fund, because what is in that fund 
will be needed for a long term health investment strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not worried about how the Government of Quebec is going to 
spend that trust money.  We know it will go for health, but a 
strategy is needed, and that is what the Government of Quebec is 
going to address. 
By taking the $841 million from the budget surplus, the 
Government of Quebec has made health a priority, rather than 
setting having a budget surplus as its priority, as this 
government has. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was 
with great interest and attention that I listened to my 
colleague, the member for Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish all government members had been present to hear what is 
going on in the health care sector, not just in Quebec, but 
throughout Canada.  I think we have just been given an accurate 
picture of what is going on throughout Canada, and the member 
for Québec has just outlined for us the long-term needs of the 
provinces and of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague whether she thinks that this 
government needs to interfere so blatantly in health care with 
the Canada social transfer.  That was what it wanted to do with 
the CHST, but the Government of Quebec refused to go along.  I 
would like her to tell us about Quebec's real concerns in the 
health care sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will begin by saying that 
the Canada social transfer represents an annual shortfall of 
$1.7 billion.  When the government announces that the provinces 
will be getting back $2.5 billion over four years, that leaves 
Quebec terribly short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada social transfer is $1.7 billion, but $875 million go to 
health, $375 million to education and $450 million to social 
assistance.  Do people realize what the loss of $875 million 
means in practical terms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means 3,000 doctors and 5,000 nurses.  The $375 million would 
hire 5,800 university professors and there would be another 
$325 million for income security for those on social assistance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are being given a difficult choice.  This is 
terrible and has got to stop.  I hope that the meeting of the 
health ministers will lead to something, that this government 
will be made to understand that it is up to the provinces to 
meet the public's pressing demands.  It is not up to the federal 
government to take over from the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there had been enough money, if the government had done its 
homework, if $18.8 billion had been made available—the amount the 
provinces are entitled to expect in order to meet health care 
needs—I could perhaps say the provinces had not done their 
homework and had mismanaged their budget.  Instead of increasing 
this $18.8 billion, what has the government been doing?  It has 
been cutting it back. 
To date, $31 billion has been taken away from the education, 
health care and social assistance network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time the public understood and the government stopped 
blaming the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak for Quebec, while you may be able to speak for your 
region, Mr. Speaker.  Honestly, I think that the Government of 
Quebec is trying to find practical and valid solutions.  It can 
meet the needs of its people.  We do not need the federal 
government, and certainly not the members on the government 
side, to give us any lessons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Broadview—Greenwood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to engage in this debate dealing with health 
care spending by the federal government and the provinces.  It 
seems to me that the problem is the whole issue of 
accountability.  To the people who are in their living rooms 
watching this debate and who are concerned about the health care 
issue, it is appropriate for us to ask not about whether it is 
new money we need, but how the money was spent in the past.  We 
can judge the sincerity of secondary levels of governments by how 
they are spending the actual moneys we transfer to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people have mentioned the report on what the 
province of Quebec did with some of its money.  It has taken it 
out of the account we provided last year and invested $841 
million in Quebec savings bonds and Hydro Quebec.  It has earned 
something like $16 million in interest.  The point is the money 
was not spent on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a lot of complaints from the province of Ontario, 
and Mr. Harris in particular, that it needs more money because 
the money provided in the last federal budget was not adequate. 
Ontario is pounding on the table and is really upset because it 
did not get enough money.  It is very appropriate that we sit 
down and ask what the province of Ontario did with the money it 
already had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am drawing my information not from my notes but from the 
Ontario government's budget book, pages 38 and 55 and from its 
third quarter fiscal results dated February 4, 2000.  Looking 
through those pages I see that of the $3.5 billion allocation 
that was made in fiscal year 1999-2000, the province of Ontario's 
share was $1.323 billion. I also see in the same books that the 
province of Ontario drew down $755 million on that account.  For 
those people who are watching the debate, it is very hard to 
relate billions and millions when most of us have a hard time 
finding $25 to put some gas in our tank.  It does not buy very 
much today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the equation, $1.323 billion was transferred to 
Ontario and it drew down $755 million, which left a balance of 
$568 million. 
Of the money we gave it last year, $568 million has remained 
unspent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if, like the province of Quebec, Ontario has 
invested it in securities and is earning interest on it.  The 
fact is that money is still sitting there. It has not spent it at 
all. The important part is $755 million went into the Ontario 
government coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the $755 million of new money, we had increased 
our normal allotment under the CHST by $190 million to the 
province of Ontario.  To get all my figures together, $190 
million plus the $755 million comes to $945 million.  That is 
$945 million of new money that went to the province of Ontario in 
fiscal year 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is what did the province of Ontario do with this 
new money?  The opposition party is saying it wants more money 
but what did Ontario do with the money it received? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked through the pages of the Ontario government 
expenditures. What have I discovered?  I have discovered that the 
new spending on health care for the province of Ontario for the 
1999-2000 fiscal year was $320 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about that.  The federal government put the money in a 
trust account.  Ontario took $755 million out of the trust 
account. We gave Ontario another $190 million of new money.  It 
had $945 million of new money.  How much new money did it spend 
on health care?  Only $320 million. The difference is $625 
million that the federal government transferred to the province 
of Ontario that it did not spend on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When thinking of a trust account, what is the concept of trust? 
We put money in trust and say, “We put it in trust for you and 
we trust you as a provincial government to spend it on your 
people and spend it for its original intention which is health 
care”.  What did the province of Ontario do?  Ontario withdrew 
this money in trust, $755 million, added it to another $190 
million in new money that we gave, and only spent $320 million in 
new dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is $625 million missing, $625 million of Canadian 
taxpayers' money that was transferred to the province of Ontario 
to undertake new spending in health care that never happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about accountability in government.  This is the problem 
with this whole debate.  People blame us for the health care 
system but we do not control how the money is being spent.  This 
is a clear example.  Mr. Harris has the audacity to shout all 
over the land today, “We need more money.  We did not get enough 
money from you guys”, when in fact the province of Ontario got 
$625 million new dollars which it stuck in its back pocket and 
never spent on the people of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were not enough, in its fiscal estimates the province of 
Ontario now anticipates an additional $1 billion surplus this 
fiscal year.  Is that not an amazing thing.  There is $625 
million seemingly missing and the province of Ontario now has a 
$1 billion surplus, a surplus $1 billion larger than it was going 
to have in the first place.  What did the province of Ontario do 
with this money?  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do know the province of Ontario spent $4.7 billion in tax 
cuts.  Perhaps that is what the Ontario government did with it. 
We know that it has done all kinds of other spending.  Worse than 
that we know it also raised its deficit by $20 billion. Those 
people in Ontario are spending money like drunken sailors, but it 
is not going into the health care system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the opposition have been saying that only 3 cents 
went to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Two cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Two cents.  Should we give the 
province of Ontario or the province of Quebec another 2 cents 
when that has been the track record?  Ontario took $625 million 
of our money, said it was going to spend it on health care and 
did not spend it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took money out of a trust account, which was being held in 
trust for the people of Ontario, and then did not spend it on 
them.  For all the people who are lined up in the wards, and for 
all the people who are having trouble with health care in 
Ontario, and in Quebec, ask where the $625 million went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe that is a better answer than blaming the federal 
government, because we gave it to them.  We spent it on the 
province of Ontario, but the province of Ontario did not spend it 
on the people.  It did not spend it on the sick.  It did not 
spend it on those people who are being threatened on a daily 
basis by disease.  It did not spend it on the frail.  It did not 
spend it on the aging.  I do not know what the province spent it 
on.  It spent it on its rich friends, I guess, or the $4.7 
billion in tax cuts, but it did not spend it on the province of 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not going to give the province any more money.  We should 
not have given it that money, if that is the way it spends.  We 
need an accountability system in the country which will tell us 
where the money has been spent and will ensure that it goes to 
the people.  Do not tell me it is about more money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
somewhat hypocritical to have members of the governing side talk 
about the accountability of taxpayer dollars after what we have 
been listening to for the last number of weeks concerning the 
human resources department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is any question that if taxpayer dollars 
for health care are not going to health care, the government 
should be doing something about it.  There is no question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government knows that is happening and it is not doing 
anything about it, then it is at fault because that money should 
be going to health care.  There is absolutely no question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is along the same lines as the EI dollars, the EI premiums 
that come in to give employment insurance benefits to the workers 
in Canada, for jobs and training throughout Canada, and to assist 
employers.  What did the government do with that money?  It used 
it to create a surplus.  It sounds an awful lot like the member's 
version of Mike Harris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he have to say about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, looking at the motion 
which is before us today, members of the NDP are co-conspirators 
with the Harris government because they have come to this place 
and said “Give us more money.  Mr. Harris wants more money. 
Give us more money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the co-conspirators with the likes of Mr. Harris and 
Mr. Klein, who have no intention of spending it on the people.

have seen it all in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have the gall to pass judgment on the way the 
provinces are managed. If the member wants to pass judgment on a 
province's administration, he should run for election in that 
particular province. I have always respected other levels of 
government. If I were him, I would be ashamed of what he just 
did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he not ashamed of what his government has been doing since 
1993-94, when it cut health, social and education transfer 
payments to the provinces by $38.7 billion? This has meant a 
shortfall of $30.5 billion for all the provinces since 1993. 
It is $11.1 billion in Quebec and $10.5 billion in Ontario.

that question was that I should be ashamed because I am standing 
here trying to prevent taxpayers' money from being misspent.  I 
am not ashamed at all.  I will defend the taxpayers of the 
province of Quebec if I have to.  The finance minister for Quebec 
is saying “It is not about money.  It is not about spending 
money. We cannot find the doctors, so we are not going to spend 
the money anyway”.

this debate.  I have always held a very high level of respect for 
the New Democratic Party and its commitment to this issue, but 
the notion that it would, without any discussion or exchange of 
ideas, want an immediate, substantial and sustained increase in 
cash transfers to the provinces absolutely boggles my mind.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  The member for Saint John is another

</I></B></P><P align=left>When my constituents listen to us talk, I think most of them

of millions there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no way, shape or form am I trying to put down my constituents 
or members, but I think we are going at this issue the wrong way. 
The member for Durham talked about this the other day.  We should 
be talking about re-engineering the health care system.  We 
should be going back to Emmett Hall's report to give our whole 
system a health check.  I have not heard one speech in the House 
today which mentioned health prevention.  How much emphasis do we 
put on health prevention in the debate today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a couple of specific examples.  A year and a half 
ago, in our sport committee where we were looking at the 
importance of having a physically active nation, we were told 
that men and women should spend at least half an hour a day doing 
some physical exercise.  The best doctors in our country appeared 
before us.  Those surgeons had studies that were ratified not 
only by our best, but by the best in the world, which stated that 
if we could increase Canadians' commitment to physical activity 
an additional 10% we could put downward pressure on health care 
costs within 18 months to the tune of $5 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we have a responsibility to mobilize the people 
of the nation to become more responsible toward themselves and to 
become more physically active.  Again I will go back to my 
colleague from Durham.  This is not just about giving Premier 
Harris or Premier Tobin blank cheques.  It is not about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not give anybody a blank cheque in this area because it 
would delay the process of re-engineering the system.  We need to 
go back to Emmett Hall's report, take some of those principles 
and reapply them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the whole realm of alternative medicine?  What about 
mental health?  What about the environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will we talk not only about sending cheques here or sending 
billions there?  When will we have a debate on the creative 
things we can do as members of parliament, as the House of 
Commons of Canada, which we can bring to the ministers of health 
and the premiers of the provinces? 
We all have a part to play.  I do not think we are talking about 
it enough in the House.  All we want to talk about is sending 
cheques here and there.  Is that what the House of Commons has 
become, a cheque writing machine?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many intelligent men and women in the House and we 
should be using our brains to put forward creative ideas.  Where 
are the creative ideas on fixing the health care system?  To 
quote my colleague from Durham, we should be re-engineering the 
system.  Is there anyone who disagrees that we have to 
re-engineer the system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the notion of Premier Klein wanting to privatize 
the system.  Let me tell my colleague from Cape Breton that with 
all of the eye surgery that was done in the province of Alberta, 
all the analyses show that private clinics cost more.  One of the 
things that makes this country great is the fact that everybody 
has access to the health care system.  That is one of our 
trademarks as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion that we would create an environment where premiers 
would be allowed to experiment with private health care boggles 
my mind.  NDP members would give blank cheques to Premier Harris 
and let— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No, 50:50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  That is what the motion says.  The 
motion says, announcing within one week of the passage of the 
motion a substantial and sustained increase in cash transfers. 
The NDP did not even put an amount on it.  It did not put an 
amount on what it would give.  I would not give my dear friend 
Brian Tobin a blank cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop talking about money and start talking about creative 
ideas.  What about mobilizing people to become more physically 
active?  What is wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say sincerely that I do not believe there is a single member 
of parliament who wants to be sitting here with a fragile health 
care system, and we all admit it is fragile.

the Minister of Health has it right.  He has said that he will 
sit down with the provincial ministers to negotiate a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a partisan issue.  I would appeal to all members to 
approach their premiers and let us cause them to think creatively 
on how we can bring down health care costs.  Let us get into the

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On its face the motion may appear to be a rather technical and 
arcane matter of concern only to a small community of 
genealogists and amateur historians, but in fact the motion 
speaks to a very important matter about access to our shared 
history as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of this place will know, having been contacted 
undoubtedly by members of genealogical organizations, historical 
associations, archivists and others, that the rules respecting 
the normal release of the census data collected from the 1911 
census have been interpreted in such as way as to prevent their 
public release and access.  Hence, for the first time in Canadian 
history, historians will not have access to the data collected in 
the 1911 census. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to and including the 1901 census in Canada, the census 
records were transferred to the National Archives and were 
subsequently made available to the public 92 years after 
collection.  This was possible because clauses in the Privacy Act 
allowed for the release of certain pieces of information to the 
National Archives subject to certain aspects of the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in 1906 the Government of Canada passed an act 
respecting the census and statistics in which section 68 
empowered the governor in council, the cabinet, to make 
regulations respecting confidentiality.  The government of Sir 
Wilfrid Laurier in 1906 did in fact promulgate certain orders in 
council which restricted access to the census of 1911. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently it did this because at that time there was concern 
among the public that the data collected could be used in the 
assessment of taxation and perhaps for the conscription of 
Canadians in a future wartime conflict.  There was some political 
sensitivity and a feeling at that time that the public should be 
assured the information it was obliged to surrender to the 
government would be kept in confidence and not used for other 
public purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, no commitment was made by the government either in 
statute or regulation at that time that this information would be 
kept secret in perpetuity.  It was clear to all concerned, 
according to many of the historians who have examined this 
matter, that the regulation applied in the context of the day. 
People understandably did not want to have bureaucrats, 
politicians or others having access to personal information which 
they were required to surrender under the Statistics Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a long and much honoured convention both in this country 
and in similar jurisdictions that such information eventually 
after a reasonable time, roughly the maximum period of an average 
lifespan, ought eventually to become publicly accessible for 
research and academic purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985 the justice department arrived at a legal opinion, an 
interpretation of the statutory and regulatory decisions in 1906, 
in which it decided the census data had to remain in secret in 
perpetuity following the 1911 census.  Thus today we find 
ourselves in the position where in the last couple of years 
archivists, genealogists and historians have suddenly discovered 
that the huge treasure trove of historical data which they 
anticipated would be deposited at the National Archives in 2003, 
the data obtained in the 1911 census of Canadian subjects and 
citizens, would not be made available.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All across the country there are tens of thousands of concerned 
Canadians who take a deep interest in the history of the country. 
They began to express their concern about the secret nature of 
the census records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important because as we all know, in the first decade of 
the 20th century, there was an enormous wave of immigration into 
Canada. Many people today can trace their ancestors' arrival to 
Canada to that period between 1901 and 1911.  Many millions of 
Canadian families have some ancestors who arrived, acquired land 
and began their lives in this great country during those early 
years of development, immigration and settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1911 census represents a critical link to the past for 
historians and genealogists.  For us it is a window which allows 
us to find who arrived generally from Europe at the time, where 
they settled, how many people were in their families, their birth 
dates, their relatives, the location of their land and their 
occupations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the release of this very basic genealogical data 
would in any way violate the privacy of those who lived in the 
country between 1901 and 1911.  It goes without saying that the 
vast majority of those people who were subject to the 1911 census 
are today posthumous Canadians and indeed have no living interest 
in the release of this information, but there are some.  I can 
say with some pride that next week my grandfather, Mart Kenney, a 
great Canadian musician, will be celebrating his 90th birthday. 
He was born in 1910 in Vancouver.  I asked him if he would be 
concerned if I and his other descendants could have access to 
census information concerning his family in 1910.  He said of 
course not, that is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could consult those who lived at the time of the 1911 
census and ask them whether they would object to their 
grandchildren and great grandchildren, and academic and 
professional historians, looking at the information to find out 
where they settled, where they lived, how many people were in 
their families and other data of this nature, I am sure we would 
find that they would not raise any objection. I am sure they 
would be intrigued to learn that there are so many thousands of 
Canadians who are deeply concerned about their familial past, 
their regional past and national past and hope they will have 
access to this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually every other jurisdiction in the developed democracies 
recognize the principle that we must respect the privacy rights 
of citizens when the government or state requires people to 
surrender information under sanction of law.  That ought to be 
managed with great discretion.  Information should for a lengthy 
period of time be kept secret. However, these jurisdictions also 
recognize that a time comes when such information no longer poses 
a privacy interest for individuals but rather poses a public 
interest for access by historians and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give examples of such jurisdictions.  Australia releases 
its census data after 100 years.  France releases its census data 
a century after collection.  Denmark releases such data 65 years 
after collection, well within a normal lifespan.  In the United 
Kingdom efforts are being made to release data after 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the 92 year rule which we have respected in Canada until 
today is an adequate period of time to ensure and protect the 
privacy interests of those who filled out census forms in 1911. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal status quo is interpreted by the justice department 
and applied by Statistics Canada.  It does not only affect the 
1911 census.  It affects all censuses taken since then. 
If we maintain the legal status quo in this regard, never again 
will Canadian historians, archivists or genealogists be able to 
reach back in time and research the important information which 
gives us clues to the past from whence we came.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often we forget the importance of our history.  In this 
country in particular we can read the brilliant best-selling book 
<I>Who Killed Canadian History?</I> authored by eminent Canadian 
historian Jack Granatstein last year.  We can look at the polling 
information which suggests that the vast majority of Canadians, 
and young Canadians in particular, have an astounding ignorance 
about the basic facts of our national history, our political 
history, our military history and our social history. One could 
make the argument that this country is losing touch with its 
past.  A country which does not know from whence it came is a 
country that has no clear direction in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential for a thriving, modern democracy like Canada to 
have a deep sense of its past.  That is not just done by academic 
historians writing sweeping histories about the socioeconomic and 
political history of the country.  That understanding of our 
history is, at its most profound level, conducted by amateur 
genealogists and historians who dig into the past of particular 
families with their own particular traditions.  This is very 
important information.  It helps the thousands and thousands of 
people every day who are collecting the data on who settled in 
Canada, where they settled and how they built their lives in this 
place.  It contributes collectively to our historical 
understanding as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that parliament hear the voices of 
those Canadians who are concerned about our history by opening up 
access to the 1911 census and all census data which has been 
collected since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is limited in its scope.  Once more it seeks only to 
release the 1911 census records, something which could be 
achieved by amending the Statistics Act to make it evident that 
this will be public information once deposited at the National 
Archives in 2003.  Again the scope is limited.  It only deals 
with that census.  However, should the House in its wisdom decide 
to vote for this private member's motion, which in fact has been 
granted votable status by the relevant committee, that I hope 
would be taken by the government as direction from parliament to 
amend the Statistics Act to permit access to all census data 
collected from 1911 onward, and indeed from the 2001 census into 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may seem to be a modest motion, and indeed it is, but it is 
an important one.  I believe that the overwhelming number of 
Canadians who have an understanding of this issue desire for the 
government to open up access to our past, not to lock away this 
important historical information into some vault, and certainly 
not to destroy that information as some, shall we say, 
absolutists in the privacy field have suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who do not see the need for a balance between 
the interest of privacy and the public interest of access to 
information.  There are those whom I would characterize as 
absolutists on the question of privacy and who actually have 
recommended that the National Archives destroy the census data 
once it has been deposited there so that no one in the future can 
ever gain access to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us send a clear signal to the chief statistician, the 
national archivist and the Government of Canada that Canadians 
want access to our past.  They want to respect Canadians' 
privacy, but we believe that can be done with the 92 year 
timeframe in place and contemplated by my motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the debate which will ensue.  I hope that when 
it is concluded, members of this place will choose to vote in 
favour of Motion No. 160 and allow us to open up a window into 
our past while respecting the privacy rights of Canadians who 
have gone before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to speak to this motion by the member for 
Calgary Southeast that the government should take all necessary 
steps to release the 1911 census records.  I can give him the 
happy news that we do not require the government to take this 
step whatsoever.  There is a private member's bill, Bill C-206, 
which is before the House on the order of precedence at this 
moment which would do precisely what the member for Calgary 
Southeast requires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Which member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I believe it is the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington who has this particular private member's 
bill. I point out to you, Mr. Speaker, that not only does the 
member for Wentworth—Burlington have this bill before the House, 
he has some 112 seconders from all parties who gave support to 
this bill to go on the order of precedence.  I do not know 
whether the member for Calgary Southeast was one of those who 
actually seconded this particular piece of legislation. I hope he 
was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it does is it amends the Access to Information Act such 
that schedule II of the act is eliminated.  Schedule II of the 
Access to Information Act lists those pieces of legislation that 
particularly raise barriers for the disclosure of certain types 
of information.  For example, one of the schedule II items is in 
the Income Tax Act where a non-profit organization's financial 
returns and other types of personal information are not 
available.  That is in the Income Tax Act.  The Statistics Act is 
similar in that it restricts access to certain types of census 
records going all the way back to 1911.  However, Bill C-206, by 
eliminating schedule II, brings all these other items of 
legislation under the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is the Access to Information Act is the superior 
legislation when it comes to measuring whether information in 
other legislation should be withheld or not.  So whether it is 
the Statistics Act, or the Income Tax Act or any other items of 
legislation that have withholding clauses, they still have to be 
subject to the test of the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-206, among other things, amends the Access to Information 
Act such that all documents held by the government over 30 years 
old which are not obviously a threat to national security if 
disclosed, or would disclose information that would be injurious 
to individuals and so on and so forth, or all documents that do 
not have obvious injury components in terms of their impact on 
the public would automatically be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had representations from the people from Statistics 
Canada.  They are of the view that if Bill C-206 is allowed to go 
forward and amend the Access to Information Act as it exists, 
then the Statistics Canada legislation that prevents the 1911 
census records from being released will be overturned and these 
documents will be readily available, at least census records up 
to 30 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member in his motion is calling on the government to act 
when in fact we have the happy situation for us all that it is 
not the government that needs to act, it is backbench MPs who 
have this opportunity to act.  What is particularly important 
about Bill C-206, my private member's bill—I have to admit it is 
mine—is that in order to get onto the order paper it sought and 
received the seconding by 112 members of the House, all backbench 
MPs on all sides of this House, no government members or 
parliamentary secretaries.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was 100% a backbench initiative.  Indeed the Reform Party 
and the Bloc Quebecois were especially supportive of this 
initiative.  I am very pleased to report that although I have to 
say that unfortunately the Reform Party did move a point of 
privilege on Bill C-206.  I regret that there is some doubt now 
whether Bill C-206 will indeed stay on the order of precedence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that the Reform point of privilege was poorly advised 
because I think the Reform Party were under the impression that 
certain changes were made to Bill C-206, which subsequently got 
unanimous consent in the House, that may have substantially 
affected things in the bill that the Reform Party would have been 
very concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that when I sought unanimous 
consent for Bill C-206 I was convinced that the support 
originally indicated for Bill C-206 when I originally sought the 
signatures would remain.  Regardless of any changes that I 
undertook, and which I obtained unanimous consent for, I thought 
that those changes would by and large receive the support of the 
very seconders who put their names to the original bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this is before the House.  I am confident that the 
members of the Reform Party, and the Bloc Quebecois indeed, have 
I think an enormous interest and a vital interest, as we all do 
as parliamentarians, in openness in government and being able to 
access the documents, be they census records or any other kind of 
government documents that we need to have in order to be informed 
about the efficiency of the operation of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to return to the motion, but I shall say in passing that 
I have examined very carefully Bill C-206 and the impact of its 
amendments on the current Access to Information Act and I have 
compared it to the American freedom of information act.  I can 
tell you, Mr. Speaker, that to reform, to use the word that my 
colleagues opposite do favour a lot, the Access to Information 
Act with Bill C-206 will create the most sophisticated and the 
most effective freedom of information legislation in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that this amendment is coming forward from not 
just this private member but from private members on all sides of 
the House who have at least endorsed the principle of the bill to 
see that it would get on the order of precedence.  They may have 
difficulty with some of the changes that might occur at committee 
stage or that might occur at report stage.  Even some members 
might decide to vote against the bill when it finally reaches 
third reading because of some changes they might have perceived 
en route, but the point is that backbench MPs in this parliament 
for the first time ever have advanced a bill based on seconding 
the bill in principle, and it is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would expect that if it goes through, and I am surely hopeful 
that it will, it will address the concern of the member for 
Calgary Southeast about the 1911 census records.  It will fix 
that problem immediately.  He can say that to his constituents 
and he can say to all those people who have wrote we MPs and have 
said open those records because they are part of our historic 
heritage.  If the Reform Party, backbench MPs, opposition MPs, 
the Bloc Quebecois MPs, the Conservatives and the NDP are indeed 
supportive of openness in government, I am sure that they do not 
need to just support this motion of the member for Calgary 
Southeast.  They have the opportunity to actually see it enacted 
by supporting Bill C-206.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in this debate, which deals with Motion No. 160, in 
spite of the fact that the member for Wentworth—Burlington 
talked about his private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here—and Bloc Quebecois members generally share my 
views on this and certain agree with the comments I am about to 
make—is a member who moved a motion, Motion No. 160, which we are 
debating today, and another one, the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington, in Ontario, who introduced a bill on 
basically the same issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT96"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT96"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1835

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wentworth—Burlington is trying to embellish 
somewhat the background for his bill. Reformers have complained 
in this House, as did our House leader, who is recovering from 
his recent open heart surgery, and to whom I wish a speedy 
recovery. The Minister of Human Resources Development, while 
wishing him no harm, must hope that his recovery will be a long 
one, because we know the dedication of the member for Roberval 
in handling issues like human resources development in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member—he may be sick but he is by no means dead; he is a 
strong man and he is getting his strength back—spoke out against 
the actions of the member for Wentworth—Burlington, who collected 
signatures from his colleagues here, in parliament. I very 
clearly recall that the member for Roberval said—and I know what 
he was talking about, being a notary myself—that it was like a 
notary reading a five page notarial act, having the last page 
signed and, after the parties have signed, changing the first 
four pages, putting in there whatever he wanted, and passing 
that for the authentic act. There would be a possibility of 
fraud, and the Quebec Notarial Act, which I respect, would say 
that it is not a valid document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this is the kind of attitude and behaviour that 
make the member for Wentworth—Burlington a terribly suspicious 
character in this parliament. There is no man more partisan, no 
Orangeman more orange than him. 
The member for Wentworth—Burlington is a danger to his opposition 
colleagues, because keeping one's word is a concept that does 
not mean anything to him. He has no respect for this principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> He is arrogant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> He is arrogant, indeed, and a resolutely 
orange Orangemen. I would rather put my confidence in my 
colleague from the Reform Party who gave us the real reasons why 
the 1911 census records should be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people in our society claim that release should be allowed, 
while others push respect for confidentiality and privacy too 
far. Even if it became known 92 years later that, in 1911, my 
grandfather owned two horses instead of one, I wonder how this 
could bother him. He has, unfortunately, been dead for quite 
some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I mean is that one should not be mean either as the member 
for Wentworth—Burlington usually is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's initiative shows an obvious interest in history. 
At a time when we are talking about genetic diseases, to have a 
period of time, even if its only five years in our history to 
which one does not have access, is to deprive people of the 
opportunity to track down their roots and know their genealogy, 
going as far back as their forebears, beyond 1911, but somehow 
there is a link missing here in demographic and sociological 
data. This is something we have to respect, like anything else, 
and provide to those who are interested. I for one am 
interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were talking about butterflies, for instance, it might be 
different. I am not that keen on butterflies, even though I like 
my colleague Mr. Hanfield, who is a notary in Mont-Saint-Hilaire 
and an entomologist who wrote a manual on butterflies in Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend, the notary Louis Hanfield from Mont-Saint-Hilaire, whom 
I salute in passing, published <I>Le Guide des papillons du Québec</I> 
last summer. It is fantastic. I am interested in butterflies. If 
my friend Louis Hanfield had skipped one page, and three or four 
butterflies were missing from his guide, I would not mind 
because butterflies are not what I dream about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I have a keen interest in genealogy. I know 
mine, I know Quebec's history. Quebecers, especially those 
sitting here, know their history very well. They know about 
their past, including the history of Acadia. We have a colleague 
here who comes from there. For the most part, Quebecers and 
Acadians share the same roots. 
We are proud, as he is proud too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some, history is an important field, if only for research 
into genetic defects.  I know a lot of the history of Quebec and 
eastern Canada, but I know a lot less about western Canada or 
the context surrounding the development of the central and 
western provinces.  There is information there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in Saskatchewan to visit my friend the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle.  Qu'Appelle is a French sounding word. It 
comes from the French language.  How is it there is a region, a 
city, a town with that name in Saskatchewan?  For me, a 
marvelling visitor to Qu'Appelle, I wonder what that means. 
This is the sort of information that could interest me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I in fact stopped in Qu'Appelle.  They asked me what I was doing 
there. 
It was the French name Qu'Appelle that made me wonder.  I was 
called to Qu'Appelle, a cappella, because Qu'Appelle called.  I 
hope you understand.  I am not sure I understand myself, but I 
follow what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that to say that we can laugh here too.  We can take this 
motion with a hint of humour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the credibility of the member for Calgary Southeast, 
not so far from Qu'Appelle, who moved Motion No. 160, I will 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is probably because he recalls that people in Qu'Appelle are 
of French descent that the member introduced his Motion no 160. 
Because of his credibility compared with the total lack of 
credibility, consideration and respect for his colleagues at all 
times of the member for Wentworth—Burlington, I favour the adage 
“a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least I have the proposal for the motion of the member from 
Calgary Southeast, near Qu'Appelle, who calls his Motion No. 160. 
I call on my colleagues to support Motion No. 160 and to stand 
against the unspeakable assaults of the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington in an effort to get us to reject what I 
would call a fine motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to Motion No. 160, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
all necessary steps to release the 1911 census records once they 
have been deposited in the National Archives in 2003. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the intent of this motion. I have received many 
letters of concern from genealogists in my constituency and from 
around the country over the issue of releasing information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that Sir Wilfrid Laurier passed the first 
law citing the issue of confidentiality in the early 1900s.  The 
information in the census of 1911 was collected from Canadians 
with the understanding that the material would not be released. 
Subsequent laws have reinforced the confidentiality of all data 
collected by Statistics Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information gathered in these surveys provides an important 
resource for the basis of policy and program creation, as we all 
know.  However, people do not give out their personal information 
lightly.  I have received many calls and letters over time from 
people in Dartmouth who have been contacted by Statistics Canada 
for various surveys, such as the census survey that we are 
required to complete every five years, and people are not happy 
about this.  They have a pre-eminent concern about 
confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a part of the country where geneology, memories and 
our roots are extremely important and where our family heritage 
is a resource for which people are fiercely proud. Amateur 
genealogists are researchers and storytellers and they have a 
determination to find out where they came from and a 
determination to use every possible resource to do so.  We in the 
NDP take their concerns very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we first learned about the cries from historians and 
genealogists, the previous NDP industry critic, Chris Axworthy, 
wrote to the Minister of Industry asking that he make a decision 
about releasing this information to the National Archives after 
92 years, which had been the standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The feeling of the NDP caucus was that the issue demanded a 
balance be struck between confidentiality and reasonable access. 
However, the need to restrict access by Canadians to the 
post-1901 census records was highly questionable, particularly 
when there is much greater availability of census materials in 
the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry deferred to the chief statistician who 
pointed out that he could not legally release the data to anyone. 
Since then the federal privacy commissioner, Bruce Phillips, 
announced his strong opposition to releasing the data by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who give information to the government under penalty of 
law on an unqualified promise of confidentiality are entitled to 
expect that that trust will be honoured. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Phillips also speaks of the right of Canadians to have 
control over their own information rather than “people with a 
vested interest” using and making decisions about that 
information.  In these days of limited privacy and control of our 
own information, his point is well taken.  The passions and 
implications for public policy surrounding this are fierce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the culture critic for the New Democrats, I am aware that one 
of the major uses of our public archives has been for 
genealogical research and that this community feels that the 
denial of access to the 1911 census information makes their 
search for roots much more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the concerns of the privacy commissioner and to 
calls from historians and amateur genealogists, the Minister of 
Industry has now appointed an expert panel on access to 
historical census records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a respectful course of action at this point is to 
wait for that panel's report and see if some kind of balance, 
which I believe can be achieved, will be found to let Canadians 
find their roots and allow us assurances of privacy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to rise to address the motion raised by the member 
for Calgary Southeast with respect to the release of the 
post-1901 census records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon initial consideration, supporting this motion may seem to 
be quite a simple decision. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as we begin to uncover the complexities of this matter, 
this decision becomes a much more difficult one to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent months a number of genealogists and historians have 
articulated their collective disappointment that the 1911 census 
records will not be available for review in the public domain in 
the year 2003.  These individuals had previously expected the 
1911 census records to be made available for research purposes in 
this particular year because census records have been, up to this 
point, accessible to the public after 92 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, censuses administered after 1901 fall subject to the 
Statistics Act that explicitly prohibits the release of all 
census records.  This prohibition does not allow anyone to access 
census records for any reason.  The only exception is that 
individuals may access his or her own personal records.  But that 
is the only current exception.  An individual may not access the 
census records of anyone else, not even those belonging to his or 
her immediate family members nor even those records belonging to 
members of the ancestral family tree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dilemma here is quite clear and yet it is quite difficult to 
resolve.  We have two competing interests that present a 
difficult case for the House.  On the one hand we have the 
reality of statutory integrity upon which our nation is founded 
and, on the other hand, practical idealism presented to us by 
historical curiosity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many have argued that the release of census records is crucial 
to furthering the knowledge Canadians hold of their past, of 
their communities, of their families and of themselves.  Access 
to census records is what enables individuals, scholars, 
researchers and historians alike to trace their respective 
histories and to answer questions about their past:  from 
questions as simple, yet so personally important as when exactly 
one's ancestry arrived in Canada, to questions as drawn and as 
nationally significant as the face of the brave men who fought 
and defended Canada in the first world war.  Answering these 
questions can indeed teach Canadians a lot about themselves and 
about their origins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Canadian amateurs, historians and academics alike have 
called upon these records to answer these and countless other 
questions which offer great insight into our history as a people. 
As such. the availability of census returns up to 1901 have been 
a tremendous resource for researchers in search of information 
with respect to housing, health, income and general social 
conditions of the day.  But again, researchers have been able to 
conduct their invaluable research based on the laws in place 
before 1906 which authorized the release of these census records 
92 years after they were taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time, census data will not be available to 
Canadians come the year 2003, the year during which census data 
from 1911 would have been available in the National Archives for 
public reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side, those who argue that the census records 
should be released to the public argue that respect for statutory 
integrity is quite important, particularly for our nation.  In 
1906, when the change was made that all future censuses would be 
kept confidential and rendered forever inaccessible, legislators 
made a commitment to Canadians.  This commitment, this promise 
was that Canadians' responses to census questions would not be 
divulged to anyone, not even to the most trusted and loved ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government currently requires Canadian residents to 
answer increasingly intrusive and intimate questions on its 
census.  These questions include proddings into Canadians' 
marital status, physical characteristics, nationality, ethnic 
origin, wages earned, insurance held, educational attainment and 
also proddings into respondents' infirmities and sicknesses. 
Clearly, the government census is not an everyday survey or 
questionnaire. It is very involved and it can also make for quite 
a personal experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While most Canadians will readily answer these questions and 
willingly provide the federal government with the information it 
requests, others will be more hesitant to divulge this very 
personal information.  Still, because the federal government 
requires Canadians to do so under penalty of fine or 
imprisonment, Canadians do indeed answer all these questions, 
albeit hesitantly perhaps.  Why do they answer these intrusive 
questions?  What puts their minds at ease in divulging this 
information?  It is no more than the federal government's 
unqualified guarantee of confidentiality that allows Canadians to 
answer these personal questions. 
This guarantee is what convinced Canadians to divulge so much of 
themselves dating back to 1911.  This guarantee puts the minds of 
Canadians at ease when, in the absence of such a guarantee, it is 
extremely doubtful that Canadians would willingly and accurately 
provide this information.  The guarantee offered by the federal 
government through the Statistics Act was and remains the pledge 
that the federal government has professed to Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is our dilemma.  It will please the member for Calgary 
Southeast to know that although the Laurier government promised 
that the information collected post-1901 would remain 
confidential, the puzzling thing is that it is really not clear 
why this promise was made.  Furthermore, archival records 
indicate that the confidentiality provision was designed to 
reassure citizens that census enumerators would not pass along 
information to tax collectors or military conscription personnel. 
What does this mean?  Simply that the reasoning for instituting 
this law remains unclear today and, more to the point, that 
Canadians in post-1901 may not have been as concerned with 
privacy as we think they were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the times have changed dramatically since 1901 
and so have cultural values.  While today we place the utmost 
importance on personal issues, back then, as archival information 
indicates, the reasons for keeping census records forever 
confidential was that Canadians feared the information would leak 
to tax collectors and military personnel, not because they wanted 
to keep the information confidential forever.  Canadians' 
concerns in 1906 were short term:  “Let's keep this information 
away from the tax man and from the military”.  The goal was not 
to keep the information from historians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when Canadians are increasingly interested in their 
past and when private foundations, such as the newly created 
Historica are allocating millions to improve the teaching and 
dissemination of Canadian history, it does not make sense that we 
would be barred from access to our own history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I certainly do appreciate the concern for statutory 
integrity and privacy interests, I do not believe that releasing 
the census records 92 years after the administration of the 
Census Act would pose an infringement on either of these 
principles.  In the U.S. it is 72 years and in Australia it is 
99, so 92 is reasonable.   It is not an infringement of statutory 
integrity nor an invasion of privacy since after 92 years those 
who completed the census as adults are likely deceased, at which 
point the concern for privacy is moot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Canadians today have been quite vocal in their 
support for releasing census records for research purposes. 
Given the overwhelming support for the release of the records, we 
in the House cannot ignore the call of Canadians.  This is an 
instance where the sensibilities of Canadians, what they feel is 
right and justifiable, must be recognized.  If Canadians of today 
do not feel that the release of census records is an infringement 
on the privacy rights of Canadians of yesterday, then we as 
legislators have no choice but to acknowledge their call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians today wish to retain access to census records 92 
years after censuses have been administered, then I do believe 
that, given the precedent set in the period leading up to 1911, 
we must accommodate them.  In so doing, we would be accommodating 
ourselves as well, for research into our history as a people and 
as a nation may only be furthered by allowing access to these 
invaluable records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I offer my wholehearted support to the motion brought 
forth by the member for Calgary Southeast. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I seek unanimous consent from the House to divide my 
time with the member for Lethbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to permit 
the hon. member to divide his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, short of not getting 
unanimous consent, I will say that my colleague from Lethbridge 
supports the intervention I will make today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the member for Calgary Southeast for putting forth 
Motion No. 160 which asks that the 1911 census records, once they 
have been deposited in the National Archives in 2003, be made 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that we have an issue here, pro and con, 
between two competing interests:  one, for people to have access 
to the 1911 census and indeed the census after that once 92 years 
have passed; and two, the privacy rights of people who, by force 
of law, were obligated to provide information in those census to 
the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the facts.  If it is an issue of privacy with 
which we would all agree, we have to also look at the timeline. 
Ninety-two years will have passed before any information from 
this census could be made public.  Virtually all the people 
affected by this census will be dead.  Certainly all the adults 
affected by this census will be dead once 92 years have passed. 
Therefore, in the interests of being reasonable, is it not 
reasonable to allow information from 1911 to be released? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should it be released?  It is very important from an 
historical perspective.  I was quite surprised to see the number 
of people in my riding, and indeed people from around the 
country, who very much want this census to be released.  The 
reason for that is not only from a genealogical perspective but 
also from the historical perspective, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These censuses provide invaluable information to historians to 
piece together the history of our country in an accurate fashion. 
That is what the census enables us to do because it provides 
information that deals with issues such as age, various 
demographic principles, housing, health and a wide variety of 
subjects that are essential for us to understand our past.  By 
understanding our past, we get an important indication and view 
into our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian history, if I can use the words of Irving Abella, is in 
a state of crisis because this essential information is not being 
allowed to be put out.  The public will be interested to know 
that this is not an arbitrary decision by the government.  It is 
a decision that is there by law that was put forward by Sir 
Wilfrid Laurier.  His law states that all information in censuses 
after 1906 would not be made public at all, contrary to censuses 
previous to that.  Censuses previous to 1906 were in fact made 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have interesting dilemma on our hands and I challenge any 
member who opposes this worthy motion to show where it is 
harmful.   If we look at the experiences of other countries we 
find it is very interesting.  The U.S. and many other countries 
allow census data to be released after a time that varies from 64 
to 100 years.  If it were such a problem to release census 
information, would we not also find that this would be a problem 
in other democracies?  Would we not also hear a cry from people 
who believe in democratic principles that the release of census 
information would somehow be an infringement on the privacy of 
individuals?  Do we hear that from other democracies or other 
western nations?  We do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly we can see that our country by preventing the release of 
census information is compromising the very ability of 
historians, genealogists and others to get important information 
about our nation's history.  It does not impede or compromise the 
privacy of individuals.  We need to look at this subject in the 
historical context and the international context to find very 
clearly that the release of census information after 92 years 
does not in any way, shape or form compromise the privacy of 
individuals who are living today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the privacy commissioner disagrees with the point of view 
expressed by members from across party lines, but he has a 
position to uphold and an important one at that.  However the 
privacy commissioner is wrong on this issue.  We need to amend 
the current legislation, take hold of Motion No. 160 put forward 
by my colleague from Calgary Southeast and ensure that the 1911 
census records will be deposited, and they should be deposited, 
in the National Archives in 2003.  That information should be 
made public to all who want to have access to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened intently to the debate and I will say at 
the outset that I am opposed to the motion because what is at 
stake is the very essence of confidentiality. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall from my experience as a medical doctor, and the member 
who just participated in the debate belongs to the same 
profession, that confidentiality is the very essence of personal 
integrity.  Even if we invoke the argument that we would like to 
study the history of our people, the history of our country, that 
we will sustain freedom of information because we are in a 
democracy, confidentiality is a supreme principle that not one of 
these points can supersede. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard during debate that we are in a dilemma.  I agree that we 
are in a dilemma because there are competing interests, but the 
question to me is very clear.  All other interests are 
subservient to the principle of privacy, in particular when the 
information was given to the Canadian census by a Canadian at the 
time, though now maybe deceased, in the honest belief that never 
would it be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine a dead person in his or her grave, unable to speak 
today, and we, the living, say “I am sorry but in the best 
interest of history, in the best interest of democracy, now we 
will forget our promise to you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What do you guys know about democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Would the member just be quiet 
please out of respect for democracy?  The Reform Party speaks 
about democracy, but at the same time when I try to speak in a 
way that somehow pierces his heart and pierces his conscience, 
the member is trying to disturb me.  He cannot disturb me in the 
ultimate analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real test of confidentiality is when one is tempted to 
breach it and one resists that.  That is the real test of living 
up to confidentiality, even when only one person is opposed 
during that census time who may be living now and says “No, that 
may not be released”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not know this motion would be debated.  What is really at 
stake here is that sense of public trust.  The member from the 
Reform Party is laughing at public trust.  I am really saddened, 
but he will not distract me.  Only the persons who did not give 
consent to revealing confidential information may withdraw it and 
have it released.  That is the essence of confidentiality.  He 
who cannot live with confidentiality I challenge.  How can we 
trust that particular person? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real test of confidentiality is when we are tempted to 
breach it for some other wishes and if we do not then we have 
lived up to the principle of confidentiality.  That is why, if I 
may add, at one time there was a study of medical confidentiality 
in Ontario by the Grange commission. You know, Mr. Speaker, 
because you belong to the legal profession, you would fully 
appreciate that it would impose the most severe penalty for 
breach of confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I say I hope we do not support this motion.  It 
would be a breach of public trust.  It would be a breach of our 
promise.  Though now they may be deceased the more we should 
respect them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here this evening to 
speak to the motion respecting a day to recognize the late 
Stanley Knowles. 
Stanley Knowles, the parliamentarian and the man, goes beyond

received great acclaim from all parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted us as Canadians and as parliamentarians to recognize 
Stanley Knowles.  As well I am looking to our recognizing other 
great Canadians by designating days for them.  We fail to do that 
as Canadians.  We recognize Victoria Day.  Certainly we have 
historical connections to England and to the Royal Family.  The 
U.S. recognizes numerous days.  It takes pride in its history and 
in its great leaders that brought that country over the years to 
a democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think as Canadians we fail to do that.  We fail to take pride 
in our country.  As a result we see some of the problems we are 
in today.  We do not take the time to be proud of the people who 
have worked for our democratic country and have led it through 
the years.  I will speak a lot about Stanley Knowles because it 
was my intent that it would be the opportune time as we go into 
the new millennium to recognize him as the man that he was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without question Stanley Knowles is a legendary Canadian.  He 
was a pioneering New Democrat with an intergenerational voice who 
spoke for all and still speaks to us now.  My colleague, our 
health critic, mentioned in his speech today what Stanley Knowles 
gave us in 1958.  Does that still speak to us today about our 
going through the same things in the House of Commons.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome the beginning of a hospital insurance plan.  But if it 
is a good idea to cover hospital bills by an insurance plan, why 
not do the same for all medical bills?  The Liberals promised 
health insurance in 1919 but had no intention of starting it 
until 1959.  Apparently, it was Mr. Mackenzie King's reading of 
the Bible, about the children of Israel having to wander the 
wilderness for 40 years, that prompted him to require the people 
of Canada to wander in the wilderness of high medical costs for 
40 years before making even a start in this field. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And now we have the spectacle of the present Liberal leader 
promising, all over again, what the Liberal Party first pledged 
itself to 40 years ago. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are, another 42 years later.  Does it not sound 
familiar?  He further stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Pearson's promise today is even more vague and misleading 
than most Liberal promises have proved to be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Stanley Knowles definitely speaks to us even today.  As 
well I will take this opportunity to comment that Stanley Knowles 
also said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debate is not a sin, a mistake, an error or something to be put 
up with in parliament.  Debate is the essence of parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we seen as parliamentarians in the House of Commons in 
the last while with this government?  Numerous time allocations 
and probably the most horrendous thing today is that regulations 
will be passed once again to stifle the voice of parliamentary 
debate.   I am sure Stanley Knowles would be turning over in his 
grave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg—Transcona said in his eulogy to 
Stanley Knowles: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was the last of a line of prairie ministers whose view of 
politics was shaped by their belief in the social gospel and 
biblical prophecies...Stanley was an exemplary politician. His 
knowledge of parliamentary rules and proceedings superseded that 
of many of his colleagues on either side of the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand Stanley Knowles we must understand the 
indissoluble link between Stanley Knowles the politician and 
Stanley Knowles the man.  This was Stanley Knowles' integrity, 
his ability to bring together his belief system and his 
unwavering faith in our parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Growing up, Stanley had faced challenges that led him to follow 
the path that he did.  As stated in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> a 
few days after he passed on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His social-democratic views were formed the hard way:  by the 
death of his mother, Margaret, to tuberculosis and poor health 
care when he was 11.

without pension or benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Knowles was on a lifelong mission.  He himself stated 
“This became more or less the goal of my life, to correct what 
happened to my own family”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not often what it takes to get us going, to really fight 
for the things we believe in, that we do not want to see other 
people suffer some of the problems, illnesses and tragedies that 
we had to go through.  We want to make a better life for the 
people around us and for our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley's political career with the CCF began in 1934.  He held 
various positions throughout those years including that of 
national vice-president from 1954 to 1961.  His son David said 
that his father initially decided that he would work to save 
people's souls through the church but he soon realized that 
preaching from the pulpit was not going to put food on the table 
or get people hospital care.  He realized he was in the wrong 
place and he should be in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to historian Susan Mann he had to change laws rather 
than souls.  Stanley Knowles went out to preach from a different 
house, the House of Commons.  He ran for parliament in 1935 and 
again in 1940.  He was elected as the CCF member for Winnipeg 
North Centre on November 30, 1942. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now have two colleagues, the member for Winnipeg Centre and 
for Winnipeg North Centre, who represent the riding that Stanley 
once represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley succeeded the late J. S. Woodsworth.  He was elected in 
1945, 1949, 1953, 1957, 1963, 1968, 1972, 1974, 1979 and 1980. 
How would any of us feel to have the support of our constituents 
the way they stood behind this man because of the man he was? 
His integrity was never at question. That we should be elected 
that many times, we would definitely deserve to have our name 
recognized within Canada, a day recognized on our behalf, if we 
were able to make that kind of commitment to our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley's career as a parliamentarian was brilliant.  Many 
honours were bestowed upon him in recognition of his knowledge of 
parliamentary procedure and his integrity as a social democrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1957 John Diefenbaker offered Stanley the Speakership. 
According to the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, the new Tory prime 
minister, the highly partisan John Diefenbaker was so impressed 
by Mr. Knowles that he offered him the job as Speaker of the 
Commons.  Mr. Knowles declined.  Why did he decline?  He declined 
because it would constrain his ability to fight for pension 
reform on behalf of his constituents.  That was a 
parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Stanley Knowles the politician, government and its laws were 
to become his instruments of transformation and education to make 
Canadian society a better place for all.  He fought persistently 
for the elderly and more specifically for the national pension 
plan. He also fought for the poor, for children, for women and 
for veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his 42 years in the House, Stanley not only gained 
respect for the role of parliament and its procedure but a sound 
understanding of it. It is no wonder that his career as a 
parliamentarian did not end when he ended his term as an active 
member of parliament in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP leader Ed Broadbent suggested that the House honour Stanley. 
Prime Minister Trudeau at that time followed through on the 
suggestion with a lifelong membership in the House and a seat at 
the clerk's table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 13, 1984, the House voted unanimously and Stanley was 
able to keep living in the house that was his home, the House of 
Commons. In October of the same year Stanley Knowles was 
recognized as an officer of the Order of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of his health needs and his frailty, Stanley still 
attended question period daily.  I am sure all of us would be 
thrilled to say that we had been in question period daily for our 
whole time here in Ottawa.  He enjoyed the ritual, the rules and 
the history of parliament's hallowed halls which he has now 
joined.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak about Stanley Knowles.  Mr. Speaker, I believe you 
and I came to the House at the same time in 1988. I then 
represented Winnipeg North.  I understand from the political 
history that a small part of that riding had previously been 
represented by Mr. Stanley Knowles.  I inherited with great pride 
the tradition that Mr. Knowles left.  I saw to it to have a 
conversation with him during my first few days on Parliament 
Hill.  I will continue to cherish that memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He reminded me of the first speech he gave when he was in 
California.  It was about the Philippines, my country of birth. 
He was a vivid and caring person.  Indeed I agree that he was a 
visionary and a person of deep social conscience.  He fought for 
the poor, veterans and seniors, the very essence of our political 
calling.  He said that debate gives testimony to democracy and I 
agree.  He spoke of procedure and how to use it to effect a 
change.  But he said that the procedural rules as they existed 
should never be abused by any frivolous approach to the 
procedures.  He said that within the existing procedures we 
should use our imagination to advance our cause.  In fact, I very 
much enjoyed reading the book in my first few months on 
Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my extreme honour a couple of years ago when the Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services requested that I appear 
on his behalf and speak on behalf of the Government of Canada in 
the naming of a building in Winnipeg for Stanley Knowles.  It was 
an honour for me to be with the members of his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, by continuing to honour Mr. Stanley Knowles, we are 
honouring and sustaining the nobility of politics itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak to Motion 
No. 211 which calls on the government to declare June 18 to be 
Stanley Knowles Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my remarks by commending the hon. member for Churchill 
for introducing this motion on behalf of the NDP and in fact 
Canadians who look up to Mr. Knowles and have great respect for 
his work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Knowles was born on June 18, 1908.  As you know, Mr. 
Speaker, I am a relatively new Canadian.  My family and I have 
been in Canada less than 10 years.  Still I know a little bit 
about Stanley Knowles and from what I know I can say that I 
highly appreciate what he did for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a politician who was dedicated to representing the people 
who elected him.  He delivered his maiden speech to the House on 
February 3, 1943.  He represented the riding of Winnipeg North 
Centre for over 37 years, from 1942 to 1958 and again from 1962 
to 1984.  That alone can be considered a remarkable feat.  I 
wonder how many of us can even imagine enjoying such a large 
amount of support for so many years.  The people of Winnipeg had 
a great deal of confidence in their MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member for Churchill should be commended. The socialist 
camp in our country must be very proud of Stanley Knowles, 
claiming him as one of their own.  I know that Stanley sat at the 
clerk's table for many years after he completed his career as a 
member of parliament. 
In 1984 he became the only member of parliament ever to be made 
an honorary officer of the House of Commons with a lifelong chair 
at the clerk's table.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To the credit of the Liberal government of the day, it was 
former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau who extended the generous 
and kind offer to Mr. Knowles to stay as a member of the House 
with his own office in this very building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a long time House leader of the NDP, his knowledge of the 
rules and his love for parliament had no equal. A follower of the 
social gospel, he was renowned for his advocacy on behalf of the 
elderly, veterans, the poor and other disadvantaged Canadians. 
Canadians will be glad to be reminded of Mr. Knowles' 
accomplishments in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He delivered what some have called one of the greatest speeches 
in the House while opposing the Liberal government's use of time 
allocation.  The way I have heard the story told, during the 1957 
pipeline debate the Louis St. Laurent government tried to cut off 
debate in the House.  That was a Liberal government.  The 
Liberals were trying to limit debate in the same way the Liberal 
government today does time and again. Back in those days the 
government's use of closure and time allocation was not common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Knowles was a western populist.  He came from the roots of 
where the NDP and the Reform Party supporters come from.  My 
colleagues and I are here to represent those Canadians who know 
how Stanley Knowles felt when the government tried to use time 
allocation to ram a bill through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government has used time allocation and closure at 
least 61 times to deprive elected members of the House an 
opportunity to debate.  This is ridiculous.  This is so 
undemocratic that it is anti-democratic.  It is almost a 
dictatorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the 60th time the government closed debate on a bill was 
the week before last on the very day the House was supposed to be 
debating this motion.  The government shut down debate on the 
clarity bill aimed at clarifying how a future referendum for 
secession will be conducted.  This occurred on the very day we 
were going to ask the government to make arrangements to 
commemorate an hon. member of the House, someone who fought 
against time allocation and closure and the limiting of debate in 
the House. It is so ironic that the man who fought against time 
allocation on the pipeline bill, a very famous debate in the 
House more than 40 years ago, is himself the topic of debate in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 61st time the Liberals cut off debate was on the bill that 
makes changes to the Canada Elections Act. This bill favours the 
governing party and in this case it favours the Liberal Party and 
the Liberals are not going to change that.  They have not 
listened to the Chief Electoral Officer and they have not 
listened to the witnesses who appeared before the committee. They 
have no respect for the kind of forward thinking Stanley Knowles 
was famous for. He would not have supported this legislation if 
he were speaking from this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been in power for almost seven years.  They 
only have to shut down debate on any bill in the House five more 
times and they will be tied with Brian Mulroney's all-time record 
of 66 times.  It took Mulroney nine years to stifle democracy 66 
times.  The Liberals are ahead and they are likely going to set 
the record for being undemocratic.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When closure was first used to end a debate it was done because 
debate had gone on for 42 consecutive days.  That is why closure 
was required at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals shut down the debate on the clarity bill after just 
42 minutes.  They shut down the debate on extending benefits to 
same sex partners after just one hour and six minutes.  They shut 
down debate on the changes to the elections act, which I 
described earlier, after just two hours and forty minutes.  It 
was an important bill and they let debate continue for only two 
hours and forty minutes.  It is unbelievable.  It is shameful. 
Stanley Knowles is turning over in his grave, I am sure.  The 
Liberals have learned nothing from Stanley Knowles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have a Stanley Knowles day.  We need to celebrate the 
lives of those who have contributed so much to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can describe Stanley Knowles as a Canadian hero who stood for 
democracy in the House, who was famous for standing for the 
rights of elected members to debate anything they were supposed 
to debate.  He championed the rights of the people.  He left his 
mark on this place.  It is important for future generations to 
know that such a man existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is encouraging for young Canadians to learn of the 
accomplishments of a single Canadian who stood for the rights of 
members to debate in the House, who stood for democracy in the 
House.  It is very inspiring for young Canadians.  June 18, which 
was his birthdate, falls within the school year.  It is a good 
time to establish this day, a day of remembrance and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for Churchill for introducing this 
motion to remind the House and to remind the Liberals who are 
asleep at the wheel that democracy is important.  It will remind 
them how important the Canada Elections Act is, which will allow 
free and fair elections in this country.  It will remind Liberals 
that free debate should be allowed in the House without debate 
being cut off, without turning this place into an anti-democratic 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I am glad to speak in support of the motion and I 
wish the member the best of luck.  I hope she succeeds and I hope 
the Liberals will learn from Stanley Knowles.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, without a 
shadow of a doubt, Stanley Knowles was a great Canadian 
parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the House of Commons let him sit in the House to 
hear our debates bears witness to the esteem that all parties 
had for Mr. Knowles.  It is not surprising, therefore, that 
thought is now being given to having a day dedicated to his 
memory.  This is a most praiseworthy idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few questions, however, that have to be asked before 
commemorating an individual or an event. 
First of all, what is the purpose of commemorating that 
individual or event?  Primarily, it is to call to mind the 
values and principles we have been taught by that individual or 
event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, when there is a desire to commemorate an 
individual, as there is today, it is important for the values 
and principles that person defended to be evident to all.  A 
goodly number of Canadians and Quebecers might deserve having a 
day dedicated to them.  People distinguish themselves in all 
areas of endeavour, be it the arts, business, teaching, science, 
medicine or some other field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they not commemorated, despite their accomplishments? 
Because they are not widely known, and the population as a whole 
does not associate the values and principles they defended with 
these individuals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Knowles was very well known to parliamentarians and to his 
fellow Winnipeggers but, and this is regrettable, the average 
Canadian or Quebecer has no idea of the values and principles 
defended by Stanley Knowles. Therefore, in spite of all the 
merits of Stanley Knowles, dedicating a day to his memory would 
not help promote these values and principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These remarks are not meant to take anything away from Mr. 
Knowles' exceptional career as a parliamentarian. That career 
was indeed exceptional in more ways than one, and particularly 
in terms of its length. After working as a typsetter and 
printer, Stanley Knowles represented his fellow citizens in 
parliament for 37 years, between 1942 and 1984. The figures tell 
the tale: he was elected 13 times to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His career is also exceptional in terms of his contribution to 
the Canadian parliamentary system, which is a very topical issue 
these days. Stanley Knowles thought and wrote about the role of 
the opposition in this parliament. He also made a contribution 
to the debate on the role of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Knowles played a key role within his party, the New 
Democratic Party, particularly when the NDP was founded to 
replace the CCF, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, in 
1961. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Knowles' exceptional contribution to Canadian democracy 
was largely recognized in his home province of Manitoba, where 
everyone knew him. In Winnipeg, a school and a park are named 
after him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His memory is also honoured in Brandon University, of which he 
was chancellor for 20 years, from 1970 to 1990, with the Stanley 
Knowles chair for political studies. Here in this House, he is 
the only person ever to receive the title of honorary member of 
the House of Commons. Stanley Knowles was also made an officer 
of the Order of Canada in 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Knowles made a remarkable contribution to Canadian 
democracy. His exceptional contribution was recognized by 
Canadians and they are grateful to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in spite of all his merits, to dedicate a day to 
Stanley Knowles would not help promote his values and principles 
among the public. It would not add anything to the political 
stature of the man.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is truly 
an honour and a privilege for me to have this opportunity to rise 
in the House to debate the motion that would see us commemorate 
the wonderful life of Mr. Stanley Knowles by recognizing his 
birthday on June 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate the hon. member for Churchill 
for introducing this motion.  She obviously shares my deep sense 
of pride and respect, as do many Canadians, for the many 
accomplishments of the late member for Winnipeg North Centre. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have read and heard, Mr. Knowles worked very hard 
for all Canadians.  He worked particularly hard for the most 
vulnerable members of society. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank my hon. colleague from Churchill for 
introducing this motion.  It has allowed each and every one of us 
to look back upon the life of a great Canadian.  Mr. Knowles was 
someone whose strength and determination helped forge a greater 
Canada, one that we too often take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often forget that many of the social programs we take for 
granted today, such as employment insurance, old age security, 
the guaranteed income supplement, the minimum wage and others, 
were not readily available when Mr. Knowles began his long and 
distinguished career back in 1942. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 40 years Mr. Knowles was a member of parliament 
who was instrumental in helping to convince the government of the 
day to introduce and improve many of the social programs which 
help Canada's most vulnerable citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Knowles could understand and appreciate the struggles of 
everyday people.  He witnessed them firsthand during the Great 
Depression while working as an ordained minister in the United 
Church, watching senior workers being displaced by younger 
workers during the depression without being provided with a 
retirement pension plan.  This convinced him to work toward the 
elimination of injustices in the workplace.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Knowles fought for employee pension rights.  He fought for 
better pensions for our seniors.  He fought for better housing 
and help for the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it rather ironic that today we are speaking of the late 
Mr. Stanley Knowles.  I say ironic because of Motion No. 8 which 
was introduced in the House today.  If Stanley Knowles were here 
he would be appalled by what the government is doing to the fine 
institution of the Parliament of Canada, limiting our abilities 
as members of parliament to debate, to make amendments, to make 
changes to legislation and to truly do what we are supposed to do 
as parliamentarians.  I am sure Mr. Knowles is spinning in his 
grave. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit that I was a bit surprised to learn that Mr. 
Knowles' father came from Woods Harbour, which is just beside my 
riding of West Nova.  Mr. Knowles' ancestors came to Nova Scotia 
in 1760 only five years after the deportation of the Acadians in 
1755. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that Mr. Knowles saw this as a great injustice 
and was perhaps even influenced by the magnitude of this 
tragedy.  But this is only conjecture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain—Mr. Knowles loved to come to Nova Scotia to 
visit his family. 
Having lived in a small village the mainstay of which was 
fishing, Mr. Knowles certainly had a unique perspective on the 
differences and similarities with which the people of West Nova 
must cope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that Mr. Knowles would be shocked if he were to see the 
terrible straits in which our fishery now finds itself.  Like 
us, he would be completely dissatisfied with the way the Liberal 
government is ignoring the crisis in the fishery. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Knowles would be disgusted by the way the Liberal government 
has handled the crisis in the Atlantic fishery.  Like any 
Canadian whose livelihood is being threatened by government 
inadequacy or incompetence, I am certain that Mr. Knowles would 
be using every possible trick in the book to focus attention on 
this very serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Knowles was a master of parliamentary procedure.  I am 
certain he would have taken every possible opportunity to 
highlight the plight of our Atlantic fishermen.  He would have 
recognized the correlation between the serious brain drain that 
is going on in this country and the Liberal government's handling 
of the Atlantic fishery crisis.  He would recognize that this 
Liberal government will ultimately destroy our fishery, forcing 
more of our youth to head west in search of job opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the fisheries minister's press release which he 
sent out last Friday, the Atlantic fishery produces some $1.3 
billion in landed values.  That is nothing to sneeze at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like our seniors and our most disadvantaged citizens for whom 
Mr. Knowles fought so strenuously, I think our Atlantic fishermen 
deserve the same protection against a Liberal government which 
appears unable or unwilling to resolve the serious problems 
affecting the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Knowles was nothing if not tenacious in his pursuit of 
social justice.  He simply would not be deterred; not by his 
initial failures at the polls where he lost in the federal 
elections of 1935 and 1940, and then the provincial election in 
1941, nor by the disintegration of his CCF party, which 
ultimately transformed itself into today's New Democratic Party. 
His message never seemed to change over the years.  He continued 
to preach his social gospel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take comfort in recognizing the huge accomplishments of Mr. 
Knowles on behalf of all Canadians.  I can see that his tenacity 
has paid great dividends for the citizens of Canada and I am 
determined to show some of the same tenacity as I continue to 
represent the citizens of West Nova to the very best of my 
ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will draw attention to the serious crisis in the Atlantic 
fishery.  I will demand that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
address the terrible conditions of our local fishing wharfs which 
his department is so determined to ultimately abandon as a 
cost-cutting measure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent storm in my riding has left a number of our wharfs, 
including the Delaps Cove, Parkers Cove, Hampton, Port Lorne, 
Cottage Cove and Margaretsville in serious condition.  Another 
storm could wipe them out leaving our fishermen to fend for 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These fishermen need these wharfs for their livelihood.  Their 
communities need these wharfs because they provide an economic 
boost to their local economies.  They need these wharfs because 
they share an important cultural component with members of their 
own community as well as with the surrounding communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking for our Atlantic fishermen, I cannot stress strongly 
enough the importance of these wharfs to our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from a western province where agriculture is so important 
to the local economy, I am sure Mr. Knowles would appreciate why 
I have raised the serious plight of our farmers on so many 
occasions in the House.  After three consecutive years of drought 
conditions, our West Nova farmers are struggling for survival, 
just like our western counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's band-aid solutions fall far short of what is 
needed to stabilize this vital industry.  It is time that the 
government started looking at long term, sustainable programs 
that will seriously address the difficulties being experienced by 
our Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question of the tremendous accomplishments of Mr. 
Stanley Knowles.  He has been recognized on many occasions for 
his commitment to the Canadian people.  For example, in 1979 our 
leader and then prime minister, Mr. Joe Clark, appointed him 
ceremoniously to the Privy Council of Canada to mark his 37th 
anniversary in the House of Commons.  In 1970 he became 
Chancellor of Brandon University and in 1990 was designated 
Chancellor Emeritus.  He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1984. 
His name appears on schools and school libraries and most likely 
on a number of street signs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on.  However, I am not totally convinced that 
we should be recognizing a great Canadian on the date of his or 
her birthday at the exclusion of many other great Canadians. 
Somehow I prefer using days on our calendar to highlight great 
Canadian achievements, events and organizations that otherwise 
may not receive the recognition they so richly deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Knowles has a special place in Canadian history.  I 
think his achievements would best be recognized through our 
Canadian history books. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the 
member for Churchill on two of her initial statements, the first 
one being that I believe everyone in the House, regardless of 
partisan affiliation, will recognize that Stanley Knowles was 
indeed someone worthy of such consideration and was honoured by 
the House, as the member herself mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now say a few words in tribute to Mr. Knowles as well.  I 
was fortunate enough to have been in the House for a bit of the 
time while he was an honorary table officer.  I think it is 
fairly well accepted that Stanley Knowles was, first and 
foremost, a man of the people.  He was motivated by his concern 
for the less fortunate, some of whom are still to this day 
overlooked, and the undervalued members of our society.  His 
concern for the suffering of others was rooted, some argue, in 
personal suffering close to home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will relate an incident in 1932 when his father, 57 at the 
time, was laid off from his machinist's job when all employees 
over 55 were deemed expendable by an efficiency consultant. 
After many years of loyal service, the elder Mr. Knowles had no 
severance, no unemployment insurance, no sick benefits and no 
pension.  One could argue that this episode in Mr. Stanley 
Knowles' life was a benchmark event in his life and that it 
helped fuel his committed drive to guarantee so many elements of 
life that we today take for granted. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also pay tribute to Mr. Knowles as a parliamentarian par 
excellence.  His exceptional presence still makes itself felt in 
the House from time to time, when it is a question of balancing 
personal conscience against public perception or expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in this room that he has left his mark, and his 
accomplishments are still celebrated today.

rare privilege bestowed on him, having been given a seat at the

honorary officer of the House of Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree on that but I wish we could have perhaps avoided some 
partisan shots while we paid tribute to Mr. Knowles, but that is 
another matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree with the member for Churchill when she says that we 
do not do enough in this country to recognize, acknowledge, teach 
and transmit the knowledge of people such as Mr. Knowles to the 
younger generations.  I for one share that view and hope we will 
find ways as we evolve as a society to do more of this. It is 
important to make sure that the achievements of people like Mr. 
Knowles are communicated to our younger people so that they can 
get an appreciation of the values he represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I may not agree with her, as she may suspect, on 
whether or not the course suggested to commemorate and pay 
tribute to Mr. Knowles is the appropriate one, I would put some 
ideas on the table as to why this may not be appropriate, without 
demeaning the importance of Mr. Knowles, and perhaps put forward 
some suggestions that she may wish to consider in another forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one concern that has been alluded to by two of the 
opposition parties, and that is the phenomenon of too many people 
being honoured.  For instance, I did a very cursory check at the 
Library before coming here.  I picked three or four dates at 
random and asked for information out of the current edition of 
Canada's <I>Who's Who</I>, if you will—and we take that with a 
grain of salt because it is only living people and it is 
self-subscription to a certain extent—but on June 18 there are 
two current parliamentarians, who happen to be in the other 
place, who may or may not also qualify for a so-and-so day.  How 
do we decide that without bringing in partisanship or trying to 
make it an extraction of partisanship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 18, another date picked at random, would one want to 
honour Knowlton Nash?  I believe everyone knows Knowlton Nash. 
Someone from western Canada may wish to honour Peter Pocklington, 
or Margaret Atwood.  They were all born on the same day but in 
different years.  One can see the complications that could arise 
from that, and that is just a very cursory look at this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is March 28 where we have Marshall Cohan, a 
fairly well-known executive; Robert Sculley, a fairly well-known 
television personality; a fellow by the name of Paul David Sobey, 
who is fairly well known in Atlantic Canada in the business 
community; and we have Karen Kain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just trying to give examples of the kinds of difficulties 
we could get ourselves into.  The final example would be January 
26, where we have Roger Landry. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Roger Landry has just retired as a journalist for <I>La Presse</I>. He 
was and still is a very important newsmaker in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of someone like Claude Ryan, who is also an important 
Canadian newsmaker, or Wayne Gretzky. They were all born the 
same day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understandably, it would be difficult for us to approve the 
concept of an individual's day. And I did not name everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of not wanting to recognize the value and 
contributions of certain individuals, whether in the 
parliamentary or education field, in the arts, business, the 
media or sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might want to consider other options, and we have been 
thinking about it. The Order of Canada was created to recognize 
and pay tribute to the contributions of a large number of 
Canadians to our society, even if they were born on the same 
day. Some thought was given to it in the House, in a way, on other 
occasions. Perhaps this suggestion should be made to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather delicate to ask the government to recognize a 
parliamentarian. One might argue that it is the role of the 
House, and that the House or parliament could find other ways, 
here or elsewhere, to recognize the contribution of a great 
parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not against the idea of celebrate the life of Stanley 
Knowles. It is the way suggested here that is inappropriate. For 
example, we have before us three similar measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bill from the other place to designate a certain day 
as Sir John A. Macdonald Day. 
I think a member from the Progressive Conservative Party would 
like a day to be designated as Samuel de Champlain Day. 
Unfortunately, we are going to run out of days. There is limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before designating days to honour so and so, we should find 
other ways of doing it. I would like to make this suggestion to 
my colleague opposite, despite what some other members opposite 
might say. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Churchill.  I 
should advise the House that if she speaks now, she will close 
the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank all the members who have spoken tonight on behalf of 
Stanley Knowles and his great accomplishments.  I thank them for 
the support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clarify a couple of areas. My colleague who just 
preceded me indicated we could run out of days.  The United 
States of America recognizes Washington, Lincoln, Martin Luther 
King and I think there may be one other politician in all their 
years of history and they have not run out of days so I think in 
Canada we are probably fairly safe.  The United Kingdom has Guy 
Fawkes Day and maybe the other odd one.  I do not think that is 
the real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we can get beyond the partisan aspect and 
have support for parliamentarians who have done a great job. I 
want to clarify it was intended that it would be parliamentarians 
or politicians who would be recognized.  So often all that is 
ever recognized of politicians is any wrong that they may do. 
Very few people will have a good thing to say about any 
politician.  There are very few of us who could honestly say that 
we hear something good about us all the time. I think we can get 
beyond that for parliamentarians who have done a great job such 
as Stanley Knowles did.  There may be others as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question there are other ways of recognition.  The 
reason to recognize a day is that it becomes that day on the 
calendar.  Every time a child or an adult looks at the calendar 
on that day, they will think of Stanley Knowles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>St. Jean Baptiste Day has been on the calendar for heaven knows 
how long.  We do not recognize it.  We did not do anything with 
St. Jean Baptiste Day where I grew up but we recognized it and we 
learned about it and we understood it as we did other holidays 
that get recognized.  To me there is very great significance in 
putting the day on the calendar and officially recognizing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the New Democratic Party said on Stanley's passing 
that we have all lost a friend, one who fought with courage and 
vigour for equality, for social justice and the dignity of all 
Canadians.  Stanley Knowles is a Canadian worth honouring. 
He should be held in high esteem in our collective memories so 
that we may never forget his integrity as a man and as a 
politician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very disappointed that the motion was not made votable. I 
am going to take this opportunity to correct that wrong and ask 
if I could have unanimous consent of the House to make it a 
votable motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent of the 
House that the motion be votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hope there will be 
alternate ways that we can go about recognizing great 
parliamentarians.  I certainly intend to pursue them in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.  As 
the motion has not been designated as a votable item, the item is 
dropped from the order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 8 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 8 p.m.)
