</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, this amendment is to clarify 
the government's intentions with respect to changes being 
introduced to part II of the Canada Labour Code under Bill C-12. 
In making these amendments we want to emphasize that the special 
situations of pregnant and nursing mothers in the workplace are 
dealt with in the appropriate sections of the Canada Labour Code 
either under part II or part III. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In bringing this amendment forward the government wants to 
emphasize that it understands and shares the concerns for the 
protection of pregnant and nursing mothers which were raised by 
some members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and 
Government Operations during detailed consideration of Bill C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in accord with the need to ensure that appropriate 
legislation is in place to provide that protection.  However, we 
do not think it appropriate to include the special situation of 
pregnant and nursing mothers in a general motion on the 
definition of danger such as was done during committee. The point 
of this amendment is to clarify that situation and to produce 
legislation that is designed to protect all workers under federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we clearly recognize the need to meet the 
challenges faced by pregnant and nursing mothers.  In fact, the 
changes we have already brought forward under part II of the 
Canada Labour Code do provide for additional protection for 
pregnant and nursing mothers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, under the changes that have already been 
accepted by the committee and which will be part of the new act 
is a section stating that women who believe their workplace 
presents a danger to their fetus, or in the case of nursing 
mothers to their baby, will have the right to remove themselves 
from the activity without loss of pay or benefits. This provision 
is found in section 132 of Bill C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says that a pregnant or nursing mother who believes her job 
creates a risk for herself, her fetus or her child will have the 
right to stop doing her work and take the necessary time to 
consult her physician to ascertain if she is really at risk.  If 
there is indeed a risk, the employer can assign the woman to 
other duties in a safe location. I note that under new section 
132 the pregnant or nursing employee who takes time off to seek 
the advice of her physician can do so without loss of pay or 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the special situation of pregnant and nursing 
mothers should be addressed under sections of the code such as 
section 132 that deal specifically with their issues and not with 
sections that deal with general issues such as one that defines 
risk for workers in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that all hon. members understand that the 
special situation of pregnant and nursing mothers is further 
addressed under part III of the Canada Labour Code.  This is the 
part of the labour code that deals with labour standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are interested in maternity related workplace issues 
can also be referred to the amendments that were made to part III 
of the labour code in 1993. The approach under part III is to 
support pregnant or nursing women to remain in the workplace in a 
risk free environment.  The 1993 amendments provide for maternity 
related job modification, reassignment, leave and other benefits 
for pregnant and nursing women whose jobs pose a risk to herself, 
her fetus or her breast fed child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing part III the following process is to be 
followed in the case of a pregnant or nursing mother in a risk 
related job situation.  Employers are first required to modify 
the employee's job.  If that is not possible, she must be 
assigned to a safe job.  If no safe job option is available, 
leave is provided.  Leave is seen as the last resort. In most 
cases women taking risk related leave would have access to salary 
replacement through employment insurance or a private insurance 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leads me to remind colleagues about the comprehensive 
provisions that exist for maternity leave under EI.  I am 
speaking of provisions such as 17 weeks of maternity leave and 24 
weeks of parental leave, soon to be increased to 37 to mirror 
increases in allowable EI parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part III of the Canada Labour Code also addresses the special 
needs of pregnant and nursing women in the workplace.  The 
changes that we are making to part II complement these 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is still a situation that has our ongoing attention.  The 
government is committed to making workplaces as family friendly 
as possible and that includes improving conditions for women in 
the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have shown our concern and our willingness to strengthen the 
protection for pregnant and nursing mothers in the changes that 
we are now making to part II of the Canada Labour Code.  We are 
open and willing to consider changes under part III.  In fact, we 
are involved in active discussions respecting part III of the 
Canada Labour Code that would follow logically on the reviews of 
part I and part II done over the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this in mind, we have interested parties representing 
labour and management convened as the labour standards client 
consultative committee which has already begun discussions on 
issues related to labour standards.  I expect this group will be 
bringing recommendations for future consideration to the Minister 
of Labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister respects the efforts of labour, management and 
government to reach a tripartite consensus on challenging issues 
in the workplace.  At this point however, the best interests of 
those affected by the legislation will be served by passing this 
amendment and thereby strengthening Bill C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge my colleagues in the House to vote in favour of 
this amendment so that we can finalize this important piece of 
legislation and send it to third reading without delay.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois was amazed to see that the definition of health, as 
amended in committee, with the support of the Liberal member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, was changed in the bill at the report 
stage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This unacceptable correction to the work done in committee is 
designed, and this cannot be said in any other way, to deny 
pregnant or nursing women workers adequate protection, 
regardless of the other provisions of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of “risk”, to someone who has worked in 
occupational health and safety, influences the decisions made at 
various stages by experts, bosses and adjudicators.  This is out 
of the minister's hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our parliamentary responsibility is to read the texts.  What, 
then, was this amendment passed in committee?  I will read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It read: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“danger” means any hazard or condition that could reasonably be 
expected to cause injury or illness to a person exposed thereto— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the following was added: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—including a woman who is pregnant or nursing and to the foetus 
of a pregnant woman— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These words are no longer in the bill at the report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It read further: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—includes any exposure to working conditions that are likely to 
be dangerous to nursing mothers— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That too, which had been added and adopted by the committee with 
the support of a Liberal member, was withdrawn.  This concerns 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that, when the government says it will do something, it 
turns around and undoes it.  Nobody better try to tell me that 
this is not significant, it is.  What is incomprehensible once 
again is that this was passed by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly it was not done to get the Bloc Quebecois to give the 
bill more support.  We do not deny that, in some respects, the 
government tried to make improvements, but as concerns the 
health of pregnant or nursing women, the bill is far from what 
it ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This explains why, later on, we will introduce an amendment to 
enable working women in Quebec and the other provinces, at 
least, if they have better provisions, to benefit from Quebec's 
legislation and that of the other provinces, if they are better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these conditions, the Bloc Quebecois is fiercely opposed 
to the bill.  Women workers have long been waging these battles. 
It is unacceptable that women are not on an equal footing in a 
province like Quebec.  Within a single establishment, women, 
because they are pregnant or nursing, have a plan that protects 
them, that protects the fetus or the child, and in other 
instances, there is no such plan.  This is unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There have been negotiations and I think you would find 
unanimous consent to have Motion No. 2, which is currently in my 
name, stand in the name of Mrs. Lalonde. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek the unanimous consent of the House to have Motion No. 2, 
which I moved, now stand in the name of the hon. member for 
Mercier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Does the hon. member have 
the unanimous consent of the House to proceed in such a fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, in conclusion, I repeat 
that it makes no sense that pregnant or nursing employees do not 
have adequate protection and that, within one province, they do 
not enjoy the same protection under the federal and provincial 
labour relations legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unacceptable and a disgrace.  It is ridiculous that a 
country such as Canada, which boasts that it is a leader, does 
not protect pregnant and nursing workers.  I cannot understand 
how the minister, with all her empathy, has not sorted this out, 
because it leaves a gaping hole in this legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill C-12, a 
bill to amend part II of the Canada Labour Code.  There are three 
parts to the Canada Labour Code and this bill deals only with 
part II.  This part is the only part of the bill that covers the 
federal public service.  Interestingly enough, House of Commons 
employees are not covered as are other members of the federal 
public service.  That is something that has caused some concern 
and some comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the Canada Labour Code has not been significantly 
updated for 15 years.  Even this update has a rather chequered 
past.  It was first introduced just a few days before the last 
election writ was dropped, and of course died on the order paper 
when the House prorogued for the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took the government another two years after the last election 
to reintroduce these changes to the Canada Labour Code, which has 
not been updated for 15 years.  There seems to be a little 
foot-dragging on the part of the government in dealing with this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the positive things about this bill is that there have 
been lengthy consultations between both employer groups and 
employee associations.  The groups have reached a consensus on 
the kinds of changes they want to see in part II of the Canada 
Labour Code.  They would like to see these changes brought in 
before the next election, which the Prime Minister is threatening 
to call very soon.  Therefore, we are hopeful that these changes 
will pass through the process before the next election so that 
the next government will not have to start all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the amendments in Bill C-12. 
Amendments to the bill were brought forward by the standing 
committee.  One of the concerns that has not been resolved 
between government and the stakeholders is the matter of the 
appeals process.  The stakeholders, management groups and 
employee groups, agreed that there should be a two stage appeal 
process.  Currently, if a safety officer issues a directive, then 
that directive can be appealed to a regional safety officer and, 
if there is concern about the decision in that appeal, a further 
review by the Canada Industrial Relations Board is possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 would change the regional safety officer to an appeals 
officer.  This person would be appointed by the minister and 
would be given quasi-judicial powers.  A decision rendered by an 
appeals officer would be final. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is real concern that the one stage quasi-judicial process 
would not be sufficient to protect the rights and the democratic 
protections that workers should have.  There is a proposal that 
recourse should be given from a ruling by an appeals officer to 
the Public Service Staff Relations Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would support such an amendment.  We believe, in fairness, 
that there should be a two stage appeal process.  It is 
interesting that in almost all of its operations the government 
supports multi-levels of appeal, particularly, for example, in 
the immigration department.  In fact there have been criticisms 
that there are too many stages of appeal in some government 
departments.  However, in this case the government seems to be 
wanting to limit the ability of employers and employees to make 
sure there is a very clear and well considered final result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance agrees with the whole philosophy behind 
Bill C-12; that is, that health and safety in the workplace is 
the responsibility of every person at the work site.  This is an 
important issue to be addressed.  It is important issue to have 
updated regulations.  Between 30 and 40 workers in federally 
regulated workplaces die every year on the job, and another 
60,000 suffer occupational injuries or illness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important matter of concern for Canadians. 
Occupational injuries and illness not only cost the people and 
families involved, as well as the employers, they also cost the 
Canadian economy almost $5 billion a year.  Most of us would 
agree that an extra $5 billion of productivity could be very well 
spent on things like health care, education and other services 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that government legislation and regulations alone 
cannot promote a healthy workplace or prevent accidents.  In any 
workplace, if accidents are to be prevented, everyone must be 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the House to a report released in November, which was 
prepared by the British Columbia Workers' Compensation Board. 
British Columbia has very stringent health and safety laws. 
Unfortunately, the November report showed that these stringent 
laws were doing little to curb workplace fatalities.  It is very 
clear that a bill such as Bill C-12, which involves everyone, 
both employers and employees, in making sure that our workplaces 
in Canada are safe and secure to protect the well-being of 
workers, is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to support Bill C-12.  I urge the House to 
support the appeal proposal and I urge the government to ensure 
that the bill is passed and receives royal assent before the next 
election.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA LABOUR CODE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK16">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-12, an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code (Part II) in respect of occupational 
health and safety, to make technical amendments to the Canada 
Labour Code (Part I) and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
first amendment we are dealing with today seeks to reverse an 
amendment that was passed at the committee stage, moved by a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois, that would amend the definition of 
danger to make reference to pregnant and nursing mothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say by way of opening that the NDP finds no fault 
whatsoever and agrees to a large degree with many of the points 
made by the recent speaker from the Bloc Quebec.  One of the most 
compelling representations made to the standing committee dealing 
with Bill C-12 was one put forward by Professor Katherine Lippel 
from the University of Quebec at Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP caucus certainly concurs with many of the things she 
pointed out about the importance of taking extra measures and 
extra steps in the workplace to protect the special interests of 
pregnant and nursing mothers.  I am glad to point out that the 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour in her 
recent address to the House also seems to agree these are valid 
issues that need to be dealt with in the Canada Labour Code at 
some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to protect the health of pregnant workers, their unborn 
children or children who are nursing, our party believes that it 
is necessary for workers to have the right to be reassigned to 
tasks that do not present a danger to their health or the health 
of the unborn child or the nursing child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the reassignment of these workers to other less hazardous 
work is not feasible, the workers should be allowed to withdraw 
from work and be compensated thoroughly or without any loss. 
Workers should be made whole and should be able to feel free to 
leave the workplace without jeopardizing either their income, 
opportunity or ability to re-enter the workforce after the 
nursing period or the pregnancy is over at the same stage as they 
left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were serious about putting a true right to protective 
reassignment in place to protect the unborn child or the nursing 
child, it is important that it permits the withdrawal of work 
without penalty.  That is a key point which I believe the member 
from the Bloc made.  I believe the member was motivated to make 
that point because the law in Quebec provides for that.  In that 
regard the law in Quebec is far more favourable to pregnant and 
nursing mothers than the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to preface my remarks by saying how wholeheartedly we 
agree with the concept and how we look forward to the day when 
the Canada Labour Code is amended to accommodate pregnant and 
nursing mothers in that fashion.  I also want to point out that 
Bill C-12 is the product of exhaustive consultations between 
labour and management over the past seven years across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experts in the field, the actual stakeholders and 
practitioners in industrial relations in the federal 
jurisdiction, have viewed every clause and every aspect of the 
bill.  They did not seek to amend the definition of danger when 
the recommendations were finally put forward to government and 
when government finally tabled Bill C-12.  Even at every stage of 
Bill C-12 to this point, neither the labour community nor the 
management community in the federal sector has felt it necessary 
to amend the definition of danger as it stands in the act.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is of the view that Bill C-12 has much merit and is 
eagerly anticipated by those who practise in the federal 
jurisdiction.  It has such a possibility of protecting the health 
and safety of workers in the workplace that we are very reluctant 
to enter into any kind of amendments at this stage that may delay 
the speedy passage of Bill C-12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best thing that could possibly happen is that Bill C-12 gets 
through report stage, gets into third reading, and gets passed 
through the Senate prior to the end of this session of the House. 
If it is left over to the fall, we are fearful that it may 
jeopardize the progress that has been made through the process of 
consultation, negotiation and now debate in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I liken it to a lengthy and exhaustive round of collective 
bargaining.  Seven years ago labour and management sat down at 
the table to start to review part II of the Canada Labour Code. 
Both parties came to the table with a number of issues they 
wanted dealt with.  They exhaustively went through clause by 
clause every aspect of part II of the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both sides showed real generosity and a spirit of compromise to 
make it work.  Everyone had to compromise their positions and 
temper their demands with reason so they could put together a 
package that would be palatable, would serve the needs of their 
industrial sector, and ultimately protect the rights of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 achieves that in most regards.  One of the gains we 
look forward to in Bill C-12 is the strengthening of the rights 
of workplace safety and health committees so that they might 
better oversee the conditions in the workplace to make sure that 
they do not present any danger to workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It allows for regulations that every employer has to establish 
and monitor a prevention program for the workplace.  These are 
big moves to anyone who actually knows the realities of this 
industrial sector of federal jurisdiction.  To actually have 
agreed on issues like that one shows huge movement and great 
progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas we are sympathetic to the issue raised by the member 
from the Bloc at committee, we believe the Canada Labour Code 
should deal with the rights of pregnant and nursing mothers, but 
not in part II.  Frankly part III of the Canada Labour Code is 
the area which deals with the reassignment of pregnant or nursing 
mothers if they feel there is some risk to their health in the 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that part III is currently being reviewed and 
amended by the same exhaustive process which we dealt with in 
part II.  We are satisfied the experts in the field, the true 
practitioners in the field, will be seized of the issue and will 
make recommendations to amend part III to give satisfaction to 
those who are concerned about the issue and to those who believe, 
as we do, that the current code does not go far enough to look 
after the special interests of that group of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that it would be wrong at this point to change 
the definition of danger in part II of the code to specifically 
point out any group of workers.  The definition of danger should 
be a general clause that deals with all workers in the 
jurisdiction.  It should not point out any particular occupation, 
trade, gender or age group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be truly legally effective, the definition of danger has to 
be a very general term that will stand up to any challenge from 
any sector.  We believe it was a mistake, although a well meaning 
mistake, at the committee to seek to amend the definition of 
danger to specifically refer to any type of worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last and final point is that the only reason we find it 
necessary to oppose the amendment passed at committee and 
therefore vote in favour of the amendment we currently have in 
front of us is the very real fear that if this were subject to 
review, challenges or exhaustive interpretations by the judicial 
department, or even if it ran into problems at the Senate because 
it may add some unnecessary complications to the definition of 
danger, we may run the risk of delaying the whole bill and losing 
the opportunity to pass it in this session of the House.

at committee to include pregnant and nursing mothers in the 
definition of danger in clause 2 of part II of the Canada Labour 
Code. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have followed the debate on Bill C-12 so far and we in the PC 
Party as well recommend speedy approval of it.  It seems that it 
has the general approval of both labour and management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support it fully because key in the bill is an expanded role 
for health and safety committees in the workplace that envisions 
identifying and dealing with hazards, potential hazards and 
related refusals to work quickly and efficiently in the 
workplace.  Now we have an amendment that addresses in a very 
real way the dangers to pregnant and nursing mothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill claims to seek a better balance between the role of 
government employers and employees in dealing with such workplace 
incidents, with more emphasis on establishing rules and 
procedures to deal with these matters at the local level.  I 
consider that to be very good indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has come about as a result of consultation among 
government, business and labour in an effort to modernize our 
health and safety legislation which last underwent a major 
overhaul probably back in 1985.  The bill has significant support 
among the various groups of people involved in it.  I understand 
that labour has been consulted widely on the bill and that it has 
significant support from management as well.  In general, as I 
said a moment ago, we support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is probably incumbent on us to raise a few questions now that 
we have the ear of the minister who is here today.  No piece of 
legislation is every perfect.  No piece of legislation is ever 
complete.  The legislative process is a living one.  Those of us 
familiar with it are used to acts of parliament being subject to 
ongoing changes as time goes by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 introduces a new concept in the health and safety 
arena called ergonomics.  Subsection 125.1 states that employers 
shall ensure that the machinery, equipment and tools used by 
employees in the course of their employment meet prescribed 
health, safety and ergonomic standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sounds very good but it is a bit vague on detail.  To the 
lay person ergonomics is a strange and very sophisticated 
sounding word.  It is the art or the science of designing or 
changing the workplace to minimize the risk of injury to an 
employee in the course of his or her normal duties.  It is based, 
I would assume, on the old adage we have heard time and time 
again that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound a cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the U.S. department of labour 
announced a major ergonomics initiative designed to prevent an 
estimated 300,000 workplace injuries, saving $9 billion in the 
American economy.  An American press release showed that the U.S. 
federal government is very advanced in that area with a detailed 
description of the roles and responsibilities of labour and 
management in meeting these new ergonomic standards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the minister might give us a some information on that, 
and expand on it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of workplace safety not covered in the bill is the 
notion of the psychological protection of the worker in the 
workplace; the right to work in an environment free of harassment 
and various other types of discrimination.  Such matters can 
cause grief in the workplace just as easily as a physical injury 
or threat of a physical injury can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are protections against a worker being unfairly 
disciplined for reporting a potential workplace hazard, there 
appears to be no provision in the bill to provide for a positive 
psychological work environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 122(1) of the bill defines health as: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the absence of physical disease or infirmity or mental illness 
arising out of, linked with or occurring in the course of 
employment... 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It specifically points out that it does not include the effect 
of ordinary workplace stress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the modern world stress is often the cause of much grief in 
the workplace, especially if the stress, be it physical or 
psychological, is repetitive in nature.  Indeed, repetitive 
physical stress is one of the main reasons we promote the sound 
ergonomic practices that I mentioned earlier.   Perhaps the 
minister could address that issue later.  I would have thought 
the avoidance or prevention of stress would have been a major 
goal in any occupational health and safety initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have introduced two amendments today.  The amendment 
introduced by the minister clarifies the meaning of what a 
dangerous condition in the workplace involves and addresses risk 
related incidents in the workplace.  We fully support the 
amendment because it expands upon the definition of danger to 
give reference to pregnant and nursing mothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is generally a very good bill.  It has the general support 
of both labour and management.  From briefings I have had from 
the minister's office, I believe labour and management have been 
consulted widely on this.  We recommend speedy passage of the 
bill and hopefully it will be passed before we rise.

hope that you are listening carefully, along with the minister 
and all the women in the House, because it is to the ladies that 
I am speaking.  The gentlemen may leave because I am addressing 
the ladies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the party across the way wants to withdraw the 
Bloc Quebecois' amendment is quite simply disgraceful and 
unacceptable for women.  Over 50% of women and mothers work.  Of 
these, over 50% are pregnant or nursing their newborns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois member's amendment, which was passed in 
committee and approved by the member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, has been withdrawn. 
The result will be two classes of women in Canada—those covered 
by Quebec's labour legislation and those covered by the Canada 
Labour Code.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What do the women who are covered by the Quebec legislation get? 
What does the Quebec legislation provide for women who get 
pregnant while working in Quebec? As soon as they get pregnant, 
and upon receiving a note from their doctor, the employer must, 
if these women work in an unsafe environment, relocate them to a 
workplace that is safe for their health and that of the foetus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important. It means that we take care of a pregnant 
woman and her foetus. Companies are required to relocate the new 
mother to a workplace that is safe and that will not compromise 
her health and that of the foetus. 
What happens if the company cannot relocate the expectant 
mother? She is told to go home and look after her pregnancy, her 
foetus and her health. A mother is important and so is a 
newborn. “You take care of yourself. Moreover, during your whole 
pregnancy and after, we will pay you 90% of your net salary”. In 
Quebec, we encourage working mothers to have children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Canadian legislation provide for women in the rest 
of Canada and Quebec women who are governed by it? It says 
“Listen, you are pregnant. That is great. If you cannot work, go 
home. We will give you about 50% of your salary”. However, it is 
not all women who can benefit from that treatment. Only those 
who have worked over 700 hours qualify under the Canadian 
legislation. This is a terrible shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have the attention of the minister, because the 
women in the Liberal Party should fight to get the Bloc 
Quebecois' amendment passed.  Without this amendment, we end up 
back with the two tiered system.  There is the Quebec 
legislation that may not be perfect but that leans toward 
perfection and the Canadian legislation that pushes women and 
mothers backwards.  This is unacceptable to me, a man.  How can 
you, Madam Speaker, and the women members sitting here, find 
this acceptable?  It is, quite simply, unacceptable.  The 
members should think twice about it.  Their solidarity is 
necessary.  I ask all women members to join with us and vote in 
favour of the amendment by the Bloc Quebecois on behalf of all 
their Canadian and Quebec sisters who work and who are mothers 
or future mothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we must not forget that this concerns some 50% of 
the Canadian population.  According to Statistics Canada, some 
50% of women are in the labour force.  If Liberal members have 
something to say to their caucus, to Cabinet or to the minister, 
who appears to be a good grandmother and mother, but seems more 
interested in chatting than in listening to the important things 
I have to say, they should say it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that the minister use her influence to get the Bloc 
Quebecois amendment passed.

that the information is encrypted and no specific information 
about individuals is given out.

herself whole.  First she said that this longitudinal database 
was secret.  When I pointed out that it is already public on

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are outraged and alarmed to learn that the government 
has been keeping every detail of their lives on a computer disk, 
first because the government has been doing it by stealth, 
second, because the government has abused our trust too many

say it is all right for the government to give the private sector 
details about individual Canadians.  I said just the opposite, 
and she should withdraw that inaccurate assertion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the last ones who should make these assertions.  Her

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday the Bank of Canada increased the bank rate by some 
50 bases points.  It said that this was a pre-emptive strike 
against inflation.  Virtually all of the experts have agreed that 
this is overkill by the Bank of Canada.  In fact the inflation 
rate actually fell last month.  It did not go up, it fell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of that, will the finance minister put pressure on the 
Bank of Canada to reverse the hike in interest rates and refrain 
from penalizing the Canadian people for an inflation crime they 
did not commit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is not the custom of the Minister of Finance or the 
government to comment on interest rates or exchange rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend by now should know something about the autonomous 
role created by a statute of the House for the Bank of Canada.  I 
think that one could say that we continue to believe that there 
will be good solid growth in the Canadian economy, based on what 
has happened so far and with the support of the most recent 
federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that as my hon. friend asks his supplementary question 
he will give the government praise for what has been accomplished 
so far and what will be accomplished. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance commented on the bank rate 
yesterday.  The Minister of Finance has the authority under the 
Bank Act to put pressure on the governor to change the rates if 
he wants to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of this, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Royal Bank of 
Canada yesterday announced record increases in profits in this 
country.  An increased bank rate will mean more money for big 
banks and less money for ordinary citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask once again, in light of the fact that a bank rate increase 
could also increase the service charge on the national debt by 
billions of dollars, will the Deputy Prime Minister change his 
mind, talk to the governor of the Bank of Canada and ask him to 
roll back the bank rate because inflation is dropping?  All he is 
doing is slowing down the Canadian economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

finance minister does not intervene in the day to day operations 
of the Bank of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do is look over the medium term in terms of 
fiscal or monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the prime rate and mortgage rates, despite the

will be answered today. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 99—<B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the vessel Stena Challenger purchased by Marine 
Atlantic: (<I>a</I>) what was the price paid for the vessel; (<I>b</I>) was 
the normal public procurement process followed and if not, why 
not; (<I>c</I>) who were the brokers on both sides of the transaction; 
(<I>d</I>) what is the date of construction of the vessel; (<I>e</I>) where 
was it built; (<I>f</I>) what facilities will be used to upgrade the 
vessel; (<I>g</I>) what is the extent of the upgrading; (<I>h</I>) how 
much will the upgrading cost; and (<I>i</I>) has the vessel been 
registered under any other names? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> (a) The list price of the vessel, the Stena 
Challenger, was $60 million CDN, firm and final. However, it 
appears that Marine Atlantic, MAI, was able to negotiate a $2 
million reduction on this price, for a final cost of $58 million. 
The vessel is also subject to a 25% foreign vessel import duty 
and 15% harmonized sales tax, HST, on the purchase price, for an 
additional combined cost of approximately $25 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) MAI followed an open and trasparent process in selecting its 
vessel. Early in the fall, MAI carried out some initial market 
research on the availability of vessels. Subsequent to receiving 
formal direction to negotiate on the purchase of a vessel and to 
maximize market coverage, MAI proceeded with an invitation to 
tender, ITT, to secure firm offers from brokers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their vessel search, MAI went to the market and researched 
over 40 vessels that were suggested by shipbrokers. Analysis was 
done on the suitability, cost and capacity of the vessels. A 
short list of six vessels that appeared to be reasonable 
candidates for the gulf service was developed. In November of 
1999, a technical team was sent to Europe to inspect the six 
vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In december 1999, with a desire to proceed with a transparent 
selection process, MAI issued an ITT to maximize market coverage 
and to secure firm offers. Using previously developed criteria, 
an assessment team composed of MAI personnel and a naval 
architect from Public Works and Government Services Canada, PWGSC, 
formed a short list of three candidate vessels; a night ferry, a 
day ferry and a Ro-Pax, from the 27 vessels offered by brokers 
through the ITT. Of the three vessels, one was subsequently 
removed due to its advancing age, high price and lack of adequate 
head room for commercial traffic. The two remaining vessels, 
owned by the same company, were deemed to meet price, condition 
and capacity requirements. Of these two, the Stena Challenger was 
chosen by MAI as best meeting their fleet requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Twenty-one brokers from around the globe submitted a list of 
vessels in response to MAI's ITT. To avoid the issue of multiple 
brokers claiming the same vessel, MAI requested that the brokers 
provide a letter of acknowledgement from the seller, identifying 
them as the preferred broker on any particular vessel. The Stena 
Challenger, was submitted by Brax Shipping AB of Gothenburg, 
Sweden, along with the appropriate letter of acknowledgement from 
Stena Lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) The Stena Challenger is nine years old. Constructed in 1991, 
it will be the youngest vessel in MAI's fleet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) The Stena Challenger was built in Norway by the Fosen Mek 
Versteder Shipyard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) The Challenger had undergone a refit prior to being purchased 
by MAI and will require only minor modifications. This work will 
likely be carried out just prior to the vessel being put into 
service on the gulf in 2001 after the current lease contract has 
expired. No decision has been made yet as to which facility will 
be used to carry out the upgrade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) Having recently undergone a refit, MAI anticipates that very 
little upgrading will be required to the Challenger and would 
involve such things as the installation of additional seating, 
Canadian approved safety equipment and new signage. Most of the 
work is minor in nature and it is expected that is should be 
completed within a month to six weeks of receiving the vessel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h) MAI estimates that it will cost $2 million to bring this 
vessel up to Canadian standards, however, registration and vessel 
survey and inspection fees are included in this amount. Actual 
modifications and upgrade expenses are estimated to cost in the 
range of $1.3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) No, the vessel has only been registered under the name the 
Stena Challenger.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to move this amendment to 
Bill C-12. Its purpose is clear—to ensure that all workers, 
particularly those who are pregnant or nursing, are covered by 
the legislation in force in their province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would mean that workers in Quebec would not be 
penalized by the federal legislation.  Members should know that 
approximately 100,000 workers in Quebec are covered by the 
federal rather than the provincial labour code.  Workers covered 
by the federal code will be protected by the bill we are now 
debating. 
However, as far as pregnant and nursing workers are concerned, 
this bill is far inferior to existing provisions in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this amendment is therefore to ensure that the 
provincial code applies to all employees described in clause 132 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment was drafted by the member responsible for this 
issue, the member for Laurentides, our labour critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be replacing her today, for a number of reasons. 
The result of the struggles which, in Quebec, gave rise to the 
present legislation on occupational health and safety and its 
protection of women, must benefit not only women covered by 
Quebec's labour code but also women subject to the federal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ridiculous that, within one province, and even within one 
federal building, where some employees come under the provincial 
code, there are women operating under two completely different 
codes.  What we are talking about is the protection of pregnant 
and nursing women.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is an improvement over the provisions of the Canada 
Labour Code as they were previously.  It does, however, stop 
short of providing pregnant or nursing women with complete 
protection.  There are several weaknesses in the clause in 
question, and we are especially flabbergasted that, from the 
moment their physician declares that there is a danger, women 
will no longer receive their pay and will be forced to go on 
employment insurance, if they are eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great departure from the Quebec legislation, which 
provides for women to retain 90% of their salary.  It makes no 
sense for this to apply in one province.  I am not familiar with 
the legislation of other provinces. 
I do know that, overall, provincial legislation follows federal 
legislation rather closely, and I find that regrettable.  We in 
Quebec cannot stand for there being such a difference between 
the coverage provided to women under provincial legislation and 
what is provided to women covered by the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason behind our calling for this amendment.  We 
know that we are again dealing with the matter of Quebec versus 
Canada.  In this case, it is very frustrating because these are 
social policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was vice-president of the CSN at the time that the Quebec 
legislation was introduced and discussed, in 1997.  It was no 
easy task to get the provisions contained in the Quebec 
occupational health and safety legislation passed.  Nor has it 
been an easy task to maintain them. 
On a number of occasions, the employers who are equally 
represented on the committee overseeing the implementation of 
the occupational health and safety act said several times “But 
that is costly and should not be covered by the CSST”.  But the 
debates and discussions have continued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle is that a pregnant or nursing employee who may 
feel she, her baby or the fetus is at risk because she is 
working, should not find it difficult to be moved or, if she 
cannot be moved to another job, she should be able to stay at 
home and wait to return to work as an employee and a contributor 
to the production and enrichment of the compagny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we did in Quebec was spread the costs among everyone.  It 
then becomes a general social benefit paid for by everyone. 
It makes no sense for the present legislation to compel the 
woman to stay at work. This is the serious part. If the woman 
does not accept it, what does she do?  Does she agree to stay at 
work, despite the risks?  That is what this means, exactly what 
this means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not encourage a woman to question.  It encourages her, 
if hers is the only income or if this income is vital, to agree 
to conditions that are dangerous to her or her child or to not 
nurse the child.  This makes no sense.  Let no one try to tell 
me she can receive employment insurance benefits.  First, she 
needs to be eligible for them and then, if she ever needs them 
because of a layoff or for other reasons, she will no longer be 
able to draw them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that the health of pregnant women is not given the 
attention it is due.  I do not understand how we could come to 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the NDP member say earlier that that could be considered 
elsewhere, but the legislation will be there.  Once it is 
passed, that is what will apply and, as far as I know, there is 
no thought being given to amending it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this amendment is acceptable.  I think this 
is an opportunity, in this House, to allow women in Quebec to be 
treated on an equal footing with women covered by Quebec's 
labour legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am basically begging, because it is women who will be 
penalized, when all that is needed is agreement for provincial 
legislation to apply. 
Furthermore, I should point out that this was the case until 
1988, until a constitutional ruling.  I should also point out 
that there is an agreement with one department concerning 
certain workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if it can be done by agreement, why could women not benefit 
in all cases from this right acquired and maintained at such 
cost by women in Quebec and their male colleagues?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
Motion No. 2 seeks to amend Bill C-12 by adding further language 
to section 132, which would make it such that the rules in the 
provincial jurisdiction would take precedence over the federal 
code in matters related to pregnant and nursing mothers in the 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 132 consists of totally new language.  All of section 
132, which deals with pregnant and nursing employees, consists of 
brand new language and is the product of the same comprehensive, 
co-operative, joint committee work that has been undertaken for 
many years between labour and management.  The language that we 
have in Bill C-12 concerning section 132 is what the industry 
sector stakeholders agreed to.  They saw no need to amend it 
further.  There was no directive to us from labour 
representatives indicating that they wanted additional changes to 
section 132.  FETCO, the employer agency in the federal 
jurisdiction, was satisfied with the new section 132. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only amendment that the NDP sought was to add further 
clarification to one clause.  That amendment failed at committee. 
Frankly, it is not of much concern to us.  We only hoped to 
further clarify the intention of section 132. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to the speech we just heard from the Bloc member, 
everyone agrees that we should all have legislation that is as 
civilized as that which is enjoyed by Quebec workers in the 
province of Quebec.  I have no doubt in my mind that pregnant and 
nursing employees in the province of Quebec are better served 
than in any other jurisdiction, and that they are better served than 
they would be under the Canada Labour Code.  However, the impact 
of the amendment the Bloc put forward would give primacy to 
provincial legislation over federal legislation.  In many 
provinces, if the provincial legislation had primacy, Canadian 
female workers would have lesser terms and conditions than those 
provided in the code, other than in the province of Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP cannot agree with this because in the other nine 
provinces and two territories the standards would actually 
decrease, rather than increase to the highest standards, which 
are those found in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other reason we are reluctant to support this amendment is, 
as with the first motion, we do not want to see this bill delayed 
in any way, shape or form.  We believe that the motion which was 
put forward by the hon. member from the Bloc would cause delays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill reaches the Senate, I believe that the Senate 
review committee would have serious problems with the language. 
The Senate would ask for a review by the justice department to 
see what the real impact would be.  Would it overlap with 
provincial jurisdiction?  Could there be a constitutional 
challenge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, even if this amendment passed all of those 
tests, it would cause delays that would take us well beyond the 
end of this session.  It would take us into the fall.  Who knows 
what the future will bring in the fall of this year.  We may be 
faced with an election.  It would be very regrettable if this 
legislation did not get back on the books at all.  All of the 
people in the federal jurisdiction who have been waiting 
patiently for amendments to part II of the Canada Labour Code, 
who have been waiting patiently for all the positive changes in 
part II, would be further frustrated.  The whole process would 
have to be started again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with regret that our caucus cannot support this motion.  I 
should make it abundantly clear that it has nothing to do with 
the merits of the argument brought forward that pregnant women 
and nursing mothers need additional recognition due to their 
special circumstances in the workplace.  However, my party is 
comfortable that part III of the Canada Labour Code deals with 
the redeployment of pregnant or nursing mothers who feel that 
they or their babies may be in some danger in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, part III of the code is being reviewed in the same 
comprehensive fashion as part II.  It is being reviewed by the 
actual stakeholders, labour and management, and FETCO, which 
represents employers in the federal jurisdiction.  They are 
seized of this issue.  They know that the current code is lacking 
and needs improvement.  Part III is the appropriate place to make 
improvements to the issues we are talking about, not part II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appeal to all members of the House to support Bill C-12 
as amended.  The NDP hopes that the bill will be widely received 
in a positive way by all parties.  Let us move quickly to pass 
the bill into law prior to the end of the session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to echo the words of the 
NDP member opposite.  He has very clearly indicated that the 
amendments we see to section 132 which were presented to the 
committee are indeed the result of a tripartite agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments proposed by the Bloc would dismiss the work done 
on the tripartite agreement and would provide for a different 
kind of classification between one worker in the federal sector 
and another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation would give pregnant women and nursing 
mothers the right to refuse work which they deem would be of 
danger to themselves, their fetus or their nursing child.  As 
such, we feel very confident that this legislation would give 
adequate protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On issues of compensation and further review, there is an 
opportunity under part III of the Canada Labour Code, which deals 
specifically with maternity related reassignment, leave and 
benefits.  There is an opportunity, in the spirit of labour, 
management and government working together, to make amendments 
under part III of the Canada Labour Code.  The groups are working 
on that, and that is where these issues could be dealt with more 
fully.

That is why we were so pleased to see the results of the 
tripartite agreement that gave, for the first time, under part 
II, section 132, these protections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than belabour the point, I will just echo the comments of 
the member opposite.  He has put the situation as we see it 
clearly and concisely.  We would urge all members of the 
government to support the bill as it currently is before us, and 
to reject the amendments brought forward by the Bloc today.

of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to rise and speak to this motion 
which was introduced by my colleague.  The motion calls for 
co-operation among like-minded nations to develop multilateral 
initiatives in order to strengthen the capacity of international 
organizations and prevent conflicts that have created havoc on 
civilian populations.  This is a very important subject as 
today's conflicts are unfortunately using civilians as pawns in 
people's desire for power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk for a moment about what we see on television screens 
these days.  We see conflicts, havoc, devastation and the misery 
that civilian populations are subjected to these days.  The 
horror stories resulting from these conflicts boggles the mind. 
An urgent response from the international community is needed in 
order to respond to these cries for help.  These are helpless 
civilians caught in a conflict for which they have no say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more tragic is that the majority of these conflicts 
taking place on continents around the world are against 
democracy.  Democracy is under attack.  Elected governments are 
under severe attack by individuals and organizations that have no 
ideological desire to improve the lot of the people but are 
attempting to seize power for their own egotistical desire for 
power. 
At the dawn of the 21st century, this is a serious concern that 
the world community must take into account.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, my colleague has introduced this motion asking that 
like-minded nations—when we talk about like-minded nations we 
are discussing countries that hold democratic values very 
high—put pressure on countries in conflict and work toward 
preventing these conflicts from taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no point in reacting after the fact.  As we have 
witnessed in the Rwanda genocide, in Kosovo and today in Sierra 
Leone, the conflicts explode so rapidly, with the civilian 
population being murdered, that by the time today's international 
intervention takes place, misery has already been created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We witnessed the late reaction to Rwanda, the late reaction now 
to Sierra Leone and, to a degree, the late reaction even in 
Kosovo where when the international community finally came it was 
after thousands had already died or had been displaced from their 
homes.  In Sierra Leone, tragically, many people had limbs cut 
off and children were being used as soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see these things at the dawn of the 21st century, we 
cannot understand how, with the rapid communications we have and 
the ability and co-operation we have, we continue to fail to 
address these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is asking that we address the issue far in advance, 
identify the areas of potential conflict and move in rapidly to 
diffuse the situation.  We are now trying to address the issue 
through the international code, but this is after the fact when 
the damage has already been done to future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must, for the sake of democracy, for the sake of humanity and 
for the sake of the children, address this issue now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the driving force that creates these conflicts?  Prior 
to the collapse of the cold war, we had ideologies that drove 
these conflicts.  With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the 
cold war, we now see a marked change in these conflicts.  They 
have now moved in order to fulfil some people's egos.  They are 
fueled by money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key issue is that these conflicts are no longer supported by 
other ideological nations but are supported by money.  Where is 
the money coming from?  It is quite sad to see the conflicts that 
are now being fueled by money.  Who is financing these conflicts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many Latin American countries, the money comes from drug 
sales.  Where does the money come from on the continent of 
Africa?  It comes from the rich diamond fields. For those engaged 
in the conflicts today it has become very evident that they are 
in control of the natural resources and specifically diamonds. 
They market these diamonds in the international marketplace, take 
the money and then fuel their war where they create misery.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from plundering the natural wealth, which is not being 
used to advance the social fabric, the democratic fabric nor the 
lives of the citizens of that nation, this has been squandered 
and has helped fuel the majority of the wars that are taking 
place in many countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the developed world have the ability to starve off the 
financial resources that these people are getting by helping to 
identify the potential future areas of conflict and diffuse them. 
We are bound to create a situation where they can no longer 
access money from the international market by selling their 
diamonds or other natural products, including drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, we know from experience that sanctions are not 
working.  Iraq is one example of where sanctions have not worked. 
In many other countries in the world sanctions have not worked. 
If sanctions have not worked, what else will work?  Dialogue? 
Diplomacy?  Those are good ideas but how will we put pressure on 
them?  In the first place, these people who are responsible for 
the conflict have refused to listen to the voice of reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking all members of the House to look at this motion 
and at its long term implication that will help solve and prevent 
conflicts.  This is an extremely important motion to me.  I hope 
all my colleagues in the House see the motion in that capacity 
and support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
motion currently before the House in its amended form calls on 
the government to continue and intensify efforts with other 
nations to further develop multilateral initiatives in order to 
strengthen the capacity of the international organizations to 
enable them to identify the precursors to conflict and improve 
their conflict prevention capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada attaches great importance to conflict prevention and 
improving existing international capabilities for early warning. 
We continue to be involved in ongoing efforts to strengthen the 
existing tools of international conflict prevention in a variety 
of fora which have been discussed in previous debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will highlight the important work of the G-8 in the area 
of conflict prevention.  As mentioned in previous debates, the 
G-8, of which Canada is an active member, is seized of this 
issue.  In advance of the G-8 summit in Japan this July, 
officials have held several policy meetings on a variety of 
subjects, including conflict prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a meeting of the G-8 conflict prevention officials in March 
of this year, it was agreed that recommendations would be made in 
advance of the leader's summit to undertake a series of 
initiatives related to small arms, conflict and development, 
diamonds, and children in armed conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been heavily involved in advancing key aspects of the 
human security agenda in the G-8 context and working to ensure 
efforts complement work in other fora, in particular the UN 
Security Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work undertaken by the G-8 conflict prevention officials 
reveals a strong commitment to the implementation of the Berlin 
communiqué agreed to in December 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been considerable development of action oriented 
conflict prevention initiatives which will draw on the 
comparative advantage of the G-8 in specific areas.  Officials 
also recognize the importance of effective consideration of the 
economic side of the conflict prevention in order to ensure a 
truly comprehensive and coherent approach by G-8 partners.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The G-8 is working in support of national, regional and global 
efforts to ensure that the challenges of destabilizing 
proliferation of small arms faced by the international community 
are addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The G-8 conflict prevention officials have advanced several 
ideas in response to these challenges which will lessen the 
impact of destabilization, accumulations of small arms on ongoing 
conflict, as well as preventing new conflicts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the G-8 intends to continue exercising a high 
degree of responsibility in licensing exports of small arms, 
while recognizing legitimate defence and security concerns of 
importing states.  It will be implemented in conjunction with 
demand side measures.  In this context the G-8 conflict 
prevention officials stress the importance of the adoption of the 
ECOWAS moratorium on the importation, exportation and manufacture 
of light weapons in October 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The G-8 intends to work to ensure that its expert policies and 
decisions respect the moratorium and will provide support to 
capacity building projects in states directly affected by illicit 
small arms trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that economic growth and sustainable development 
will exist only when there is peace and democratic stability, the 
G-8 will promote the consideration of conflict prevention and 
development assistance strategies.  It will enhance assistance to 
ensure a focused, quick response with the aim of conflict 
prevention.  It will ensure a smooth transition from emergency 
humanitarian assistance to development assistance in the 
post-conflict stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the G-8 will work with bilateral and multilateral 
actors and the international financial institution to promote and 
develop good governance and respect for the rule of law, 
including capacity building of administrative, police and 
judicial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the organizations such as the OECD development 
assistance committee, DAC, the G-8 will also monitor and assess 
bilateral donors practices in seeking to address conflict 
prevention within the broader development assistance strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada has advanced as chair of the UN security counsel 
Angola sanctions committee, there is international recognition 
that illicit trade of certain high value commodities, in this 
case particularly diamonds, provides funds for arms purchases, 
which fuels conflict and creates humanitarian crises.  This is 
evidenced by the ongoing conflicts in Angola, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The G-8 conflict prevention officials have called for producing 
and consuming countries and leaders in the diamond industry to 
ensure transparency and accountability in the diamond trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The G-8 also supports the efforts of African states in 
strengthening regional law enforcement and internal capacity 
building for controlling the illicit trade of diamonds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of particular interest to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
many other Canadian parliamentarians is the impact of armed 
conflict on child participants and child victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of leading as chair of the Asia-Pacific 
Parliamentary Forum a delegation in January to discuss this issue 
with parliamentarians from Asia, the United States and Latin 
America. Several approaches to the subject have been agreed upon 
by the G-8 conflict prevention officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These include maintaining pressure against those who involve or 
target children in armed conflict in breach of international 
standards such as the ILO convention on the elimination of the 
worst forms of child labour, which prohibits forced recruitment 
of those 18 years of age into armed forces and the early adoption 
of the optional protocol to the convention on the rights of the 
child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The G-8 continues to be an important forum for discussion on 
armed conflict prevention because of its important influence in 
setting the international agenda.

motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to stand today on behalf of the New Democratic Party of 
Canada to indicate that we support Motion No. 30.  In essence it 
calls upon the government to continue and intensify efforts with 
other nations to further develop multilateral initiatives to 
strengthen the capacity of international organizations, for 
example the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the 
United Nations, to enable them to identify the precursors to 
conflict and improve their conflict prevention capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is very important and contains a number of very 
valuable words and thoughts.  I want to focus a bit on some of 
the clauses that are quite important.  For example, when we talk 
about multilateral initiatives that in itself says a lot.  It 
talks about co-operation with other nations rather than a 
unilateral initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many unilateral initiatives take place where one nation will 
decide something on its own and move forward.  Far too often 
those kinds of initiatives are based on the narrow economic greed 
of a nation or on its own particular agenda.  Very often they are 
based upon intimidation, where a nation intends to intimidate 
other nations to go along with its will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I read in the paper, and I sure others read the same 
article, about an initiative that was considered by the United 
States to explode an atom bomb on the moon back in the 1950s to 
intimidate the Russians.  This has just come to light now.  That 
kind of initiative was based upon intimidation and an attempt to 
display that it was omnipotent, all powerful and could do what it 
wanted.  That is not the kind of thing that leads to peaceful 
relations between nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years later we are seeing these things happening again. The 
United States is attempting to intimidate others to go along with 
its unilateral move to put up a national defence missile system. 
Concern has been expressed by nations across the world and by 
many citizens about it.  Even people in Canada have expressed 
concern about it.  Yet we see these intimidation tactics whereby 
the United States says that it will move ahead anyway and if we 
do not co-operate we will suffer as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kind of threats that neighbouring nation is making 
to Canada.  We have to get away from that kind of approach if we 
want to move forward, if we want to look at preventing conflicts 
and if we want to work together for a peaceful world and society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also talks about strengthening the capacity of 
international organizations.  We must agree that the 
international organizations today are quite weak.  For example, 
let us look at the United Nations.  It was very clear during the 
Kosovo crisis that the United Nations was weak in terms of being 
able to cope with that situation.  It was a NATO led movement 
that dealt with that situation when in reality it should have 
been the United Nations that took the led.  We know the United 
Nations has to be strengthened to enable it to cope with the many 
conflicts that come up today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also look at the situation regarding Sierra Leone.  A 
number of peacekeepers have been taken prisoner.  That does not 
bode well for the strength of the United Nations, an 
international organization.  We have to seriously look at 
strengthening these organizations so they may fulfil the kind of 
role that we determined they should fulfil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to strengthen any of the international organizations 
such as the United Nations they need to be properly resourced. 
That brings back the responsibility of each country that is a 
part of the United Nations to pay its dues and to contribute do 
the things it is supposed to do as a member of that organization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need people of like mind.  I think the original motion talked 
about bringing together like minded people.  Indeed this is very 
important.  We need people who are concentrating upon and 
desirous of obtaining world peace rather than simply preserving 
their own national identity or their own particular national 
interests.  This is very important when we talk about 
strengthening the capacity of international organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third idea that is brought out in the motion, again a very 
important idea, is enabling the identification of precursors to 
conflict and to improve conflict prevention capability.  This is 
where it is very important.  We must look at bringing about 
situations that prevent rather than always end up reacting to 
crises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far too often we find ourselves at a stage where something 
terrible or drastic is happening in the world. We then react and 
try to correct the situation, but many times we know that if we 
keep our eyes and ears open, if we are at all interested in what 
is happening around us, there are many signs that conflict is 
developing.  There are many indications that problems are brewing 
on the international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we have to be able to detect that kind of information 
and to move to prevent these things from escalating to a point 
where we are sweeping up afterward.  With today's technology we 
should be able to do that.  We should be able to clearly identify 
and know when trouble is brewing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at our military there is talk about revolutionary 
and military affairs where we are being presented with the 
concept of modern warfare based upon technology and based upon 
the ability to have smart bombs.  Ultimately I guess the goal is 
to have war with very few casualties because everything could be 
so precise according to the technology.  If the technology is 
precise enough to enable us to conduct that kind of warfare, it 
should be precise enough to enable us to detect when problems are 
brewing and developing and to step in to do something before they 
become a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about international organizations, one of the key 
factors we have to recognize is that no matter how great the 
technology is today, no matter how advanced the technology is, 
the human factor must always be dominant.  The human factor must 
remain.  Technology is only going to be as useful and good as we 
as human beings enable it to be.  If we put it to the proper use 
then it can be quite helpful to us.  Otherwise it can be very 
damaging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That calls for a certain mindset among people who are governing 
nations and working together for international peace.  They must 
have a mindset or an attitude that is predisposed toward peace 
rather than toward aggression and war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must move away from the idea that everything is controlled by 
economics.  We heard about diamonds being the cause of the 
conflict in Sierra Leone.  In other parts of the world economic 
advantage has been the moving factor for people.  We have to move 
away from letting economics dominate our lives and start to 
consider the value of human life in itself.  We have to start 
looking at the lives of those children missing limbs whom we have 
seen, the victims of a war over economic greed.  If we change our 
mindset we can certainly go a long way toward strengthening these 
international organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of a couple of stories told to me by people who 
had worked at the United Nations.  One young woman who was a 
lawyer told me how she just quit in discouragement because of the 
things she saw taking place at the administrative level within 
the United Nations.  Again, it was coming down to personal 
agendas and people looking toward their own power within the 
organization rather than looking toward the goals of the 
organization itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke recently to a RCMP officer who had worked through the 
United Nations in a very high position.  He told me about the 
things that discouraged him on the administrative side of things. 
When they needed equipment in certain areas in which they were 
working, they could not get it.  They were told there was a lack 
of resources.  Then they would see personal secretaries and 
people at the top riding in Jeeps and getting the equipment they 
needed.  That kind of approach or attitude is what we have to 
change if we want to strengthen and create co-operation among our 
nations and to improve and strengthen our international 
organizations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the NDP are very pleased to speak in support of this 
motion.  We feel it goes to the heart of what is important when 
we are dealing with international affairs. People must work 
together with a proper mindset toward peace and harmony in the 
world.  If we put that behind our efforts, certainly it will go a 
long way toward improving these international organizations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to rise today.  It is getting 
to be a bad habit in that I am following the hon. member for 
Halifax West again today as I did last night, but I guess I could 
do a lot worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put my comments about this important issue on the 
record.  We have already had the opportunity to discuss the issue 
at some length through the debate on the motion by my colleague 
for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, but I have a few additional 
thoughts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people in my area do not even understand, nor do I, the 
roles of the IMF, the World Bank, the United Nations, where one 
jurisdiction starts and one ends, and how they fit together and 
work.  The motion by the hon. member helps to simplify that, to 
make it clearer for all, and to help define the roles of each 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party definitely supports the initiative of the 
reform member and we want to congratulate him on his excellent 
work.  However we are going to return to what we have already 
pointed out with regard to the motion's limitations.  That is the 
underlying assumption that it is impossible to determine the 
signs that predict world conflicts and to develop responses to 
those conflicts well in advance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the motion is laudable but I think it is somewhat 
over-optimistic.  Even in this Chamber we often have trouble 
reaching understandings on issues and we have trouble agreeing 
with one another despite our good intentions.  Imagine the 
difficulty that would be encountered by the various world bodies 
which certainly have diverging interests even country by country. 
But then again, walking on the moon was merely a dream 40 years 
ago, so maybe if we keep trying we can achieve this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time for reform of international institutions has certainly 
come.  There is no question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance explained in great detail during his 
meeting yesterday morning with the members of the foreign affairs 
committee that the necessity for reforming these institutions is 
paramount and the time is now. He stressed the urgency of 
international co-operation in establishing international 
standards and codes in order to reduce the risk of financial 
instability in the world's financial system. We heard the same 
story from the first deputy managing director of the IMF, Mr. 
Stanley Fischer. The demonstrations in Washington and Seattle are 
not isolated gestures either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that the world's institutions listen, respond 
and understand that their decisions have an impact on ordinary 
people's everyday lives.  It is through national governments and 
the representatives they mandate to represent us that we will be 
able to influence these organizations and not otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a time when everything is done on an international 
scale.  Unfortunately I do not think the people's needs are being 
genuinely respected.  It is not for lack of desire to do so in 
some corners, but because the way international institutions 
operate is just too complex and they seem to serve the interests 
of certain stronger countries at the expense of the less 
influential countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, during the gulf war the UN played an important 
part in the decision making process, but during Kosovo the UN 
proved insufficiently effective for some of its members and was 
promptly replaced by NATO.  Why did that system fail? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything depends on the interests of the member countries, and 
the interests often diverge.  Another factor is that world bodies 
have proliferated in recent decades.  Their functions have become 
more ponderous and they have become less effective because of 
their excessively complex procedures.  I am thinking here of the 
hierarchy of international organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often the result is either that action is delayed until it is 
too late or that everyone is so confused and no one really knows 
anymore what the solution to the problem is or even whether there 
is a solution.  We have seen that firsthand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The players on the international scene choose an organization 
that suits them depending on their own interests rather than on 
the basis of what would be the best way to solve the problem. The 
best example I can think of is the trade conflicts that may arise 
and do arise, and there are plenty of them even between Canada 
and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one party thinks it has more chance of winning by choosing 
the WTO, it will address itself to the WTO for arbitration. 
But if it is the free trade agreement that would serve its 
interests better, the country will opt for that process. We are 
thus finding ourselves in a real spider's web of bilateral, 
multilateral and international agreements.  The result is 
confusion, inefficiency and ultimately, conflict.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Frequently foreign affairs would like to introduce an initiative 
but unfortunately finds that it clashes with an agreement signed 
with one of the world organizations.  On a given issue the answer 
is yes under the agreement with one organization but no under the 
agreement with another.  It has become a real tangle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When everything becomes too complicated it is time to simplify 
as proposed in this motion. It is in this perspective the 
Progressive Conservative Party has concluded that it is high time 
for the thinking and discussion process on internationalization 
that is suggested by this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The operations of international bodies should be simplified and 
clarified with a view to making them efficient and effective 
enough to meet the needs of ordinary people.   Let us not forget 
that is why they were set up. That is how we will prevent 
conflicts in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order to seek unanimous consent of the House to make some closing 
remarks at the end of the debate on my private members' motion. 
I hope the House sees fit to do that.  No other motions or 
additions will be presented at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Is there agreement to 
allow the hon. member who is the sponsor of the motion to close 
debate with a five minute speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank hon. members for allowing 
me to close with a few minutes on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion which I put forth last year is one which comes out of 
my experiences working in Africa during the Mozambique civil war. 
During that time we saw all manner of horrors that were 
inflicted on people, primarily civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that 90% of the individuals who are hurt, maimed, raped, 
killed, tortured in today's conflicts are innocent civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the close of the cold war when the Berlin wall came 
crashing down, the world thought we would have a peace dividend, 
but this just unleashed a plethora of conflicts around the world. 
More than 50 conflicts have sprung up which have put very large 
demands, both financial and in terms of personnel, on all of us 
as nations but also on the international organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew for a long time that Rwanda was going to blow up. 
Kosovo was going to blow up.  Burundi, Angola, the Horn of 
Africa, Ethiopia, and the list goes on.  We saw these precursors 
to conflict taking place and the world did nothing to prevent it. 
The consequence of that has been the death, maiming and torture 
of hundreds of thousands if not millions of innocent people 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an extraordinary opportunity to do something about that. 
Canada has had a moral persuasive force for many years and has 
been seen by some as a country that stands in the middle and is 
able to bring different groups together with a common purpose. 
Not many countries can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 30 will enable us to deal with the precursors to 
conflict and reform the international organizations such as the 
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the UN by working 
with our other member states to reform these institutions to 
prevent conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can they prevent conflict?  By utilizing economic levers 
that are used to fuel wars. It takes money to run a war.  If we 
can choke off the money supply, we can choke off the war, not 
always, but sometimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we allow the status quo to remain, as my colleague from the 
NDP mentioned, there will continue to be people with their limbs 
chopped off, people with hot stakes poked in their eyes to blind 
them, people who have been gang raped, children being used to 
carry landmines who are blown up as a consequence, and children 
being used as soldiers in conflict.  This cannot be allowed to 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not debate this on humanitarian grounds, then at least 
as a cogent financial argument we can argue on self interest as 
nations of the world.  When a conflict blows up half a world 
away, it will come back to haunt us in terms of putting our 
soldiers in harm's way, and putting demands on our defence, 
foreign aid and foreign affairs budgets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These demands are actually crushing international organizations, 
particularly the World Bank whose post-conflict reconstruction 
costs have increased 800% in the last 12 years.  The IMF 
continues to fund countries that siphon off the funds to buy arms 
to slaughter innocent civilians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we accept the status quo then we are part and parcel of the 
slaughter that takes place as we speak.  Innocent civilians are 
being tortured in the most heinous ways or are being killed 
without mercy. We as a nation can do something about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged by the support this motion has had across party 
lines. I am confident that as members of different political 
parties, we can come together to support the motion. It will give 
the government and members across party lines the ability to work 
together to act in a leadership role in utilizing the IMF, the 
World Bank and the UN as levers for the prevention of deadly 
conflict.  At the end of the day it is something we will all be 
proud of and which we can proudly take to our constituents. More 
important, we will be doing much to save some of the most 
innocent people in the world from terrible fates.
