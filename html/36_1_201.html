<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK9">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-68, an act in respect of 
criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure this morning to speak on 
second reading of the youth criminal justice act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians realize that several important aspects of the youth 
justice system are not working as well as they ought to, and 
that the system needs to be re-examined and reworked. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it will take a sustained effort involving all 
levels of government and many other partners to tackle the 
complex problems of youth crime and to build the fair and 
effective youth justice system Canadians want and deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That process is underway.  Last June the solicitor general and I 
launched the government's national crime prevention program. 
Since then millions of dollars have been invested in community 
based crime prevention initiatives across our country dealing at 
the front end with the root causes of crime, with a special focus 
on youth at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 11, 1999, I introduced the youth criminal justice act 
and I am now pleased to participate in the second reading debate. 
Repealing and replacing the Young Offenders Act with the youth 
criminal justice act is the next key step in the process of youth 
justice renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will signal to Canadians that a new youth 
justice regime is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation reflects the message Canadians want from 
their youth justice system, that it is there first and foremost 
to protect society, that it foster values such as respect for 
others and their property, that it insist on accountability and 
that it provide both violent and non violent young offenders with 
consequences that are meaningful and proportionate to the 
seriousness of the offence, that it be a youth justice system 
that is inclusive, that engages Canadians in the response to 
youth crime and that it does a better job of responding to the 
needs of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House are not prepared to criminalize 10 
and 11 year olds.  That is not the way to best address their 
needs, a point I have made clear in the House on many occasions. 
We believe that in those circumstances where a formal approach is 
required, child welfare and the mental health systems are the 
preferred approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is committed to working jointly with the 
provinces and territories to develop a co-operative approach. We 
also want to ensure that we have a system of youth justice that 
offers hope to young people, that gives young people who get in 
trouble with the law a chance to turn their lives around for 
their sake and for the sake of their families and their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act includes provisions for more 
meaningful consequences for the most serious violent young 
offenders.  It expands the list of offences and lowers the age at 
which youth would presumptively receive adult sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation is passed youth 14 years and older who are 
convicted of murder, attempted murder, manslaughter or aggravated 
sexual assault will receive an adult sentence unless a judge can 
be persuaded otherwise.  The judge would need to be persuaded by 
the youth that a youth sentence would be adequate to hold the 
young person accountable given the seriousness and the 
circumstances of the offence and the degree of responsibility, 
age and maturity of the young person involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we are creating a fifth presumptive category for 
repeat violent offenders where young offenders 14 and older who 
demonstrate a pattern of violent behaviour would receive an adult 
sentence unless a judge can similarly be persuaded otherwise.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains an important change to what may be the most 
controversial aspect of our youth justice legislation, the 
publication of names.  The debate on this issue essentially 
involves two legitimate and competing values, the need to 
encourage rehabilitation by avoiding the negative effect of 
publicity on youth versus the need for greater openness and 
transparency in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation now before the House strikes an 
appropriate balance between those competing views and values.  It 
would permit the publication of names upon conviction of all 
young offenders who qualify for an adult sentence.  The names of 
14 to 17 year olds given a youth sentence for murder, attempted 
murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault or repeat violent 
offences could also be published in certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act would also replace the current 
procedure for transfer to adult court by empowering all trial 
courts to grant adult sentences so that the youth retains 
age-appropriate procedural protections and so that justice can be 
provided quickly, placing less of a burden on victims and 
families.  This will also ensure that the offender, the victim or 
the victim's family and the community see a clear and timely 
connection between the offence and its consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains other important reforms to the youth justice 
system.  In response to concerns by the law enforcement 
community, judges would be given more discretion to admit 
voluntary statements by youth as evidence at their trials.  In 
response to the concerns of victims, victim impact statements 
would be introduced in youth court and victims' access to 
information regarding proceedings would be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for an increased sentence for adults who 
undertake to the court to respect bail conditions involving 
supervision of a young person who would otherwise remain in 
custody and who wilfully failed to comply with those conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that provinces may recover the costs of court 
appointed counsel from parents and young people who are fully 
capable of paying.  As well, the record keeping system for youth 
records would be simplified and would allow for greater access by 
authorized people in the interests of the administration of 
justice and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of young people who get into trouble with the law 
are non-violent and only commit one offence.  Unfortunately there 
are too many examples in our current youth justice system of 
young people serving time in jail for minor offences.  We 
incarcerate youth at a rate four times that of adults and twice 
that of many U.S. states.  We incarcerate youth despite the fact 
that we knowingly run the risk that they will come out more 
hardened criminals and we incarcerate them knowing that 
alternatives to custody can do a better job of ensuring that 
youth learn from their mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill includes criteria on the use of custody so that it is 
used appropriately.  Further, the bill includes provisions for 
dealing with less serious offending outside of the formal court 
process.  Police would be asked to consider all options, 
including informal alternatives to the court process before 
laying charges. The police, key partners in this strategy, would 
be given more authority to use verbal warnings or cautions, to 
direct youth to informal police diversion programs such as family 
group conferences, or more formal programs requiring community 
service or repairing the harm done to the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While every effort would be made to reduce the overreliance on 
incarceration, some youth will be sentenced to custody.  The 
youth criminal justice act includes provisions that respect an 
obligation to ensure that all young people, particularly the most 
serious offenders, receive effective treatment and 
rehabilitation.  Successfully rehabilitated youth means fewer 
victims, restored families, safer schools and stronger 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, the bill includes an intensive custodial sentence 
for the most high risk young offenders who are repeat violent 
offenders or who have committed murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault.  These sentences are 
intended for offenders with serious psychological, mental or 
emotional illness or disturbances. 
The sentence will require a plan for intensive treatment and 
supervision of these offenders and will require a court to make 
all decisions to release them under controlled reintegration 
programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation also makes an important reform to youth 
justice sentencing to foster the safe and effective reintegration 
of youth into their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new law judges would be required to impose a period of 
supervision in the community following custody.  This would allow 
authorities to closely monitor and control the young offender and 
to ensure that he or she receives the necessary treatment and 
programs to return successfully to the community.  The period of 
supervision administered by the provinces will include mandatory 
and optional conditions tailored to the individual youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes a comprehensive, balanced and flexible 
legislative framework for youth justice.  It was developed after 
extensive consultations with the provinces, the police, the bar, 
youth justice workers, youth themselves, victims and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next important phase of the renewal of youth justice is 
directed at the implementation of the new youth justice 
legislation.  Youth justice professionals, community members and 
others will need information about the new system and will need 
training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the best answers to the complex problems of 
youth crime lie in integrated approaches.  Effective youth 
justice involves educators, child welfare and mental health 
systems, voluntary organizations, victims, families, youth 
employers and neighbourhood groups; just about anyone who works 
with or cares about our children, our young people, our 
communities and our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional federal resources in the amount of some $206 million 
over the next three years have been made available to support the 
important challenge of renewing our system of youth justice. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's youth justice strategy opens the door to 
greater involvement by the general public and by professionals 
in youth crime, and I encourage Canadians to get involved. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask members to support the youth criminal justice act so 
that we can put in place the kind of youth justice system that 
Canadians are seeking; one that protects society and instils the 
values of accountability, responsibility and respect.  We owe it 
to Canadians, but we owe it especially to Canadian youth. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a 
summer evening a number of years ago I was sitting in our living 
room when I heard the sound of sirens.  Now, that is not an 
uncommon occurrence on a Saturday night in the town where I live. 
However, later on I heard that there had been a drive-by shooting 
in which a teenager had died.  The car in which he was a 
passenger was stopped at a red light when another car pulled up 
alongside.  A teenage passenger in the second car leaned out the 
window and fired point blank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next day I mentioned the incident to one of my children who 
had spent that night at a friend's house not too far from the 
shooting.  He told me that he had heard the fatal gun shot.  I 
remember thinking “Just what is our community coming to?”  I 
also remember thinking about the parents of the victim.  A few 
days later the suspected killer was himself killed in an act of 
revenge.  Again, I remember thinking about the safety of our 
streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of months later on another Saturday night a family 
friend was visiting from the Queen Charlotte Islands.  After 
dinner, as I was sitting in my living room, our son Jesse 
sauntered down the hall, paused at the top of the stairs, said 
goodbye to his mother and our friend in the kitchen, glanced 
toward me, and with a “See you later, dad” bounded down the 
stairs and out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jesse was a drummer and his rock band had been asked to play at 
a house party.  He was excited.  It was their first gig.  Our 
daughter, who is three years older, left shortly afterwards, 
leaving us to a quiet evening of conversation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At 11.15, shortly after our friend had left, Jesse phoned 
telling me that he and his two buddies were on their way home. 
They were waiting for a bus.  An hour later the phone rang again. 
My wife answered the phone.  She swore.  It was the hospital. 
They wanted us there right away.  Jesse had been stabbed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A panicked five minute drive, hospital staff avoiding eye 
contact as we ran through the doors, and then the words no parent 
should ever have to hear:  “We're sorry, we tried, but there was 
too much damage”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A single stab wound to the back had pierced his heart.  He was 
16.  That was October 18, 1992, on my father's 81st birthday. 
Jesse would have been 23 years old tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jesse was the victim of a random, unprovoked attack on himself 
and his two friends by complete strangers.  He died in the arms 
of his best friend at the side of the same road, about a quarter 
mile from the spot where the earlier shooting, the one which he 
had heard, had occurred a couple of months previous.  His 
attackers were part of the same loose-knit group of thieves and 
thugs involved in that shooting.  In fact, it later came out that 
his killer, also 16, idolized the shooter and saw him as a 
martyr. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an arrest within days.  The police informed us that 
the accused, because of his age, and unless the crown could 
successfully argue that he be tried as an adult, would be facing 
three years in secure custody followed by two years in open, most 
likely community supervision and then free with no criminal 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you have no idea just how devastating the knowledge 
is to a family that is still reeling from the murder of a loved 
one that there is a philosophy in this country which holds that 
three years of incarceration is an appropriate sanction for 
intentionally taking the life of an innocent stranger in a 
random, unprovoked attack on the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two days after we buried Jesse a six year old girl was raped and 
murdered in Courtenay, British Columbia.  Eventually her 16 year 
old neighbour was charged.  He also faced a mere three years of 
secure custody and two in open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was my introduction to the Canadian criminal justice system 
and the Young Offenders Act.  I am neither a lawyer nor an 
academic, but after 20 months in the courts ourselves, six and 
half years of involvement with other families and individuals 
who, in the words of a dear close friend, now belong to a club 
that none of us wanted to join, and the same amount of time 
listening to Canadians at shopping malls and soccer fields, not 
conference rooms and lecture theatres, I think that I am 
reasonably qualified to speak to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it was the refusal of the justice committee to allow me 
to appear in open session when it was in Vancouver in 1996 which 
pushed me over the edge and prompted me to seek election to this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday in this place the member for South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley said that following my appearance before the 
justice committee a number of years ago a government member 
commented to the effect that victims bring nothing to this debate 
other than sentiment.  I make no apology for that.  For far too 
long our legislators and our courts have chosen to ignore the 
real human impact and human cost of crime, especially youth crime 
and violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once heard that a Vancouver lawyer wanted families of homicide 
victims barred from courtrooms because they cried too much and 
might influence a jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you may guess, I have looked forward to an 
opportunity like this for some time now.  The Young Offenders Act 
will hopefully be assigned to the garbage heap of history before 
too long.  It has been a failure and Canadians have had to suffer 
its consequences for far too long.  It was never a priority of 
various governments over the years.  Obviously it was not a 
priority of the present government.  The minister, upon taking 
the job, claimed that introducing new young offender legislation 
was to be one of her major priorities, but how much of a priority 
was it when it has taken almost two years for the legislation to 
come before us?  What do we have?  We have a new name.  We have 
new spin-doctoring from the government.  We have new claims of 
being tougher on crime, but we really have the same old thing 
wrapped up in a nice new package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every step forward there is a step backward.  Ineffective 
legislation does Canadians a disservice.  It does our youth an 
even bigger disservice as they are most often the victims of 
youth crime.  Of course youth involved in crime are dealt a very 
questionable hand when the citizenry become so disenchanted with 
the law that they take it out on the offenders by ostracizing 
them or refusing to help in rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the minister been doing for the past two years?  In the 
fall of 1997 she promised Canadians that changes would be made to 
the Young Offenders Act in a timely fashion.  She was working on 
it.  Over the winter of 1997 and early 1998 she claimed that she 
was not going to deal with the legislation in a simplistic 
manner, but was going to deal with a complicated issue in the 
proper manner.  Then, under great fanfare, with all the splash of 
press conferences, fancy overheads and colourful brochures, the 
minister came out with her youth justice strategy; not 
legislation, just proposals.  She was going to get tough on young 
criminals and promised legislation by the fall of 1998.  Of 
course we did not get it.  The minister claimed that she needed 
more consultation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It soon became apparent that what she really had to do was to 
shake loose some federal dollars to pay for her proposals.  One 
would have thought she would have had this in place upfront. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of getting long overdue changes to address youth crime, 
Canadians had to wait for the government to pony up the bucks. 
This was done to some extent with the February budget.  We now 
have legislation.  I suppose the government is hoping that 
Canadians are so worn out from pushing and pressuring for 
something they will be happy with anything.   I assure them that 
we are quite prepared to flesh out the legislation.  We are quite 
prepared to see what can be done to finally give Canadians what 
they have been seeking for years, but we will not be holding our 
breath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown on numerous occasions its unwillingness 
to listen to reason.  I only need to mention the funding for 
hepatitis C, debt reduction, breaks for overtaxed Canadians, 
conditional sentencing and two tier justice whereby the 
government is trying to promote one form of justice for 
aboriginals and another for the rest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act fails to deliver what Canadians 
expect.  We will propose amendments.  We are in this for the long 
haul and we will not let the issue slide as the government would 
like it to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claimed that she would deal with this complicated 
issue and would take the time to deal with it in a proper manner. 
While we can certainly agree that she has taken her time, we have 
to question her claim that it was complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When going through the proposed legislation clause by clause we 
found for the most part that it was the old Young Offenders Act 
rewritten and presented in a different format.  When particular 
provisions appear to have been tightened up there is almost 
always a corresponding opportunity for the provinces or the 
courts to provide exceptions and to maintain the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What actually makes it complicated for the minister is her 
attempt to appease all the different philosophies within her 
government.  Some want tougher legislation.  Others think 
everything is just fine the way it is.  Still others want it to 
become even more lenient.  Some actually believe that society is 
to blame for all our crime and criminals are merely those that 
society has failed.  No wonder we have problems in the criminal 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the minister claiming that she needed time to 
consult with the provinces.  She had to understand what the 
various regions of Canada were seeking in the overhaul of our 
youth laws.  Obviously the minister has little faith in the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee spent many months conducting hearings from coast 
to coast.  The committee listened to the provinces.  It spent 
almost half a million dollars to provide a comprehensive report 
with a number of recommendations toward significant changes to 
the laws.  I guess that was not enough so I will accept that the 
minister wanted more consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it reasonable consultation or was it merely a stall because 
the government was having trouble satisfying its caucus?  I 
suspect that there was not adequate consultation.  I cite 
comments by the Minister of Justice for Alberta.  He wrote to the 
federal minister to complain about this very issue.  He states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite your assertion to the contrary, there has not been 
sufficient consultation with respect to the proposed replacement 
legislation for the Young Offenders Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government failed to include the major concerns of at least 
some of the provinces.  Alberta, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island 
and Ontario are on record as agreeing to a number of significant 
changes.  First on their list was the reduction in age of 
criminal accountability in selected cases to address the serious 
offences committed by children under 12 and for those in this 
group who exhibit a pattern of offending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Calgary Chief of Police Christine Silverberg criticized the 
government's changes as not going far enough with violent 
children under age 12.  The Winnipeg police inspector in charge 
of youth crime, Ken Biener, stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—she missed the boat completely in failing to adopt the 
recommendation to allow 10 and 11 year olds to be arrested and 
face the courts. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be of no surprise that this was not included.  Not 
only did the government ignore their partners in the youth 
justice process.  It also ignored the justice committee and its 
reports which included a very similar recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister attacks the Reform Party for wanting to include 10 
and 11 year olds within the youth justice process.  She 
characterizes the proposal as barbaric.  She refuses to accept 
that our present system is failing to properly address and help 
these younger members of our society.  She refuses to permit 
these young offenders to obtain all the benefits of 
rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, she leaves them in this vacuum where they do not get 
the help and the support they need.  She refuses to acknowledge 
that the provinces want reforms in this area and the police need 
support in their effort to deal with violent 10 and 11 year olds. 
She refuses to even acknowledge that members of her caucus have 
publicly supported the inclusion of 10 and 11 years olds in the 
youth justice system.  She refuses to acknowledge that the 
Liberal majority on the justice committee of the last parliament, 
chaired by our late colleague Shaughnessy Cohen, supported the 
inclusion of 10 and 11 year olds within the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all seen what happens to those few Liberals who 
challenge the views of the party management.  Fortunately for all 
of us Shaughnessy did not suffer that fate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example of failing to consult.   These 
provinces had demanded an amendment to apply the victim fine 
surcharge to young offenders. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the justice committee that recommended the same thing in a 
victims rights report, these provinces saw the benefit of having 
young offenders supply some of the financing of assistance to 
victims of crime.  However the legislation does not include 
automatic victim fine surcharges.  It merely provides the 
opportunity for the provinces to bring in their own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that a number of provinces were seeking a mandatory 
custody disposition for youths convicted of offences involving 
the use of weapons.  Once again the government has chosen to 
ignore those on the frontlines of the youth justice process. 
There is no provision for mandatory custody for crimes involving 
the use of weapons.  It makes me wonder whether the government 
just has a justice committee to use when its reports correspond 
to the government's own political position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for consultation with interested participants, the government 
meets with the provinces to say it has consulted but there 
appears to be little intention of meaningful dialogue unless 
those provinces share the political position of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned a number of failings just in getting the 
legislation before the House.  The government does not listen to 
its partners in the administration of youth justice.  It does not 
participate in adequate consultation.  It does not even follow 
its own committee when valid recommendations are made after 
extensive input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the government merely goes on and does what it wants to 
do for purely political reasons.  It ignores the priority to do 
what is right for Canadians, including those youth that find 
themselves on the wrong side of the law and those youth that are 
most often the victims of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to discuss a number of the specific issues 
covered by the legislation.  I will deal with a few positive 
developments first and then move on to some of the negative 
aspects that raise concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has decided to formalize the whole matter of police 
discretion.  This will enable the frontline troops, so to speak, 
to deal with minor youth indiscretions quickly and easily.  The 
occasional scuffle over a street hockey game can be resolved 
through police caution or warning.  It is the same with most 
childhood pranks.  The theft of a chocolate bar from a corner 
store need not go to a community based committee or even to 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister likes to characterize members of my party as being 
one dimensional and interested only in locking up offenders.  She 
is wrong.  The hon. member for Crowfoot recommended this very 
initiative in his minority report to the justice committee in 
April 1997.  He included it within his private member's Bill 
C-210.  He understood the necessity to support the police.  Many 
officers were already doing this without legislative authority. 
Others were afraid to use their discretion.  They were concerned 
that they could be subjected to criticism as they did not have 
the proper authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also made quite a big thing about their 
interest and the need to deal with non-violent offenders 
differently from violent offenders.  It is regrettable that many 
in the media have been sold on this idea as being solely a 
Liberal initiative.  It is really nothing new.  In many parts of 
Canada there are already programs known as diversion, restorative 
justice, alternative measures, community based youth justice 
committees, healing circles, and the list goes on.  All the 
government has done is to create an all-encompassing term, 
extrajudicial measures, to cover them all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the hon. member for Crowfoot proposed his two prong form 
of justice whereby first time non-violent offenders could proceed 
through a more informal process.  They would simply take 
responsibility for their actions and obey the requirements set 
out by any community based committee or organization.  This was 
proposed both in his minority report to the justice committee and 
in his private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot claim credit for this proposal.  Reform 
was not interested in claiming credit.  We were only interested 
in doing what was needed for a proper system of justice.  We have 
had to bring this matter to public attention merely because of 
government attempts to characterize the Reform Party as one 
dimensional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been personally involved with dozens of young offenders 
in a diversion program in my home province for some four years 
now.  I want to publicly acknowledge Lola Chapman for the work 
she has done in this area.  Lola and I have worked closely with 
the B.C. attorney general to expand the use of these programs.  I 
am in full support of them in the limited circumstances of first 
time non-violent situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have expressed surprise, given my personal experience, that 
I would even be interested in working with wayward youth.  We all 
know that as youth we made mistakes and some, I dare say, may 
have broken some laws.  All most of us needed was to be taken to 
task for these indiscretions.  If we failed to pay attention and 
moved on to additional crimes or more serious offences then we 
deserved to be treated in a more formal process.  This is the 
same for today's youth.  This is all we are looking for from 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final area I would like to discuss from a positive aspect is 
the incorporation of my private member's Bill C-260 in its 
entirety.  Once again there was a massive leak of information 
about the legislation before it was actually introduced.  Part of 
the leaks had to do with my private member's proposal. However, 
most of the media reports have misinterpreted this part of the 
legislation as something new in Canadian law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These reports indicate that parents will be held criminally 
responsible for the crimes of their children.  Nothing could be 
further from the truth in both respects.  What has me concerned 
is whether the sources of the government leaks have deliberately 
misinterpreted this proposal.  Furthermore, the government has 
shown little interest in correcting these misinterpretations. 
After all, it is now part of its legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had to cover the issue on a number of different types of 
media.  I have written a number of letters to the editor to 
attempt to correct the record.  The law has been around for a 
number of years.  My proposal merely enhances the potential 
punishment.  It has nothing to do with the crimes of the young 
person.  It has solely to do with the written agreement or 
contract whereby the young person is released from custody while 
awaiting trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young person is essentially released on a form of bail when 
a responsible adult, usually a parent, signs a legal undertaking 
to supervise that young person to ensure court imposed conditions 
are respected.  Both the young person and the adult sign the 
agreement.  Both are liable to be charged with an offence if they 
each wilfully fail to fulfil the agreement: the parent for 
wilfully failing to supervise as agreed and the young person for 
wilfully failing to obey the conditions.  The offence has to do 
with the court agreement.  It has nothing to do with the ordinary 
responsibilities of the parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only the obligation to supervise.  When the person who 
signed the undertaking becomes aware of a breach of conditions 
there is an obligation to notify the authorities.  There is a 
high threshold to meet before a case may be made that an adult 
has wilfully failed to supervise as required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be said that the initiative for this came from my own 
personal experience whereby my son's killer was in breach of a 
court imposed curfew that night.  He had also failed to appear in 
court some three weeks earlier; another breach of conditions. His 
father had signed an undertaking to supervise some months 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I support the legislation in respect of judicial 
undertakings by responsible persons.  I will be interested in 
seeing how this portion of the bill develops.  I will be 
interested in seeing whether members of the government attempt to 
claim this initiative as their own, and I do not really care as 
long as it gets done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impressing upon both the parent and the young person the serious 
repercussions for violating the agreement will protect members of 
our communities.  Hopefully the parent will think twice about 
signing such an agreement if there is little expectation for the 
young person to mend his or her ways.  Hopefully the young person 
will think twice before breaking the conditions of release and 
endangering the position of the parent who wilfully fails to 
supervise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now discuss some of the inadequacies of the legislation, 
and there are a number.  Even though I have been provided with a 
significant amount of time, it will take a number of 
opportunities to address all of them.  Fortunately we have a 
committee process to go through.  We have amendments to propose. 
At some time we will be back here to make comments at third 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I mentioned the concern with the government's scheme of 
extrajudicial measures.  It has taken a valuable and progressive 
means of addressing minor crime and once again opened it up to 
massive abuse.  It did the same thing with adult conditional 
sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing involves serving a sentence in the 
community under some form of supervision.  It may involve some 
type of house arrest.  It may involve some form of restitution to 
the community through providing service with charitable 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many uses for conditional sentencing.  What did the 
government use it for?  It used it to reduce the cost of 
incarceration.  It said the jails and the prisons were too full 
and were too costly.  It said that criminals were really not bad 
people and that mere arrest and conviction were enough to teach 
them the error of their ways.  It said that the courts would not 
permit violent and repeat offenders to take advantage of 
conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the courts permitted all kinds of violent criminals to 
obtain this get out of jail free ticket.  Killers got conditional 
sentences.  Violent sex offenders got conditional sentences. 
Pedophiles got conditional sentences.  Repeat offenders got 
conditional sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-41 was debated in 1994 and 1995 the Reform Party 
argued to restrict the use of conditional sentencing to first 
time non-violent and non-drug offenders.  We understood its value 
but only for a restricted purpose.  The government has been 
consistent.  It refused to listen.  It maintained only it knew 
the best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Minister of Justice recognized the abuse of 
conditional sentencing.  She requested the justice committee to 
review the issue.  She will likely then procrastinate some more 
and suggest that perhaps more consultation is required.  In the 
end she will do what is political.  She will take much of her 
direction from the Prime Minister's Office.  After all, he was a 
justice minister in the dim past and he is undoubtedly another 
expert on conditional sentencing, even though it was unheard of 
at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to youth legislation, extrajudicial measures can 
easily become more of a problem than conditional sentencing. 
Under section 4(c) of the bill they are presumed to be adequate 
for non-violent offences.  The word presume is key.  It means 
that extrajudicial measures will be the rule rather than the 
exception in cases of non-violent offences. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT9"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT9"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1145

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see how non-violent is defined.  It means an offence that 
does not cause or create a substantial risk of causing bodily 
harm.  This definition would include sexual touching, as there is 
no risk of bodily harm.  Pedophiles cause psychological harm to 
young children.  This definition would include the possession of 
child pornography, as there is no risk of bodily harm.  It would 
include break and enters into homes, as there would have to be a 
substantial risk of causing bodily harm in order to avoid this 
definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This definition would include drug offences, including 
trafficking.  Is there a substantial risk of bodily harm for 
selling crack cocaine in a school?  I would hate to have to 
convince a court that there was this risk when the evidence is 
limited to one sale to one student, another sale to another 
student and so on.  How could it be proven that there is 
substantial risk of bodily harm when only one hit of the drug is 
provided at the time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extrajudicial measures will be available to repeat offenders. 
While clause 4(c) limits the provision to non-violent offenders 
who have not previously been found guilty of an offence, that 
clause applies only to where extrajudicial measures are presumed 
to be adequate.  Clause 4(d) permits these measures to be used 
even if there were previous convictions.  It permits these 
measures even if they were used for the same offender before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means extrajudicial measures may be used 100 times for the 
same offender for any number of crimes.  This means extrajudicial 
measures may be used even though that offender may have been 
convicted of a previous offence.  There is no further limitation. 
The previous offence may have been manslaughter, sexual assault 
or murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I wonder whether this government is interested in 
putting anyone in prison.  This government is responsible for 
allowing all types of violent offenders to remain in our 
communities threatening the safety of our citizens.  It seems 
intent on doing the same thing with our young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adult sentencing will be available for presumptive offences but 
even for those where there is an opportunity for the young person 
to challenge adult sentencing in each particular situation. As 
well, the judge may only use adult sentencing when of the opinion 
that a youth sentence is not adequate.  Presumptive offences are 
limited to murder, attempted murder, manslaughter and aggravated 
sexual assault.  The definition is very limited.  It does not 
include all types of crimes in which a weapon is used. It does 
not include kidnapping. It does not even include sexual assault 
causing bodily harm.  These are all seriously violent crimes but 
they are not sufficient for this government to include in its 
presumptive offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The adult sentence for murder is life imprisonment.  For those 
over 18 parole eligibility is at 25 years for first degree and 10 
to 25 years for second degree.  For 16 and 17 year olds parole 
eligibility comes at 10 years for first degree and 7 years for 
second degree.  For those under 16, parole eligibility comes at 5 
to 7 years.  There is no change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended the trials of a 15 year old and the 19 year old who 
were convicted for the savage murder of a frail 79 year old 
widow.  She is buried just a stone's throw from my son.  The 15 
year old masterminded the plot, he was the more violent of the 
two, he targeted the lady because she would be easy. He had done 
yard work for her so he knew that she would let them into her 
home.  The judge sentenced the 19 year old to 15 years before 
parole eligibility.  He then complained on the record that his 
hands were tied by parliament forcing him to set parole 
ineligibility at only seven years for the young offender, and 
that has not changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will illustrate further how this government just does not 
listen.  In 1994 my son's killer was handed a parole 
ineligibility period of ten years, the maximum allowable at the 
time.  When Bill C-37 was before the House in the last parliament 
it proposed to fix parole ineligibility for second degree murder 
at seven years.  I anticipated a loophole because he was in the 
process of appealing the sentence at that time.  I wrote the then 
justice minister, the current health minister, with my concerns. 
No response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 became law in December 1995.  The following spring the 
killer had three years knocked off his parole ineligibility 
period not because he deserved it but because the new law was 
made retroactive if to the benefit of the offender.  I commented 
publicly, saying I told you so.  A few days later I received a 
call from a justice department lawyer asking me what happened. 
This is what happened.  If a letterhead or a call display does 
not indicate a university or a professional organization, this 
government does not want to hear from you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly mention the second half of the definition of 
presumptive offence.  In practice it will have almost no 
applicability.  To be included within the definition of a 
presumptive offence an offender must commit three seriously 
violent offences for which an adult could be sentenced to prison 
for more than two years. 
A judge must have made a determination that the offence was a 
serious violent offence and endorse the information accordingly, 
twice.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A serious violent offence is defined as an offence that causes 
or creates a substantial risk of causing serious bodily harm, not 
just bodily harm, serious bodily harm.  Most courts will have 
difficulty in distinguishing between bodily harm and serious 
bodily harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would members like to explain to the victim and to the public 
that a particularly vicious attack only caused bodily harm and 
not serious bodily harm?  Would members like to explain to the 
victim and the public that there has been only one prior 
documented incident of the offender causing serious bodily harm? 
We need two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would any of the members opposite like to explain to a victim or 
the public that this offender caused bodily harm a number of 
times in the past but he only caused serious bodily harm once so 
he still does not come within the definition of a presumptive 
offence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adult sentences are also available for offences for which an 
adult could be sentenced to prison for more than two years and if 
the young person is 14 or older.  The very inclusion of 
presumptive offences and these other types of offences leaves the 
courts and our youth justice system with the distinct impression 
that parliament is serious about the presumptive offences and 
much less serious about the other types. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case the listener thinks these provisions for adult 
sentencing will result in similar crimes receiving similar 
sentences for both adults and young persons, I point out some 
other wrinkles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overriding principles of this legislation include 
rehabilitation and reintegration of the young person.  There are 
no words such as deterrence and denunciation.  There is to be no 
punishment for the sake of deterring other young persons from 
similar activity.  There is to be no punishment for the sake of 
expressing society's displeasure and abhorrence of a particularly 
gruesome or violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All young persons must be rehabilitated and reintegrated in a 
short period of time.  This government believes they are all 
curable and pose little risk to our communities when they are 
returned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole idea of adult sentencing for those 14 and older is 
nothing more than a con job.  There will be challenges in almost 
every case against their imposition. Lawyers will be fully and 
extensively employed.  Judges will be permitted to continue in 
their lenient ways.  After all, many of them have liberal 
tendencies as most of them were appointed by the Prime Minister 
and his predecessors.  The judges have unlimited discretion to 
determine when to impose adult sentencing and when to impose 
youth sentencing. Section 72 does not limit this discretion in 
any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are also involved, as the crown has the 
opportunity to support youth sentencing or to fail to provide 
notice that an adult sentence is to be sought.  Then there is the 
overriding principle that these young persons are to be 
rehabilitated.  They are not to be deterred and denounced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of deeming of young persons is of the same 
nature.  The government sells the idea that it will be tough and 
young persons receiving adult sentences are to be named.  The 
government does not, however, say much about all the provisions 
that permit the court to ban the publication of names. A young 
person may apply for the ban.  The crown has the option of not 
opposing the ban.  The court has complete discretion to ban 
publication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act is set up so that rehabilitation and reintegration are 
the primary principles to be applied.  There is no requirement by 
parliament that certain crimes automatically require the naming 
of offenders so that the public has the knowledge of who is a 
risk to its safety and security.  Even those who 14 and over who 
commit a presumptive offence like murder or aggravated sexual 
assault may receive a youth sentence and may be protected by a 
ban on publication of their names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I spoke about the rape and murder of a little girl by 
her 16 year old neighbour.  At the time of the murder he was on 
probation for sexually molesting a young child. He was allowed to 
reside in a complex full of children in complete anonymity 
because of his age.  I do not think I need say more about 
protecting the identity of those who pose a threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, when this government does change legislation it 
does not like to change much.  It prefers to change the packaging 
and the sales pitch.  Canadians end up with the same old thing. 
In some cases we end up with something far worse.  With the youth 
criminal justice act, the jury is still out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refused to lower the age to 10 for purely 
political reasons.  The issue has been around since 1962 when the 
justice department recommended this change.  The government 
ignored the recommendation then and it ignored it today.  There 
are obvious difficulties in this legislation such as the 
extrajudicial measures that may be rectified through amendment. 
The government is once again unlikely to listen and to admit its 
error, but we will try. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other areas like adult sentencing and publication of 
names that have so many exceptions and provisions that there is 
bound to be dissatisfaction and new calls for revision from the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an extensive promotional budget and it has 
significant human resources to sell Canadians on its legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately justice legislation, unlike some other forms, 
takes time to come home to roost. The youth criminal justice act 
will change nothing.  As case after case slips through the cracks 
the weaknesses will be revealed and disenchantment will grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act is nothing more than the Young 
Offenders Act with a face lift and a new name.  I have been 
involved in this debate for over six years and, as I said 
earlier, I make no apology for the sentiment or emotion I bring 
to it.  It is unfortunate that after years of delay, years of 
so-called consultations and deliberations this is the best the 
government can do.  Canadians deserve better. More important, 
because they are most often the victims of youth crime, our kids 
deserve better.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is with some degree of regret that I rise in this House today to 
speak on this bill.  The debate on Bill C-68 ought never to have 
taken place at all, as the Minister of Justice knows full well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been demonstrated on many occasions that what is not 
working properly is not the Young Offenders Act itself, but its 
application.  Those who are applying it properly succeed where 
others fail.  Nevertheless, the Liberal government is 
obstinately preparing to demolish the spirit of this approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the time available to me to prove that the 
Young Offenders Act does not deserve the fate the Liberals have 
in store for it, in response to pressures from western Canada. 
The act is being used as a scapegoat by a Liberal government 
that prefers to take the easy way out, while it ought to be left 
unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Youth Offenders Act was passed in 1982, and came into effect 
in 1984.  This legislation did not spring up over night.  It is 
the result of several decades of reflection.  In fact, one has 
to go all the way back to 1857 to find the first initiative 
assigning special status to juvenile delinquents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beginnings of the first youth justice system go back to 
1908, with the Juvenile Delinquency Act.  This intention of this 
act was to put young people back on the right track, while 
minimalizing their responsibility, given their youth. 
The idea was to set up a system that would truly promote the 
effective reintegration of young offenders into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, Ontario was among the first provinces to put 
pressure so that young offenders would benefit from a protective 
approach. Ironically, Queen's Park is now the most vocal in 
demanding more repressive measures for young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early seventies, Quebec took two social measures that 
would prove very useful under the Young Offenders Act: the 
creation of a legal aid program and a reform of social services. 
Quebec adopted its first diversion measures in 1974, when it 
reviewed its Youth Protection Act. The province was then ready 
to implement the Young Offenders Act as soon as it would come 
into effect, in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out here the extraordinary solidarity displayed in 
Quebec, which, at the time, succeeded in convincing the federal 
government to adopt the act that we now have, that is an act 
based on crime prevention, on the rehabilitation of young people 
who commit criminal acts, and above all an act designed to 
ensure the long term protection of society. The Young Offenders 
Act as we know it reflected, and still reflects, the thrust that 
it was intended to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, there was no doubt that we had to put more emphasis 
on diversion measures. In Quebec, that approach had been 
stressed long before, in the Prévost report. Going before the 
court should only be considered after having exhausted all other 
options, such as reorientation, rehabilitation, and agreements 
with the parents to provide special treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That approach had been applied elsewhere, including in the 
United States, in England and in Scotland. 
The federal government had no choice but to set the stage for 
diversion measures, through the Young Offenders Act. Still, 
since the administration of justice comes under their 
jurisdiction, it was the provinces that had to set up diversion 
programs. Quebec did so by establishing an ambitious alternative 
program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, 1999, we celebrate the 15th anniversary of the coming 
into law of the Young Offenders Act.  The Minister of Justice of 
Canada considers that the law has done its time, that it is out 
of date and no longer meets our expectations.  Let us be clear, 
the Liberal government is not getting ready to sacrifice 15 
years of expertise, but rather 30 years of Quebec know-how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act is the product of a number of serious 
consultations and studies. 
In 1992, the Government of Quebec established a task force to 
look into the application of the Young Offenders Act.  Chaired 
by Michel Jasmin, deputy chief justice of the court of Quebec, 
Chambre de la jeunesse, the task force brought forth a 
voluminous report after two and a half years of in-depth 
consultation and study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider it vital to inform the House of some of the 
conclusions of the Jasmin report, which remain topical and 
which, it would seem, are unknown to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drafted from testimony by many jurists, criminologists, 
psychologists and social workers in Quebec, the report 
eloquently describes the approach taken in Quebec in dealing 
with juvenile delinquents.  I will read to you a number of 
passages of this important report prepared by Mr. Justice 
Jasmin. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the work we have done over the past two and a half years, 
we are satisfied that the Young Offenders Act is good 
legislation.  We were struck by the consensus of the various 
sectors that deal with this area.  It should be noted that 
Quebec has developed a tradition in dealing with young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The efforts of the pioneers, who, in the 1950s, 
advocated that services be human and professional, have borne 
fruit that at the time would have been unthinkable.  The aim was 
to move beyond mere repression to focus interventions on the 
education and rehabilitation of young people.  A lot has been 
done to reach that point. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the judge continues, a little further on in his extremely 
important report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Juvenile delinquency is a complex problem and must be approached 
accordingly.  The legislation is a key element of any strategy, 
but we must look at the broader picture and examine other 
factors that are no less important.  It is often easier to amend 
legislation than to change our approach to a problem. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Jasmin probably already knew the current Minister of 
Justice.  He goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be tempting to think that tougher legislation is the 
answer to the problems of delinquency.  Simplistic responses 
blind us to the full extent of complex problems and create the 
false impression that we are doing what is necessary to resolve 
them.  One such simplistic response is substituting get-tough 
measures for educational approaches. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from examination of the bill at second reading that 
the minister's responses to an extremely complex problem are 
very simplistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Jasmin report is often mentioned by those who support 
Quebec's approach.  As a member from Quebec, I cannot ignore it. 
I will use this report to denounce the simplistic solutions of 
this government, which has caved in not once but twice to 
pressure from the right and from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will again point out that the Young Offenders Act is a good 
act.  I cannot say often enough to the minister across the way 
that substituting get-tough measures for educational approaches 
is a simplistic response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act is getting very good results.  Youth 
crime is steadily declining.  Oddly enough, the federal Minister 
of Justice presented very eloquent figures to this effect when 
she introduced her bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She mentioned that there had been a 23% decrease in youth crime 
since 1991.  She even told the press that the number of crimes 
with violence had also decreased since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as we identify a tree by the fruit it produces, so should 
we judge the Young Offenders Act by the results it gets, and not 
by a misconception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be irresponsible to blindly reform the youth justice 
system without looking at the whole picture. 
In protecting such vital things as life and bodily security, the 
Young Offenders Act plays a front line role in strengthening the 
community's faith in our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians therefore must respond quickly to the concerns 
of their fellow citizens by making the appropriate legislative 
amendments as needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they must first and foremost ensure that the public has 
the information it needs to properly grasp such a complex 
problem as juvenile delinquency.  There is no point, however, in 
doing what the minister has decided to do, namely throwing the 
baby out with the bath water.  We must take a very close look 
and not act impulsively with such legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Minister of Justice failed in her duty to inform. 
By advocating stricter legislation, the minister wrongly 
intimates that the existing legislation is deficient.  It would 
seem to indicate a lack of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 shows it is easier for a Liberal government to 
sacrifice good legislation than to advocate the effective 
approach it promotes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To properly understand the reason behind the current amendments 
to the Young Offenders Act, we must go back to the 35th 
Parliament to look at the first Liberal attempts at turning the 
Young Offenders Act into a scapegoat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 28, 1994, the current Minister of Health and former 
Minister of Justice stated in the House that the move to the 
right responded to election commitments.  He was very candid in 
his acknowledgement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I scarcely need to point out that these commitments were 
certainly not aimed at Quebec voters.  In fact, it is hardly a 
well-kept secret that the Liberal Party's intention was to win 
over the clientele of the Reform in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By passing Bill C-37 at that time, the Liberal government was 
introducing into the Young Offenders Act a whole series of 
automatic provisions which would greatly affect the fragile 
equilibrium of the youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By allowing 16 and 17 year olds to be automatically referred to 
the adult court system, this government watered down once again 
the specific nature of the youth justice system.  At the rate 
things are going, soon the only connection it will have with 
youth will be in its title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing in the same vein, in May, 1998, the Minister of 
Justice introduced her youth justice renewal strategy.  In 
particular, she announced her intention to extend the referrals 
to 14 and 15 year olds. 
All parties involved in Quebec viewed this with alarm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec bar association had even prepared an impressive brief 
in which it openly deplored this measure, which it felt was 
likely to increase recidivism among youth, both in number and in 
severity. In its brief, the bar association expressed the 
opinion  that the problem did not lie with the current Young 
Offenders Act, but rather with the way it was being applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also criticized the reform because it was based on grounds 
that were both biased and disconnected from reality.  Among 
other points it raised was the following most legitimate 
question, one still as timely now as it was then, “Where exactly 
does the government get the information that stiffer sentences 
were going to have any impact whatsoever on the crime rate?”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec bar association was bang on.  Not only was the reform 
not necessary, but the solutions being put forward by the 
minister are misguided and risky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday, this issue received a breath of fresh air when some 
fifteen organizations from Quebec publicly reaffirmed their 
opposition to Bill C-68.  The Association des centres jeunesse du 
Québec, the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits 
de la jeunesse, the Conseil permanent de la jeunesse and the 
Association des chefs de police et de pompiers du Quebec, to 
name just a few, held a press conference at which they 
reaffirmed Quebec's consensus and flatly opposed the Minister of 
Justice's Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message was and is very straightforward.  They are telling 
the minister that they want nothing to do with her bill.  They 
have systematically rebutted all the minister's claims that her 
flexible system will allow Quebec to enforce the legislation as 
it sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminologist Jean Trépanier, a recognized youth crime expert in 
Quebec, was scathing when it came to the minister's much-touted 
flexibility.  At the press conference, he said: “The so-called 
flexibility seems to be a political trick.  Quebec's judges 
cannot ignore sentences handed down in other courts”. Those in 
doubt need only read the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cécile Toutant, another very respected voice from Quebec, also 
took aim at certain of the bill's measures. 
This criminologist, who is responsible for the youth program at 
the Pinel institute, condemned the new measures allowing for the 
automatic imposition of adult sentences on 14 and 15 year olds. 
According to Ms. Toutant, the time served in jail has nothing to 
do with the protection of the public. Perhaps the minister does 
not know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Me Trépanier and Ms. Toutant are members of the Quebec bar 
association's subcommittee on young offenders. That subcommittee 
drafted, among other documents, the association's submission on 
the strategy to renew the youth justice system. The minister 
cannot ignore the advice of these experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who will have to live with the new legislation do not care 
about the concerns of this election-minded Liberal government. 
They are the ones who will have to implement the new act. The 
spokesperson for Quebec's youth centres association was very 
clear when he said, and I quote, that “if the bill is passed, we 
will have a real mess”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act will be implemented based on a very fragile 
discretionary power held by crown attorneys. Again, the Young 
Offenders Act is a good act. It is effective and it gives good 
results. Therefore, why change it? What are the reasons 
justifying such a shakeup, other than the fact that the minister 
is desperate to please right-wing voters and give them the 
repressive measures they are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, western Canada, headed by the Reform Party, was 
demanding harsher sentences. It is getting them with this bill. 
Recently too, western Canada's right wing was demanding that the 
names of young offenders be published, and again the minister 
yielded to pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are still not satisfied. They now want criminal 
justice to apply to 10 year olds. Right now, the minister says 
she does not want to hear about such a measure. 
Yet, that is what the Liberal government said in 1994, when 
Reformers were asking for harsher sentences. The government 
would not hear of such measures. What happened since? The 
government caved in pathetically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government will never succeed in maintaining a balanced 
approach to juvenile crime. It is much too concerned by its 
election ambitions in western Canada. Who can trust such a 
flip-flop government?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Still today, one thing is obvious in the issue of the Young 
Offenders Act. The Quebec people will not be able to make 
choices that reflect its own values until it attains 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day until then, we shall rise in this House to denounce 
the weakness of this government.  In this issue in particular, 
the Bloc Quebecois will not give up on its demands, with 
witnesses to back up its position, that the minister listen to 
common sense, quit playing petty politics with something as 
important as the future of young people who are experiencing 
trouble with the law, and make up her mind to withdraw her bill, 
because it is aimed at trying to cause the failure of the Quebec 
model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It constitutes a real obstacle and a threat to the Quebec model, 
which was created with the help of specialists and all those 
involved in the field and goes back a good 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling upon the minister to understand this, and to 
withdraw this bill as quickly as possible, because it is not 
good for the future of these young people involved in crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is always a pleasure to rise on behalf of the New Democratic 
Party to address justice issues and in particular the new 
legislation that has been tabled by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I follow some eloquent speakers, who have put forward concerns. 
While I concur with many of the remarks of the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm, I would suggest to him that not all MPs from 
the west are members of the Reform Party.  Indeed, it is my 
privilege to be part and parcel of the party that contains the 
progressive elements of western Canada and the progressive MPs 
from that part of the country.  I just remind him of that.  I 
know he is cognizant of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I would like to comment first about some 
statements that were made. I will deal with the bill and the 
minister's comments shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are listening to this debate or reading 
<I>Hansard</I>, it is important to recognize that as opposition 
parties it is our job not just to oppose for the sake of 
opposing, which is often sadly what the Reform Party does, but to 
examine the legislation, to offer constructive advice and 
alternatives, to offer genuine criticism, to also offer 
congratulations when sections of a bill are well done and to 
examine that in committee.  That is the job of the opposition. 
Unfortunately, members of the official opposition, the Reform 
Party, have forgotten that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments made by the member for Surrey North tended to 
defeat their own purpose.  He criticized the government saying it 
was one dimensional in its approach to crime and then went on to 
criticize the bill in one dimensional ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think some things need to be clarified, specifically with 
respect to the sentencing provisions.  The member for Surrey 
North said there was nothing in the sentencing provisions that 
would make young people accountable, that there was only 
reference to rehabilitation and reintegration into society.  This 
is an example of simplistic language in what is an extremely 
complex document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has many sections and deals with a fundamental issue. 
To clarify and illustrate the simplistic measure of the Reform 
Party as opposed to the complex piece of legislation which the 
New Democratic Party will examine thoroughly and balance, I will 
read that section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The purpose of sentencing under section 41 is to contribute to 
the protection of society by holding a young person accountable 
for an offence through the imposition of just sanctions that have 
meaningful consequences for the young person, that promote his or 
her” and then there is rehabilitation and reintegration into 
society. It is a complex piece of legislation, not one to be 
dealt with with simplistic hysteria.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people came before the justice committee in the preparation 
of this report.  They are to be congratulated for their input. 
They included the Church Council on Justice, the Canadian Police 
Association and legal aid lawyers from across the country, many 
of whom I had the opportunity to work with before I came to 
parliament.  It was interesting to read the comments of my 
colleagues in that report.  I also want to commend the members of 
the justice department who prepared this document which as I have 
indicated is complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some good things in this legislation.  It is important 
that we offer a balanced approach.  In the principles, the 
minister recognizes that the basic premise for the legislation is 
the protection of society.  The reason we have criminal laws is 
to ensure that as a society we are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister indicated, many people in Canadian society today 
do not feel safe. They feel that the law has failed them in 
certain criminal areas. Sometimes that is fed for political 
reasons. Sometimes hysteria is put forward.  We hear repeatedly 
day after day in this House stories from the opposition about 
isolated incidents of heinous crimes, and they are heinous 
crimes. For every one young offender whose story is told for 
political points by the Reform Party, there are 20 young 
offenders who do find their way through the system and do find 
rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of society and the accountability of young people 
for the commission of their crimes are good things.  The taking 
of responsibility by young people has to be enunciated and this 
legislation does that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member knows and you know that it 
is not within the rules of this House to impugn motive.  When the 
member speaks of what we are doing here and attaching motive to 
it, it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  That is a point of 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Madam Speaker, I understand the 
sensitivity to the truth but I will continue anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have enumerated some of the good things in the legislation. I 
understand how sensitive sometimes the Reform Party is to the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go on to suggest some of the good things.  There is a role for 
victims in this legislation which is important and needs to be 
recognized.  The publication of names for serious offences for 
which a young person receives adult time is an important and 
significant change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, some other areas of the bill will require 
extensive study.  I have serious concerns with some areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost is the cost of the program and whether or not 
there is sufficient funding by the government to implement the 
changes in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act departs from the Young Offenders Act in many ways. It 
grants a great deal of judicial discretion and a great deal of 
power to the community in extrajudicial remedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the legislation is to determine that only those 
young people who commit serious violent offences or the 
prescribed offences will be incarcerated, whereas the others will 
find a way through the system to rehabilitation or reintegration. 
The problem is that is not new; that is what the old Young 
Offenders Act set out to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember practising law with respect to young offenders when 
that piece of legislation was introduced.  The real problem from 
the trenches, as we used to say at legal aid, was the resources 
were not there.  My hon. Conservative colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough will understand this. While there 
was progressive legislation in place and a call for community 
groups to deal with young offenders, without adequate financing, 
those young offenders went to jail because that was all the 
judiciary could do with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that the $206 million committed by this government 
over three years is not enough, especially if we look at it per 
capita.  If this money is to be distributed to the provinces on a 
per capita basis, it will mean very insignificant funds for the 
provinces with small populations, and the funds are necessary to 
fulfill the purposes of the act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to look at youth crime statistics, especially 
violent youth crime statistics.  They are down, as the minister 
has said.  They are down in some provinces, in Newfoundland, 
P.E.I., New Brunswick, Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario. They 
are down in Canada as a whole.  But in Saskatchewan, in my home 
province of Nova Scotia, and in Manitoba, violent youth crime is 
up.  It is up from 1990 to 1997 by 23% in Saskatchewan, by 32% in 
Nova Scotia, and by 34% in Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, if the money is to be distributed on a per capita 
basis, the very provinces that need the funding in order to 
implement the good parts of this legislation will not have 
significant funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $206 million over three years would be roughly $68 million 
per year to be distributed Canada wide on a per capita basis. For 
my province this would amount to perhaps $2 million to do many of 
the things the bill calls for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It calls for the creation of community organizations to work 
with young people and to ensure legal aid. The bill makes it very 
clear that every young person is entitled to a lawyer, which is 
as it should be but without substantial increased funding, that 
will not be there and will create problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs for changes to mandatory probation and increased 
supervision, which is what the bill calls for, will fall 
primarily to the provinces.  When the young person leaves the 
court to be under the supervision of a probation officer, the 
funds will not be there for that probation officer to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the old act, faced with no probationary services, no 
community groups, or special facilities to deal with young 
offenders, the judge will have no option but to sentence them to 
a custodial period.  Without adequate funding, and this is a 
primary concern, even the good parts of the bill cannot be 
implemented and will require scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also fails to deal with some of the concerns of the 
provinces. Provinces were unanimous in requesting a return to 
50:50 funding so that 50% of the funding for youth crime and the 
implementation of the bill would come from the federal 
government.  That has been cut back in recent years. 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia have sought that kind 
of funding.  As I have indicated, all of the provinces have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba has requested many things, such as mandated time lines, 
which are not contained in the bill.  Part of the problem is that 
under the current system the funds are not there to ensure speedy 
justice. Justice has to be speedy if it is to be just. Many of 
the concerns of the provinces have not been met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other areas of the bill have to be examined in committee.  I can 
assure the people of Canada that we in the NDP and myself as its 
justice critic will examine those things with a critical eye to 
implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this legislation there is a great deal of judicial discretion 
in determining whether or not a young person over the age of 14 
will face adult sentences for particular crimes.  That will 
require careful examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with providing police discretion to caution young 
people, but again we cannot hold the police to a high standard of 
behaviour if the funding is not there to ensure adequate 
training. We have to ensure that the police understand the 
conditions under which a cautioning can take effect.  If we do 
not, we run the risk of the police overstepping their bounds and 
the police run the risk of not understanding where the bounds 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always encouraged police discretion, but realistically 
and sensibly, the average cop on the beat who is concerned about 
being held accountable has to know what those time lines are, 
what he or she can or cannot do in terms of cautioning.  That 
will require careful examination.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are special provisions in this act for young people who 
are suffering from mental illness or severe problems.  We do not 
know how that is to be financed or exactly what young people will 
fit into that category.  The statement that mentally ill young 
people will find this as an alternative to adult sentencing 
causes me some concern.  The place for mentally ill people is not 
in prison.  We know that and we cannot change that for young 
people. I am sure that is not the intent of the legislation but 
we will guard against that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate that this is the Young Offenders Act, but 
provisions could be made to the Criminal Code to address the 
concerns we have.  The Minister of Justice is right in one sense. 
There is no place in jail for 10 and 11 year old children.  They 
should be dealt with through social services in each province 
because they are children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked and called for changes to the Criminal Code to 
punish those who recruit 10 and 11 year old children into crime, 
especially young people who know that a 10 or 11 year old child 
cannot be charged under either the old legislation or the new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been pointed out by the Minister of Justice, there is a 
parties section.  Anyone who encourages another to commit an 
offence is a party to the offence committed.  However, we think 
there should be a special section dealing with those who recruit 
10 and 11 year olds.  It is perhaps the most heinous of crimes to 
induce young people into a life of crime and then only be a party 
to that.  Perhaps the penalty should be increased for those who 
do that.  Again, that is a subject matter outside of the Young 
Offenders Act but an amendment to the Criminal Code could meet 
the concerns of many people concerned about youth gangs in their 
cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Surrey North has put forward a private member's 
bill in good faith which has been included in the provisions of 
the Young Offenders Act.  It is a section that will require 
careful examination.  I appreciate that the member says this is 
not to make adults responsible for the crimes of their children. 
I believe he means that but I am concerned about the wording of 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is also absolutely correct when he says there is currently a 
provision in the Criminal Code which deals with that.  The 
difference is this change will make it a hybrid offence. This 
means that under the old legislation when a parent or a guardian 
signs an assurance saying they will be responsible for the young 
person while he or she is released pending trial, if the young 
person breaches the conditions then the person who is supervising 
him or her has some liability for that.  Currently it is a 
summary offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding of the proposed change is that it will make it 
a hybrid offence where the parent can either be charged 
indictably, which carries a more serious penalty, or summarily at 
the discretion of the crown.  If we are not imputing the crime of 
the child on to the parent, one must ask why we would have 
differing penalties.  The crime is clearly the failure to 
supervise.  It is not failure to supervise if one robs the 
grocery store or commits armed robbery, it is failure to 
supervise, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That we would have differing penalties for the person who fails 
to supervise leads to the impression, which is why the member 
from Surrey said the members of the press were reporting it this 
way, that the parent is then responsible and faces a more serious 
penalty if a more heinous crime is committee.  That is something 
we will check on balance at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated, there are many areas to this act.  There 
are over 101 sections that need to be examined carefully.  I 
think the member from the Bloc Quebecois who spoke prior to me is 
correct to some extent.  The agenda has been pushed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have in this new legislation, in a way to balance, is 
tremendous discretion. 
It is in part a response to find that balance.  We will be 
checking that discretion carefully to ensure that while there is 
discretion the principles that guide that discretion are proper.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day we need legislation based on sound public 
policy.  We need neither hysteria nor platitudes.  We owe it to 
the young people of this country, to the people who live in 
communities and who are concerned about crime.  We owe them a 
piece of legislation that works, that balances and that is fair.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, quite frankly, I am appalled at the hon. member.  He is 
accusing Reformers of using this issue for political purposes but 
he is using it in resorting to attacks on the official 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of his speech he said that one thing we do not need 
is legislation based on hysteria.  I think all members and all 
political parties would agree with that.  What we have seen 
continuously over the five years during which the majority of 
Reformers have been present in this Chamber is the unwillingness 
of the government to properly address this very serious issue of 
youth crime.  The real problem is exactly that.  It is not 
hysteria.  It is not that some members raise important issues and 
examples of where the system is failing, failing all Canadians, 
not just the victims of crime but in many Canadians the youth 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member agrees with the government in its reluctance to 
lower the age to include 10 and 11 year olds.  I believe he said 
that the proper avenue to address crime in this age group is with 
social services.  I point out to the hon. member that is the 
problem we have today.  That is the problem we have with the 
current Young Offenders Act.  These youngsters are falling 
through the cracks and social services cannot adequately address 
that. It is not just the official opposition saying that.  We are 
hearing that from all sectors, from a lot of people involved in 
the field of justice as it pertains to youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member elaborate on how he would see those 
youngsters who are falling through the cracks and who are not 
getting the help they need?  Let us be clear that we are not 
talking about 10 and 11 year olds going to jail.  That is the 
charge from the other side.  It has been directed at those people 
who have suggested and stated quite emphatically in many cases 
that 10 and 11 year olds need to be included in any remake of the 
YOA.  The fact is we must include them if we are to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to explain at greater length how he 
envisions under the new act that those 10 and 11 year olds who do 
flaunt the system will be dealt with adequately under social 
services when they have not been in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond. 
There are ways we can ensure 10 and 11 year old children, 
children who are usually in grades four and five, are dealt with 
when they commit crimes.  I say commit crimes but they are not 
committing crimes, they are behaving badly. The member asked how 
we can remedy that.  The suggestion came from his own party.  It 
was a commendable suggestion by the member for Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca who talked about a head start program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about ending child poverty in this country. 
Unfortunately in the race to balance books, in the race to cut 
deficit, in the race to the bottom we have increased child 
poverty in this country by 50%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we say it over and over.  I know members are tired of 
hearing it, but when we talk about increasing child poverty by 
50%, the faces of that child poverty are the 10 and 11 year olds 
referred to by the member who asked the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that children who do not have adequate food, who 
do not have support at home for whatever reason, are children who 
fall between the cracks and commit crimes.  That is why we need 
at the provincial level adequate social services such as a head 
start program, such as increased support for families and for 
single mothers, to ensure those children have both the monetary 
and emotional support they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes I am puzzled at why some people take various stands on 
things.  That is why we have guidelines in terms of maintenance 
support under divorce legislation. It is a way of trying to 
ensure that young people have the necessary support to grow up 
healthy, to grow up with respect for society and to be 
accountable for their behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to improve schools.  We have a crisis in education 
across the country.  Governments are cutting back on teachers. 
All this is happening to some extent, especially in the poorer 
provinces, because the federal government has cut back money to 
the poorer provinces.  When it comes time for education, teachers 
who are on the front line and understand perhaps more than anyone 
when children are falling through the cracks do not have adequate 
resources.  We have kids going to school without sufficient 
learning tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many ways we can address the problem of 10 and 11 year 
old children who fall through the cracks. The way to do it is to 
help families through social services, not through the criminal 
code. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the member. Except for some very 
obvious points, I had a great deal of sympathy for what he had to 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that at the present time we incarcerate 25,000 
young people a year.  Given that the vast majority of these are 
boys, this means that in a four or five year period we 
incarcerate over 100,000 young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the statistics are quite skewed. Look at Quebec and 
New Brunswick. I understand New Brunswick has recently closed a 
number of prisons.  The figures are quite different there.  The 
rate of incarceration is much lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member has any information on these two 
provinces and what they have been doing to keep their 
incarceration rates so low compared with a province such as 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question.  A great deal of what Quebec has been doing was 
elaborated on by the justice critic for Quebec. Interestingly 
enough, in his criticism of the government he says that the Young 
Offenders Act works if the resources are available to make it 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to my concern about this legislation. While there are 
some good things in the legislation dealing with extrajudicial 
remedies and some good things that provide for redirecting young 
people in a way that would move them away from a life of crime, 
without adequate resources that cannot be fulfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have a great deal to learn from Quebec in the way it 
has dealt with its young offenders. The hon. member who preceded 
me gave a history of the tremendous contribution of Quebec to the 
youth crime issue. It is to me a startling example of working 
together at the federal and provincial level and achieving the 
results we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I perhaps would disagree with the hon. member.  The federal 
initiative was important in working with Quebec. The country 
benefits best when we see those two governments working hand in 
hand for the enhancement and betterment of the whole country and 
is a shining example of what all the provinces can do if we work 
well with the federal government.

Speaker, I am appalled when I hear that Reform is trying to 
create hysteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House what hysteria is.  It is when one has a 
son in the hospital who has been beaten to the point where they 
cannot recognize him, where they have to identify him by a tag. 
I was more fortunate than my hon. colleague from B.C. in having 
my son restored and brought back to health.  That is hysteria. 
If we do not want to address it when the police in the streets 
tell us that their problems are getting greater and greater, then 
someone should have the experience of hysteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comment 
of the hon. member.  What I am suggesting is this.  We need to 
hear that kind of evidence in this body.  It is important for us 
to hear what happens in a balanced way.  When we talk about 
victims of crime we need to recognize that all of society is 
victimized when crime occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we tend to hear about is the person who is hurt.  That is 
legitimate.  What we do not hear about is that many times young 
offenders are victims; victims of sexual abuse, a history of 
violent abuse, a history of mental abuse, a history of being 
ignored by the system, of growing up in aboriginal communities 
where, many times, there are no support services.  When those 
stories are told I would expect a balanced approach.  That is 
what I am saying. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, for over 10 years Reform members have been calling for 
reforms to the Young Offenders Act, a statute which the justice 
minister herself characterized as the most unpopular piece of 
federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leadership in advocating these Young Offenders Act reforms 
has been provided in particular by the hon. member for Crowfoot, 
the hon. member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, the hon. 
member for Surrey North, the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford 
and many others of my colleagues.  I want to thank each of them 
for the sincerity of their efforts and for their dedication, some 
of which has come to fruition in portions of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our interest in this bill stems from two sources:  first, the 
concerns of the public with respect to youth crime and the 
inadequacy of the Liberal approach to dealing with it and, 
second, from our interest and concern for young people 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I frequently visit high schools where I have open question and 
answer periods with young people.  I notice that of all the 
federal laws, the one that is best known—young people know about 
it, how it works and how it does not work—is the Young Offenders 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually in my encounters with young people I ask them at the end 
of the discussion to take a straw vote on would they prefer to 
tighten up the Young Offenders Act, strengthen its provisions, 
would they prefer to leave it as it is, or would they prefer to 
loosen it.  In the assemblies that I have been at I have probably 
asked this 30 or 40 times over the last three or four years. 
Invariably the voting is always the same.  About 60% to 70% of 
our young people say strengthen the Young Offenders Act, tighten 
it up, and adults better believe and better understand that we 
young people are the greatest single category of victims of youth 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested that in the minister's remarks this morning 
commenting on the bill there was not a single reference to 
consultation with young people on their ideas, their fears and 
their concerns.  Yet I suggest that they have a big stake in this 
bill and it is not simply as the perpetrators of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act reforms which the public has called for 
and which we have advocated have been numerous in detail, but the 
most substantive may be grouped under eight headings:  one, 
clarification of the purposes of the act; two, strengthening 
parental responsibility; three, recognition of victims' rights 
and the provision of support services for victims; four, stronger 
differentiation between violent repeat offenders and non-violent 
first time offenders; five, strengthening sentencing provisions; 
six, publication of the names of young offenders; seven, changes 
to the age of application of the Young Offenders Act; and eight, 
provisions for rehabilitation and prevention.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After six years of dithering the government has finally brought 
forward proposed changes to the Young Offenders Act which are 
found in the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My intention today is first to briefly compare the changes in 
the bill with those demanded by the public and the official 
opposition; second, to identify those measures which we support 
and give credit where credit is due; and third, to identify those 
areas where we feel the government's response has been inadequate 
or misguided and to urge constructive alternatives and 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin with the purpose of the act.  I was disappointed 
this morning in the minister's remarks as she devoted no time at 
all to that subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will know that this official opposition attaches 
great importance to ensuring that parliament clearly states its 
intent in any bill that we consider or that we adopt, because if 
we do not, and the government is often sloppy in this area, we 
simply hand jurisdiction by default over to the courts, and that 
has been done far too many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the bill before us, it is particularly important 
to clearly state the intent because there has been a lot of 
confusion on this in the past.  The old Juvenile Deliquents Act 
made it clear that its primary purpose was the welfare of 
society, whereas the Young Offenders Act introduced by the 
Trudeau government focused more on the welfare of the young 
offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask, what is the primary intent of this parliament in passing 
this statute?  Is it first and foremost the protection of the 
public, or is it the rehabilitation of young offenders?  If we 
give the typical Liberal answer, which is that when one comes to 
a fork in the road one should take it, in other words both, then 
the question is which objective prevails if those two objectives 
come into conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that one of the commendable features of the bill is 
that it states in the preamble that the protection of society 
from youth crime is the principal objective of the bill.  I think 
that is progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clause 3.1 it also states that the principal goal of the 
youth criminal justice system is to protect the public; a 
protection to be pursued through the prevention of youth crime, 
through the punishment of convicted offenders and through efforts 
to rehabilitate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clarification of the intent of the Young Offenders Act with 
greater emphasis on the protection of society is a change that 
Reformers have long advocated and we are pleased to see progress 
in that direction in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should note in passing that some of the reforms we have 
advocated, like clarifying the intent of the Young Offenders Act 
to establish the paramountcy of protection of the public, have 
frequently been dismissed by the government, and by the minister 
in particular, as simplistic.  In doing so the minister implies 
that complex problems always require even more complex and 
complicated solutions and that simplicity is always suspect by 
definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the minister that there are really two kinds of 
simplicity.  There is “simple stupid”, a simplicity rooted in 
ignorance or lack of experience, which certainly should be 
avoided in seeking solutions to public problems.  There is also 
such a thing as “simple wise”, a simplicity that is rooted in 
common sense or in experience and perceptions which allow us to 
reduce complexity to its essential element. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newton's definition of the laws of motion and Einstein's 
reduction of the theory of special relativity to E = MC2 were 
simplifications, but they were not “simple stupid”, they were 
“simple wise”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clear, simple definitions of the intent of parliament in passing 
a statute are greatly preferred over the convoluted statements of 
multiple objectives such as the minister and her bureaucrats are 
wont to spout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to remind ourselves that the law of Moses, which will be 
remembered and studied long after the laws of this administration 
are forgotten, consisted of 10 commandments, not 10,000 
commandments, and it is not necessarily a sign of advancement or 
sophistication when a forklift is required to deliver the laws to 
the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to turn to another Young Offenders Act reform which 
this party has long advocated, and that is increased emphasis on 
parental responsibility for the actions of young offenders. 
While this bill does not go as far as Reformers would like with 
respect to affirming parental responsibility, it contains at 
least two steps in the right direction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I refer to the requirement for compulsory attendance of a 
parent at court, if that is considered by the judge to be in the 
interests of the young person.  Second, I refer to the increased 
penalties provided for a parent who signs a court undertaking to 
supervise a young person upon release and who wilfully fails to 
fulfill that obligation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate to remind the minister and the House that this 
latter provision on penalties for parents who wilfully fail to 
supervise a young offender released into their custody is in this 
bill primarily as a result of the work of the member for Surrey 
North who originally proposed this measure in a private member's 
bill.  In question period when the justice minister is asked, as 
she frequently is, why she did not include such and such a 
measure in the bill, or why she failed to see such and such a 
consequence of her decisions, if members check <I>Hansard</I>, her 
most frequent response is to say that the questioner does not 
understand, as if all knowledge on issues like youth crime lies 
with the minister and her bureaucrats, and ordinary MPs or 
ordinary members of the public lack the understanding to question 
the minister or comment intelligently on such sophisticated 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week in question period when the minister implied that the 
member for Surrey North did not understand the issue of youth 
crime, she made a mistake so grave that it deserves public notice 
and rebuke.  Members will know that the primary reason the member 
for Surrey North ran for parliament, and he explained this this 
morning, was to work for amendments to the Young Offenders Act to 
hold parents or guardians more accountable when supervising 
accused young offenders who are released from custody pursuant to 
a court order or signed contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Surrey North experienced the terrible tragedy of 
having his 16 year old son Jesse murdered by a young offender who 
was released into society on precisely one of these court orders 
signed by a parent.  That parent promised to supervise the young 
offender and promised to ensure that certain conditions would be 
respected.  One of those conditions was that the young offender 
was to have a curfew from dusk to dawn.  The parent in that 
particular case did not supervise his child and the son of the 
hon. member was knifed to death at night when that young offender 
should not have been on the streets.  I for one do not ever want 
to hear the Minister of Justice say again to the member for 
Surrey North that he does not understand.  He has an 
understanding of the youth crime issue at the heart level and at 
the gut level as well as the head level that no amount of book 
learning or memo reading could ever give the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn to the victims of youth crime.  Victims of youth crime 
have become so frustrated by the government's lack of concern for 
them and their families that some, like the member for Surrey 
North, have had to run for parliament to raise their concerns 
directly.  Let us look at Bill C-68 from the standpoint of 
victims' rights and the provision of support for victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us contains several provisions that represent a 
step in the right direction.  For example, clause 52 permits the 
provinces to order that a surcharge be levied on any fines 
payable by young persons, the funds to be used to provide 
assistance to victims of offences.  Where the province has not 
made this type of order, a youth justice court may order a victim 
fine surcharge in an amount not exceeding 15% of the fine to 
provide assistance to victims of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 113 permits a youth justice court, a review board or any 
court to keep a record of proceedings of young persons.  Clause 
118 permits victims access to the clause 113 records.  Clause 39 
states that the pre-sentence report is to include the results of 
an interview with the victim.  If applicable and reasonably 
possible, clause 12 permits the victim to obtain information on 
how the young person has been dealt with through extrajudicial 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions all represent steps in the right direction. 
However, hon. members on both sides of the House will notice that 
they fall far short of the demand of the official opposition, 
supported by this House, for a full blown victims' bill of rights 
applicable to victims of offences committed both under the Young 
Offenders Act and under the Criminal Code.  We will therefore 
continue to press for a full blown victims' rights provision 
along the lines of that proposed by the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister, like her predecessor, still appears to assign a 
low priority to victims' rights in relation to the rights granted 
to persons accused or convicted of crimes, which reminds me of a 
story.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the story of the good samaritan with a Liberal twist.  It 
seems that a certain man went down Wellington Street one night. 
He was attacked by a gang.  He was beaten, robbed and left half 
dead by the side of the street.  Shortly after, the Minister of 
Justice and the Minister of Health happened to be going down the 
same street.  They were on their way to a discussion of child 
poverty at the Rideau Club over wine and cheese when they saw 
this poor victim lying on the street.  As they hurriedly stepped 
over the victim to continue on their way they were heard to say 
to one another “You know, we really need to do something to help 
the people who beat and robbed this fellow”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most Liberal policy statements, their words reflect a half 
truth.  It is true that the people who beat and rob others need 
not only to be apprehended and restrained but treated and 
rehabilitated.  I suggest it is even more true that the victims 
of their crimes, who do not need to be hunted down because they 
are right there in front of us, also need to be helped and often 
more urgently so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the provisions of this bill for providing real 
help to victims are woefully inadequate, and that is a 
regrettable deficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn to three other subjects of great concern to the public 
and on which we consider the provisions of this bill inadequate. 
I refer to the provisions pertaining to the differentiation of 
violent offenders from non-violent offenders, for sentencing of 
young offenders and for publishing or prohibiting the publication 
of the names of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have already done this and will continue to do 
this.  We will comment in greater detail on all these provisions 
but I will summarize our concerns in this way.  It is the 
position of the official opposition that a disproportionate 
number of non-violent offenders are locked up, limiting space and 
resources needed for violent offenders and increasing rather than 
reducing the probability that these young people will be drawn 
into a life of crime rather than being protected and liberated 
from criminal influences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consequently advocated a stronger differentiation, both 
in law and in treatment, between violent and non-violent youth 
offenders and between first time and repeat offenders.  It was 
the justice committee and the Reform Party which strongly 
recommended extrajudicial measures, measures other than judicial 
proceedings, to deal particularly with first time non-violent 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us in section 2 defines a non-violent 
offence as an offence that does not cause or create a substantial 
risk of causing bodily harm and defines a violent offence as one 
that does cause or create a substantial risk of causing bodily 
harm.  In part 1 the legislation goes on to provide for 
extrajudicial measures for application to first time non-violent 
offenders.  All this is well and good and is welcomed by the 
official opposition, regardless of who gets the credit for these 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, however, there is a weakness in this section 
which if not corrected will bring the whole concept of 
extrajudicial treatment into disrepute, just as the minister's 
approach to conditional sentencing has brought that concept into 
disrepute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our interpretation of clauses 4(c) and 4(d) is that these 
extrajudicial measures could also be applied and will also be 
applied to repeat offenders and even violent offenders at the 
discretion of the court.  This is a weakness on which my 
colleagues will comment further and to which we will propose 
corrective amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with the principle of more strongly differentiating 
between the treatment of first time non-violent youth offenders 
and violent repeat offenders, the official opposition has 
consistently called for tough sentencing in adult court of repeat 
violent young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill before us the list of presumptive offences for which 
an adult sentence may be imposed is severely restricted.  The 
list includes murder, attempted murder, manslaughter and 
aggravated sexual assault but it does not include sexual assault 
with a weapon, hostage taking, aggravated assault, kidnapping and 
a host of other serious violent offences.  This too is a weakness 
in the bill and my colleagues will propose corrective amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition and many victims groups have also taken 
the position that the public has a right to know the names of 
young offenders whose activities are a threat to others, 
including other young people, and that the public has a right to 
know if a violent young offender has been released into the 
community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 109 of this bill covers the publication of the names of 
young offenders.  It generally permits the publication of the 
names of most violent young offenders 14 and over.  Violent young 
persons under 14 would appear, however, to have their names 
protected from publication.  In general, it is our conclusion 
that the act contains too many provisions and too many loopholes 
to prevent the publication of names of violent offenders who 
constitute a risk to the people of their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, my colleagues will elaborate on these deficiencies. These 
are the deficiencies of half measures.  When the government 
approaches a problem it never provides a whole solution, always 
half measures.  This bill is riddled with half measures in 
respect of differentiation, sentencing and name publication. That 
is why we say it needs a lot of corrective amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to the age of application.  The age of application of 
the Young Offenders Act is provided for in Bill C-68.  The 
official opposition believes the government has made another 
serious mistake here by rejecting proposals for lowering the 
maximum age from 17 to 15 and lowering the minimum age from 12 to 
10.  Sixteen and seventeen year olds are legally allowed to drive 
cars, to get married and to live on their own.  They are able to 
distinguish right from wrong and should be treated as adults 
under criminal law, particularly in the case of repeated violent 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition and the public take particular exception 
to the government's fallacious contention that people who want to 
lower the age of application of the Young Offenders Act are hard 
hearted barbarians who would put 10 year olds in jail. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada about 5% of all youth crime is 
committed by children under 12.  These children, more than any 
other category of youth offenders, are usually victims of crime 
themselves, often recruited into criminal activity, particularly 
in the case of break and entry for the purposes of theft, by 
older teens or adults who know that if these under 12 children 
are apprehended they cannot be dealt with effectively by the 
police or courts under the current law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole purpose of lowering the age of application to 10 years 
is not to put 10 year olds in jail but to keep them out of jail 
when they are 16, 18 and 21 by giving them access to the 
rehabilitative measures and services which this act purportedly 
provides to first time offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that if the minister really had the faith she 
professes to have in the effectiveness of the rehabilitative 
provisions of this bill, the provisions for extrajudicial 
measures, for warnings, for cautions, for referrals, for youth 
justice committees, for community support, why would she deny 
access to those rehabilitative provisions to the most vulnerable 
and malleable of young offenders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to what I consider to be the most important of 
the eight categories of the Young Offenders Act and criminal 
justice reforms that Reformers have advocated, the provision for 
rehabilitation and prevention.  I have already emphasized the 
interest shown by my colleagues on the justice committee in 
developing and ensuring the success of extrajudicial measures for 
dealing with young offenders, in particular the non-violent first 
time offender who at least in theory is the best candidate for 
rehabilitative and preventive measures if these are available and 
properly funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Surrey North, has been personally 
involved for a number of years in diversion and alternative 
programs whereby the community and the young offender sit down, 
sometimes with the victim, to determine how best to address the 
wrongs that have been done and to provide the healing of both 
victim and offender, which is at the heart of rehabilitation.  I 
appreciated his experience and the remarks he made this morning 
on this subject and I commend those remarks to the minister and 
other members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me confine my remarks to prevention.  It is on this aspect 
of the treatment of young offenders where there is the most 
profound difference between the government and members of the 
official opposition.  The official opposition believes that the 
most effective approach to crime prevention, particularly youth 
crime prevention, is to strengthen families.  By this I mean 
families broadly defined to include extended families, single 
parent families, traditional families, the situations in which 
the vast majority of our children are born and in which they are 
raised for better or for worse.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of this fundamental belief that the strong family 
is the key to healthy, properly educated, law abiding, secure, 
adventurous and happy future generations that we advocate tax 
relief for families, tax fairness for families, respect for 
families, respect for their rights to make decisions that affect 
the welfare of family members and acceptance by families of 
responsibility for their decisions.  We would like to see the 
justice minister, the health minister and the human resources 
minister, all ministers with social responsibility, band together 
and become the strongest lobby within the government for 
strengthening families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead what do we see?  When it comes to issues like crime 
prevention, youth crime prevention, illness prevention or 
unemployment prevention, the ministers of the Liberal government 
put their faith not in families but in government programs 
operated for the most part by well meaning but impersonal and 
inefficient bureaucracies.  When bureaucracy fails their instinct 
is to appoint a super bureaucrat or an ombudsman to adjudicate 
among the bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This predisposition to trust bureaucracies to deal with our most 
delicate and serious social problems was graphically illustrated 
last week in question period when the justice minister was asked 
what should be done for these 10 and 11 year olds recruited into 
crime by teens and adults and if her department was going to 
ignore it.  Her answer, which she repeated several times then and 
again this morning, was turn them over to the provincial welfare 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister not aware that the public has absolutely no 
faith in that answer at all?  Has the minister not read about or 
been briefed on the abuse and neglect of children by both 
provincial and private child welfare systems across the country? 
For example, the situation in B.C. of the torture and death of a 
young child at the hands of his mother, both of whom were under 
the care of the ministry of social services, sparked a whole 
special inquiry by Justice Thomas Gove and resulted in demands 
for a complete rethinking of the entire child welfare system in 
that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the minister not read the briefs or seen the reports on the 
situation in Manitoba where the number of child deaths in 1998 in 
situations where child welfare agencies have responsibility has 
prompted a complete review of the child welfare system there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has she not read the statistics on the situation in Quebec where 
more than 100 Quebec children under five die every year in 
violent, unusual or undetermined circumstances and where the 
child welfare system itself acknowledges having great difficulty 
in either getting to the causes or providing protection?  Is the 
minister not aware that right here in the province of Ontario the 
starvation death of a five week old infant while under the care 
of the Children's Aid Society has prompted the review of child 
abuse and neglect cases in all 55 children's aid societies across 
the province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister not aware that the appointment of a children's 
czar or a super bureaucrat or an ombudsman to adjudicate among 
the bureaucrats is not the answer to the prevention of social 
ills? Is the minister not aware it is time to challenge the whole 
notion, which is embedded in the administration and has been 
there ever since the second world war, that bureaucracies can 
care for people, in particular vulnerable people like the old, 
the sick, the poor and the young? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are bureaucracies not the best instruments for delivering 
frontline care?  There are two huge reasons.  First, bureaucratic 
structures with their layers and layers of organizational boxes 
divide up responsibility for the consequences of their actions so 
finely that no one is accountable for the final result.  Thus we 
can have a revolving door parole system that simply does not 
work, that everyone knows does not work, and yet no one accepts 
any responsibility for it, for changing it and, worse, no one 
accepts any responsibility for the outcome of the defective 
system, not even the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus there can be a bureaucratic system for guaranteeing the 
security of the blood system.  When people die of hepatitis C 
contracted from tainted blood obtained from that system, no one 
is responsible.  It is the same story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason bureaucracies are untrustworthy in caring for 
people stems from the way they handle information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bureaucracies are information systems that transmit information 
on particular cases involving people upward to policy decision 
makers and downward from those decision makers to frontline 
workers.  Unfortunately bureaucratic information systems can only 
transmit certain types of information.  The information they can 
transmit most reliably is hard data consisting of objective facts 
and figures.  The information they cannot transmit effectively is 
information about values, beliefs, emotions and feelings which 
happen to be precisely the type of information one needs to make 
policy on or to deal directly with vulnerable people, in 
particular the sick, the old, the poor and the young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say there is no place for the big public service 
social bureaucracies, but their place should be to serve and 
support frontline caregivers and not to smother or substitute for 
them.  By frontline caregivers, many of whose actions can 
contribute to the prevention of crime, I mean all those 
overworked social workers, probation officers, court workers, 
doctors, nurses, teachers and day care workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all I include in the frontline caregivers overworked, 
under supported and under recognized parents.  Of all the 
frontline caregivers it is these parents that the official 
opposition considers to have the most crucial role with respect 
to the care and nurture of children into productive and 
law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government and the justice minister have any appreciation 
of the need for a more progressive, decentralized, family 
oriented approach to the prevention of youth crime, it should 
have been evident in the budget and the other social policies of 
the government but it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when the government takes $2,000, $3,000 and $4,000 
in taxes per year away from poor families with children and then 
gives them back a few hundred dollars through tax credits, it is 
contributing to, not alleviating, the poverty and family stress 
that breed social problems including crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the justice minister had any appreciation of this alternative 
family centred approach to crime prevention, it would be evident 
in the section of the bill providing for consequential and 
conditional amendments to other legislation.  However the only 
conditional and consequential amendments in the bill are some 
amendments to the Criminal Code and a few other criminal 
statutes.  There are no consequential amendments or adjustments 
to social legislation or tax legislation which is where we get at 
this family centred approach to prevention of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we see hardly a trace of this more progressive, 
decentralized family oriented approach to prevention of youth 
crime in the bill, we consider its approach to rehabilitation and 
prevention completely inadequate and completely out of date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concluding summary therefore is that eight great categories 
of reforms the public has demanded, which we have been advocating 
for years and against which we measure the content of the bill, 
have been presented.  With respect to clarifying the purposes of 
the act and strengthening parental responsibility we support the 
measures contained in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to recognition of victims rights and provisions for 
victims support, the bill contains a few steps in the right 
direction but falls far short of what we wanted to see in a full 
blown victims bill of rights.  With respect to the bill's 
provisions for differentiating between violent and non-violent 
offenders, its provisions for sentencing of young offenders, and 
its provisions for publishing the names of young offenders, we 
find major deficiencies in all these provisions which my 
colleagues will endeavour to correct through amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the failure of the bill to effectively change 
the age of application of the Young Offenders Act, we think the 
government's approach is a big mistake.  With respect to the most 
important dimension of treatment of young offenders, namely the 
importance of prevention and the crucial role of the family with 
respect to youth crime prevention, we find the approach of the 
government, the justice minister, the department and the bill to 
be both inadequate and misdirected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons the official opposition opposes the 
legislation in its current form and urges other members of the 
House to do likewise.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with the member for Durham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to speak to the proposed youth crime justice 
act.  I think all members are concerned about youth and certainly 
those who engage in criminal activities.  Approaches may vary, 
but I believe that the fundamentals in the bill are sound and 
ones which deserve the support of all members of the House.  The 
bill is not a panacea, but it does address the key issues that 
have been before the Canadian public for some time now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After extensive consultations with the provinces and 
territories, with professionals and with community leaders, the 
government has introduced a strategy to protect the public from 
youth crime.  As one who has advocated a scrapping of the Young 
Offenders Act I am pleased that the minister has taken 
significant steps to send out a strong message to young offenders 
that their actions will not be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former educator I know that young people want and indeed 
need rules that will be enforced.  The message for young people 
is that if they take certain actions which are not deemed 
appropriate by society there will be meaningful consequences for 
their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996-97 about one-third of convicted youths received 
sentences of custody.  One-half were given probation and only 
one-sixth were ordered to do community service or to pay fines. 
Custodial sentences were given in approximately 25,000 cases of 
young offenders, usually for short periods of time.  Over 
one-quarter received sentences of less than one month and about 
one-half of the sentences were from one to three months.  Eight 
per cent were sentenced to more than six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that sent out the right message.  I do not 
think Canadians felt that sent out the right message.  Therefore 
we have the introduction of the bill which I believe will address 
those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goals of the bill are to prevent young people from turning 
to crime in the first place, to ensure both violent and 
non-violent youths are given meaningful consequences that reflect 
the seriousness of their crimes, and to effectively and safely 
rehabilitate young people so they will not reoffend.  I believe 
these are the goals which all Canadians can and indeed will 
support.  The legislation reflects accountability, respect and 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition referred to Moses and the Ten 
Commandments and suggested the minister was referring to the 
10,000 commandments.  I would suggest there are only three 
commandments in the bill: accountability, respect and fairness, 
which are values Canadians want to see enshrined in the new youth 
justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accepting responsibility, particularly placing the onus on the 
violator, is a key element of the legislation.  Only a small 
number of youth are involved in serious and repeat criminal acts, 
particularly acts of violence.  Statistics show 18% were involved 
in violent crimes.  According to 1997 statistics over one-half of 
all violent crimes were minor non-sexual assaults and another 
one-quarter were more serious non-sexual assaults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal activity is an antisocial activity.  Toughening the law 
to make it clear that such acts are unacceptable must and will be 
part of the message that the bill addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have lost faith in the Young Offenders Act.  The 
government has responded with a number of key initiatives which I 
believe will address these concerns and send out a tough message 
to those young people who engage in acts which are unacceptable 
to society.  The bill reflects the protection of society.  It 
reinforces strong social values and proportionality of 
sentencing.  Recognition of the rights of victims is something I 
am particularly pleased to see enshrined in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a youth justice system which protects citizens 
and provides meaningful consequences for the actions of those who 
would disregard the law.  Establishing tougher consequences for 
serious youth crime by expanding the offences for which a young 
person convicted of a serious violent offence can receive an 
adult sentence is an important change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support and applaud the lowering of the age of youth who could 
receive an adult sentence for serious violent crimes from 16 to 
14. 
I support the publication of the names of all young offenders who 
receive adult sentences.  Individuals who commit crimes should 
have their names published.  It would be a warning and hopefully 
a deterrent to others.  Meaningful consequences to unacceptable 
acts are critical if we are to maintain Canada as a nation with a 
relatively low crime rate compared to other nations such as the 
United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important section of the bill is to establish an effective 
rehabilitation and reintegration process that would require all 
young people who have served a period of time in custody to also 
have a period of controlled supervision in the community.  This 
is something Canadians have wanted and the government has 
responded to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committing a crime is not a lark.  It is not something one does 
for fun.  Having both meaningful sentences and appropriate 
supervision after the individual has left custody is something 
for which Canadians have been asking.  Public protection is 
critical and the bill addresses that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expanding offences for which a youth is presumed to receive an 
adult sentence to include a pattern of convictions for serious 
violent offences and extending the group of offenders who are 
expected to receive an adult sentence to include 14 and 15 year 
olds will be welcomed by most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much public debate about the publishing of names 
of young offenders.  I believe the publication provides 
transparency in the justice system which will further provide 
public confidence in our judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring that consequences for young people who commit crimes 
will be in proportion to the seriousness of the offence is a 
major change in the proposals before the House.  Sentences that 
fit the nature of the crime, sentences that are meaningful and 
encourage accountability, is an important feature of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two elements of note are creating an intensive custody sentence 
for the most high risk youth who are repeat offenders, who have 
committed murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated 
assault and assault, and permitting victim impact statements to 
be introduced in youth court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of concerns and rights of victims, their concerns are 
recognized in the principles of the act.  This is a first in 
federal legislation.  Providing victims with the right to access 
youth records and to play formal and informal roles in community 
based measures is something I know residents in my riding of Oak 
Ridges welcome.  They further welcome and applaud the right of 
victims to information on extrajudicial measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill gets tough on youth crime it also recognizes that 
as a society we have a responsibility to make sure where possible 
we place a strong emphasis on rehabilitation in terms of the 
youth justice system.  Throwing away the key is not the answer. 
At some point these individuals will be back on the street.  How 
they are prepared to reintegrate into society is important not 
only for them but for society at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long term protection of our citizens is best ensured by 
making sure that the youth are accountable for their actions and 
that they are supervised and supported, particularly during the 
period when they re-enter the mainstream of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the provision that requires every youth sentenced to a 
period of custody to also serving an additional period of 
strictly controlled and meaningful supervision in the community 
equal to half the period of custody.  This period of supervision 
is subject to several mandatory conditions.  The individual must 
keep the peace, participate in good behaviour and report to a 
youth worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional or optional conditions may be imposed on the 
offender.  These include conditions to structure the individual's 
life such as finding or continuing employment, obeying a curfew 
or attending school, and conditions associated with the offending 
behaviour such as abstaining from drugs, alcohol and attending 
counselling, et cetera.  If these conditions are not met then 
having the individual returned to custody will occur.  The follow 
up is crucial if the program is to be successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing a reintegration plan where the individual and the 
youth worker develop a plan of action together will assist in 
successful reintegration into the community.  Developing the 
strategy while the youth is in custody and continuing it during 
the period of supervision in the community help build a more 
successful and meaningful transition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing community based programs in conjunction with a 
variety of organizations, individuals and parents is important. I 
am pleased that in the area of York region my colleagues and I 
are working together to establish a community crime prevention 
council, making sure that people are accountable and involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome these changes and I look forward to further comments 
from members of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to enter the debate on Bill C-68, the changes to our youth 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to this debate with some new-found experience.  I left the 
House on Thursday and entered my home around 12.00 a.m. to 
discover it had been broken into and violated.  Windows had been 
smashed. I lost about $20,000 of personal assets.  It is the 
second time this has happened.  Obviously I cannot accuse young 
offenders of doing this because I am not certain who it was. They 
may well have been graduates of the young offenders school. 
Therefore, I speak with some experience today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first constituent to come into my office on Friday sat down 
and pounded on the table.  He had sold some cattle and had some 
money in his house.  He believed that young offenders had broken 
into his house and had stolen his money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the train coming back here last night another constituent 
told me that someone had stolen his car on the same night my 
house had been broken into.  He is a local high school teacher. 
His car was found at the high school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come to this debate today saying there is definitely a 
problem.  I can now say that I am a victim of this type of crime. 
However, I do not believe that incarceration and penalizing by a 
harsh system is the answer. Canada has one of the highest 
incarceration rates for young offenders in all the western world. 
That is not the answer. A very informative trip to Millhaven 
penitentiary convinced me of the total waste of human assets in 
our prison system.  People are wasting their days away at the 
taxpayers' expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In studying the whole youth justice system, one thing which 
seems to be missing is some kind of retribution.  The retribution 
process is one which recognizes that somebody has committed a 
crime against another person.  We live in a very plastic society. 
We turn on the television set and see crimes committed.  We do 
not believe there are any human beings behind the crimes.  We 
believe that people's property can be stolen, or they can be 
maimed and there really is no downside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very impressed with some of the programs our 
minister has sponsored in my riding to increase the awareness 
that the people who commit crime have done so against other 
people.  An aggressive program in south Oshawa involves the 
street crime unit, the crown prosecutor and others.  We have had 
some positive results.  Youth crime has declined in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One commonality is it seems that communities are acting in a 
holistic fashion to deal with the problems of crime.  One issue 
which also seems to be in there is that younger people for 
example go to the supermarket and talk to the person who is 
running the store or talk to families or other people who have 
been violated.  They see that real people are involved in the 
process and it is not just some statistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened attentively to the Leader of the Official Opposition. 
His simple answer was that to empower families would solve all of

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken the time to sit down with some families that have 
been affected in that their children have committed youth crimes. 
There was a period during which they felt they had lost control 
of one of their children while the other children were fine. 
These things often are not predictable. Parents understand that 
personalities can be very different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone of these people came from very caring families.  They 
all said that the intervention of the state at a certain period 
of time was useful.  It takes the custody situation out of the 
family unit.  Somebody else is responsible for curfews, et 
cetera, and creates a positive attitude of rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of many dysfunctional families.  There are limitations as 
to what we can do to empower families.  It is a fair and 
respectable thought process to take care of each other within our 
family units, but the reality is that is not where society is 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we should go back to that regime is another point of 
view.  Even if it were possible to go back to that kind of a 
society is questionable as we enter into a more global society. 
People are moving. Families are scattered all across the country. 
People do not live in the same little areas they grew up in, the 
flip side of which I suppose is that people are pursuing more 
interesting careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill tries to segregate violent and non-violent crimes. 
Basically it takes two courses of action.  The Leader of the 
Opposition talked about the fork in the road, but we are talking 
about treating crimes differently depending on what the 
commission of the crime is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would all stand back and say that this legislation 
attempts to be tougher on acts of violent crimes against people 
by allowing younger violators to be tried in adult court, the 
publishing of their names, et cetera. The second area is 
non-violent crimes, the type that affected me and would be dealt 
with differently.  I fully respect that.  I would rather have 
these young people out working in the community, earning money 
and paying people back as a consequence of their actions rather 
than having them sit in a penal institution wasting their days 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about preventative measures and more community 
based measures in order to solve the issue of youth crime.  When 
the person is reintroduced into the community they realize they 
are part of a family, a family of communities. Within that 
structure they have a responsibility for their actions. It is for 
those things that are in this bill that I am very supportive of 
the minister and her legislative process.  We all have a tendency 
to wish there were simple solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said to a lot of my constituents, “Do you not think that 
if changing a couple of lines in the Young Offenders Act would do 
away with youth crime in this country we would not have done it 
long ago?”  The reality is that it is a societal issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party think there is a cause and effect, 
that before they commit a crime they study the Young Offenders 
Act and the sentencing provisions and then commit the act. People 
tell us all the time that there is no thought process put in 
place before the crime is committed, even with adult crimes. 
There is no consequence of people saying “Should I or should I 
not carry a gun”.  They are not brilliant people.  They are 
probably some of the lower educated people for a variety of 
reasons and do not think that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply changing an act here in Ottawa is not going to change the 
problems of youth crime in our communities.  It has to be done 
through assistance to communities and through preventative action 
programs such as the ones in the bill.  Communities must also 
become more aware of how they can enhance their communities to 
make them safe and ensure that young people will not follow a 
course of violence and crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the new name of the riding is 
Haliburton—Victoria—Brock.  It reflects the fact that there is 
only one Haliburton.  There are three Victorias and many Brocks. 
The name change reflects that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to enter the debate on Bill C-68.  I have not 
gotten over the last C-68 we had in here.  I did not think I 
would ever want to get up and speak on anything that had anything 
to do with C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case however, the people of Haliburton—Victoria—Brock 
had a direct say in the drafting of this bill.  I was able to 
have some input into this bill and indirectly to the solicitor 
general's bill which we debated in Minden on October 4.  That 
allowed for the Criminal Records Act to be changed so that 
people's names could be entered into a register, for example 
sexual predators and pedophiles in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member for Calgary Southwest, the Leader of 
the Opposition. He has a rather simplistic approach.  He talks 
first about punishment and asks how society will be protected. He 
tries to transpose the idea into people's minds that the more 
people are punished, the more they will be rehabilitated.  I find 
that kind of offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my credit, and sometimes I think to my detriment, I was a 
member of the society that looked after parole. As an officer in 
that role I came in contact with many police officers.  I 
conducted a number of parole hearings just as the Young Offenders 
Act changes were coming in a few years ago.  I saw repeat and 
repeat offenders at age 18 being brought back into the system as 
young offenders.  They were teaching crime to young offenders who 
maybe would only have come into the system once and then would 
have been rehabilitated and reintegrated into society. Had they 
been taught values for the first time, they would have had a 
better chance in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a simplistic approach by the Leader of the Opposition, 
the member for Calgary Southwest.  The member for Calgary 
Northeast wanted to study caning.  He thought that caning people 
would somehow cure people from committing crimes. I do not know 
whether he was going to study the stroke or the intensity.  He 
never did tell me what it was that turned his crank to want to do 
that. It seems Calgary has this thing about beating everybody 
into submission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some examples as a parole officer.  People 14 years old 
who have been beaten, hung by their heels, put down all their 
lives need help. They do not need another beating.  Another 
beating will do totally nothing for them, except turn them 
further and further away from what they need to be rehabilitated 
in order to be constructive, contributing members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this bill tends to look at.  It does not take a 
rocket scientist to see that the government can be blamed, 
everyone can be blamed, but blaming the system for someone 
murdering someone else is part of the problem.  It is not all of 
the problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we will punish people who sign someone out of an 
institution and say they will take care of them is a good step. 
I do not think that should be taken lightly.  A person who 
commits a crime and intends to commit another crime will not to 
be stopped by having their mother sign them out of the 
institution. If they are going to reoffend, they will reoffend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find a way to reach that person, to teach them 
values, to show them perhaps for the first time values.  In 
studying some of the personal things, some of the parts of the 
Young Offenders Act that I was involved in, as a parent I went 
to court seven times.  Two judges did not last through the 
proceedings.  We came to our third judge before finally they 
talked about sentencing.  Was it to be closed custody or open 
custody for the person who offended was what I was a witness for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the court system, which I tend to have the highest 
respect for even though I am not a lawyer.  Being a real estate 
agent we just made all their money for them.  I hear my lawyer 
friends getting upset about that.  The fact is it is a good part 
of their practice.  When they are able to delay and delay and to 
wait until the witness does not show up of whom they have a 
question to ask and the case is dismissed, I find that part has 
to be taken into account and has to be treated very seriously in 
the criminal justice system.  It is something where police 
officers are continually asked to appear in court to be 
witnesses, which takes up valuable time they need to chase 
criminals.  Instead of that they end up in court and in a 
situation where they are off the street.  Many times they are 
dealing with people who have been through system many times. They 
know how the system works better than police officers, better 
than lawyers, better than judges and certainly better than the 
prosecutors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 is not perfect.  Anyone who thinks perfect law will be 
passed here which changes society will be disappointed. 
Everything has to be tested in the court system. When we test a 
law in the court system it is done by the experience of working 
it through, by having it exposed to the many people who become 
involved in that system to see how the legislation works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to my friend, the hon. solicitor general, when he 
brought in the publishing of the names of pedophiles, I think 
that was a very positive step in our criminal justice system.  It 
allows institutions, boys and girls clubs, people who coach 
hockey, people who are involved in the youth system, to do 
background checks on people to find out if they have previous 
experience.  Even if they have been pardoned it will show up in 
the system as they go from province to province. Changing their 
name is another problem that exists in the system.  People change 
their names. They have a clean slate and they have been pardoned 
under another name. That legislation is good because it comes 
from the problems of community groups and how they want to 
interact with the youth justice system and with the criminal 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing an adult sentence for a youth of 14 who is convicted of 
an offence can result in a sentence of two years less a day.  If 
a person is convicted provincially they can serve up to two years 
less a day for that crime.  It puts an onus on people.  If we 
take a person and put them into a value home, a value 
environment, a place where sometimes for the first time they 
would have some values, I think that is an important part of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the simplistic approach by the members for 
Calgary Southwest and Calgary Northeast who have a punishment 
philosophy, let us take a look at the problem.  If I were to 
write a parole paper and I put broken home, substance abuse, 
alcohol abuse, abused as a child, a grade eight education, a 
dropout, I would have about 90% of that catchment area that I 
work in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is missing?  Is it punishment?  Most of them fight their 
way into gangs.  They do not get brought in because they have not 
been beaten or because they are going to beat someone.  A lot of 
gangs are there.  Peer pressure draws people into them. Taking 
them out and beating them for being beaten is not something that 
will instil any values in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about poor, underprivileged, abused people.  The 
rest of the people who are caught in this will see the results of 
their actions.  When they are taken away from that peer group 
they will interact with people because they know the difference 
between good and bad and evil.

share my time did not show up.  I do not mind doing 20 minutes. I 
may have to actually start reading something, which would be 
quite a change for me because the member across tells me that I 
have to read a speech.  I have never read one yet in here and so 
I do not think I will start now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
You have extended the member's time by 10 minutes and a Liberal 
member spoke before him.  Does that mean they have 30 minutes 
speaking time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  No, it means that in 
order to accommodate the Leader of the Opposition to speak out of 
sequence we had to do some juggling to get back into sequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I simply want to say that 
we were very pleased to make the arrangement so the Leader of 
Opposition could speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sit on a lot of 
committees with the member for Calgary Northeast. Ten plus twenty 
is thirty. The member is absolutely right.  I am very glad he was 
able to work that out.  That might have something to do with that 
stroke in intensity he was studying in Singapore.  It takes a 
fair bit of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to some of my personal experiences in court cases 
involving young offenders.  It is a very serious thing to go into 
a prison to do a parole hearing.  I appreciate that the 
simplistic approach applied by the Reform Party is well meaning. 
Some Reformers are very intelligent former Conservatives and 
Liberals.  I know they cannot get elected out west except by 
running under Reform so I appreciate that they are doing that and 
I wish them well as long as it is not well in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about the young man who was hung by his heels at 
age 14 by his parents, who was sexually abused and beaten as a 
child, who was not taught values, who dropped out of school so he 
could run away and get away from everything.  When he was 
arrested and incarcerated, he met people who deal with young 
offenders.  They took him under their wing and taught him values 
he had not been taught before.  He got away from his substance 
abuse and alcohol abuse.  He got away from the abusive nature 
that surrounded him.  Today he is a productive member of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that does not happen all the time and that the Reform 
Party does not want to talk about it, but the fact is the Young 
Offenders Act served a purpose that does not serve the purpose of 
Reform. 
Reformers cannot build unless they can teach everyone that 
everything is hate, hate, hate, punish, punish, punish.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that if we are to rehabilitate people, we do not do 
it by putting them in boot camps or by putting them in a caning 
camp or whatever the member wanted. We have to teach them values. 
We have to teach them the societal things expected of them.  If 
young people are to be productive members of society, they have 
to be taught values. That simply is what changes people to 
be productive members of society and that protects society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was impressed with a criminal I met who was a musician. When 
money machines first came out and PINs had to be punched in which 
had a different tone to the pad, this man could stand behind 
someone making a withdrawal with their card and he could pick off 
their pin number because he had a musical ear.  He could play any 
instrument.  He was a very talented person. He would follow that 
person home, find an undetected way to break into their house and 
steal that card out of their wallet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the card is not in our wallets, we often think where did we 
leave it.  We take a couple of days and think somebody else might 
have it, whatever.  Just before midnight or just after 2 a.m. 
your bank account has been cleaned out by that person.  The 
reason was not because he was a thief but because he was a heroin 
addict.  How do we get a person like that into methadone 
treatment and let them put their talent to work in society?  That 
same young man is now playing in a band and is very productive. 
These are a couple of examples the Reform Party cares to not 
notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the Young Offenders Act and about 
rehabilitation, we talk about people who suddenly come into a 
society where values are taught and they offend only once.  They 
do not become repeat offenders. Repeat offenders are a shame and 
there has to be a way to deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can save the majority of young offenders, which the Young 
Offenders Act did and which the Reform Party does not want to 
mention, we have done society a great justice.  I believe Bill 
C-68 is a good start in changing the Young Offenders Act so we 
will have a youth criminal justice system that will stand the 
test of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, you still have 10 minutes of

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sears family of Quispamsis in my riding, like so many

chooses to have one parent stay at home to raise the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get away from this unfair tax policy where the government 
believes it can make the best choices.  The best choices can and 
must be made by the people it affects, Canadian families.  We 
should allow Beth Sears to make the choice that best suits her 
family without unfair tax penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 9 the PC caucus along with the opposition members voted 
in favour of this motion.  Unfortunately Liberals voted against 
it.  Again the government had an opportunity to demonstrate its

does the minister explain that the only member of the jury of 
experts to come from Winnipeg voted in favour of the design 
proposed by the Winnipeg firm, and that the minister, who is 
also from Winnipeg as it happens, decided to award this juicy 
contract to a consortium, one of whose firms is based in his 
Winnipeg riding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not odd that the only member of the jury to vote for the 
design chosen by the minister, the firm preferred by the 
minister, and the minister himself, all have Winnipeg in common?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is just being silly.  The major 
design firm was from Toronto.  It was supported by associates 
from Montreal, Vancouver and Winnipeg, which provided various 
engineering and other support services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how the jury worked.  I was not there.  However, 
what I can say is that we will have a very good embassy that will 
represent Canadian interests and be a showcase for Canada in the

split three to three or four to four, naturally the government 
has to be able to cast the deciding vote.  But when, as in the 
Berlin case, the jury makes an almost unanimous recommendation, 
then it is surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister claim that he overturned the jury's 
decision because of special security requirements, when a senior 
official from his department and the ambassador himself were 
assigned to help jury members make the best decision?  Was it 
not the specific function of these two individuals to provide 
the jury with guidance?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the jury was made up of a group of design people who 
were arranged to make a judgment, of which a small, final 
selection was made, including the final project that was applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time there were separate reviews being done on the 
question of functionality, which included a wide variety of 
performance criteria; cost, which is always a concern when 
constructing public buildings; and the technical working of the 
building to suit the particular nature of the site in downtown 
Berlin.

Winnipeg, which just happens to be in his riding, was given a 
leg up and that is what concerns us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister invited three top German architects to sit on the 
jury in order to ensure that the Canadian embassy fit in well on 
the Berlin site.  These three experts voted unanimously for the 
same project, as did other members of the jury.  Only one person 
was in favour of the Winnipeg project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister explain that he went with the opinion of 
one jury member from Winnipeg over the opinions of three German

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are not in the habit of letting foreigners decide 
what Canadian embassies will look like.  Canadians will make that 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the firms chosen were firms that have won awards, 
firms from Montreal, firms from Toronto, firms from Winnipeg,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister, who many years ago 
authored a report about foreign investment in Canada.  The sale 
of Spar Aerospace, and with it the Canadarm, has raised concerns 
once again about foreign investment in Canada and the extent of 
it.  Investment Canada reports that 796 foreign acquisitions took 
place in 1998, only 28 were reviewed, all were approved, and this 
constituted $63 billion in one year in foreign acquisitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government not concerned about the extent of foreign 
acquisitions?  If it is concerned, what does it plan to do about 
it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as I was quoted as saying over the weekend, the 
acquisition of Spar by MDA is saddening.  However, it is 
important to point out that in the context of this deal the 
acquisition by MDA, previously by Orbital, has resulted in an 
increase in employment at MDA in Richmond, British Columbia.  It 
has enabled it to compete effectively, in fact so well that it 
won the RADARSAT II contract which was open to bidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are confident that in the long run the investment in the 
robotics division will continue to maintain Canadian leadership. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is not just a question of short term jobs; it is also 
a question of long term control over our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Deputy Prime Minister again, hearkening back to 
another day:  What has happened to the Liberal Party that brought 
in the Foreign Investment Review Agency, the national energy 
program and a number of other measures that expressed concern 
about foreign control, in particular American control of the 
Canadian economy?  Is this no longer on the government's agenda? 
Is it simply a matter of Canada being up for sale and the highest 
bidder take all?  Is that the situation we are in? 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his ongoing

our policies in the best interests of Canada as we respond to 
current and future situations.  His key support of the Liberal

rejected by the employment insurance system because the access 
requirements are too severe, that call us into question as the 
government, and we will have to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the labour market was more generous to them, and 
more women found work, I am saying this is a whole other 
reality, which will involve other actions by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the member for Québec has, for the last three years, been 
saying in the House that women are being penalized and that they 
do not have the same maternity benefits as before.  Despite the

remain unchanged.  What does the member for Québec say to that?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member would like us to look at the facts, so 
let us look at the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the announcement was that retail sales in Canada 
rebounded strongly in January, gaining 1.7%.  Our nominal exports 
were up 2.1% in January.  Our employment, as members know, is up 
13,000, an increase of 51,000 a month over the last eight months.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the facts according to the Alliance of Manufacturers and

he says Canadians should not worry about falling living 
standards.  They pegged our productivity as having gone from 
fifth to seventh in the G-7 last year. The ultimate indication of 
economic growth is the stock exchange, which in the United States 
has increased by 30% and is stagnant in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the finance committee says this government should let

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
is a number of goofy aspects about the back to work legislation 
the government wants to ram through today.  For one thing, the 
corrections officers mentioned in the bill are not even on 
strike. Second, the proposed legislation does not tell us what 
their settlement is to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the President of the Treasury Board is how do we 
order somebody back to work who is not even out on strike? How 
are we supposed to debate and vote on a pig in a poke, on a wage

<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in fact the correctional officers do not have the right to strike 
because they are all designated workers.  If some of them went on 
strike and there was a riot in a prison, this would obviously be 
unacceptable to Canadians.  However, through a quirk and a 
loophole, 500 or 600 of them have the right to strike.  Obviously 
since they have the right to strike and since they have indicated 
that they intend to use it, we have to close the loophole. That 
is why they are included in the law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is with some regret that I must this

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the President of the Treasury Board, will be 
giving a detailed speech on what the bill, which was introduced 
earlier today, will contain as soon as the order that we have 
before us has been disposed of by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, might I take this opportunity to thank the House for 
having agreed earlier today to the introduction of Bill C-76, the 
Government Services Act.  This has allowed members to see the 
bill for a few hours more than they would normally have been able 
or entitled to.  Hopefully it has succeeded in convincing at 
least a number of members of the House as to why the bill is so 
urgent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has settled collective agreements with some 87% 
of its civil servants.  However, there is a number of groups with 
which a settlement has not proven to be possible.  With a view to 
reaching a settlement the government was very flexible at the 
bargaining table. 
Again, the President of the Treasury Board will be speaking I am 
sure very eloquently on this issue when he makes his second 
reading speech.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our last offer compared very favourably to what 87% of our 
unionized employees, including more than 90,000 PSAC members, in 
other words the same union, have already accepted. Unfortunately 
an agreement has not been possible with a smaller group who 
nevertheless provide services in critical areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do they provide services in critical areas but they 
have picketed in a way that has prevented other people from 
attending to their regular duties and deprived Canadians of the 
services they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strike activities have been affecting millions of Canadians, in 
particular Canadian farmers, Canadians who pay income tax or, 
perhaps more important if we look at it through the eyes of the 
taxpayers, those numerous Canadians who are expecting income tax 
refunds.  Some 900,000 claimants are waiting for their benefits 
as we speak because we are unable to process these claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an issue involving Canada's prison system which of 
course came to light last Friday through the media and we all 
know how important the preservation of that is for the security 
of Canadians and for providing for the security of those who are 
incarcerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week Mr. Speaker determined that an emergency debate on 
this issue was necessary. If no less than the Speaker of the 
House of Commons has decreed that this was an emergency to be 
debated on the floor of the House we in the government are 
treating this issue as an emergency and agree with what Mr. 
Speaker ruled on some days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote the member for Selkirk—Interlake who stated on March 18 
that grain farmers are facing one of the worst financial years in 
a decade: “Farmers are innocent third parties in this labour 
dispute”. These concerns were raised again on Friday, March 19 
in the House by other hon. members.  We agree this is important 
and urgent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Revenue Canada offices were heavily picketed across the 
country, the national capital region, the Atlantic region, 
including St. John's, Sydney, Halifax, Summerside and Saint John, 
the Ontario region office at Belleville and the prairie region 
offices at Winnipeg and Edmonton.  This adds to the problem at 
Revenue Canada that I was speaking of a while ago. This is 
disrupting and it is disrupting to many Canadians and sometimes 
Canadians least able to help themselves and who need our help and 
our support in this time of need. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the government has today tabled a bill in the name 
of my colleague, the President of the Treasury Board, for the 
purpose of ordering 14,000 of these blue collar workers back to 
work and imposing a collective agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also calling on parliament to order some 4,500 
correctional officers to remain on duty in the interests of 
public safety and to negotiate a collective agreement as quickly 
as possible in order to maintain the safety of inmates and of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government and for millions of Canadians, this is 
therefore an urgent matter, as the Speaker of the House pointed 
out last week.  It is urgent that action be taken immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Blue collar workers are responsible for the operation of 
government facilities and buildings throughout Canada, as well 
as health services in federal institutions.  In addition, of 
course, when these people are picketing, they can prevent other 
equally important workers from delivering services to Canadians.

I would argue, become unacceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament representing a rural constituency, I 
do not want to see my country lose sales of grain and other 
agricultural commodities.  Our agricultural commodities are the 
pride of this country and we do not deserve to see the sales of 
these products diminish for any consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strike is having a serious effect on Canada's economy, 
particularly on grain farmers, small business, low income 
Canadians and all those who are counting on receiving their 
income tax refunds.  Canadians are counting on us today.  I ask 
the House to approve swiftly the motion before us. Having passed 
that motion, we will then proceed with the bill in the name of 
the President of the Treasury Board, Bill C-76. After that bill 
is in place we will be able to resume all the services that 
Canadians deserve. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore call on the House to pass as quickly as possible 
today this motion that will enable us to pass Bill C-76 in order 
to restore the services to which Canadians are entitled.

<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today we finally have a debate about the emergency 
situation facing this country.  We have a debate based on some 
facts and some details which this government has failed to 
provide since I raised the motion last Thursday for an emergency 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of this debate this afternoon Canadians will start to 
fully realize the level of incompetence and uselessness this 
government that went ahead and negotiated over the past five 
years since it came to power in 1993.  We are in this emergency 
situation today because of the negotiators who work against the 
unions as opposed to working with them in an attempt to get a 
fair and reasonable negotiated settlement.  What happened?  They 
dillied, they dallied, they wasted time, they did not bargain in 
good faith.  They knew these negotiations were absolutely vital 
to coming to an agreement before there was any harm done to the 
Canadian economy. They did not bargain in good faith.  Otherwise 
we would have had today a negotiated settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They disregarded the farmers in this country who are already 
suffering from a serious financial situation due in no part to 
their own actions or decision making.  The actions I described 
were due to subsidies in foreign countries and a general 
oversupply of the commodity product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have Bill C-76 in front of us, an act to provide for 
the resumption and continuation of government services.  The 
Canadian people will see the spin doctoring of this Liberal 
government done by its henchmen back in the offices behind the 
ministers.  We will see that the people of Canada will see what 
has gone on in the House and outside. I will go over that spin 
doctoring a little.  The true facts will arise from this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the agriculture minister is following my speech very 
closely today.  Whether or not the Treasury Board minister and 
the agriculture minister agree, the question of how serious this 
was and when the government should have known about it is one of 
the key things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we had the revenue minister stand up in the House and 
refer to 1.2 million tax returns that have not been filed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  You guys are worried, aren't you? 
You better send a few more task forces up there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  It is very difficult 
for the Chair to hear the hon. member who is making his remarks. 
Perhaps there could be a little more order so the hon. member 
could be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is behind by 1.2 
million tax returns.  The revenue minister has to know that as of 
January 1 Canadians are entitled to file their tax returns and 
try to get back some of the money that the government has taxed 
out of them.  They deserve that money and they deserve it on 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government saw this coming.  Here again it goes right back 
to those poor negotiating tactics.  It attempts to squeeze the 
union people and farmers out of every penny they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard another member speaking today with regard to 
corrections. The Treasury Board minister said he had to close a 
loophole, a quirk in the previous agreement they had negotiated 
with the corrections officers and the unions representing them. 
Why did they have to close that loophole, that little quirk?  Not 
only did they not negotiate with the unions in good faith and 
come up to an agreement, but the very legislation they put in 
making them essential workers was incomplete and incompetently 
drafted. The government went ahead and passed that legislation 
which is another reason why we are here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can continue on about the incompetence of this government in 
its labour negotiations.  We look back to when we were dealing 
with Bill C-19, a labour bill.  That bill and other major labour 
legislation were designed to have agriculture products continue 
to move through the ports.  When we look in <I>Hansard</I> at the 
debate, Reform members put in amendments to say this legislation 
did not cover the 70 grain weighers out on the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not name the member, but a member of the Liberal 
government came to me on Thursday, the night I asked for this 
emergency debate, and said “Are you sure this did not cover 
those 70 members of the PSAC grain weighers union on the west 
coast?”  I had to tell him it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were telling this to the government back in 1997 and 1998, 
that Bill C-19 did not cover that.  As late as Thursday these 
Liberal members were coming to me and admitting that they knew 
not what was in that bill, assuming it covered the necessary 
labour agreements to keep the grain flowing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to March 18.  The summation of everything I have 
said to this point is quite clear.  This government since 1993 
has not bargained in good faith.  It has not done the things 
necessary to establish good relations and come up with a fair and 
reasonable settlement for the union people, the farmers and 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a known fact that in this country, as in any country, 
productivity is directly related to the workers and the amount of 
produce, product and manufactured goods. Over the years we have 
seen billions of dollars lost to union strikes and other labour 
disruptions.  Even those disruptions were due to the previous 
governments over the past 30 years negotiating in poor faith and 
not understanding what union people were trying to put across to 
them which was simply a fair and negotiated settlement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They failed in all those 30 years.  I remember seeing these 
stoppages from the time I was a very young lad in Saskatchewan 
living on a farm.  They started back with the seaway negotiations 
with the pilots.  That was when governments lost control of 
negotiations.  History shows us that inflation took off in Canada 
and put us into this $600 billion debt.  We only have to look at 
who was in charge of the country over those 30 years.  I look 
across and I see the Liberals and I see the Conservatives.  They 
have brought us here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has put forward solutions to some of these problems and 
has certainly worked closer with the unions than the government 
with respect to the very problems we are facing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the possible solutions which I mentioned in my speech in 
the emergency debate of Thursday, March 18 was the fact that the 
grain weighers are an essential service provided by government, 
due to the fact that they are the only ones who perform that 
service, and they should have the benefit of final offer 
arbitration to settle their labour disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the incompetence shown by the government in Bill C-19, 
those 70 weighers were not treated properly and, as a result, all 
14,000 Public Service Alliance of Canada workers have been 
dragged into this dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will certainly give credit to the Speaker who authorized the 
emergency debate on Thursday, March 18.  However, in the Liberal 
spin doctoring, no credit was given to myself or the Reform Party 
by the government.  Government speakers went outside the House to 
give part of the story of what had happened in the House.  There 
was no mention of the fact that final offer arbitration was 
suggested as one way of settling these disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate of Thursday, March 18, there was an amazing 
coincidence.  This was again spin doctoring.  This time it was 
the Minister of Natural Resources, the minister responsible for 
the Canadian Wheat Board, saying that Canadian Wheat Board 
negotiators, the salesmen, the marketers for the Canadian 
farmers, were in Japan and were announcing the loss of a $9 
million sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the first time I had ever heard representatives of the 
Canadian Wheat Board say they had lost a sale.  It is a 
coincidence that it came up just at the time they were trying to 
put pressure on the labour unions.  They were trying to put 
members of the official opposition into what they perceived as a 
beautiful, spin doctored, compromising position to make us look 
bad before the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comment on the Canadian Wheat Board is a question I am going 
to be asking farmers and one which farmers are going to be asking 
their elected representatives.  Farmers are going to find out how 
the decision was made to make a public announcement that our 
grain was not selling in Japan and why this government was unable 
to settle the labour negotiations to keep our grain moving; and 
not only settle negotiations, but in fact have legislation in 
place to facilitate grain movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, March 19 the government came into the House to put 
forward a motion.  The Liberals expected us to buy into a motion 
that gives absolutely no details of the legislation they intend 
to bring forward.  The government also asked the Reform Party, 
the NDP, the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois to accept this 
no detail motion on behalf of Canadians and to assume that the 
government will take care of Canadians and their interests.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has not taken care of farmers' interests.  It 
has not taken care of the PSAC union members' interests.  It has 
not taken care of the productivity interests of Canadians in this 
country.  It certainly has not taken care of the high taxes or 
the high debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Canadian public is starting to understand and 
realize that this whole problem, this whole emergency, this whole 
non-negotiated settlement, this requirement for back to work 
legislation, rests solely on the head of the Liberal government. 
It does not rest on the opposition members.  The government has 
been in charge of this House since 1993.  That is precisely why 
this problem rests on its head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked for the emergency debate the other day we were 
trying to get solutions from the government as to what facts it 
had to bring forward and what it was going to do about the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sat here that night.  It is all in <I>Hansard</I>.  There were 
no solutions coming forward from the government.  It threatened 
the union.  It talked about hostages and that kind of thing.  But 
it is not the union's fault in this situation, it is the Liberal 
government's fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no point in reading the full motion that was put 
forward on March 19, but it stated that it was a bill in the name 
of the President of the Treasury Board, entitled an act to 
provide for the resumption and continuation of government 
services, and it gave the manner in which it was to be disposed 
of.  There were no details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I hope it is abundantly clear to the House and to 
the Canadian public that members of the Reform Party stood for 
Canada.  We stood for the unions.  We stood for the farmers.  We 
said that we were not going to let the government sell us a pig 
in a poke.  The Canadian public bought that in the election of 
1993 by electing the Liberal government.  I do not expect to see 
them make that mistake again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Canadian public can see that the opposition parties 
took the right stand in saying that before we would give consent 
to the government to do anything, which would probably cost a lot 
of money and a lot of heartache, we wanted to see the facts. 
Today we have the facts in Bill C-76, which we can now debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this chronology of despair over the emergency situation, when 
there is no real need for an emergency situation, we saw the 
Saturday and Sunday press releases describing the attempt to put 
the motion on Friday.  Over the weekend I followed the 
newspapers. They did not even bother including the other 
opposition parties because they wanted to try to make Reform, 
with our strong base in western Canada, look bad to Canadians.  I 
know today that Canadians and western Canadian farmers know what 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those newspapers are reviewed and when the facts start to 
come out over the next couple of days, our western Canadian 
farmers are going to see that Reform stood for them and has a 
good track record in regard to this whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already covered some of the history.  This government has 
been in power since 1993 and it continued the wage freezes which 
were started a year or two earlier under the Conservative 
government.  The freezes continued right through until the last 
two years.  The government knew that there had to be negotiations 
and that agreements had to be in place.  There was ample time for 
it to do that, instead of leaving it go, instead of making poor 
decisions, instead of not showing any leadership, instead of not 
taking the bull by the horns to come up with a settlement which 
would treat people properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We referred to June 18, 1998, when royal assent was given to 
that essential service in Bill C-19.  Our suggestion at that time 
was that the government should include in the bill final offer 
arbitration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is that 70 grain weighers who were not covered were 
able to harm the incomes of 115,000 grain farmers in western 
Canada.  The grain weighers did not want to harm these farmers 
financially, but they did have to stand for their interests.  The 
government had the opportunity in Bill C-19 to make sure that did 
not happen, but once again flawed legislation prevented Canada 
from moving ahead with its economic programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back in history a few months, on January 27, 1999 the 
Western Grain Elevator Association was very concerned about the 
rotating strikes.  Members of the association said that it was 
time to do something about the labour negotiations.  They were 
concerned about the movement of grain through the Vancouver port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen from the situation we are in today, this emergency 
situation, that in fact that letter, if it was not ignored, it 
certainly was not acted upon.  That was not the only warning, I 
am sure, telling the government that something had to be done 
immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the government's previous history with respect to 
labour negotiations.  I am not going to go back to 1993 or the 
many years that Liberals have been in government, but I am going 
to go back to the famous debates we had on back to work 
legislation for the postal union.  I am saying this so that 
everyone fully understands the incompetence with which the 
government has dealt with labour-management problems in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The postal union strike was not settled.  There was back to work 
legislation about two years ago.  In fact I was informed the 
other day that there has been no negotiated settlement of that 
dispute.  It is ongoing.  Who knows?  If the time runs out on 
that legislation, I guess the government's idea of labour 
negotiations is simply to bring in another piece of back to work 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country cannot be run by a dictatorial government.  That is 
exactly what back to work legislation is.  It is a dictatorship 
which has been resorted to and implemented.  The government has 
ignored the normal democratic processes, including listening to 
the official opposition when it puts forward good amendments to 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with the introduction of the legislation 
this afternoon by the government House leader.  Once again the 
spin doctors came out.  I guess in this case it was his own spin 
doctor.  I do not know if he was handed the information or if he 
collected it himself, but he said that he introduced this 
legislation with some regret.  I am referring to Bill C-76. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time for his regret was back in January.  It was back in 
1998.  It was back in 1997 when something could have been done 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals know that something is coming down the pike, 
why if they are doing their job, if they are representing the 
people of Canada, would they wait until the last minute, wait 
until it is a crisis, wait until the situation cannot be 
resolved, wait until financial harm has hit some of the poorest 
people in the country who are waiting for tax returns?  I do not 
know.  I have to refer to it as simply being incompetence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a nice bit of spin.  Then the government House leader 
went on to say that he hoped this bill would convince some 
members of the House, referring to members of the Reform Party 
and possibly other members of the opposition, that we were wrong 
on Friday.  That was the gist of his remarks.  I have already 
explained that we had no details on Friday. 
For him to stand today and try to make it look as if the 
opposition parties were against having this legislation come 
forward, like we said, we will not buy a pig in a poke in this 
House.  If we did, who knows the dismal conditions the Liberal 
government would have us living in within very short order?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a comment by the House leader.  I do not want to dwell 
on his presentation but he brought it up.  Like they say in the 
old school yard, he started it.  And at the schools I went to, I 
was of the opinion that somebody else may have started it but I 
was going to finish it and that is exactly what I am going to do 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that he did not want to see lost sales exports. 
The rotating strikes and lost sales exports started back in 1998 
and in early 1999.  If he does not want to see them, why the heck 
did the government not do something about them before today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hurt for farmers will not stop today.  To get the grain 
system and the hopper cars spotted on the tracks by the elevators 
and inland terminals will take several days.  It will probably 
take a week or more to get the system back up and running. 
Demurrage charges will kick in.  Late delivery penalties will 
kick in from our customers.  The financial hurt is there and it 
should be on the government's head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture minister sat back until December 1998 saying not 
to worry about that income problem because the western Canadian 
farmers have crop insurance and a NISA program, and that is fine 
and dandy, they will be all right. The farming industry and the 
opposition members finally convinced him by December that he was 
totally misguided, misinformed or he misunderstood what the facts 
were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring that up to point out that the agriculture minister is 
part of this whole terrible scenario leading up to this emergency 
today.  He is supposed to be representing farmers across the 
country, including western Canadian farmers. When the agriculture 
minister saw the hurt that was happening, even if he did not want 
to admit it, and when he had the opportunity to do something 
about it and did not, that to me is what Canadians will see as 
incompetence on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with the final comment that the government will 
have to pass this legislation.  I will support this legislation 
because incompetence has brought us to this point. The government 
has put Canadians, farmers, the union, everyone in a box from 
which they cannot escape without this drastic dictatorial action. 
It is a sad day but that is what will have to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting this minute, the government will not get off lightly 
having left us in the lurch.  Tomorrow we will have to continue 
on with two things.  We will have to try to get some amended 
legislation on Bill C-19 that went through on labour relations. 
We will continue to push the government to negotiate in good 
faith and come up with a solution with the union that is fair and 
reasonable for both the union and the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the postal workers, I do not believe we will see 
anything different in the negotiations with the PSAC workers. 
As a result it will take all of us on this side of the House, and 
I intend to be part of it, to work with the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada and the farmers to get this country into shape 
so we do not have to suffer this financial harm.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long term, what can I say?  We hope that in the next 
election we can come up with a new government.  I am certainly 
looking forward to a Reform type government.  People like to 
comment about the united alternative, but we will certainly come 
up with a government to replace this government with one the 
general population of Canada wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the last of the speeches are made from the opposition side 
today, we will see the truth of this whole emergency debate come 
out.  We will see the truth of the legislation.  We will see 
whether there can be some amendments to include some final offer 
binding arbitration for the 70 grain weighers out on the west 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I say that this is a sad day. We have been left in 
the lurch by the Liberal government. Starting with the emergency 
debate the other night, we are finally seeing that something is 
being done.  It is not perfect but something is being done.  We 
will continue to push this government into doing not what it 
wants to do but what Canadians want it to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, and as its 
labour critic, on this special debate, but I share the 
government leader's distress in doing so.  There is good reason 
to be sad when we are required as legislators to introduce such 
a bill in the House, since it constitutes admission of a failure 
in the way our organizations and institutions operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of our labour relations are based on a relationship of power 
that is meant to be a fair one.  When we are forced to take 
steps such as those being taken today, it means something has 
gone wrong with that relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are dealing with is a legal strike, a strike by a 
legally recognized and constituted union.  It is part of the 
rules for the labour relations process that, when the workers' 
side considers that what has been offered is inadequate, they 
may strike. This is what we are dealing with at this time: a 
union that is legally using its right to strike and, by the very 
fact that it operates within the governmental system—because the 
government wears two different hats in a context such as this 
one, as employer and as legislator—is having forced upon it 
special legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, acting as both employer and legislator in this 
case as I said, wakes up one morning, supposedly exasperated 
after a few days of strike—at least as far as the people at 
Vancouver are concerned—and decides to take action, arguing that 
the services involved affect public health and safety, thus 
qualifying as essential services.  Measures are in place since 
public health and safety is an integral part of essential public 
services, and that was the rationale for taking this line of 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, the government is going overboard and is failing to 
demonstrate—and this is where it is not following procedure—the 
urgency of the situation, but one does sense a kind of 
exasperation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has, moreover, had its task made easier for it. 
I personally have a hard time figuring out the workings of the 
Reform Party, which set the table last Thursday by so eloquently 
dramatizing the situation in the port of Vancouver.  In my 
opinion, it considerably facilitated the government's action and 
this is why Friday and today we see the government acting 
entirely exceptionally by taking measures to impose special 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we ought to deal with matters one at a time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exceptional measure used here is the suspension of the 
debates on the order paper.  It is called a special debate.  We 
are talking about the motion that will enable the government to 
introduce special legislation, perhaps tomorrow.  That is what 
we must be discussing.  We will talk as eloquently as possible, 
except that the time frame as you know is very short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be said often enough.  It is an illegal strike.  It is 
a process recognized by the parties and by society.  We support 
bargaining and civilized balance.  This has been upset today. 
It is excessive on the part of the government, which happens to 
be the employer, to try to impose its own rules, its own way of 
seeing things, its own working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will discuss this into further detail later on, but we are 
convinced that it is still possible to negotiate in good faith, 
to restore a normal balance of power between the parties. Look 
at what happened at the two bargaining tables where there are 
now problems, that is table 2 and table 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of members of parliament and those listening to 
us, table 2 deals with labour relations between the government 
and general labour, ships' crews and trades represented by the 
Public Service Alliance of Canada, while table 4 is for Canada's 
correctional services employees, who are also members of the 
PSAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some progress had been made, albeit slowly at times, but at 
least to the point where, in the case of correctional services 
employees, an agreement had been proposed by a conciliator. That 
agreement was accepted by the union, but rejected by the 
employer. The parties could find a solution, provided they 
negotiate in good faith. This is where the attitude of the 
employer, the government, becomes a concern because, given that 
the conciliator's report had been approved by the union, there 
is already the basis for an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be premature and inappropriate for the government to take 
this kind of action today. It should have been a little more 
patient, a little more conciliatory. It should have tried to 
find a compromise, given that the union had committed itself, 
making it unnecessary to this kind of measure, which is always 
exceptional and sad. 
Only the government can get away with taking the sort of action 
it has taken today as an employer.  From the smallest company to 
the largest multinational, no organization except the government 
has the power to take the action being taken today of 
legislating heavy fines to force people back to work under 
conditions set by the employer, in this case the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for table 2 on general labour, ships' crews and so forth, the 
workers represented by this union are prepared to go the 
alternative route of arbitration, so desperate are they.  It is 
good for the government to see how its offers are perceived, if 
they are seen as being as reasonable as it claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion, and this is why we are opposed, all efforts have 
not been made to reach a negotiated settlement.  This is a 
serious matter.  Time is running out, and let us not forget that 
these people's salaries have been frozen for six years.  They 
have every reason to make demands, to make strong demands, given 
the rise in the cost of living, inflation, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken a very firm stand, and resorted to 
legislation to get its way.  That is how we see it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it is a matter of principle, that this is an illegal 
strike and that the government should honour the mechanisms 
currently being used.  Neither the negotiations nor this House 
should be upset with strategies built on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will summarize our position, which is clear.  We believe the 
freedom to unionize exists in Canada for employees and 
employers.  This freedom exists for the parties, and the option 
of calling a strike exists from the moment there are good 
reasons for doing so, and this is the case here.  It is part of 
a fair balance of power, except when the employer is also the 
government and is abusing its legislative power.  Special 
legislation must be used only as a last resort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has not been shown to be the case here in our opinion.  In 
the meantime, we want the government to return to the bargaining 
table with an offer acceptable to the workers and to resolve the 
problem democratically and in a civilized manner through 
negotiation.

the comments of the member for Selkirk—Interlake go by 
unchallenged.  He said that the truth would come out in the 
emergency debate last Thursday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On all the remarks by the member for Selkirk—Interlake about 
Bill C-19 being inadequate and that we need to amend it so that 
this sort of situation can never happen again, if people

they will find that all those remarks and recommendations were 
made by me, a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I was the only one during that emergency debate, not 
the Reformers, who proposed that we should have back to work 
legislation.  I was puzzled by the silence of members of the

When the motion by the government was put forward on Friday 
calling for back to work legislation they voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people wonder about what is happening here, all they have to 
do is check with the phone logs of the ridings of the Reform

</I></B></P><P align=left>Arbitrariness seems to be the rule and it is being supported 
through legislative means. This is very annoying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also tell you that the union's arguments in this 
respect were good ones. If the salaries paid to members of 
parliament were based, as is proposed for union workers, on the 
differences that exist between regions of Canada, people here 
would be very upset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government's position is defensible, but we would 
greatly appreciate it if the government showed more conviction 
than it has so far.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech by the 
member for Trois-Rivières.  I have the impression we are reliving 
events we have already lived through in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, we realize that when the federal government fails 
to accept its responsibilities fully, when it does not pursue 
negotiations fully or when it does not achieve the desired 
results in its negotiations, it is tempted to play employer 
government rather than just plain employer.  We see this in the 
current situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the representations made by the support employees, there are 
things that could be discussed at the bargaining table.  There 
are differences in salaries between provinces.  This is not an 
issue in which the government must remain closed to all 
negotiations. 
This is a situation in which there is a way to resolve such 
things at a bargaining table or to take an original approach to 
doing so, without necessarily coming down on the union and 
wielding a mandate like the one the government wants today, at a 
time that strikes me as— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you ask the Liberal member 
shouting on the other side to be quiet while I speak?  I would 
hope we could speak in this debate in a civilized and rational 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would have been a way to continue negotiations longer to 
come to a conclusion that would mean better labour relations. 
There is more involved than just the resolution of labour 
disputes.  We have to be able to live with the situation 
afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the comments of the member for Trois-Rivières on my 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly shows us one thing about this government.  It is 
very authoritarian when it comes to labour relations and 
anything related. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that is refusing to recognize the 
court decision on pay equity.  This is the government that uses 
discriminatory orphan clauses, as it did with Canada Post.  This 
is the government that last year refused to bring in clear 
antiscab legislation, when such legislation already exists and 
has been very useful in Quebec.  Here we have an example.  All 
it had to do was follow Quebec's lead, which, more often than 
not, is very good.  Last year, the government was not 
interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it does intervene in the labour market, as it did with 
employment insurance, this is the kind of government that 
discriminates shamefully against new arrivals by requiring them 
to have twice as many hours the first time or on coming back 
after <I>x</I> number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is more of the same.  It is part of this government's 
philosophy to be very arbitrary and authoritarian.  I hope that 
the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam will listen 
carefully and be more polite as the debate goes on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
seems like deja vu to me.  Here we go again with back to work 
legislation.  We went through it recently.  We probably heard 
many of the same debates.  I heard the same heckling, the same 
sort of protestation from the other side that it was in the best 
interest of Canada to order these people back to work.  It was 
somehow so essential to the well-being of the country that the 
government could trample all over the democratic rights of people 
to withhold their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is galling to those of us in our caucus.  We obviously do not 
approve of the movement to order back to work legislation in this 
matter.  We think it is offensive, which is the best word that 
comes to mind.  What is even more offensive is the fact that at 
the end of today I have no doubt the government House leader will 
stand and move closure on this debate.  The government is piling 
insult upon insult when it comes to the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that it will be the 50th time the government 
has introduced time allocation and closure.  It is icing on the 
cake to the government.  We are dealing with the subject of 
stripping away people's right to withhold their services and we 
will even strip away their right to have a debate about it in the 
House of Commons later today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about what this strike is all about, even before we 
get down to the terms of back to work legislation.  What 
triggered blue collar workers to strike was the regional pay 
issue, the fact that a carpenter working for the federal 
government makes one wage in Halifax and another wage in 
Vancouver doing the exact same job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are even more glaring examples where a truck driver would 
be crossing the Alberta border to drop off a trailer to be picked 
up by another driver on the other side who would be making $3 or 
$4 an hour more in wages even though they are both doing the same 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That had to end.  The workers were pushed and pushed.  They 
tried to negotiate their way out of it after bargaining year 
after year.  It was not possible.  They used the only weapon 
available to them, the strike weapon, the right to withhold their 
services to try to satisfy this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice in the package being rammed down people's throats today 
that there is some movement on the zones.  They are going down 
from 10 zones to 7 zones, but we should recognize the way the 
Liberals are doing it.  It is almost unbelievable.  Rather than 
harmonize in any kind of a common sense way they are merging the 
province of Saskatchewan and the province of Nova Scotia into 
one, Saskatlantic or something, because it will not cost them 
anything.   There is no sense.  There is no logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House how flawed is the package we have been 
presented with today.  The Liberals forgot Nunavut.  On April 1 
we will celebrate the creation of Nunavut and there are no rates 
of pay in Nunavut.  They left it out.  It was omitted.  Even 
people working outside Canada are listed in the rates of pay. The 
people working in Nunavut will have none of it.  It is crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I stood and asked a question earlier today I was saying 
this was a goofy package.  There are all kinds of inconsistencies 
and flaws.  Yet we will not be given a chance to give it the 
visitation it needs to review the clauses to try to correct some 
of these things because debate will be terminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be happy to point out some of the inconsistencies so 
that perhaps the Liberal government could correct some of them. 
One of the things that I pointed out is that correction officers 
are listed in schedule 2 of the bill.  Correction officers are 
not on strike.  Corrections officers do not have the right to 
strike.  They are designated an essential service, but as the 
minister pointed out 600 or 800 of them somehow slipped through 
the cracks.  In other words we are seeing exactly what we saw in 
the postal workers dispute.  The government is trying to slide 
this in.  It is trying to slip this in through the back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to work legislation is supposed to be about back to work. 
How can they order employees back to work if they are not on 
strike?  In other words, the government is trying to designate 
these corrections officers as an essential service without having 
the guts to come in through the front door and stand up to the 
test of honest debate on that subject.  They would rather do it 
by subterfuge and by stealth.  It is truly offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same that happened to the Canada Post Corporation 
Act.  They tried to slide the whole profitability issue in during 
back to work legislation.  They wanted to use Canada Post as a 
cash cow.  They wanted $200 million a year worth of revenue to 
come out of Canada Post, but they did not have the guts to come 
forward and introduce an amendment to the Canada Post Corporation 
Act.  No, they tried to slide it in under the carpet again with 
the back to work legislation. 
We caught that right away.  We did not have that bill more than 
five minutes before we noticed how sleazy that effort was.  We 
find it offensive from where we are.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us really look again at the trigger of the strike, what 
caused the impasse.  Certainly wages are part of it.  These 
people have not had a raise in pay in seven years.  They have not 
had a negotiated settlement in nine years.  It has been imposed 
settlements all the time.  Where is the right to free collective 
bargaining in this country if our own government, the major 
employer in the country, is always imposing settlements, 
legislated settlements like this one, year after year?  With no 
raise whatsoever for seven years, the union was asking for a 
pretty modest package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 12 when the talks broke down the union's position on 
the table was 2%, 2.75% and 2% with a 30 cent sweetener into the 
last two years.  That is not exactly catch-up money.  With the 
cost of living increases over that seven year period, union 
members are way behind.  They are not asking to make all that up. 
On March 12 the government was not that far apart.  The 
government's last offer to them was 2%, 2.5%, 2% and 1%, which 
is really not miles apart.  Why then would it want to provoke a 
strike that has had such devastating effect on prairie farmers 
and our commodity industry?  Why for the sake of a lousy 3% 
spread does it provoke a strike like this and cause the kind of 
rancour and disruption we have seen across this country?  Where 
is the logic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costing of this spread is $7.8 million.  I wonder what the 
total impact and the cost of the total impact to prairie farmers 
has been of shutting out the industry and the grain handling in 
this strike.  A little more than $7.8 million, I think.  This is 
what is really irritating about this strike.  We fully endorse 
and respect the right of workers to withhold their service.  It 
is the most peaceful way of handling an impasse.  In the old days 
things got rowdy.  Heads were split open.  Withholding services 
in a peaceful way is the most civilized way of trying to put 
pressure on the other party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes back to the ancient Greeks and <I>Lysistrata</I>. The 
women of Troy withheld their services from their husbands because 
they were tired of them going to war all the time.  They were 
walking around with little tents instead of togas.  That is the 
first reference we have to that kind of organized withholding of 
services.  It is a time honoured tradition.  We do it today 
because somebody has to recognize the historic imbalance in the 
power relationship between employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have enshrined it in our charter of rights, that 
is why the United Nations recognizes it, that is why it has 
become one of the hallmarks of a free democracy, a strong and 
democratic trade union movement with the right to organize, the 
right to bargain and yes, the right to withhold your services if 
you reach an impasse.  We have seen that trampled on twice since 
I have been here and I have not been here very long.  We have 
seen those rights trampled on. I did not come to Ottawa to vote 
away workers rights.  That is not why I came here.  I will not 
have anything to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the Reform Party as if it were somehow the 
champion of the working class all of a sudden.  This is 
particularly grating as a trade unionist.  Reformers would like 
to wipe unions off the face of the earth.  They have said so 
publicly.  It is no secret what they think of free collective 
bargaining and the trade union movement.  One Reform member is 
the only professional union buster I have ever met. It is 
honestly galling for us to listen to Reformers saying that they 
are on the side of the trade union movement.  They do not even 
take phone calls from unions.  They will not acknowledge or 
recognize organized labour.  Lobbyists from unions who come to 
the Hill are not welcome to come to their offices.  It is almost 
fraudulent for them to try to portray themselves as any kind of 
friend to the working class.  It is almost unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get down to politics since we are in the business of 
politics.  The irony of the whole thing is that the public sector 
votes Liberal. 
Public sector workers, by and large, support Liberals.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really have to question the logic of the Liberal government 
poking them in the eye with a stick and provoking this strike in 
the way that it has if it really hopes to forge any kind of 
relationship. Even if I were not a socialist and a trade 
unionist, as a taxpayer I do not want the morale of my public 
sector so demoralized that productivity does drop.  If we want to 
talk about the issue of productivity that we have heard so much 
of in the House lately, that is a productivity issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government does not give somebody a raise for seven or 
nine years and then keeps heaping more and more work on them 
because it used to take ten people to do a job but it has laid 
off half of them so the other five have to do the same work for 
less money, frozen wages, how does it hope to garner support from 
public sector workers by beating them up like this all the time? 
It is trampling on their rights.  Now they are being ordered back 
to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, with the corrections officer thing, the CX table 4 worker 
is confusing to me.  Not only do we have a case where they are 
not on strike, but they are being ordered back to work as a 
preventive measure or something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the package that we are having rammed down our throats 
unceremoniously in the next few days, the government does not 
even tell us what the settlement is to be.  It is completely 
silent on what the settlement is supposed to be for the 4,500 
corrections workers who are being lumped into this back to work 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform member for Selkirk—Interlake was talking yesterday 
about a pig in a poke.  We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke 
because we do not even know what the package is. Obviously we 
will vote against it.  Who in their right mind would vote for 
something when they do not even know what it looks like?  It is a 
huge leap of faith and I do not have that kind of trust in the 
members opposite to act on strictly faith that everything will be 
okay, we will treat everybody fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do government members not state up front what the terms and 
conditions will be for those employees?  Are they allowed to go 
back to the bargaining table and keep negotiating?  That is what 
was implied.  Negotiations are not really over for them. Why are 
they being legislated back to work and having the right to strike 
taken away?  Most prison guards do not have the right to strike 
as it is.  They were designated essential a long time ago.  This 
is to try to catch those 600 or 800 who have somehow slipped 
through the cracks. In other words, it has nothing to do with 
back to work legislation.  The government is trying to achieve 
some other, secondary objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is intellectual dishonesty to try to go through the back 
door.  We have seen examples of it.  It is not unlike the idea of 
taking a deduction off a person's paycheque to use it for a 
specific purpose and then to use it for something completely 
different. That is a breach of trust that borders on theft. I 
would never say the government is stealing from workers because I 
know that would be wrong.  It is certainly a breach of trust to 
deduct something for a specific purpose and to use it for 
something else again.  That is fundamentally wrong whether it is 
dishonest or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is along those lines.  This is misrepresentation.  It is 
subterfuge.  It is stealth.  It is trying to say this bill is 
about back to work legislation.  For 14,500 members of the Public 
Service Alliance of Canada it is about back to work legislation. 
The government is trampling on their right to withhold their 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other 4,500 must be as confused as I am.  The 4,500 prison 
guards must be mystified by this.  The government has taken away 
their right to strike and they are not even on strike. They do 
not strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The package we were given today is 530 pages of very detailed 
wage schedules with wage increases accurately itemized. These are 
the increases being imposed on these workers.  Nowhere does it 
say they are getting a 2% raise or they are getting a 2.75% 
raise.  It is up to us in the few short hours we have to try to 
get our pocket calculators out and figure out how much of an 
increase is this new wage schedule the government has listed. A 
bunch of us were calculating away.  I would think it was the hope 
of the government House leader and the minister for the Treasury 
Board that we would not be able to figure it out. Again, stealth 
and subterfuge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in a court of law one has to tell the other side what one 
is doing and what evidence one will present.  Here we were 
presented with 530 pages of evidence that we have to plough 
through and try to make some sense of, yet the government is 
asking us if we are willing to vote with it today and support 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost inconceivable.  I did not think I would see things 
like this when I came to Ottawa.  It is really quite an eye 
opener for me how this place really works.  It is disappointing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a trade unionist I went through a great number of issues like 
this.  We were never legislated back to work because I was in the 
private sector with the carpenters union.  We had the right at 
least in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess it is all the more reason for not going to work in the 
public sector.  The pay is lousy and the minister responsible for 
the Treasury Board will steal your pension and there is not even 
the right to strike when trying to improve the terms and 
conditions of employment or to elevate the standard of wages and 
working conditions.  How do working people advance their causes 
if they do not have the right to strike?  It is the only tool we 
have left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, this is the same government that has 
given us advance warning that in early or mid-April it will be 
introducing legislation so that it can get its hands on the 
public sector pension plan surplus, $30 billion.  That is its 
next big windfall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First it paid off the deficit on the backs of its own $10, $11 
and $12 an hour employees by freezing their wages.  It pays off 
its deficit there.  The only advantage for taking a public sector 
job used to be there was a reasonable pension plan.  That was 
always the excuse.  The wages are crappy and it is a thankless 
job but at least there was a decent pension plan.  Now it is 
targeting that, zooming in there. First it was the UIC program 
and now it is the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Honestly, this is probably the most uncomfortable situation I 
have been in since I have been in Ottawa just because the 
circumstances surrounding this bill are so nonsensical, so 
unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about pensions and wages, I was a private sector 
carpenter.  I made about $25 an hour.  It was good money.  The 
public sector carpenter makes $15.  Figure that out.  Still the 
government wants to contract work out instead of using its own 
forces.  It will contract it out to the private sector, often to 
immediate family or close personal friends.  It would rather pay 
$25 an hour than pay its own people $15 an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what led to a lot of the hard feelings and the animosity 
that led to an impasse in these negotiations.  It was that huge 
disparity between the public sector and the private sector in 
terms of wages.  How can it be explained?  Never mind the 
regional differences.  Those we have already dealt with, that it 
unfair for a carpenter to make $15 an hour in Halifax and $10 
elsewhere under the arbitrary zone system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there is any commitment to the concept of equal pay for work 
of equal value?  The prevailing wage in an area for a carpenter 
might be $25 an hour.  The federal government pays $15 and takes 
away the ability to elevate the standards of wages and working 
conditions by trampling on their right to withhold services.  It 
is added insult to injury.  How does a working person ever move 
forward without being able to exercise that one basic, 
fundamental right to withhold services for the sake of moving 
them and their family forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the most peaceful way to solve any kind of impasse.  It is 
not violent.  People look at it as economic violence.  It is not 
economic violence.  What gets foisted on workers is economic 
violence.  The threat of layoff is economic violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constant Damocles sword hanging over every public sector 
worker's head, that is economic violence, when people are 
threatened with their jobs every minute of every day.  A 
workplace that used to do a certain task with ten people is now 
asked to do it with five and then freeze their wages for seven to 
eight.  I doubt that many public sector workers feel very 
inclined to keep voting Liberal if that has been their practice. 
I doubt it very much because they have been poked in the eye with 
a stick one too many times, their rancour has been provoked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Watch next month when the government finally tries to get its 
hands on the surplus of the pension plan.  It will wake a 
sleeping giant.  It will regret the day this was even raised 
because they will rise up in a way they have never been seen 
before.  The government will regret it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the hon. member's remarks.  I have a 
great deal of respect for the member.  I understand his 
frustration as a man with considerable background in the trade 
union movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to correct a couple of comments he made at the 
beginning of his remarks.  He said, “The Reform Party would like 
to wipe unions off the face of the earth” and that it was almost 
fraudulent to claim that we had any support for unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member perhaps got a little carried away in 
hyperbole.  He may doubt the degree of commitment of my party to 
trade unions and collective bargaining, but in all sincerity, I 
would point out to the member that one of our basic principles as 
a party and as defined in our policy statement is that the Reform 
Party supports the right of workers to organize democratically, 
to bargain collectively and to strike peacefully.  We also 
support the harmonization of labour-management relations and 
reject the view that labour and management must constitute 
warring camps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, many of my own economic views are influenced by the 
social teachings of the Catholic church.  I have been heavily 
influenced by the encyclical letter <I>Rerum Novarum</I> on the 
dignity of human labour.  I understand and appreciate the right 
of workers to work together, to bargain collectively and the 
freedom to associate and the freedom to strike peacefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have had difficulty with the approach of the 
government on this issue. We would prefer to see final offer 
binding arbitration to the kind of destructive game we see being 
played here between the union and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on whether he sees that kind of 
final offer binding arbitration as a possible constructive 
alternative to the kind of adversarial relationship that is 
destructive to the interests of both the workers and, in this 
case, the farmers whose product is being held up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
because the issue of final offer selection has been raised as a 
possible solution for this impasse and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have quite a bit of close personal knowledge of final offer 
selection.  I have actually used it in my own negotiations. It 
was law in the province of Manitoba for a number of years.  It 
was chucked out by the Tories when they got in.  They thought it 
was weighted too much in favour of the union, which was not 
really true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing one really needs to know about final offer selection 
is that it is not very effective unless both parties stipulate 
themselves to it, that both parties are willing participants. In 
other words we cannot legislate final offer selection by telling 
them they are going to settle their impasse by final offer.  That 
puts a disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also very difficult to use final offer selection for 
complicated matters other than strictly monetary issues.  For 
instance, if rules of work or the organization of the workplace 
have some part in the impasse or the strike which is taking 
place, then it is very difficult because we cannot weigh apples 
to apples.  When one party is asking for a 5% raise and the other 
one wants the washroom moved closer to the lunch room, how do we 
compare those two and how does the arbitrator make a selection? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose it is Roger Maris dealing with his baseball team.  Final 
offer selection originated with pro ball.  If it is only about 
money and the company is offering $1 million and the player wants 
a $1.5 million, the arbitrator does not have that difficult a 
time.  Both parties then try to temper their demands with reason, 
one would hope, and get closer to the centre until they are not 
that far part so that there are no real losers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are my comments on final offer selection.  It has its 
place.  There is nothing precluding people from using it now if 
both parties stipulate themselves to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I fully 
understand the question.  The translation was a little 
questionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party's position is that it is fundamentally wrong.  We are 
always opposed to back to work legislation.  We are fundamentally 
opposed to taking away the rights of workers to withhold their 
services.  I believe the comments of my leader have been 
consistent with that party policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues my leader, representing the riding of Halifax, 
was most concerned with was the regional pay issue. Some public 
servants are paid differently based on where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems fundamentally wrong that skilled trades people doing 
exactly the same job but in two different parts of the country 
are paid differently. Members of parliament are not paid 
differently based on where they come from. Neither are members of 
the RCMP nor most civil servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only that group, the 14,500 blue collar workers, that 
suffers this inconsistency.  It can be as much as $3 an hour from 
one coast to the other. We are not talking high wages to begin 
with but we are talking about a spread of $3 or $4 an hour for 
the same job.  It is a pay equity issue, not dealing with gender 
this time but with geography.  It is fundamentally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How sloppily crafted was this back to work legislation? Looking 
at the zones, the government left out Nunavut.  How could we 
forget about Nunavut?  It is in the papers.  April 1 is the big 
day.  The legislation must have been thrown together at midnight 
in a coal mine or something with no lights on because there are 
glaring omissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the omissions is in the translation.  In the definition 
of common law spouse, the English language version talks about a 
relationship existing for a continuous period with the employee. 
It contemplates same sex.  In the French translation it says that 
the common law situation shall be a relationship between a man 
and a woman who have lived together for a certain length of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government forgot to update its own bill which we are being 
asked to pass.  On the basis of that omission alone, we should 
vote down this legislation because it is not consistent with the 
government's own policy to recognize same sex relationships when 
it comes to benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am quite interested in the comments by the hon. NDP 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that in western Canada the grain issue and work 
stoppages have been going on for the last 30 years.  I also run 
into a number of problems where workers are migrating from one 
part of the country to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am right, unemployment insurance is also discriminatory for 
some people who have worked in higher workfare areas such as B.C. 
and then have come to Manitoba and are unemployed. They are paid 
at a lower scale. There are a lot of inequities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I liked his comment on final offer selection arbitration.  We 
have talked to quite a few shippers in the last couple of years 
on transportation reform.  This type of arbitration works quite 
well in some instances in other sectors such as the coal 
industry.  There is some good in this. There should be enough 
common ground so that we can work toward the legislation and not 
have these interruptions any more.  That is what western farmers 
want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have had this 
matter raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we went through the amendments to Bill C-19, we did put in 
place some protection to make sure the grain would go through. 
Let us remember that is the Canada Labour Code. The workers who 
are at an impasse today are under the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act and therefore are not affected by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were really sincere about never having the 
flow of grain interrupted again by anybody, the simple solution 
would be to let those public servants be covered by the Canada 
Labour Code, not the Public Service Staff Relations Act.  This is 
exactly what they have been asking for for decades.  The Public 
Service Alliance of Canada wants to be under the Canada Labour 
Code.  We would not have any more grain problems because this 
would be covered under Bill C-19.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what I am about to say is very important.  It has a lot of 
importance in reference to western Canada, particularly in the 
grain industry.  We will deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphatically say that the blame here and this debate 
is happening today because of inactivity and inaction on behalf 
of the government of this country.  Treasury Board has had two 
years to resolve this issue.  Because of the inaction of Treasury 
Board and this government, members of PSAC table two were 
required to go on strike in order to get their message across to 
the President of the Treasury Board.  It is inexcusable that 
labour-management relations have dropped so low that in two years 
they could not get to the bargaining table and come up with a 
resolution to a labour issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak from experience.  I have had ample experience in dealing 
with numerous unions in a previous life.  I can also stand here 
today in front of the House and say that in all of the negotiated 
settlements we had, not once did we require a strike mandate to 
get a settlement.  Not once did we have our unions hit the bricks 
in order to get what they felt was a reasonable negotiated 
settlement from the corporation.  That speaks to good, honest, 
equitable, in good faith negotiations between labour and 
management.  That is something this government and the President 
of the Treasury Board do not understand, open honest negotiation, 
an honest negotiated settlement with their unions, in this case 
PSAC table two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about PSAC.  I stood in the House not that long ago 
when PSAC was still on strike.  It is still on strike today but 
perhaps not in the next couple of days.  I said in a statement 
that it is unconscionable to have a unionized group of 
individuals who have not had a wage increase for seven years. Not 
to give a wage increase to any labour organization for seven 
years speaks to disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1991 we have all gone through some very tough economic 
times over the last seven years.  There was a thing called the 
recession.  I am sure most members will remember the recession of 
1991-92.  It is pointed out to us regularly when we talk about 
how after 1992 the economy got spurred along by a number of very 
major initiatives that the government of the day put into place. 
However, I digress just a bit.  From that point on when those 
initiatives of that government were put into place, the economy 
did turn around.  We are seeing the fruits of our labour today 
because of those initiatives taken in 1991-92. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to PSAC's position.  Since 1991 it has not had an 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same circumstance faced us and we gave increases to our 
unions.  They may very well have been small increases. They were 
half of 1%, three-quarters of 1% on an annual basis. The reason 
we did that as an employer is so we would not have to worry seven 
years later about trying to catch up.  We did not have to worry 
seven years later about having a very disappointed and unhappy 
union that would go on strike.  We never had that because we were 
logical in the way we faced labour-management relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>PSAC table two has not had an increase for seven years.  Of 
course those workers frustrated.  We would be frustrated if we 
had not had a wage increase for seven years.  Members of the 
House gave raises to themselves.  Mr. Speaker, you, me and 
members in the House got salary increases.  We did it ourselves.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, members of this party said we would rather see wage 
increases go to the RCMP, to PSAC and to those government 
employees who have not had salary increases for seven years. 
When we ran for office we knew what we were going to be paid. 
Those people have families like we do and they have to make sure 
they keep pace with inflation.  They have not had it, but they 
should have a wage increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>PSAC went back to the table for 14 days.  On the last day the 
government decided that it would try to negotiate in good faith. 
Those negotiations lasted for three hours.  Then the government 
walked away from the table.  That is why we are here today, with 
a PSAC strike that is still ongoing and a government that is not 
prepared to negotiate honourably and fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, two years is a long time.  Fourteen days of 
negotiations with nothing happening is a long time.  The 
frustrations of PSAC came to a boiling point and it went on 
strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unions have certain rights in negotiated agreements.  PSAC has 
the right to strike.  PSAC has the right to remove its services 
from the government, the employer that is paying its members. The 
PSAC membership has taken that strike vote and it has taken that 
strike to the streets.  That is the right of PSAC and the unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to meet quite a number of PSAC members in 
my office over the weekend when I was in my riding.  They are 
like the rest of us.  They have families, they have jobs, they 
have lives, they have mortgages and they want to go back to work. 
They actually want to go back to work.  They would rather be 
working than not working and on strike.  However, they want a 
settlement which is fair and equitable.  I mention the strike 
vote because they have the right under their union agreement to 
take their services away from government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week when the grain weighers went on strike they impacted 
another industry, an industry that is very important to me and my 
constituency in western Canada, and to Canada in general.  In my 
opinion they crossed the line.  They went too far.  When I met 
with these people I mentioned that.  I told them that I spoke on 
their behalf, that I believed the government and the President of 
the Treasury Board had not done what they were elected to do and 
that they had been negligent in their duties.  But when these 
people took their services away and impacted the agricultural 
industry, they stepped over the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are well aware, the agricultural industry is in 
difficult straits.  We have problems in trade relations with our 
major trading partners, the United States and Japan.  We have 
problems with commodity prices worldwide.  Western Canadian 
producers are getting the lowest commodity price they have had in 
generations.  There is difficulty in the farming economy to the 
point where the government has put together the AIDA program, an 
aid program to give farmers the opportunity to plant their crops 
again this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that there are serious implications when the trade 
of that agricultural commodity is impacted.  I told the PSAC 
members that, unfortunately, this could not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very fortunate last month to travel with the agriculture 
committee to Washington.  I was very fortunate this month to 
travel with the minister of agriculture to Japan. Two issues were 
always being put on the table by our major partners.  The United 
States of America is our major trading partner and Japan is our 
second largest trading partner in agriculture.  In both cases our 
trading partners told us that they would trade with us if and 
only if we could guarantee delivery of our product in a reliable 
fashion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember what I just said.  There are problems in the world with 
commodity prices.  There are problems in the world with a number 
of other countries producing the product that we would like to 
sell to the open market.  There is a lot of competition out 
there.  We have good customers who depend on us.  They depend on 
the delivery of that product.  The delivery of that product has 
been impacted by the PSAC strike.  That cannot be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best solution is not back to work legislation.  The best 
solution is not to force people to do something they do not want 
to do.  The best solution is to get the President of the Treasury 
Board back to the bargaining table, to sit down and negotiate a 
fair settlement with that organization, which in fact should be 
dealt with in a similar fashion as other members of that 
organization were dealt with previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not asking for anything totally out of the ordinary. 
They are asking for fair compensation.   That is all they are 
asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that they should not to be forced back to work.  We will 
debate this legislation that is before us right now, the back to 
work legislation.  However, I cannot in good conscience suggest 
that farmers in western Canada will be able to take this on the 
chin, a third party which has absolutely no opportunity of 
getting its grain moved without PSAC going back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is something we would like to talk about.  As I said 
earlier, this motion should never have been introduced.  This 
should never have been an issue.  It should never have been a 
problem.  I again must repeat myself and say that I hold this 
government totally to blame for not solving this problem before 
it got here.  The government had two years to solve the problem. 
It should never have come to the floor of this House.  Now it is 
here.  We will have to make sure that grain exports, grain 
handling and grain transportation are not impacted by this group 
of individuals in PSAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my closing remarks to the union people whom I met with this 
weekend I told them quite emphatically that we cannot stand for 
what they are doing and how they are impacting grain.  We will 
have to consider supporting back to work legislation if they are 
not able to get back to the bargaining table or back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed that we have to be here today to speak on 
this issue.  I will hopefully have an opportunity when we debate 
the legislation within the next day or two to explain why it is 
totally unfair that this government has not been able to come up 
with a negotiated settlement with this particular table of PSAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be more than happy to answer questions.  I wish the 
motion would come forward quickly so that we could debate it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with intent to my 
colleague from the Conservative Party.  It almost sounds like he 
wants to have it both ways.  However, I do agree with him on the 
fact that the government of the day is responsible for the 
current impasse.  He is absolutely correct when he says that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason we are having this debate today is that when the 
back to work legislation was presented by the minister the NDP 
and the Bloc stood to force it.  The Conservatives, Reform 
members and the Liberals all sat down.  That is the reason we are 
having this debate.  But that is another story and in my speech I 
will talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member from Manitoba is this.  I am sure the 
hon. member is fully aware of the Liberal broken promise on 
regional rates of pay.  He is sitting next to the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who has briefed him on the 
regional rates of pay issue and the fact that the Liberals broke 
their promise on it.  If they broke the promise they made in 
1993, what makes him or his party think that this government has 
any credibility when it comes to fair bargaining with PSAC 
workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is my understanding that my colleague is not in fact the 
member for all of Manitoba.  Although I understand that he has 
aspirations in that direction, he is actually the member for 
Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sure the hon. 
member for Brandon—Souris is very disappointed to hear of his 
new abridged responsibilities, but we will give him a chance to 
work up to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for, I suspect, some ambitions that I may have, although I was 
not aware of them.  Maybe he could tell me where he has been 
getting these particular pieces of information.  However, things 
are strange in this world of politics, so one never knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the member for Brandon—Souris and I accept that there are 
members from Manitoba who represent other ridings, perhaps not as 
well as Conservative members in Manitoba, but they do represent 
them all the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to answer the question from the hon. member of the 
NDP.  As he is probably aware, with respect to zones or regional 
rates of pay, an offer was placed on the table by Treasury Board. 
As I understand it, PSAC table two has even agreed to a massaging 
of the zones at the present time from ten zones to seven zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to his other comments about breaking our promises, I would 
suspect that we have not broken as many promises as the Liberals 
have broken.  We can talk about the GST, the NAFTA, the EH-101, 
Pearson airport and a lot of other things, but we do not break 
our promises.  We negotiate honourably and sensibly and try to 
make it as best we can for labour-management relations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad that the hon. member for Brandon—Souris has 
seen through some of the Machiavellian aspects of this piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never, since I came to parliament, encountered a 
situation like this, where we have a national emergency of 70 
people tying up the entire western agricultural economy. 
Everyone on this side wants to see that ended, as I am sure even 
hon. members from the party to my right would like to see that 
particular disruption ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this government do?  It brings in this bloody piece of 
garbage that is going to take away the right to bargain by all— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We have spoken about this with respect to the Reform Party 
before.  Intemperate language is not appropriate.  There are 
children watching this program.  I heard words from that member's 
mouth.  I think this is the third time in a week that the Reform 
Party has been using language of this type and it is not 
appropriate when across the country children are watching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The point of the 
government House leader is certainly well made.  I will invite 
the hon. member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands to continue his 
dissertation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought I was being 
rather temperate under the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has brought in a bill which is going to directly 
affect thousands of workers who have absolutely nothing to do 
with the emergency at hand and nothing to do with the problem 
which we are going to have to resolve.  In effect, it is probably 
going to force a lot of people who would not otherwise want to do 
so to vote to relieve people of their bargaining rights to solve 
a problem in one corner of the labour movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is absurd.  It is wrong.  It is mean and it is 
Machiavellian.  That is the only way I can describe it.  I hope 
the hon. member for Brandon—Souris really had that in mind.  I 
think that is what I got out of his speech.  I would like him to 
confirm that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is true 
to a point.  There is no question that this is a huge hammer to 
use to try to resolve a problem that could be resolved in a 
better and more honourable fashion if the assurances were there 
that the grain would be moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that farmers are being used as the badminton bird 
in this game between management and labour.  Do not use my 
farmers as that badminton bird or that pawn.  If we make sure 
that the grain can be moved, then I would be very happy to 
continue with the negotiating process that has now been put on 
the table by treasury and the union. 
It is a terrible sledgehammer to use back to work legislation 
right now in order to resolve this problem.

are very upset that they will be taken out of the bargaining 
process for no reason other than the government wanting to 
wholesale everybody back to work.  They think it is ridiculous. I 
feel for them.  In fact, they have many concerns that I would 
personally support as a Reform Party member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the thoughts of the member for Brandon—Souris on why 
the government would not have brought in final offer selection 
long ago to prevent these strikes or lockouts from ever happening 
in the first place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  To try to understand the logic of the 
government is impossible.  To ask me how I think the government 
thinks, it is impossible for me to get to that level.  I am sorry 
but I cannot answer that question.  At some point in time when a 
member of the government stands to speak perhaps the question 
would be better directed to him or her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still go back to my original comment.  I cannot believe that a 
negotiated settlement could not be achieved in two years of 
negotiating.  That shot my wildest dreams.  I do not know why the 
Liberals would not go to binding arbitration.  I know that the 
union has put that on the table before and they have not taken 
binding arbitration.  I do not know why it was not extended in 
Bill C-19 so that grain would not be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize this is the pawn.  We recognize the unions will use 
it.  Let us be fair about it.  They will use anything they 
possibly can to get the attention of a government that is not 
prepared to sit down and negotiate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to debate the motion introduced by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heavy handedness of the government goes beyond the pale in 
the way it thinks it can use its majority to impose its will not 
only in the House but right across the land.  The motion 
introduced reads in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, notwithstanding any Standing Order or usual practice of 
this House, the bill standing in the name of the President of the 
Treasury Board, entitled an act to provide for the resumption and 
continuation of government services, shall be disposed of as 
follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. Commencing when the said bill is read a first time and 
concluding when the said bill is read a third time, the House 
shall not adjourn— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted us to give our consent, even before they had tabled 
the legislation, to rush the bill through first reading, second 
reading, third reading, hold our nose and presumably vote for it 
too without even having the courtesy of giving us the bill to 
tell us what they intended to do with the legislation.  That type 
of attitude in this place cannot be tolerated and that is why the 
Reform Party says the government is very heavy handed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can think of other types of legislation that have been 
brought into the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the hepatitis C debate we have had in the House 
wherein we talked about providing compassion and compensation for 
people who were infected with tainted blood.  I have some people 
in my own riding, whom I know personally, that were tainted with 
hepatitis C.  The member for Macleod is a physician and critic 
for the Reform Party on health matters.  He has stated in the 
House many times that the government has an obligation to 
compensate these people because the Red Cross and those 
administering blood products were quite aware of the dangers in 
blood back in 1984 and before then.  They had the capacity to 
test it and did nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government absolved itself of the responsibility.  How did 
it do that?  The Prime Minister cracked the whip and told 
everybody to get in line and support the legislation.  Now it has 
taken it one step further.  Now it is asking us to support the 
legislation before we even see the legislation.  Surely that is 
too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Do you know about grain handling? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  The government member is asking if we 
know about grain handlers on this side.  Maybe they do not over 
there, but we know that farmers are hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We commend the minister of agriculture because he brought in a 
package to help farmers in serious trouble.  As we know, 
commodity prices have gone through the floor.  When it comes to 
hog production, the faster farmers produce hogs the faster they 
lose money because the price of a hog is below the cost of 
production.  Farmers are absolutely suffering a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy people on the west coast who, because of the job they do 
weighing grain as it ends up at the coast, have been able to put 
a strangle hold on the prairie farm economy by stopping the 
movement of grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is late March.  A month from now farmers on the prairies will 
be wanting to be out in their fields to get this year's crop in. 
If last year's crop does not work, there is always next year. 
Farmers are always hoping for next year, and next year is just 
around the corner.  They will have to pay for more grain, 
fertilizer, fuel and soon thereafter the cost of spraying that 
grain crop.  These things are just over the horizon for farmers, 
and 70 people on the west coast have put a strangle hold on the 
entire farming economy on the prairies at the very time they need 
it most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cash is no good for them in late May.  They need it to buy 
the seed that has to go in the ground in the springtime, not 
later.  The seed cannot be put in any later.  It has to be 
planted in the spring or it does not grow.  It is that simple. We 
all know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the most opportune time to put the squeeze on the 
government.  That is one of the reasons we as Reformers feel the 
motion deserves serious consideration.  There is an emergency and 
that is why we feel the motion deserves serious consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean to say that we like it.  That does not mean 
to say that we like the way the government has introduced it.  It 
has had opportunities to negotiate in good faith.  It knows these 
contracts expire.  There are five different tables of ongoing 
negotiations with PSAC.  There are these different unions and 
they all expire at different times.  The governments knows that 
ahead of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of computer specialists.  They have a contract that 
expires at the end of April.  That is only six weeks from now. 
This year we have the Y2K problem coming up. If we do not get the 
Y2K problem fixed before January 1, 2000, we will have a problem. 
The government knew that years ago.  Yet it negotiated a contract 
with computer technicians that will expire on April 30, 1999, 
knowing full well that they have the potential to move into a 
strike position if they cannot get what they want before the year 
2000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see a few months from now standing here again talking 
about back to work legislation for computer programmers because 
government negotiated a contract that expired on April 30, 1999 
rather than on April 30, 2000.  It does not take a rocket 
scientist to understand that we have given computer technicians a 
stranglehold on government operations by saying that if they go 
on strike the government will not be ready for January 1, 2000. 
If it is not ready by January 1, 2000, it is all going to shut 
down.  That is incompetence by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are talking about when we debate back to work 
legislation.  If the government were to negotiate in good faith 
as an employer being able to offer a proper compensation package 
and the union had an understanding of its obligation to society, 
I am sure they could have come to an agreement before now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let look at the labour relations with the government.  First it 
legislates no pay increases for six years.  Then when it says 
they can have a pay increase it is only what it is prepared to 
give because they will not have the right to binding arbitration. 
It wonders why they are concerned when treated as something that 
can be legislated out of existence or legislated back to work any 
time the government wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Bill C-76 was introduced.  We are only talking about 70 
grain weighers in Vancouver, but the legislation wraps up the 
14,000 people in the general labour and trade services, hospital 
services, fire fighters, heating and power, ship crews, 
lighthouse keepers, general services and grain weighers.  I do 
not think these other people are on strike, but they will get 
wrapped up in the back to work legislation before they even go on 
strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heavy handed government is not bothering to wait for them to 
go on strike.  It expects they will because the relationship is 
so bad.  Therefore it will not wait.  It does it now by wrapping 
it up in one piece of legislation to get the job done.  That is 
not right.  It cannot be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants a good relationship with its employees, 
how can it justify legislating 14,000 people back to work before 
they go on strike, before they even say they are going on strike, 
before they have even indicated they are going on strike? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I explained there are 70 people and we feel 70 people should 
not have the right and the responsibility to hold up the entire 
farm economy on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been all kinds of debates in the House about the 
wheat board, how it manipulates farm prices and how it should 
have and could have provided better incomes to farmers.  Finally 
the government has opened the board a bit but not very much.  We 
need to make sure the board is a lot more accountable to farmers. 
The government is stonewalling on that.  The whole message of the 
government is stonewall, ignore, disregard.  Then when people 
rise up and say “you are trampling on my democratic rights and I 
want to push you around”, the government legislates them out of 
existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therein is the problem.  We have 70 people on strike and we want 
to do something for farmers.  We want to ensure that they cannot 
hold these people to ransom.  Yet the government takes 14,000 
people and wraps them up in the same argument. 
We cannot deal with that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on and on, whether it concerns hepatitis C, 
legislating that people cannot have a raise or the farmers.  The 
government does not recognize and respect the democratic rights 
of very many people.  The only thing it respects is the Prime 
Minister's whip, who says “You will vote the way we tell you”. 
And when they vote the way they are told, the government gets 
what it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we will debate this issue as much as we can.  Our 
hearts are with the people of this country.  Our number one 
concern is for the people of this country, the taxpayers of this 
country, the people who built this country, the people who opened 
up the prairies and who make a livelihood as best they can, 
sometimes under very difficult conditions.   I do not think the 
hundreds of thousands of people in the prairies deserve to have 
their livelihoods and their lifestyles held for ransom by 70 
people.  We oppose that.  We are glad the government is doing 
something about it, but we are mightily upset that it has wrapped 
the rest of the people in at the same time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question is quite simple.  The 
member is correct that this government has faltered quite 
seriously in its negotiation processes with the unions.  However, 
I should remind the hon. member that it is more than just 70 
members on the west coast who are on strike.  Blue collar workers 
on the Atlantic coast are also staging rotating strikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made mention of these 70 people having a stranglehold 
on the Canadian economy.  He makes it sound as if that is what 
these 70 members want to do.  They want to go out on strike. 
They want to lose pay.  They want to suffer through possible 
mortgage loss or possible car payment loss.  Do people go through 
school, get educated and get a job so they can go on strike and 
put a stranglehold on the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should remind the hon. member that this is not what they want 
to do.  What they want to do, and I am sure the hon. member knows 
this, is to bargain in a fair collective bargaining process.  If 
that fails, then a third party should become involved, an 
arbitrator, whose ruling would constitute binding arbitration, 
which would be the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has legislated away binding arbitration.  This 
government also has not, even with the adjustment of the ten down 
to seven zones, gotten away with regional rates of pay.  The 
personal love of the President of the Treasury Board is to have 
different pay scales across the country for the same work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member from the Reform Party does not believe 
that these 70 members on the west coast and the strikers on the 
east coast love to go on strike.  I can assure the member that 
they do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously the member was 
not listening to my speech when I went into great lengths about 
how the government denied them a pay raise for six years and 
denied them the right to bargain, and that it had the right to 
impose a settlement rather than binding arbitration.  The 
democratic rights of many people have been taken away, including 
the people who work for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, if it wants to have a good working relationship 
with its employees, should bargain in good faith, rather than 
allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where we are now 
legislating them back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that these 70 people want to have a stranglehold on 
the economy, but the point is that they do.  They do have a 
stranglehold on the economy.  By virtue of the fact that those 70 
people have gone on strike hundreds of thousands of people have 
had their livelihoods affected.  Those hundreds of thousands of 
people have absolutely nothing to do with the dispute.  They have 
no input in the debate.  They are the ones who are greatly at 
risk.  That is why we have to think seriously about helping them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one 
of the strangest and oddest things about this back to work 
legislation has been the fact that the correction officers, who 
are being lumped into the back to work legislation, are not on 
strike. 
They are being ordered back to work even though they are not on 
strike.  When the President of the Treasury Board was asked about 
that oddity, that strange set of circumstances, his reaction was 
that corrections officers are designated essential so they cannot 
strike.  We all knew that, but there are 600 or 800 of them who 
somehow slipped through the cracks.  The government is using this 
back to work legislation to plug that hole, to patch up that 
anomaly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member think about trying to use back to work 
legislation as a vehicle to slide under the table or to sneak in 
other things which are not even related, which are completely 
secondary objectives?  My personal feeling is, if the government 
wanted to designate these other workers as being essential, why 
did it not come in through the front door and do it honestly so 
we could have an open debate?  It should not try to sneak it in 
under the table.  I would ask the member to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is right.  It is the 
arrogance of this government which is denying people their 
democratic right, which was the general theme of my speech.  It 
does not matter who it is.  The House of Commons has the 
democratic right to challenge and hold the government 
accountable, but it rams through its legislation because the 
Prime Minister says that what he wants he gets.  That type of 
attitude has to be stopped.  The member is absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His question was:  How can we have back to work legislation for 
people who have not gone on strike?  If the government says it 
made a mistake and they were not designated as being essential, 
is that a problem for this side of the House?  No, it is a 
problem over there, but the government is trying to co-opt us 
into fixing its mistakes.  That is not our responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our responsibility is to stand for the democratic rights of 
ourselves and others in this country.  We all agree that these 
people have the democratic right to strike and to bargain freely, 
yet this government, through all the things it has done over the 
years, has not shown a great deal of good faith in dealing with 
its workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are today having to deal with an issue in which the 
government and its employees are at a deadlock and people who 
have no control of the situation, who have no influence, are 
being held for ransom.  That is the issue that we have to deal 
with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
remember sitting in the House shortly after many of us were newly 
elected in 1993.  I believe it was in the winter of 1994 when the 
government brought down its first back to work legislation on a 
strike which affected grain handlers and transportation workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wetaskiwin stood to ask the government if it 
would take action so that this would not happen again.  Here we 
are, five years later, and we are still doing the same old thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has abdicated its responsibility to a lot of 
people.  It has abdicated its responsibility to the victims of 
strikes and lockouts, in this case farmers and the farm economy. 
It also has abdicated its responsibility to other groups.  We 
have talked about corrections workers, for whom I happen to have 
a soft spot in my heart.  Also, there are people whom I have just 
talked to in my riding at Dundurn who have some very serious 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has abdicated its responsibility.  It has done 
nothing in five years to change this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sure you have heard of the rock group “Hootie 
and the Blowfish”.  I am not sure which one Hootie is over 
there, but I can hear the blowfish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my hon. colleague from St. Albert if he remembers 
the day when the government promised it would take action.  Does 
the hon. member remember the day when the government said it 
would take action, five years ago, so that these kinds of things 
would not happen again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remember the day well, 
but then of course promises are easy to come by from that side of 
the House because they will promise anything and they seldom 
deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just talked about the fact that the correctional services 
people are potentially going to go on strike, but they will be 
legislated back to work before they go on strike.  I have not 
figured that one out yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we dealing with the firefighters?  I was not even aware 
they were talking about going on strike.  Then we have the 
heating and power workers, ship crews and lighthouse keepers. 
I know they have a problem.  As we have automated the lighthouses 
we have put them right out of business, completely and forever. 
We had to fight that on the west coast to try to maintain safety 
and to ensure that the people who travel up and down the coast do 
not run aground.  As well, there are the general service workers. 
These are the people who have been wrapped up in this draconian 
piece of legislation.

promises.  The only thing the government did was balance the 
budget on the backs of taxpayers as it hiked revenues by 25%. 
The government did not tell us that it was going to hike revenues 
by 25% to balance the budget.  It may get small credit for that, 
but it is now manipulating the numbers to try to ensure that we 
pay more taxes and we do not get the services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the millennium scholarship fund.  The taxpayers have 
put $2.5 billion in the bank and there will be no benefit to

spent on health care until next year.

it does not work out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a sad 
occurrence to again find the House of Commons involved in back 
to work legislation with a special bill entitled an act to 
provide for the resumption and continuation of government 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is also the subject of time allocation, so that there 
cannot even be any serious debate on the issue of this abruptly 
interrupted negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have a great many questions. 
It seems to me, of what I know—and in the past I dealt with 
labour relations, I taught labour relations—that what cannot be 
regulated does not justify the bill as it is presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the workers are on a legal strike.  Not only 
are they on a legal strike, they are on a rotating strike.  This 
is not a full general strike that will go on forever.  It is a 
rotating strike, action taken by the workers in turn before the 
workday starts or after it finishes to get themselves talked 
about and of course to slow traffic.  If they did not get 
themselves talked about, if they do not hold a full general 
strike, how do we know there is a problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem that strikes me as a fairly serious one. The 
problem, it must be repeated, is the fact that these workers 
have contributed their share to the deficit reduction.  They 
have not had an increase in six years.  Their collective 
agreement expired two years ago, or a little less.  Some expired 
in June 1997, some in April 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are these highly paid workers?  No.  They can easily have 25 
years' seniority and be earning $30,000.  They are fathers and 
mothers.  These are not people about whom we can say “These 
government workers are choking the public”.  No.  For the most 
part, they are blue collar workers, with positions of 
responsibility.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of them, such as those who were with national defence and 
were relocated, may have ended up in a region where the salary 
is lower than in their original region. It must be pointed out 
that, not only have these workers not received any increase for 
six years, but—and, as far as I know, they are the only public 
servants in that situation—they are not paid the same salary in 
all regions, unlike members of parliament or judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The further west they are, the higher their salaries. 
Conversely, the further east they work, the lower their 
salaries. The gap can be as much as $3 per hour. 
So, since many of them are paid about $14 per hour, an hourly 
difference of $3 is very significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The workers who come under the Public Service Employment Act 
would like to be covered by the Canada Labour Code. Why? Because 
the rules concerning essential services are not the same. What 
is the problem in this House? It is that these workers, by using 
their legal right to go on strike, do not have to provide the 
essential services they are expected to provide. But do members 
realize that the Public Service Employment Act does not include 
the type of provisions on negotiating and providing essential 
services that were recently included in the Canada Labour Code? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such provisions on essential services did not exist when railway 
workers went on strike, but now they do. But they do not apply 
in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very serious concern is that, for these negotiations, 
the government has suspended these workers' right to 
arbitration.  Not all workers in our society have the right to 
binding arbitration, but those in the public service do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was this right suspended?  The fact that these workers, who 
perform duties that can be compared to others, have not had an 
increase for six years, may well explain why the federal 
government thought it best to prevent them from going to 
arbitration.  Why?  Because they would have been wrong?  Hardly. 
Why then? Because, on the contrary, arbitration would have 
given the workers much larger increases than what they were 
offered and than the offer that in one case was actually lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble seeing any goodwill in the federal government's 
actions, all the more so when I read Bill C-76, an act to provide 
for the resumption and continuation of government services.  The 
operational services group includes firefighters, national 
defence and coast guard workers, and so on.  What I see in the 
collective agreement section leaves me enraged on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiating a collective agreement is important for workers who 
are not entitled to arbitration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this bill have to say?  Under “Collective Agreements”, 
clause 7 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor in Council may, on the recommendation of the 
Treasury Board, and taking into account collective agreements 
entered into by the employer in respect of bargaining units in 
the Public Service since the Public Sector Compensation Act 
ceased to apply  to compensation plans applicable to them— 
</UL>
<Thus, the government may, having examined the situation, may: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—prescribe: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the terms and conditions of employment applicable to the 
employees: and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) the period during which those terms and conditions of 
employment are applicable. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the government has not negotiated seriously 
and has refused mandatory arbitration, and now says 
“Well then, the governor in council, very familiar with the good 
of the people, will be the one to decide”.  One might well term 
this “in lieu of a collective agreement”  But no, it states “the 
collective agreement”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor in Council may provide that any of the terms and 
conditions of employment is effective and binding on a day 
before or after the beginning of the period prescribed— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there we have it, the governor in council knows what is good 
for the people. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terms of employment prescribed under paragraph (1)(<I>a</I>) 
constitute a single collective agreement binding on the 
bargaining units composed of the employees referred to in that 
paragraph. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing goes for correctional services.  In the 
correctional services negotiations, union members obtained a 
majority report.  Who was the minority?  The government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not comply with the majority report?  It 
empowers itself to act otherwise than its own law tells it to. 
It gives itself the means to go against a process that is not 
only legitimate, but legal as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> The truth hurts, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards table 2, those providing support or operating 
services, there was no majority report, because there are three 
different positions.  There was no real bargaining.  The spirit 
in these reports and in these facts is not a spirit conducive to 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are balances of power in the public sector and in the 
private sector.  They must exist, in fact, because, if one party 
completely dominates the other in negotiations, the results will 
never be fair.  That occurs in private life.  That occurs among 
people.  There must be a balance somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These workers took the means at their disposal, not illegal, but 
legal means. 
They did not take them excessively, even if a full general 
strike is not excessive, but in this case they did not go out on 
a general strike.  It is a rotating strike.  They used the means 
at their disposal under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This then is why we have this bill, with a time limit.  It is a 
total shame for this House, for which this is definitely not a 
first, for this House, which has seen the arrogance of this 
government in other matters, arrogance often in dealings with 
the provinces. 
This is the approach where the government says it knows what is 
good for others and it does it in their stead or, to coin a 
phrase, it knows what is ours and makes sure it will get it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best additional proof is that the hands of the government in 
this matter are not clean.  It is including in the bill workers 
who have announced they would strike, that is, the federal 
corrections officers.  That is something.  Here we have a bill 
allegedly to correct something excessive, which makes no sense 
because, as I said earlier, this is a legal strike, but some 
people are not yet on strike and are being forced to go back to 
work before they have struck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is affected by this way of doing things is the bargaining 
process itself. But, more importantly, it is the relationship 
between the state, which is the employer, and its workers, to 
whom it is sending a message of contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government thinks this is the way to get the loyalty 
and services to which citizens are entitled. It did not look any 
further than its nose. The workers appear to want justice, since 
they have not had a raise in six years and some of them are paid 
based on the region where they work, which is not the case for 
other people around them. These workers are at their wits' end. 
They are resorting to legal means, not in an excessive fashion, 
and yet they are being forced to go back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is poor judgment on the government's part and it does not 
augur well for the years to come. 
I used to teach labour relations. Experts know that when there 
is real and deep dissatisfaction, it is always better that 
workers not necessarily always get everything they want, but 
that there be a negotiated settlement. Otherwise, they will not 
feel any incentive to work, to be helpful. This is true both in 
the private and the public sectors. Nowadays, the government can 
do better than this mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I deeply regret that we are being put in this situation, 
since everything tends to give workers the impression that they 
are not being treated fairly, far from it, and that in fact the 
government only has contempt for them.

Quebec.  I agree with a lot of her comments about getting 
fairness and equality and about the arrogance of this Liberal 
government in dealing with some of these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the west as farmers have known this for over three 
decades.  In early 1970 when western farmers asked the prime 
minister of that day to help them market some of their wheat, 
they got the finger.  That was how much the Liberals cared for 
agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what my hon. colleague would say to the farmers who 
have been continually losing through these strikes by paying huge 
demurrage charges and by losing sales.  This year especially, 
when they already have an income crisis, they will be asked to 
bear again all these extra costs.  They have no recourse; they 
are helpless.  They have to accept these losses and they have no 
way to reclaim them by pricing their product higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the answer be to help these farmers because of the 
losses they have had to bear time and time again because of the 
arrogant government's attitude toward western grain farmers? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> I will begin by recalling the rail 
strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something I remember very clearly, because I was 
opposition critic at the time.  I remember that we did not have 
an easy time of it with western members.  But what did we say 
back then?  We said that the labour code was there for these 
workers.  I said: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“If the Canadian economy cannot afford the Canadian Labour Code 
then change it”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened was that the code was changed. As far as I know, 
workers were in agreement with these provisions.  There was 
agreement on the essential services provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this public service legislation is that it does 
not have the same provisions.  I do not know exactly why these 
people are unhappy.  We are told that 70 workers are involved. 
One thing is certain and that is that they cannot strike without 
substantial support.  I wonder if the reason for this support is 
not precisely because they have been without increases for a 
long time, on top of the cost of living in the west, the 
flourishing businesses and so on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was discontent, as there was a few years ago, I would 
imagine that ways would have been found to make their strike 
less frequent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly not by taking the sort of action now being taken 
that the problem will be resolved for the next time around.  It 
will only come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And that says nothing about how people who think they have been 
forced back to work unfairly will feel. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for Mercier on her 
presentation. I believe government members would be well advised 
to read it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It contained many references to the fact that the government 
does not seem to learn from its past mistakes. She mentioned the 
rail strike. Indeed it had several elements in common with the 
special back to work legislation the government wants us to 
debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, the stakes, the differences between the negotiating 
parties, the contentious issues are not as important as the ones 
in the rail strike. 
Are we not talking about a government that dilly-dallied during 
the negotiations? It chose this approach because of its power 
relationship with support staff, employees who are making 
demands. As a former personnel manager, I can say that the issue 
of regional pay scale, the fact that salaries vary from one 
province to another or from one economic region to another, 
should not be hard to settle at the negotiating table. I find it 
amazing that the government has not succeeded in settling this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I wonder if the chickens are not coming home to roost. 
For too long the federal government has ignored problems of its 
own doing, and now it wants to make its employees pay for its 
ineffectiveness as a government. This is an age-old trick: divide 
to conquer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that this is hurting farmers and people who are 
not receiving their income tax returns. Why, then, should we let 
those workers exercise their right to strike? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, I believe the government should have anticipated 
what is happening. If those workers are so important and 
significant to the government, did they not deserve to be better 
listened to at the bargaining table? At the end of the day, they 
would have come out with a negotiated collective agreement and 
adequate labour relations for several years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's 
question, which already contains elements of answer. It is 
actually quite legitimate to ask why the federal government did 
not foresee the present situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should ask the question differently. Maybe the 
government foresaw the strike and still wanted to impose a 
settlement, which will not solve the problems in any case. I 
think the answer is already contained in the question. Had the 
government understood the importance of the issue, it would have 
been careful to bargain seriously with those workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, it is true that the government finds itself in the 
present situation because the Public Service Staff Relations Act 
does not provide anything for essential services. 
The government finds itself in a situation similar to the one it 
found itself in during the private sector strike, when the 
Canada Labour Code did not contain the provisions it now does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the government only has itself to blame, because it sets the 
legislative agenda and could have anticipated the situation we 
are in today. The government could listen to the Public Service 
Alliance, which would prefer to be under the Canada Labour Code 
rather than the Public Service Staff Relations Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to take part in the debate and particularly to follow 
the member for Winnipeg Centre who gave a very cogent and 
comprehensive speech about the shortcomings of this onerous and 
odious legislation.  He did it from the point of view of working 
people.  I will at least begin my remarks by talking about the 
impact on farmers and the situation they find themselves in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strike by table two members of the Public Service Alliance 
of Canada has been in effect for a couple of months.  There have 
been rotational strikes.  It is the second time the 70 grain 
weighers have put up picket sides at the seven grain terminals on 
the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last set of pickets has been in effect for some six days and 
has aroused a lot of the bluster from the other side on the 
impact of the anti-democratic legislation we have before us. The 
rationale is that the government is moving to do something about 
grain.  However, when it is behind by one million income tax 
files and there are crocodile tears about income taxpayers not 
getting their refunds, I rather suspect it is the government not 
being able to collect the money and get it into the government 
coffers as fast as it would like to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people who are not from the prairies or who do not have a 
farm background, the movement of grain from the prairies to the 
west coast is quite a Byzantine world that in some cases almost 
defies description. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a minute to explain what I think happens in 
this regard.  The farmer grows the grain and stores it on his 
farm.  We would think that was okay, that he or she was still 
accountable for it when it is on the farm.  Then it is trucked to 
the country elevator or more likely to the inland terminal.  We 
would think that maybe it is the people who truck the grain or 
the elevator operator who would then be responsible.  That is not 
the case.  The farmer is still on the hook for any problems that 
arise when it is at the elevator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it goes by rail to the west coast or to Thunder Bay.  Again 
we would think it is out of the farmer's hands, that he has no 
control over it so it must be the responsibility of Canadian 
National, Canadian Pacific or Omnitrax.  However it is still the 
farmer.  If there are any problems with it at the point it is the 
farmer who pays any of the demurrage or any damages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not until the grain is actually loaded on the ship that 
the farmer's responsibility for his product ends even though his 
accountability and his ability to correct any problems ended when 
the product left his farm gate perhaps a couple of months 
earlier. It is clearly a Byzantine system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Estey report that came down in December on which the 
government is still not showing any leadership talks about the 
need for accountability and for those involved in the system to 
be responsible for it.  While my caucus and I have many problems 
with the Estey report this is certainly not one of them.  We 
think that Mr. Estey's comments on accountability and 
responsibility are extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a grim time particularly for farmers on the prairies. In 
December the government announced its so-called AIDA program, 
agricultural income disaster assistance.  Farmers have other 
acronyms to describe it.  It is not helping very many farmers in 
our region.  I have yet to speak with a farmer who thinks that 
there will be any pay off or any relief for his or her operation 
at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strike of grain weighers has added insult to injury.  It 
would be true to say that many farmers out there believe that the 
disruption needs to be dealt with because they are in dire 
straits and sinking deeper.  As has been mentioned by other 
speakers, spring seeding is just around the corner.  It is a time 
of very quiet desperation and perhaps not so quiet desperation 
for farm families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time many farmers feel that what is before us today 
is inherently unfair.  They implicitly recognize that the 
government is playing off farmers and workers.  That in the long 
run gets nobody very far down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the table two negotiators, I want to read into the 
record some references contained in a letter addressed to me on 
March 19 from a table two member in the riding of Palliser in 
Moose Jaw.  This individual is employed at 15 Wing in Moose Jaw. 
The letter reads in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a loyal employee of the Federal Government of Canada 
for over twenty years and a member of the Public Service Alliance 
of Canada.  As an employee represented at the PSAC table 
two-Treasury Board negotiations, I feel compelled to bring a few 
things to light, and hope the attached documents will shed some 
light on the “real issues”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter references the fact that the President of the 
Treasury Board stated that the government has accepted a 
conciliation board report when under the staff relations act the 
conciliation board has to have agreeing parties to substantiate a 
report. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter writer says that in the case of table two 
negotiations there was no agreement between the three members of 
the board, thus the report is invalid. The letter also points out 
that the minister responsible for the Treasury Board has also 
stated:  “Unfortunately, at this point the union has been asking 
for things that are excessive and for which Canadian taxpayers do 
not want to pay”.  He appended some tables that approximately 
80% to 85% have already settled agreements with federal 
government employees and the table two requests are by no means 
out of line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His third and final point is that in a review of comparable 
market rates, public service employees in Saskatchewan make an 
average of 70% of the going local market rate.  He wrote 
“Clearly, not only as public servants, but as folks from 
Saskatchewan, we are treated as the poor sister of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He ends his letter by urging that we intercede to get Treasury 
Board back to the negotiating table.  “Treasury Board has come 
to a reasonable agreement with other groups, why not us? We 
deserve to be treated fairly and equitably”.  We in this caucus 
agree very much with the sentiments expressed by that individual 
from the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a letter from Nova Scotia.  I want to zero in on 
the regional rates of pay. It is brought to light in the letter 
that the regional rates of pay discriminate against about 1,500 
blue collar workers in Atlantic Canada and about 11,000 Public 
Service Alliance of Canada blue collar workers across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the letter, 97% of federal government employees are 
paid national rates of pay.  Only 3% are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter contends that Atlantic Canadian employees are paid 
the lowest rates in Canada. Treasury Board officials have 
consistently argued in the House and in the media that regional 
rates of pay cannot be paid to blue collar workers.  They say the 
policy has been in effect since 1922 and was based on market 
comparability with private regional rates of pay when introduced. 
They argue the regional rates of pay cannot be eliminated 
because of regional costs of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may have been true seven decades ago and may have remained 
true for many decades after that. However, for the past 20 years 
regional rates of pay have been amalgamated in an attempt to 
eliminate them gradually and regional rates of pay really no 
longer reflect regional markets. The question remains, if 
regional rates of pay were a cost of living issue, why does the 
policy apply today to only 3% of federal government employees and 
not the other 97%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To follow up on that, in a letter to the federal government on 
behalf of the province of Nova Scotia, the labour minister for 
that province, Mr. MacKinnon, wrote to his Liberal counterpart: 
“It is our view that the work Nova Scotians deliver is of equal 
quality and value to the work delivered by workers in other 
provinces.  It would only seem just to consider wage parity for 
all Canadian government employees no matter what their 
classification”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Chisholm, who many of us hope and expect will become the 
next premier of the province of Nova Scotia has written: 
“Provincial workers in similar positions already make higher 
incomes than those affected by regional rates of pay.  When 97% 
of federal workers already have uniform rates of pay, surely 
giving it to the other 3% would not lose unheralded inflationary 
pressures”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the reasons that this party remains 
fundamentally opposed to the legislation before us this 
afternoon, which we will be debating and discussing over the next 
couple of days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wrap up of this individual's letter from Halifax said: “The 
federal government's regional rates of pay policies discriminate 
against blue collar workers.  Treasury Board's bargaining tactics 
have been counterproductive for the public service in Canada. 
Treasury Board manager Alain Jolicoeur suggested to the media in 
Ottawa that had we not been happy with our wages, we could have 
quit, entirely ignoring our real economic situation as modest 
wage earners and our commitment to serve the Canadian public. The 
government has treated us as though we are entirely worthless and 
disposable”.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And these are modest wage earners.  It is fair to say that the 
average salary is in the neighbourhood of $26,000, hardly a 
king's ransom.  As my colleague from Winnipeg Centre noted in his 
remarks, the pay scale does not compare with what folks earn in 
the private sector in provinces such as Saskatchewan or indeed 
Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of concluding my remarks, it is my contention that had 
the government opposite negotiated in good faith, this rotating 
strike situation would be over in a day.  We note that the public 
service employees, members of the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada, have not had a raise for some seven years.  It was 
pointed out to me earlier that in some groups, not all in table 
two but in some, settlements have been imposed. It has really 
been 15 years since they have had any kind of meaningful 
increase.  These people are not asking for the moon. They are 
asking for a wage increase of what will amount to less than 3% 
per annum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our contention that this strike is fully and totally the 
responsibility of the government opposite.  At the same time, as 
was noted in question period today, it is the farmers who are 
being hurt as a result of this.  There is a grain backlog from 
the west coast terminals all the way back to the farm gate in 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are debating this legislation, it is noteworthy to 
point out that the strikers are back at work today.  The 
government should have seized the opportunity when the pickets 
came down on Friday morning to get back to the bargaining table 
and to have negotiated a full and final settlement over the 
weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the government's bungling and total mishandling 
of this situation, it should pay Canadian farmers for the losses 
they are suffering due to this aforementioned bungling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a rather simple and direct question for the hon. 
member.  Can the member see any reason, either in practicality or 
in law, why the government could not have brought in targeted 
legislation to keep the grain moving for the benefit of the 
western Canadian economy without involving thousands of other 
unionized workers who have absolutely nothing to do with the 
principal crisis that has caused us to be debating this today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Cypress Hills—Grasslands for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some merit in what the member is proposing.  However, 
to have done that the government would have had to have brought 
the 70 grain weighers into the labour standards of Canada as 
opposed to the Public Service Staff Relations Act which they are 
currently under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more important question was noted by my colleague from 
Winnipeg Centre when he talked about the number of people that 
were brought in.  I recall specifically the member talking about 
the prison guards who are not affected because they are essential 
workers, but nevertheless they have been drawn in under the terms 
of reference of this all-encompassing piece of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Palliser mentioned the impact on farmers and on grain. 
I would like to share something with him which just happened 
outside in the lobby.  I received a phone call from the leader of 
the grain handlers union who is very interested in the debate 
that is going on.  I would like to share this with the member for 
Palliser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He lamented the fact that this government enters into back to 
work legislation so lightly and so easily.  The grain handlers 
union is thinking about the next time it goes to the bargaining 
table and what is going to happen to its members.  Are they going 
to be legislated back to work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their union has come up with a very creative idea that I would 
like the member for Palliser to think about.  Rather than going 
on strike, and perhaps being legislated back to work, they are 
thinking of taking a 70%—I should say a 30%—cut in pay and 
asking the companies to take a 30% cut in profit while they are 
at impasse.  This money would be put into a pool to be donated to 
the farmers to offset their demurrage costs and charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems like a really sensitive and intelligent solution to an 
impasse.  If they do not make any progress in two weeks, they 
bump it down another 20% to 50%, so that both sides suffer 
equally, share the pain and offset the inconvenience to the farm 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the member would comment on creative solutions 
like that coming from the trade union movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his question.  When he talked about a 70% reduction, I thought he 
was going in the direction of the AIDA program because that has a 
70% threshold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this sort of creative solution that perhaps could work to 
put these things in perspective and result in the speedy 
resolution of labour-management difficulties.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see the clock 
ticking and I am afraid I may not have enough time, but I 
promise you I will be here tomorrow morning to continue this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are discussing here today is very important for 
workers. In fact, I hope there are a lot of workers watching us 
now on the parliamentary channel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think people will finally find out what is hidden behind the 
Liberals' mask. The Liberals are always saying how they work for 
the common good and how they try to stabilize the economy. But 
at whose expense do they do that? At the expense of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I formally accuse the Liberals of continuing their crusade 
against the workers of Canada and Quebec. A lot of Quebeckers 
are victims of this bill, and I find it unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People must understand what is hidden behind the Liberals' mask, 
and I intend to take about twenty minutes to try to describe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to say is that the Liberal government wanted its 
employees to go on strike. They did, and now it wants to 
legislate them back to work. And it is totally intentional. This 
problem did not come about suddenly. These people have been 
asking for salary increases for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some of my colleagues mentioned, these people have not had a 
salary increase in six years. The government could have settled 
the issue over the last two years, but that is not what it has 
decided to do. 
It has been decided to wait until the very last minute. And now, 
they stand up and say “We are going to protect Canada's and 
Quebec's economy. We will put an end to this”. But the problem 
is of their own making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I should tell you a little bit about my own background. 
During 20 years, I was a trade unionist with the CSN before 
entering into politics. I have had the opportunity to see what a 
government employer is. It behaves like the Liberals do. They 
sit at the bargaining table, and have negotiations. When it does 
not work out, they pass a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just imagine the power they can wield. All they need to do is 
leave the bargaining table, make offers that are lower than the 
union demands, and they will end up saying the employees do not 
take up what is being offered. Employees have the right to 
strike, and the government knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the employees have decided to go on strike, the government 
introduces a special legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfair, cynical and machiavellian. That is what the 
government is. It is not the first time we can see that. It has 
done the same thing with postal workers, railway workers and 
now, with specific groups that are amongst the lowest paid in 
the federal public service. They are the victims of a government 
that is legislating them back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not hold that view only because I have been a trade 
unionist. Members of parliament are here to represent 
constituents. In my riding, between 400 and 500 people working 
at the military base will be legislated back to work. This 
probably represents a fairly high pay loss in my riding. 
The fact that the government did not want to adjust those 
salaries also meant a loss of revenue for several years now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has the Liberal government shut down the military 
college in my riding, totalling $32 million a year, but now we 
are stuck with a special bill because the government has decided 
it has had enough. Canada is supposedly on the brink of a major 
crisis, yet it is this very government that has driven the 
federal public servants of table 2 and table 4 to use their 
right to strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we ought to settle this fundamental issue once and for all 
with this government. Does the right to strike still exist in 
the federal public sector? Does it? Do employees have the legal 
right to say “We have had enough of the proposals coming from 
the government, we have had enough on these never-ending 
discussions and negotiations, we have the legal right to decide 
to go on strike”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have right now is a smoke screen, because as soon as the 
workers start using their right to strike, the government tells 
them “You cannot go exercize your right to strike, because you 
are disrupting the economy”. This is what the government often 
does. They did it to the rail workers on strike, to the postal 
workers on strike, and now they are doing it to the federal 
public servants who are members of table 2 and table 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to remember about the Liberal record is not only 
the way the government has been badly protecting and even 
persecuting the workers. 
We also have to look at what has been going on with wage parity. 
How long have women in the public service been demanding wage 
parity to ensure that they are properly paid for their services? 
Public servants,  many members of the public, and myself, all 
believe these women deserve to be paid fairly. But not this 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the same thing happening over and over again.  They are 
going to wait for a decision to be brought down in another case 
before they alter their position.  If the judgment is to the 
government's advantage, it will say “We are now going to 
implement it”.  If it is to the government's disadvantage, it 
will say “We are going to ignore it and do things our own way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government waited very long before settling the issue of pay 
equity for women in the federal public service. I hope people 
who are watching us this evening will remember that, because 
most of them are just coming home from work. These are people 
who pay taxes so that the Government of Canada and other 
governments throughout the country, including Quebec, can 
continue to operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this is not what this government is doing. It is targeting 
workers. Again, if we look at the impact on a riding such as 
Saint-Jean, we can see that it is not negligible. It was 
estimated that the riding of Saint-Jean alone suffers an annual 
shortfall of about $2 million, because the government is taking 
so long to settle the pay equity issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The workers should get used to the idea that to vote for a 
Liberal government is to vote against workers. In Quebec, many 
have realized that. Who really looks after the interests of 
workers in this House? Who will oppose special legislation that 
adversely affect these workers? The Bloc Quebecois has always 
stood for these workers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the reasons the Bloc Quebecois is so popular in 
Quebec.  For sure the millionaires, the banks and the insurance 
companies dealing with billions of dollars do not contribute a 
red cent to the coffers of the Bloc Quebecois, because we are 
popularly funded.  We do not want our hands tied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that, when it comes time to put an <I>x</I> beside the Bloc 
Quebecois in the booth, these people hesitate.  But workers, for 
example, can see just who can rise in this place and defend them 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the EI fund.  Who pays for the EI fund? 
People will tell me it is partly paid for by employers, and I 
would agree. But workers put in a large amount.  And with all 
the changes to the EI fund, all the amendments to the 
legislation since it was introduced, who has benefited?  The 
government, which, in my opinion, is levying an indirect tax. 
Workers contribute every week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have workers who have paid EI premiums for 25 or 
30 years.  During the ice storm, to give one example, we asked 
the government to be more flexible, because people needed money. 
Workers needed money to cope during a major disaster.  And the 
government said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government continues to say no to workers, not just to 
those who are the victims of disasters. 
Members should take a look at the wording of the legislation. 
My colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouta—Les Basques, is doing an 
excellent job, so that these inequities will be corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government is turning a deaf ear, all the 
while accumulating billions of dollars in the fund and paying 
down its deficit.  In the meantime, big corporations have it 
great in Canada.  It is workers who are watching their salaries 
and living conditions slide ever downward.  It is not for 
nothing that this Liberal government has been accused of going 
after workers.  In my view, this is another blatant example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another development recently.  This goes back a few 
weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago in the House, I raised the important 
issue of the Singer employees. 
I was told for two years, after I do not know how many 
questions, that the government had no responsibility in that 
case, whereas it was clearly stipulated in the contract that the 
government was a trustee, that it was the guardian of the plan 
and the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It allowed Singer to stop paying premiums, taking the money from 
the fund surplus. Today, Singer workers, who are 83 years old on 
average, receive a monthly pension ranging from $20 to $50. 
There are people, like my father, who worked in that company for 
45 years.  We told the government “Look, this does not make 
sense. You were a trustee of the fund. Why did you allow the 
company to take money from the fund?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we annualize the whole pension fund, what has been taken out 
of it from 1962 to today, plus the accumulated interest, we get 
around $8 million, which could greatly benefit the Singer 
pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what has the government been planning for the past two 
years? It has watched the public service pension plan grow.  It 
has been getting ready to put its hand on the surplus. Contrary 
to what the President of the Treasury Board often says, the 
surplus does not belong to the government. Public servants have 
been paying into this fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there is a surplus. It should be used to enhance the 
pension plan and not by the government saying “This belongs to 
us now. Workers, you have contributed for 10, 15, 20 or 30 
years. 
There is a surplus, but sorry, the plan will remain unchanged, 
while we are use it to eliminate the deficit, we are using your 
money for other purposes”. The money is used for purposes other 
than the one provided for in the act, namely to enhance these 
employees' pension plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed that the former workers of the Singer Company have 
probably been the first victims of this government's intentions 
to reach into the pension funds of its own employees. The 
government will not admit that I am right and that it should 
help those 250 people who on average are now 83 years old. The 
government will not help those people by enhancing their 
pensions because this would put at risk its intention to dip 
into the federal public service employees pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those workers who are listening today, I believe those are 
examples which should not be forgotten. Do we have to ask who 
the Liberal Party is defending? Is it defending workers, those 
who pay the bulk of taxes and income tax? I do not believe so. 
What has happened here today is despicable, but we could already 
feel it coming last week. I have had contacts with people on the 
Canadian forces base in my riding who are in touch with their 
union delegates. I told them that I had the feeling a special 
bill would be introduced in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned Friday that there had been two attempts to get the 
debate going rapidly. I believe workers sensed, knew what was 
coming. This is not to mention the way workers were treated. As 
far as I know, workers on strike have the right to put up picket 
lines and to protest in front of the offices of members of 
parliament or ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, the people who come to my riding office want to tell 
me about their concerns, not to protest in front of my office. 
They go do their picketing in front of the Liberals' offices, 
since they know these hon. members are responsible for the 
situation they are in, because, as I said, the government really 
wanted this strike to happen. Now that it is here, they want to 
quash it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of privatization. I remind the House 
that less than a year ago this issue was very much on the 
agenda. The government wants to contract out to some agencies 
the work being done by several people at DND and throughout the 
federal public service. For some years now, we have seen the 
government contracting out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen to this. At CFB Saint-Jean, we have personnel with 20 
years of service and officers who are retiring. 
These officers are paid. Those who have worked for 20 years get 
their full pension. They turn around and set up businesses, and 
they tell their employees “Sorry, friends, I can rehire you, but 
you will not get $12 or $13 an hour. I can afford to pay you 
only $8 an hour”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These officers are double dipping. They get their full pension 
from the Canadian army, they set up businesses, and they make 
profits by lowering the working and living conditions of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have before us today? When I say that this strike was 
planned, it is because the government is laughing at the workers 
when it says “Special legislation is coming up. If you do not 
accept our offers, you will strike out because we will impose 
them on you”. The government is taking advantage of this special 
legislation to lower the terms and wages offered to the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is not all the government has up its sleeve. It is 
saying to these workers “You are not skilled workers, anybody 
can do your work. So, if you do not accept our offers, we will 
impose special legislation on you”. Moreover, we often hear that 
employers say to their employees “If you are not happy with what 
you are getting, you can resign, leave your job”, whereas they 
are the lowest paid in the public service. The government wants 
to make money on their backs, saying “If you all resign, we will 
give the contract to the private sector, and we will make even 
more money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I say that what is happening here today is really 
unfair and cynical. The Bloc will stand up because, to my 
knowledge, it is the only party that has been standing up for 
the workers, so far.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise and discuss this 
important matter.  As the public complaints commission resumes 
its hearings today into the APEC security fiasco, it is my 
pleasure to speak to this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 23, 1998, I asked the Prime Minister during question 
period when the government would call a complete independent 
judicial inquiry into the security at APEC, a relevant question 
then and now.  Because the public complaints commission has never 
had a mandate under the RCMP act to investigate the Prime 
Minister's office, the public complaints commission has never had 
the opportunity to delve into allegations that the RCMP was only 
following government orders when it pepper sprayed protesters in 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The embarrassing actions of the Liberal government and the 
solicitor general of the day to avoid broad accountability 
prompted some to call for the end of the RCMP public complaints 
commission.  In the aftermath of resignations, indignation and 
media manipulations, the commission went into hibernation and 
only recently returned to the spotlight when the new committee 
chairman, Ted Hughes, a very able and learned jurist, was 
appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since his appointment by the Prime Minister, Mr. Hughes has 
shown his ability to make an impartial and fair process work. Mr. 
Hughes has stated that he will go where the evidence leads him 
and that his questions will be answered.  Mr. Hughes must have 
the Liberals shaking in their boots with this attitude because as 
he has stated he will not rule out issuing a subpoena that might 
call for the testimony of the Prime Minister at this inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During question period in November the Prime Minister responded 
to my question by stating: “The inquiry can ask on all subjects 
it wants of anybody in the bureaucracy and even in my office and 
not only of the RCMP”.  I wonder how comfortable the Prime 
Minister is with that statement now that he does not control the 
commission like a puppet on a string. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the public complaints commission or the building 
of summer cottage access roads, the Prime Minister likes to have 
his own way and people in place to control the outcome when he 
does not have his own way.  This time, however, the process will 
not be easily manipulated.  Canadians are left still wondering 
about the meaning behind the former solicitor general's famous 
comments on his ill fated plane ride when he stated that Hughie 
would take the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is next?  The RCMP has been directed to chase after dead 
ends in the Airbus scandal, so will the Liberal government make 
the RCMP again take the brunt of the criticism after the 
decisions of the Prime Minister's office which actually led to 
the APEC scandal?  I am hopeful that this current version of the 
public complaints commission will have the mandate to look at 
what happened as a result of the PMO's direction should those 
events transpire and as it relates to the RCMP's handling of 
these protesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, I am cautiously optimistic that the commission 
will now be able to draft a report that will give us answers that 
get to the bottom of these important questions. This being said, 
I am hopeful that the public complaints commission will be able 
to make a proposal for the proper and meaningful retribution of 
student protesters involved in the APEC scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are questions Canadians deserve to have answers to.  Now 
that the commission is back in full operation and is down to the 
business of looking at these issues as they are brought forward 
by lawyers like Cameron Ward for the protesters currently giving 
evidence, we are hopeful these answers will be carefully studied 
by the government. There is an opportunity here to perhaps 
restore some of the lost faith that came about as a result of the 
events in Vancouver.

The commission decided to hold a hearing as the result of 
complaints about the behaviour of members of the RCMP at the 
APEC conference in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission determined the parameters of the hearing.  In 
December 1998, the commission named Ted Hughes, an experienced 
and a highly respected jurist, to hear the testimony of the 
complainants.  The PCC will prepare a report at the end of the 
hearings and will publish the conclusions and recommendations of 
the committee.  It will send this report to all complainants, to 
the solicitor general and to the commissioner of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me return to the mandate of the commissioner of the public 
complaints commission looking into complaints against the 
conduct of RCMP officers during the demonstrations at the APEC 
conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, as the Prime Minister has repeatedly pointed out here 
in the House, Mr. Hughes has been given a very broad mandate. 
This mandate was established by the public complaints 
commission, not the government.  As the public complaints 
commission said in its December 21, 1998, press release, Mr. 
Hughes will examine the events that occurred during the 
demonstrations that took place at that time and will submit a 
report.  Mr. Hughes has already made it clear how broad a 
mandate this is in the decisions he has handed down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the public complaints commission is ever allowed to do its 
job, I am sure that the Canadian public will be much enlightened.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all I wish to thank all 
members of the House and of the Senate for the opportunity to 
change the name of our beautiful riding from Sackville—Eastern 
Shore to Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore.  On 
behalf of the 83,000 we thank the House and the other place very 
much for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that we are debating today the concern of my 
question on February 16 about the blue collars workers of the 
PSAC union.  It is unfortunate that in 1993 this Liberal 
government broke its promise to end regional rates of pay which 
in my riding of Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore are 
a very major bone of contention for these hardworking Atlantic 
Canadians who are not paid equitably for the work they do 
compared to other workers with the same union across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House we saw crocodile tears from the House leader 
of the Liberal Party who said how upset and how ashamed he was 
that these workers can actually hold hostage the people of Canada 
or the farmers of Canada.  In all my years of labour negotiations 
and all my years in the union never once have I ever met a 
picketer who loved to be on a picket line.  Never once have I met 
a family that wanted its main earner to go on the picket line and 
lose income so it could end up losing the house, having to go 
further into debt, having to lose the car and so on.  No one 
likes a picket line, especially farmers.  No one likes a picket 
line, especially the workers who are on that picket line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they do want and what they have asked for time and time 
again is fair collective bargaining.  In the event that 
bargaining process breaks down it is up to the two parties, in 
this case the government and PSAC, to bring in an arbitrator to 
make a ruling which is binding on both parties in this case. 
That arbitration was legislated out so the workers do not even 
have that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to name two people, Mr. Howie West and Ms. Cathy 
Murphy, in Nova Scotia with the PSAC union who have done yeoman's 
work for their membership and for the citizens of Nova Scotia by 
bringing these issues to the forefront and displaying a very 
positive attitude as to how they can reach a settlement in this 
case.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refused to negotiate pay equity and now it is 
before the courts and they are appealing it one more time.  Then 
it was regional rates of pay it refused to discuss.  Now the 
government will go after its own workers' pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three strikes and this government will be out.  As my colleague 
for Winnipeg Centre said, the government is waking a sleeping 
giant it does not want to wake up.  I can assure the House that 
from coast to coast to coast retired PSAC workers and current 
PSAC workers from all stripes will rise up in anger over the fact 
that this government is refusing to listen and has brought the 
morale of these workers to an all time low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have letter addressed to the President of the Treasury Board. 
It basically states if this government thinks it can legislate 
these workers back to work and replace the picket line outside 
and move the picket line inside, it is sadly mistaken because it 
is in for a lot of trouble it does not wish to have. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, aside from saying that the NDP is not 
surprising anyone with its usual rhetorical lines, supporting 
regional rates of pay is not difficult to understand.  The 
striking blue collar workers want one rate across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would make it inequitable for many in the process.  It 
would mean excessive income for some in certain areas while 
others would be underpaid in other areas.  That is simply not 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has offered blue collar workers contracts in line 
with what it has provided other public servants in negotiated 
settlements while paying wages that reflect local market 
realities. In fact, 87% of PSAC has negotiated settlement.  We 
believe in the negotiated settlement approach and collective 
bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has offered to reduce the number of regions where 
different rates apply from ten to seven. That is fair.  If the 
government were to pay Vancouver rates to blue collar workers in 
Halifax, imagine the outcry.  Small business would be competing 
for needed workers, not just the federal government but the 
corporations rich enough to match the higher rates.  That would 
disrupt the local labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we pay higher wages in Vancouver?  Quite simply, the cost 
of living on the west coast is much higher. Consider housing 
prices alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By paying regional rates, the federal government contributes to 
social and economic stability across Canada.  That is why we 
should simply return to the central issue, passing a bill to end 
a strike that is hurting Canadians and threatening the trade so 
vital to our economy, exporters, grain producers, the many 
Canadians who desperately need their income tax refunds, et 
cetera. This government has responsibilities to ensure all 
Canadians work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
recently had the opportunity to ask a question of the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.  It had to do with poverty measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of background, Statistics Canada has a measure called low 
income cutoff.  It measures poverty on a relative basis, which 
basically means that Canadians are looked at as to how their 
requirements for food, clothing and shelter match up to the 
average Canadian expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The low income cutoff has measured poverty in Canada to be at a 
rate of 17%.  In December of last year the United Nations 
committee dealing with such matters addressed poverty.  With 
regard to Canada, even the Government of Canada made 
representations that it does not consider the low income cutoff 
to be an official poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the UN committee made a recommendation that Canada 
must adopt an official poverty line so that we can properly 
measure poverty in Canada in order to properly target our 
resources available and measure our progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the federal and provincial governments are looking 
at another measure called the market basket measure. That is more 
an absolute measure of poverty.  It looks at how much is required 
for basic necessities as well as certain provisions for 
participation in society so that Canadians would be able to fit 
in, as it were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed market basket measure right now would measure 
poverty in Canada at 12%.  That is five percentage points lower 
than the LICO measure, or a 40% decline.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern would be that Canadians will start asking questions 
about whether we have reduced poverty in Canada simply by 
redefining what we mean by poverty.  I do not believe that is the 
case.  I hope the parliamentary secretary might be able to shed 
some light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 the Campaign 2000 coalition identified that there were 
one million children living in poverty.  In 1998 it reported a 
figure 50% higher, that 1.5 million children were living in 
poverty.  That was used in the LICO measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the LICO measure we see that 40% of the people who 
are poor own their own homes.  In addition, of those 50% do not 
even have mortgages.  It is very clear to me that the low income 
cutoff measure is not an appropriate measure of poverty in Canada 
and that something more akin to a market basket measure may be 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be engaged in a dialogue about what constitutes 
poverty in Canada.  We need to define poverty so that we can 
better measure, target programs and convince Canadians that we 
have made progress and not fallen behind as shown by the low 
income cutoff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been exposed to what I think is called sympathy 
fatigue.  If the numbers get far too large people do not believe 
them any more.  For that reason I believe the UN committee is 
correct in recommending that Canada adopt an official poverty 
line.  I am hopeful the government will look carefully at the 
proposition and engage Canadians so that when we establish a 
poverty line in Canada everybody understands it and accepts it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like almost 
all industrial countries other than the U.S.A., Canada does not 
have an official measure of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the early sixties Statistics Canada low income cutoffs 
have often been used as measures of poverty by journalists and by 
advocacy groups.  These cutoffs calculate low income as compared 
to the average family income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 Statistics Canada introduced a second measure called the 
low income measure which calculates income levels both before and 
after income taxes relative to the median or middle income level. 
This is comparable to the way the United Nations calculates 
international comparisons of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today many in Canada favour the development of a third measure, 
a market basket measure that takes into account the cost of 
people's essential needs like food, clothing, shelter and 
essential services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To adopt an official measure of poverty in Canada, parliament 
would have to agree on the form such a measure would take and at 
what income level the measure would be set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently there is no consensus about how to appropriately 
measure poverty.  Most people seem to agree that we need to 
broaden our understanding of poverty.  We believe it is prudent 
to have a number of complementary measures based on different 
concepts of poverty.  Trends using these various measures can 
then be followed over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any new measures that we would look at would complement, not 
replace, existing measures like the LICOs or the LIMs and would 
build on our knowledge of the real conditions of low income 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock pursuant to Standing Order
