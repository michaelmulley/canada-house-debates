act to amend the Auditor General Act (reports), as reported 
(with amendment) from the committee.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING">SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Motion No. 1 will be 
debated and voted upon.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MOTIONINAMENDMENT">MOTION IN AMENDMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-207, in Clause 1, be amended by replacing line 10, on page 1, 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``under section 8(1), at least three''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I am wondering whether the 
mover of the motion is in fact here today and, if not, whether we 
can address this matter. I believe a negotiation was discussed 
and, before making a decision about this matter, we could settle 
that question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-207, tabled for first 
reading on February 1, 1994 by the member for Ottawa-Vanier, 
provides in clause 1 that the Auditor General shall report at least 
annually to the House of Commons. This bill also provides, in 
clause 4, that the Auditor General may report to the House of 
Commons on a study of any matter undertaken for the purposes 
of this act upon completion of the study.
<P>
	After second reading, the public acounts committee 
considered this bill. The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
President of the Treasury Board moved in the public accounts 
committee the following amendments, which were carried on 
division by the committee.
<P>
	The Auditor General shall report annually to the House of 
Commons and may make, in addition to any special report made 
under subsection 8(1), not more than three additional reports in 
any year to the House of Commons. That was the main 
amendment moved in the public accounts committee by the 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	Where the additional reports are concerned, the Auditor 
General shall send written notice to the Speaker of the House of 
Commons of the subject matter of the report the Auditor General 
proposes to make under subsection (1). Then, again according to 
an amendment moved by the parliamentary secretary, the 
additional report shall be submitted to the Speaker of the House 
of Commons on the expiration of 30 days after the notice is sent 
or any longer period specified in the notice.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	A third amendment was also moved, to subsection 8(1), 
concerning the presentation of a special report. It was worded as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>8.(1) The Auditor General may make a special report to the House of Commons on 
any matter of pressing importance or urgency that, in the opinion of the Auditor 
General, should be reported immediately.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That clause 3 was replaced by the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>8.(1) The Auditor General may make a special report to the House of Commons on 
any matter of pressing importance or urgency that, in the opinion of the Auditor 
General, should not be deferred until the presentation of the next report under 
subsection 7(1).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This amendment was moved in the public accounts committee 
by the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	Since the present act, which is 17 years old, has existed, 
subsection 8(1) concerning special reports has never been used 
by an Auditor General.
<P>
	As well, in his testimony before the public accounts 
committee on May 26, 1994, the Auditor General stated: ``An 
amendment to allow the office to table, say, four times a year 
would enable me to do what I would intend to do anyway. There 
are few issues that cannot wait a month or two for reporting, and 
in those cases there is always subsection 8(1) of the current act 
for use in real emergencies''. In fact, that section has never been 
used in the 17 years of the acts existence.
<P>
	Why not simplify this entire system, as proposed in the 
amendment by the Parliamentary Secretary to the President of 
the Treasury Board, and add to the annual  report, which will 
continue to be tabled, the possibility of not more than three 
additional reports?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5186"> 5186 </A></B>
<P>
	I have already stated in the House that the request by the 
member for Ottawa-Vanier during Question Period on January 
20, 1994 to allow the Auditor General to increase the frequency 
of that person's reports was the 16th such request since July 
1980; there has been a 17th in the meantime. It is time that we 
took action on this bill.
<P>
	The federal debt, combined with that of the provinces, has 
now reached the critical level of 91 per cent of Canada's GDP. 
Furthermore, according to economist John Richards, the author 
of a study published by the C. D. Howe Institute, the measures 
announced by the Liberal government to reduce the deficit will 
probably fail. In Mr. Richards' opinion, it is highly probable that 
the present program to fight the deficit will not even achieve the 
most modest objectives contained in the Liberals' red book.
<P>
	In the present situation of indebtedness, since we have 
reached a critical point and have a program to fight the deficit 
that is worse than shaky, why not give the Auditor General more 
elbow room and promote a more flexible and workable way for 
that person to publish work and take action?
<P>
	Why put the number of reports by the Auditor General in a 
strait-jacket of one annual report, to which in the long term no 
more than three additional reports would be added?
<P>
	In order to give the Auditor General more room to manoeuvre 
and more latitude to take action, I move the amendment tabled 
this morning, that is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That clause 1 of Bill C-207 be amended by striking out lines 4 to 11 on page 1 
and substituting the following therefor: The Auditor General shall report 
annually to the House of Commons and may make, in addition to any special 
report made under subsection 8(1), at least three additional reports in any year 
to the House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	By means of this amendment, the Auditor General could 
publish at least three additional reports, indeed four, five, or 
even more. The Auditor General could still publish the annual 
report, to which could be added three or more additional reports, 
depending on the situation.
<P>
	This amendment would avoid pointless and tedious 
proceedings to amend the act two or three years from now to 
allow for more additional reports, if the Auditor General 
considered that appropriate, and would be in the spirit of the 
initial bill tabled by the member for Ottawa-Vanier, which did 
not put a ceiling on the number of reports by the Auditor 
General.
<P>
	That member's bill specifies only a minimum of reports each 
year; the amendment moved by the parliamentary secretary puts 
a ceiling of three additional reports in addition to the annual 
report; and the amendment I am moving today is in agreement 
with the bill tabled by the member for Ottawa-Vanier: a 
minimum of three additional reports, and thus a broader base, in  
addition to the annual report, which would still be published.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am going to comment very briefly on this amendment 
requiring the Auditor General of Canada to report at least three 
times in addition to his annual report.
<P>
	We considered such a provision when the bill was drafted, and 
we rejected it at that time because, in my opinion, the Auditor 
General should be left free to act. It should be his decision when 
to table a report. There should not be a minimum of three reports 
imposed on him.
<P>
	What will happen if, for completely extra-parliamentary 
reasons, for factors entirely outside his activities as auditor, an 
election is called? It is easy to see that it would be impossible for 
him to table the three minimum reports plus an annual report in 
that year. I am puzzled that the Bloc Québécois is absolutely 
determined to impose three additional reports on the Auditor 
General, over and above his annual report.
<P>
	The original idea behind Bill C-207 was to make possible 
greater transparency, greater freedom of action, and, what is 
more, greater accountability to the people of Canada with 
respect to the public accounts that are approved by this House.
<P>
	I do not see why the Auditor General should be forced to 
prepare a minimum of three additional reports. I would have 
preferred that we stick to the original bill, which left him the 
freedom to decide when, how and why he would report, and did 
not impose a minimum of three extra reports.
<P>
	I cannot support this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Madam Speaker, I support 
the amendment of the hon. member for La Prairie to Bill C-207, 
under which clause 1 of the bill would be amended to enable the 
Auditor General to make at least three supplementary reports a 
year.
<P>
	By allowing the Auditor General to report more than once a 
year we would be giving him greater latitude, and that is 
something we heartily support. The wording of the amendment 
sets a minimum.
<P>
	It is not restrictive. It says the Auditor General will be able to 
present at least three supplementary reports. He could present 
more than that, but there will be a floor. I do not think it would be 
wise to introduce this kind of change and set a limit on the 
number of supplementary reports.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5187"> 5187 </A></B>
<P>
	The Auditor General's strength is his credibility. Giving him 
latitude is also giving him the room to carry out his mandate 
fully.
<P>
	Changing from one report a year to several is a response to a 
long felt need. The proposed amendment to section 7 of the 
Auditor General Act has been recommended four times by the 
public accounts committee and once by the Senate finance 
committee. The Auditor General would like to see this change.
<P>
	With reports at regular intervals, information will be split up 
and will reach us in a shorter time, which will obviously result in 
savings.
<P>
	The Auditor General will be able to report to the House of 
Commons as soon as he has finished an in-depth audit of a 
department or a federal body, instead of waiting until he tables 
his annual report. Parliamentarians will thus be able to have 
access to information faster, and act more promptly.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	The amendment gives plenty of leeway, and the necessary 
flexibility, to the Auditor General. Why opt for a ceiling? Where 
does this distrust come from? Why give with the right hand and 
take away with the left?
<P>
	If it is felt that the Auditor General needs to produce more 
than one annual report a year, which seems to be an accepted 
fact, why restrict him to producing no more than three additional 
reports?
<P>
	Moreover, the idea of regular reports reflects a trend that we 
can see in other countries: Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, 
Australia, New Zealand. They have all adopted the idea. We are 
not abandoning a sacrosanct standard and striking out on our 
own.
<P>
	The Auditor General's 1993 annual report has over 700 pages. 
If he reported at regular intervals all the information would be 
brought out over the course of a year and not just at the end of the 
year. That would be more efficient, more effective and more 
transparent. His auditing activities show how public money is 
being used, which meets a vital need. There can be no half 
measures in transparency.
<P>
	Everyone is in favour of virtue, but when the time comes to 
act they get lukewarm and propose to limit the number of 
supplementary reports. This is backing and filling. Since 1980 
there have been many attempts to amend the Auditor General 
Act but none of them has succeeded.
<P>
	It seems to be difficult to go from words to action and give the 
Auditor General the latitude he needs. We are clearly running 
into resistance here. Apparent supporters of the idea say one 
thing but make a point of setting limits to what they call 
transparency. There is no room here for petty politicking. The 
Auditor General is the government's watchdog, and he must not 
be muzzled.
<P>
	The Bloc Québécois defines the Auditor General's role 
positively. There is no question of imposing limits on him: we 
want to give him the manoeuvring room he needs to carry on his 
activities.
<P>
	The bill tabled by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier 
originally provided in its clause 1 that the Auditor General could 
table at least one report, whereas the text we now have before us 
stipulates that he can prepare not more than three supplementary 
reports a year. Limits are being introduced, things are being 
restricted. After they make their resounding statements of 
principle, put the Grits through the mangle and their real 
intentions gush out.
<P>
	The Auditor General ensures probity in the management of 
public moneys. He is apolitical. In today's context, participating 
in the passage of measures that might make it possible to save 
money is not something to dismiss lightly.
<P>
	The Office of the Auditor General does audits, and we would 
benefit from having the findings in a shorter time. The wording 
of the amendment is designed to achieve this by providing for 
additional reports. The Auditor General already has the power to 
make special reports to the House.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Section 8(1) reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Auditor General may make a special report to the House of Commons on 
any matter of pressing importance or urgency that, in his opinion, should not be 
deferred until the presentation of his annual report.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	However, since 1977, he has never invoked that section. The 
member for Ottawa-Vanier wanted to soften the original rule. 
In its place, he proposes the present wording which sets 
requirements too high, so high in fact that one wonders if they 
will ever be satisfied since the auditor has never used this 
prerogative in 17 years.
<P>
	We submit that the requirements of managing a modern state 
call for a new way of doing things which allows for greater 
visibility. The auditor needs more leeway in the performance of 
his duties. For one or two weeks after he reports to Parliament, 
everyone focuses on the complexity of the task, on the visibility 
of his work. Then, it is back to oblivion for another year.
<P>
	He must-and arguments favour more frequent reporting-be 
given the opportunity to make more than one yearly report. To 
achieve this, we will have to use general wording.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to address the House on this bill to amend the 
Auditor General Act. I have followed the discussion with 
interest on the question of when and how the Auditor General 
reports to Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5188"> 5188 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since 1980, the public accounts committee and the Auditor 
General have repeatedly recommended that the Auditor General 
Act be amended to allow more frequent reporting to Parliament. 
Such recommendations were made in 1984, 1986, 1988 and 
1993.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Both the former Auditor General, Mr. Kenneth Dye, and the 
current Auditor General, Mr. Denis Desautels, have supported 
initiatives to amend the Auditor General Act to allow them to 
report results of individual audits at their completion.
<P>
	Both Auditors General have examined the merits of 
completion date reporting. They have noted that more frequent 
reporting would lead to a more even workload within the office 
of the Auditor General. This would lead to improved 
efficiencies. However there has been no estimate of the 
magnitude of these efficiencies.
<P>
	The primary benefit for supporting change to allow the 
Auditor General to report more frequently would be to enable 
Parliament and the public accounts committee to discuss the 
findings of the Auditor General on a more timely basis.
<P>
	This would imply that corrective action could be taken sooner 
and that Parliament would be in a better position to influence 
that action. These are indisputable goals. However, it must be 
clear that we are not referring here to the timely reporting of 
very urgent issues.
<P>
	Section 8 of the current Auditor General Act already allows 
him to report at any time to the House of Commons on any 
matter of pressing importance or urgency that in his opinion 
should not be deferred until the presentation of the annual 
report.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This section allows the Auditor General to make a timely 
report to Parliament on any pressing matter. Yet, no Auditor 
General has never done so. Why is that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another reason advanced for changing the current act is that 
more frequent reporting will help the public accounts committee 
to do a better job. The committee will be able to hold department 
and agency officials more accountable to Parliament and the 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	For instance it will be more likely that public service 
employees called as witnesses before the public accounts 
committee will be the same ones involved at the time of the 
Auditor General's audit. In the past this was not always the case. 
Again this is an admirable goal which members should support. 
Anything we can do to improve the results of this important 
committee should be seriously considered.
<P>
	However the most important question we must ask ourselves 
today is what will be the impact of this bill on the effectiveness 
of the office of the Auditor General?
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	The Auditor General is effective because of his independence 
and the credibility that results from that independence. We 
would not want to support changes to the act that would put the 
Auditor General's independence at risk.
<P>
	The Auditor General recognizes the importance of his 
independence. It is a key component of his office's mission 
statement. The Office of the Auditor General of Canada 
conducts independent audits and examinations that provide 
objective information, advice and assurance to Parliament. We 
promote accountability and best practices in government 
operations.
<P>
	The importance and the necessity of the work of the Auditor 
General and the public accounts committee is not a question for 
debate. It is how we can make the best use of these important 
tools that is the issue.
<P>
	In the past when the issue of completion dates reporting was 
discussed in the House, it was noted quite correctly that the 
findings of the Auditor General have become more positive in 
recent years. The Auditor General has been reporting in his 
annual follow-up chapter that progress has been made in solving 
problems reported in earlier reports. Improvements in 
departmental management are being made and reported by the 
Auditor General.
<P>
	Reporting audit findings closer to the completion date of the 
audit will result in early reports to Parliament, but this alone 
will not solve the timeliness problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The very nature of the auditing process is a partial 
explanation. Complete auditing within a department can in fact 
take up to two years. I know the Auditor General is working on a 
solution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It should be remembered as well that audit findings are 
discussed with the managers responsible as they are being 
developed. Issues are addressed by government managers on a 
priority basis as they are identified by the auditee. Corrective 
action plans are generally developed well before the tabling of 
the Auditor General's report to Parliament.
<P>
	I believe that the Auditor General would be happy to report 
that all the problems have been solved. In one of his first reports 
he noted: ``Accordingly, the greatest professional satisfaction 
for me and for my colleagues in the office will not be the 
disclosure of error, waste and loss, but rather the evidence that 
management has corrected unsatisfactory situations''.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5189"> 5189 </A></B>
<P>
	Mechanisms are in place within the government to address 
observations made by the Auditor General. Furthermore, as I 
commented earlier, provisions already exist in the Auditor 
General Act that empower the Auditor General to report to 
Parliament on an urgent basis at any time.
<P>
	This act is a very important piece of legislation. It is critical to 
the accountability process that takes place between the 
government and Parliament and the Canadian public. However, 
it is an act that is viewed as being very successful. Canadian 
taxpayers are happy that they have an independent and effective 
watchdog on their side.
<P>
	I have another concern relating to the proposed amendments 
to the current act. I am concerned that the Auditor General could 
come to be used as a short term investigator asked by House 
committees and others to respond to the partisan controversies 
of the day. Pressures to agree to investigate concerns of this 
nature could place an unbearable workload on his office. This 
additional workload could put completion of his extensive 
statutory workload in jeopardy.
<P>
	In summary, I would like to emphasize that we should be 
careful when amending the Auditor General Act. We should 
ensure that we have all the facts on the table. We should know all 
the consequences, both the positive and the negative.
<P>
	In conclusion, the amendment proposed here at report stage is 
an inappropriate one. It calls essentially for mandatory quarterly 
reports rather than a more reasonable approach of one report 
annually with the option for additional reports as audits are 
completed.
<P>
	The Auditor General opposes this sort of additional duty 
because it forces him to have a new report three more times a 
year, whether he is ready or not. The amendment has the 
potential to be an absurd waste, given the fluctuations of the 
audit cycle.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Auditor General is opposed to the amendment because he 
does not feel he should be required to report until he is ready. He 
must have the choice, as given him by the act.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration)</B> moved that Bill C-35, an act to establish the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, there is something very strange 
going on this morning. For those viewers watching on television 
I was almost getting a standing ovation from my friends on the 
Reform side. I thank them for their generous and very thoughtful 
co-operation today. I thank my hon. friend, the Reform Party 
critic, for moving to second reading and showing some degree of 
flexibility to move to committee of the whole. I understand the 
Bloc Quebecois does not want to do so. I hope to find out the 
reasons why.
<P>
	The bill before the House of Commons today is relatively 
short, straightforward and important. It is only six pages long 
and 22 paragraphs in all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5190"> 5190 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Its purpose is obvious: the creation of a Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The House will recall that one of the commitments of our 
party during the campaign was that the business of immigration 
had no business being in the department of public security.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	That was a move made in the dying moments of a very 
desperate government that Canadians saw fit to replace. That is 
not the issue that caused consternation for the Prime Minister, 
this minister and all caucus members of the Liberal Party of 
Canada. It was that the move of putting immigration in public 
security was very directly a slap or a black eye for all those 
people who came to the country as immigrants and who are now 
for the most part full members of the Canadian family through 
their Canadian citizenship. Placing that in public security very 
much undermined the real story that immigration has played in 
the country.
<P>
	Sure there are cases of abuse. Sure there are individuals who 
claim refugee status, are not refugees and are everything but. 
Yes, there are those who make multiple claims on our welfare 
systems. We have tried to address that through memorandums of 
understanding with municipalities across the country. We have 
those problems, but show me a department of government that 
does not have abuse problems. Show me a UI system that is not 
abused. Show me a CPP disability system that is not abused. 
Show me a welfare system that is not abused.
<P>
	We are saying that regrettably there is abuse of various 
programs in society. Regrettably that is part of human nature not 
only in our country but the world over. Our system, when 
stacked up against other systems of the world, certainly speaks 
to a sense of clarity and a sense of integrity.
<P>
	We are also dealing with a minority of cases that should not be 
translated to being the majority story. That is why I was 
personally offended, as was my party, by immigration being 
placed in public security. The Prime Minister made a 
commitment that if he were elected Prime Minister that would 
cease and desist. True to his word when he appointed his cabinet, 
lo and behold there was a new department called citizenship and 
immigration.
<P>
	We have been carrying out our work notwithstanding the bill 
that gives legal authority to that department is before the House 
of Commons today. It enacts changes announced by the Prime 
Minister on November 4, 1993 and delivers on the principles 
contained in the red book.
<P>
	The bill organizes the citizenship and immigration mandate 
and promotion functions of the government in a coherent and 
common sense fashion. More important, the legislation before 
Parliament today modernizes and  streamlines government to 
meet the needs of Canadians and to give us the tools needed to 
deal effectively with myriad complex citizenship and 
immigration issues.
<P>
	The Prime Minister spoke on many occasions. Our party 
spoke very eloquently and indicated that immigration was a 
building tool for our country. It is a building tool that through 
the years has helped to build a modern day Canada. Immigration 
will also be part of our future. It is up to us how to shape it, how 
to mould it and how to help it address current day phenomena 
which are different from yesteryears. Nonetheless immigration 
is an absolutely vital part of the lifeblood of our country.
<P>
	There is also citizenship. Sometimes citizenship gets lost 
because immigration is so overpowering or is such an emotional 
issue that the media clearly focus on it as opposed to citizenship 
issues. I might also add that oftentimes the media deal with 
immigration in a negative way. It is always the negative issue 
that screams the loudest on page 1 or on the first story on our TV 
sets or radios. Sometimes that is how news is covered. Negative 
stuff sells but if members of Parliament are interested, as we all 
should be, about talking fact and not fiction then there is also the 
need to distinguish for the public that the culmination of all 
those negative cases does not define the essence of the issue.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	Sometimes immigration gets covered the way media covers 
aeroplanes. Media covers aeroplanes only when they do not 
land. They do not talk about the ones that land safely. They ask 
why they should. We feel bad when aeroplanes do not land. We 
send our sympathies to the families of the victims of aeroplane 
crashes. We try to learn from aeroplane mishaps. We try to 
figure out whether it was pilot error or whether it was a 
malfunctioning in one of the motors, engines, wings or whatnot. 
We study and we try to prevent another one from happening.
<P>
	We in the House of Commons do not go around and across the 
country as members of Parliament alarming our fellow 
Canadians because of an unfortunate accident. We know better. 
Ninety-nine per cent of aeroplanes land at airports seven days a 
week, 24 hours a day. In fact the statistics show that travelling in 
aeroplanes is safer than driving cars. Members are responsible 
to learn from those mistakes, but we have to be responsible 
about reflecting the total picture, the context of those aeroplane 
mishaps and landings.
<P>
	I ask my fellow colleagues: Ought we not do the same when 
we talk about the emotional issue of immigration? I think we 
should and it is important that we do so. It is not to say that we 
forget about the negative cases or that we do not learn from the 
negative cases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5191"> 5191 </A></B>
<P>
	I will be presenting legislation before we rise for the summer 
on individual cases that have been in our newspapers which have 
driven Canadians, the opposition and this minister right up the 
wall and around the bend. We will learn from them and make 
amendments so that we make the laws as foolproof as possible 
from those who want to play with or abuse our laws.
<P>
	Citizenship is also part of my mandate. I would suggest to 
hon. members that citizenship can help us with immigration. It 
is a natural fit when the Prime Minister put citizenship and 
immigration together. As immigrants come into the country and 
are facilitated, the processes of citizenship and making them 
Canadian take over. When a person becomes a Canadian citizen 
the process of him or her being an immigrant is over.
<P>
	Immigration is a process that at some point stops and 
citizenship takes over and we are all Canadian citizens. Our 
origins may be different. I may have been born in Argentina of 
Canadian parents. Yet I went through the same school system as 
the children of hon. members today. We speak English or 
French; maybe badly but none the less we speak it. We have 
played hockey on the same streets. We have been in trouble for 
throwing snowballs at our schoolmates. My cultural origin is 
different. Am I a better Canadian than anybody else here? 
Absolutely not. Am I any worse? The same answer.
<P>
	Citizenship helps us with immigration. It also helps us with 
immigration because in the offer to the standing committee to 
help us shape a new Citizenship Act one thing I asked it to do 
was to look into the responsibilities, obligations and values of 
Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	Why is that? There are two reasons. In the debate about 
immigration we talk often about rights: the rights to make an 
application, the rights of family class reunification, the right to 
have rights defended under a refugee application, and the right 
of an individual to receive humanitarian and compassionate 
consideration on which I have had requests from members of the 
Chamber on a daily basis. It is rights dominated and that is 
legitimate. There is a place for rights to be defended and to be 
respected.
<P>
	When we talk about citizenship the debate should shift quite 
properly and focus on the responsibilities and obligations of 
new citizens in Canada to defend, promote and stand on guard 
for Canada. What are the values of Canadianism that we want 
our new immigrants to embrace, cherish and respect? While we 
value the cultural identity that formulated my father's first 35 
years, we are a mature country when we say: ``Mr. Marchi, we 
are not asking you to leave your cultural vestiges at the door 
because who you were for 30 years no one can remove''. Not 
even the former Soviet Union with all its armies and tanks was 
able to suppress that. The moment the Soviet Union came apart 
we saw a flourishing of culturalism, ethnicity and religion. 
Where was that during the time of the Soviet empire? It was still 
alive because that is who people are.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	We are a mature country when we have embodied an official 
policy of multiculturalism which was certainly there before it 
was crystallized by Mr. Trudeau in 1971.
<P>
	There is also a complementary feature. When one comes to 
Canada one also needs to embrace that which is Canadian and 
which has given essence to our life in Canada.
<P>
	Why is it that in the oath that we ask our citizens to swear that 
it speaks to beholding to the duties of citizenship and nowhere in 
our Citizenship Act or anywhere else do we define duties, 
nowhere do we define obligations, nowhere do we talk about 
responsibilities. Some people wonder why certain things are not 
done.
<P>
	I would like to be in a position to move a bill in this Chamber 
in the fall, after the committee has had its study and reported, to 
talk about those things because those are unifying. It would not 
only help the newcomer to understand what Canadian society is 
about but it would also be a reassurance to all other Canadians 
that people are coming here and becoming Canadians are 
prepared as immigrants in the past to build, sacrifice, pay taxes, 
bleed when they get hurt and to rejoice in Canadian victories 
whatever those victories are.
<P>
	I would like to be in a position as minister or those who may 
follow me to be able not only to give out a citizenship certificate 
or congratulations or for members of Parliament to do that when 
they go to the citizenship ceremonies, but also to give out a 
charter of responsibilities and obligations.
<P>
	Let us strive to talk about that even though it is difficult. How 
long of a charter are we going to have if we start talking about 
responsibilities and obligations? We have to obviously capture 
the essence. What are the values of Canadian citizenship or 
Canadianism? It is pretty difficult and sometimes it can be a 
divisive debate. I think on the whole it will be a unifying debate, 
particularly at a time when our country in the next number of 
months will be seeing and hearing a lot about the negatives of 
this country and how federalism does not work and how people 
are in a funk.
<P>
	When we eliminate those day to day problems and talk about 
Canadian citizenship as I have on radio shows, TV shows and in 
forums with Canadians, it is an absolutely positive and uplifting 
force. Nobody, despite the problems that we have in all of our 
backyards, is prepared to give up on Canadian citizenship. 
Everybody recognizes that it is the best passport in the world. 
Everybody recognizes that one of the difficulties in immigration 
is the fact that literally millions of people want to come to this 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5192"> 5192 </A></B>
<P>
	The biggest difficulty I have is dealing with members of 
Parliament who come to me and say: ``Why has your department 
turned this individual down?'', ``We have a point system'' or 
``Why was he refused his visitor visa?'' The demand to come 
here is a reflection of how much of a good thing we have got 
going in this country and that we need to protect and promote it.
<P>
	We cannot be home to everyone. That is why we need to be 
selective in our immigration program. Being selective is a 
natural part of the immigration program. We select to further the 
interest of our country. We also need to have a sense of 
compassion so that our immigration policy can be a lifeline to 
our brothers and sisters who are deserving and in search of 
simply a life that you and I have either adopted or that has come 
automatically to us. The responsibilities of this new department 
include immigration applications, level setting, 
federal-provincial relations in terms of immigration programs, 
visas, refugees, enforcement, settlement, citizenship 
applications and citizenship promotion. We are changing how 
we do citizenship in this country.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	No longer are we going to have citizenship court judges 
because the system imposed on them was a financial and time 
burden that simply was not worth it anymore. There were 10,000 
people in the backlog every month who wanted to become 
citizens.
<P>
	In my area of metropolitan Toronto it took almost two and a 
half years in some cases from the time they got an application 
until the time they swore an oath. That simply was not good 
enough. One court judge had to do a one on one. We were 
approving 95 per cent of all applicants. I concluded that for 
saying yes to 95 per cent it was simply taking too much time and 
costing too much money. Therefore, we have moved to an 
administrative process, a classroom style, a written test rather 
than a one on one verbal. We are also adding standards and 
consistency across the board.
<P>
	We are not losing sight of the ceremony of citizenship which 
all of us as members of Parliament have or hopefully will 
participate in because it is such a moving tribute and it helps us 
with immigration. Why? Because we are not going to hide 
citizenship in a court. We are going to move it to a school 
auditorium.
<P>
	When I was in the riding of the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester, we did it in a school auditorium in front 
of the kids, the parents, the rate payer groups, police 
representatives and RCMP and the local media. Neighbours of 
these citizens came out to see them.
<P>
	The bogey persons as we now call them because we have to be 
politically correct, and bogey persons is a name that people 
sometimes attach to those who are the newcomers, who are 
they? Are they like us? Who are these people? There they were 
on a stage raising their right hand and swearing allegiance to our 
country. What a beautiful testimony it was. It is our Prime 
Minister and  our government that is pushing those out to the 
community not as the exception but as the rule.
<P>
	Citizenship court judges for the most part did a wonderful job. 
No one is blaming them personally at all. It was the system that 
needed changing. Instead of citizenship court judges we are now 
going to ask the Order of Canada recipients on a 
non-remunerative basis to officiate. That adds greater elegance 
and profile.
<P>
	For instance on the opening day of Citizenship Week we held 
a special court at the University of Toronto. We had three Order 
of Canada recipients on stage with us: Knowlton Nash, June 
Callwood and Maureen Forrester. Those three were better 
known than the minister, never mind the citizenship court 
judges. Everybody lived with Knowlton Nash for 30 or 40 years 
in this country. For years the last thing people thought about 
before they went to sleep was Knowlton Nash. All of a sudden 
Knowlton Nash is there on the stage celebrating citizenship. 
Does it not add greater testimony to the importance of 
citizenship when we include Order of Canada recipients across 
the country? I think it does.
<P>
	On July 1 it will be the first such occasion in Halifax in 
ceremonies on pier 21, our answer to Ellis Island, our Statue of 
Liberty. Millions of immigrants came through pier 21. Second 
and third generation sons and daughters go back when they visit 
Nova Scotia. They go to see pier 21 that their dad or mom talked 
about. That is our Statue of Liberty. There will be a citizenship 
ceremony at pier 21. There will also be one in Toronto. For the 
first time Order of Canada recipients will be officiating to let 
people know that the changes we made are happening.
<P>
	Citizenship and immigration go hand in hand. That is why the 
new department will take a lead role in strengthening those 
values, obligations and responsibilities that I talked about.
<P>
	This month marks the 125th anniversary of our immigration 
programming. Interestingly enough this is not the first time that 
Parliament has engaged in a debate on the establishment of the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration. Almost 45 years 
ago today Prime Minister St. Laurent constituted a Department 
of Citizenship and Immigration. With today's legislation we are 
in fact learning from our history and from our past where we 
have to obtain lessons and inspiration from time to time.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I would like to quote briefly what M. J. Coldwell said in the 
House of Commons 45 years ago. He was not a Liberal, but he 
was acknowledged as one of the great parliamentarians of his 
day. On November 26, 1949 Mr. Coldwell said, and I quote: ``In 
my view the placing of matters related to immigration and 
citizenship under one Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration is a wise move. It is essential that people who come 
here as immigrants should be not only welcome, but also taught 
to value 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5193"> 5193 </A></B>
<P>
the citizenship of this country and to have an appreciation of 
what Canada means to them''.
<P>
	Like Mr. Coldwell, I am a citizen of Canada and an immigrant 
and I am deeply aware of the value and importance of the words 
immigrant and citizen.
<P>
	All members of Parliament recognize the need to overhaul our 
immigration policies and to consider the long term role of 
immigration in that nation building exercise. All of us recognize 
the need to improve the immigration system. No one has the 
virtue of a monopoly of concern. There are things that work very 
well. There are other things that clearly need modification.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons we are doing a 10-year policy 
framework. I do not believe that immigration is done annually. I 
do not believe that immigration is done on a short term basis. 
Immigration to our country of Canada is a long term investment. 
You do not do settlement in six months. You do not take an 
individual and pretend that after six or 12 months that person is 
integrated. We know that it is more generational. We know that 
at the intake the country to a certain degree pays for the 
integration of those individuals. As the individual goes on in 
Canada, he repays that loan to the point that he is repaying more 
than the initial loan. That is then the net benefit to our country 
economically, socially and culturally.
<P>
	That is why we are also doing a broader consultation. We 
cannot do a 10-year policy without inviting Canadians into the 
tent. The days when setting levels and not including 
municipalities are over. Why should we include municipalities 
in the business of immigration? We see mayors and reeves and 
councillors complaining that they never knew the levels for the 
next five years. They did not know the numbers more or less that 
would be coming to their city or town and, therefore, they could 
not plan a resource accordingly.
<P>
	I went last week to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities 
meeting in Winnipeg. I delivered a strong commitment of this 
Prime Minister and government that those days are over. No one 
forced us to do this, but what makes sense is what is worth doing.
<P>
	Why should boards of education be on the outside looking in 
when they too complain that they never knew the number of kids 
born of immigrants or refugees that came into the school 
system. They could not plan. They could not resource. So we 
have included boards of education in our consultations.
<P>
	Unions and labour movements, the same thing, people who 
have a concern with our unemployed membership. How many 
people are you bringing in? What skills are you bringing in? Are 
you looking for scales in construction or high tech or the new 
economy? What is the mix?
<P>
	For the first time in many years we are enlarging the tent and 
giving a place for people to stand. We have opened up the 
consultations in an unprecedented way since 1976, when 
another minister of immigration offered the green paper and 
basically built the amendments, very significant amendments, 
as a result of  consulting Canadians. We hope to do the same. 
That process is under way.
<P>
	We are also including the public. We have five town hall 
meetings planned across the country. My first one tonight is in 
Montreal. We have eight study circles on specific issues across 
the country.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	We have 10 working groups working with Canadians on 10 
specific issues which 50 Canadians from all walks of life 
identified as key issues.
<P>
	All the members of Parliament in this Chamber were given 
from my office a kit that would try to provide information and 
direction on how members of Parliament could provide 
leadership in their own ridings, touching base with Canadians, 
NGO groups, lawyers and advocates. When we opened it up, 
sure we took risks. Do you not think it is a risk opening anything 
up? Of course it is because when you open yourself up you open 
yourself up to a spectrum of issues and this is not a public 
relations exercise.
<P>
	If we are looking just for public relations then I am suicidal 
because the consultations that took place in October are the 
fullest that can be had, an election.
<P>
	We have a majority government. We have a red book that we 
are following so we could have said that we are on course. We 
are not doing this for public relations gimmickry because no one 
makes us do this. We want to do this because we believe it is the 
right thing. If we allow things to fester on the outside and ignore 
them, my attitude is that those festers grow and become bigger 
and unmanageable, and we have a problem when things are left 
unattended.
<P>
	The objective of government is to provide good government, 
leadership and inspiration and you do that by tackling problems 
or concerns or fears that Canadians have and we work them out.
<P>
	I believe by being open we can work them out. I have people 
coming to me saying I should close the doors: ``Why are the 
doors being kept open when my Johnny and my Susie cannot 
find a job? What gives you the right to keep those doors open?''.
<P>
	I do not want to ask Mrs. Smith or Mr. Jones to get out of my 
way-``I have my mind made up. It is a red book. We are a 
majority government. Who are you?''. I am not going to be that 
kind of a minister because we cannot afford that luxury. Mr. 
Smith or Mrs. Smith, talking about Johnny or Susie, love Johnny 
or Susie as much as we love our own kids. If we heard one thing 
in the campaign it was that parents had it pretty good in Canada 
but they were really concerned about their kids, their future, 
their education, their career. If I heard one thing in my riding it 
was: ``Mr. Marchi, we have had a pretty good shake but I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5194"> 5194 </A></B>
<P>
worried that my kids get the same kind of good shake I have and 
I fear for them now, given the state of the economy''.
<P>
	Mrs. Smith or Mr. Jones has that concern out of love for their 
kids. I love my Adrianna as much as they love their Johnny and 
Susie and so I will never say to those parents ``get out of my 
way''.
<P>
	I also will not do something that some people are prepared to 
do and embrace Mrs. Smith and say ``You are absolutely right. If 
your Johnny or Susie does not have a job obviously I have to 
close the doors''.
<P>
	I am not going to be that minister either, as much as I care for 
that Canadian. What I prefer to do as a minister, which speaks to 
this consultation, is say: ``Mrs. Smith, Mr. Jones, it is time that 
you and I sit down. It is time that you and I looked at the facts. It 
is time that you and I break some bread, look at the facts, ask 
ourselves if immigrants will help Johnny and Susie or hurt them, 
if economics is the discussion of the day''.
<P>
	I can ask a Mrs. Smith and a Mr. Jones in Toronto if they think 
immigrants cost us jobs or create jobs. Toronto has been in an 
economic funk for a few years and I believe a lot of people 
would say they would cost us jobs today because of how that 
economy has dealt a fatal blow almost to the metropolitan area 
and that we are now coming out of it.
<P>
	I am realistic to note that the feeling would be immigrants can 
cost us jobs. If I were to go to Vancouver, the part of the country 
the Secretary of State for International Affairs comes from, and 
ask a Canadian if they think immigrants create or cost us jobs, 
they would say undoubtedly: ``Mr. Marchi, are you kidding me? 
Look at Vancouver. Look at British Columbia''.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the reasons we do not know the <I>r</I> word, ``recession'' is 
because of immigrants, of business investment from the 
Asia-Pacific, for instance.
<P>
	One Canadian in Vancouver, one Canadian in Toronto, they 
cannot both be right. There has to be one general answer and I 
know it depends on how many in a certain class we have, where 
they go and what their skills are. That is why it is not only the 
numbers game. Is it the 250,000 or is it the 150,000 the Reform 
Party talks about? I would like to see where it is also going to be 
prepared to cut. It does not tell me that.
<P>
	However, let us put that argument to the side because the other 
numbers game is within the categories: what is the number of 
family versus independent versus refugee versus student visa 
versus all the other categories?
<P>
	Both those Canadians cannot be wrong or right generically. I 
hope to sit down and find that common cause and common 
ground with Mrs. Smith. I believe that on the whole, immigrants 
create economic activity, whether it is because they buy a 
product and lead a recovery through consumership which we 
have not yet seen in this country-until we do we will not see a 
full economic recovery-whether it is because of the dollars 
they bring into this country through their savings, whether it is 
the entrepreneurs who create a business.
<P>
	I believe that at the end of the day, and most studies will 
confirm this-we need to do more work on it-on the big picture 
immigration creates economic activity. If we can break bread on 
some common ground, maybe we will put to rest the popular 
wisdom that every time one gets into an economic downturn one 
needs to close the doors to immigration.
<P>
	Maybe we can also do with that popular wisdom what they did 
with those who suggested that the popular wisdom was that the 
world was flat. If one thought it was round, they thought of 
taking that person away somewhere. It was clear that it was flat 
because one could look way out there and of course earth fell at 
the end of the last apartment building at the end of the highway. 
One can not even begin to think that the world is round when we 
are walking nicely and smoothly on a flat piece of green carpet 
in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Popular wisdom was wrong there. We have a lot of popular 
wisdoms that do not build countries. Popular wisdoms do not 
build countries. They do not give momentums to countries. They 
do not create values. We know that and that is the exercise.
<P>
	I believe that if you sit down with Mrs. Smith and Mr. Jones, 
they are fair minded. They are tolerant. This country is not less 
tolerant. Look over the course of 25 years where they measure 
unemployment and immigration. Sure there are ups and downs. 
Take the average. Do not point to me the worst case. Do not be 
the media on the negative cases.
<P>
	I will admit that tolerance is down during an economic 
recession but then I will ask members to look where it is when 
we are having an economic boom. If members want me to look at 
one, they are going to have to look at the other. Then we will 
have to take an average and then we will say where the tolerance 
level is for Canadians.
<P>
	I strongly believe that Canadians are fair minded and tolerant. 
They want to be presented with the facts. They do not like abuse 
nor should they. We should not be tolerant with people who have 
no business being here but we should not take that out on the 
entire policy. I believe in that tolerance.
<P>
	I have speaking notes that my officials put together that I will 
not read because I tried to cover the essence of this department.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5195"> 5195 </A></B>
<P>
	I will end on a very personal note. Maybe I should not do it but 
I will do it anyway. I fought a nomination battle in 1984 that was 
the toughest battle that some of us go through. We had it Monday 
night at seven and we ended up on Tuesday morning at 3.30 a.m. 
on the third ballot. We then went to our favourite Italian banquet 
hall, Tony's ballroom, to celebrate until six in the morning. I 
went home and showered and went looking for a campaign 
office because Liberals were still fighting Liberals because their 
Liberal candidate had decided three days into the campaign not 
to seek office.
<P>
	We were all in a tiff-the Conservatives that year as we 
know-and some of us survived, but it was a tough campaign. I 
felt so pumped up as we all do after a nomination that I went into 
the toughest part of my riding, the Conservative end of town, in 
the south end.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	I took my wife and we went door knocking right after we 
found a campaign office. I knocked on my very first door and a 
60-year old gentleman came out and said: ``Yes, what can I do 
for you?''. I said: ``Hi, I am Sergio Marchi and I am your Liberal 
candidate. I just wanted to say hello and hopefully capture your 
confidence in this election''. He said: ``What is your name?''. I 
said: ``Sergio Marchi''. He said: ``What kind of a name is 
that?''. I said: ``It is a Canadian name. My parents are Canadian 
and I am a Canadian so I guess that makes it a Canadian name''. 
He said: ``Don't give me that. What is the background of your 
name?''. I said: ``I was born in Argentina. My parents are Italian 
born and we came here in 1959''. He said: ``Kid, my parents 
have been dead 25 years and if they thought I would vote for an 
Italian MP they would turn over in their graves''.
<P>
	I looked at my wife and my wife thought I was nuts, but we 
both thought without saying it, ``this is our first door and this is 
the response. We have to go through this for a campaign''.
<P>
	Being a stubborn Canadian of Italian background, rather than 
doing what each of our campaigns tells us to do-when you meet 
someone like that keep moving, do not waste time-I stayed 
there.
<P>
	I stood there and said: ``Who are you going to vote for?''. He 
said: ``None of your business''. I said: ``You are absolutely 
right, but I have lost your vote so what does it matter?''. He said: 
``I am going to vote Conservative''. I said: ``Do you know who 
your Conservative candidate is?''. He said no. I said: ``Do you 
want me to tell you?''. He said sure. I said: ``His name is Frank 
DiGiorgio''. He looked at me and said: ``You think you're kind 
of a smart ass, don't you?''. I said: ``No, sir, I am telling you the 
truth''. He said: ``For the first time in my life I am voting 
Socialist''. I said: ``Do you know who your Socialist NDP 
candidate is?''. He said no. I said: ``I'll tell you''. He said ``I 
don't want to know''. I said: ``I don't care, I am going to tell you 
anyway. His name is Bruno Pasquantonio. Sir, you cannot get 
any more Italian than that. So unless you  want to vote 
Communism or unless you don't want to vote give me five 
minutes''.
<P>
	He invited my wife and me in for tea and I made a second 
mistake. Any campaign says not to have a tea or coffee or a glass 
of wine, keep moving. I went inside and we spent 10 minutes at 
our first door.
<P>
	The beauty of this story was, and it is a true story, when we 
moved on to the next door there was a sign on that gentleman's 
lawn that said ``Elect Sergio Marchi, Liberal, York West''. It 
was not that he took a Liberal sign. The essence of that first door 
for me is the story of our department today, that once he had seen 
that I did not have thorns or horns in my head, that he felt I went 
to the local school, that I spoke English, that I was capable of 
mixing it with the best and not being any worse or any better, 
that the boogie persons came down, he said: ``Put a sign on my 
lawn''.
<P>
	That is the debate and the discussion I want to have with Mrs. 
Smith or Mr. Jones because if I would have went to the second 
door I would have spoke ill of that first person who came out and 
offended me. However, we stayed there and the two of us 
chatted. He had up my lawn sign. That is the Canadian way. That 
is tolerance. You would not have thought it initially, but it was.
<P>
	That is the essence of doing the consultations the way we are 
going to do them. Citizenship and immigration is a natural and it 
has worked for the country. None of us believes that nation 
building will stop at the end of this parliamentary day. Nation 
building is an ongoing march and an ongoing exercise and 
immigration is one of those tools to shape and mould a better 
Canada for all of us. That is why it gives me great privilege and 
honour this morning to move the acceptance of this bill at 
second reading.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Madam Speaker, I am rising 
today to join the debate on Bill C-35, establishing a Department 
of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	This bill also amends a number of acts: The Access to 
Information Act, the Department of Multiculturalism and 
Citizenship Act, the Employment and Immigration Commission 
Act, the Financial Administration Act, the Immigration Act, the 
Department of National Health and Welfare Act, the Privacy 
Act, the Public Service Compensation Act and the Salaries Act.
<P>
	As you can see, Madam Speaker, it is a fairly complex piece of 
administrative legislation. The minister has just told us that it 
was his decision to transfer immigration from the former 
Department of Public Security to the Department of Citizenship 
and Immigration. The original switch was made arbitrarily by 
the Conservative Party in June 1993. We in the Bloc attacked 
that original Conservative decision, because it associated 
immigration and immigrants with criminal acts probably 
constitut-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5196"> 5196 </A></B>
<P>
ing  attacks on the security of the state. We strongly opposed the 
decision by former Prime Minister Kim Campbell.
<P>
	In light of the far-reaching re-organization by the new 
Liberal government, and of the bill's complexity, we would have 
preferred the government, and in particular the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, to provide us with a detailed 
document explaining the Bill.
<P>
	We will vote against the bill at second reading, because it 
contains certain clauses that we cannot accept. For example, 
clause 4 provides that ``the powers, duties and functions of the 
Minister extend to and include all matters over which 
Parliament has jurisdiction relating''-and I want to stress that 
word ``relating''-``to citizenship and immigration''.
<P>
	This strikes us as too broad and too vague a provision. We 
would like the Minister's area of jurisdiction to be defined 
clearly and precisely. In any event, we want to avoid abuse of 
these powers by the Minister, and duplication of work done by 
other departments and government agencies.
<P>
	Above all we want the minister to respect scrupulously the 
scope of the provinces' jurisdiction over immigration. We have 
already criticized the minister's intrusion into an area of Quebec 
jurisdiction, the orientation and training centres for immigrants. 
We will never permit the minister to interfere in education, 
which is exclusively a provincial responsibility.
<P>
	Another major objection to this bill is found in clause 5, 
which specifies as follows: ``The Minister, with the approval of 
the Governor in Council, may enter into agreements with any 
province, group of provinces or any agency thereof''-and I 
stress the word agency-`` or with any foreign government or 
international organization, for the purpose of facilitating the 
formulation, coordination and implementation of policies and 
programs for which the Minister is responsible''.
<P>
	We do not agree that the word ``agency'' should be included in 
the Act. It is dangerous. The federal government must negotiate 
and sign agreements with the provincial governments 
responsible for these agencies. Using a word like that, the 
federal government could short-circuit the authority of the 
provinces, something we find unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Another clause we cannot accept in its present form is clause 
10, amending section 4 of the Multiculturalism and Citizenship 
Act; this clause reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include all 
matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to multiculturalism and 
Canadian identity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As well, clause 11 adds the function of promoting the 
understanding of Canadian identity. This provision does not 
exist in the legislation now in force. Why does the government 
want to add it now, if not to block the rise of the sovereignist 
movement in Quebec? Furthermore, the respective 
responsibilities that the Department of  Citizenship and 
Immigration and the Department of Canadian Heritage will have 
are not clearly delineated.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are not unaware that Canadian unity is a 
subject that profoundly divides Quebec and English Canada, the 
government and the opposition. Why does the government want 
to include this controversial provision in a bill whose sole 
objective should be to provide a legal structure for the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration?
<P>
	We shall vote against this bill on second reading, and we want 
it to be referred to the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration for consideration.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to criticize the minister, once again, for 
launching his show on Canadian identity at a time when the Bloc 
Quebecois has elected two-thirds of MPs from Quebec, on the 
eve of a provincial election that the Parti québécois will win, and 
on the eve of a referendum to be held in 1995.
<P>
	It is clear that the government organized these hasty and 
premature consultations on citizenship with the sole objective 
of blocking the battle by the people of Quebec. The review of the 
Citizenship Act was not in any sense a priority, either of the 
government party or of the opposition parties. A resolution to 
that effect and discussion at a recent convention of the Liberal 
Party of Canada held in Ottawa in May 1994 raised no interest 
among the delegates.
<P>
	The minister should on the other hand concern himself with 
the solution to concrete, more immediate and pressing problems 
such as the backlog of more than 220,000 requests made by 
permanent residents who often have to wait several years before 
getting their citizenship and Canadian passport.
<P>
	We also denounce the minister's intention to close the 
Citizenship Office on Saint-Denis Street, at the corner of 
Beaubien Street, in Montréal, and his decision to transfer and 
centralize visa functions in Ontario and Alberta.
<P>
	In addition to citizenship, the new department is also 
responsible for immigration, a matter of shared jurisdiction 
between the federal government and the provinces ever since 
Confederation, in 1867, pursuant to section 95 of the British 
North America Act.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Canada, then a country of 3 million inhabitants, adopted its 
first immigration act in 1869. On June 25, we will be 
commemorating, as the minister said earlier, the 125th 
anniversary of this first act and of the first Canadian programs in 
this area.
<P>
	I would like to pay tribute, here, to the 12 million newcomers 
who have since arrived in Canada. Together with the First 
Nations and the two founding nations, they have build this 
country. They continue to arrive from all parts of the world to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5197"> 5197 </A></B>
<P>
participate and contribute to Canada's and Québec's economic, 
political, cultural and social development.
<P>
	As an immigrant myself for the last 20 years and as critic for 
the Bloc Quebecois in matters of citizenship and immigration, I 
want them to know that my party and myself greatly value their 
precious contribution to the building of this country.
<P>
	We believe jurisdiction in immigration matters should belong 
exclusively to Québec. Québec must be able to exercize all 
powers in this area in order to maintain its demographic weight 
and its survival as a distinct society and as the only 
French-speaking state in North America. Québec has always 
claimed this jurisdiction and you know, Madam Speaker, that 
today it has its own department, the ministère des Relations 
internationales, des Communautés culturelles et de 
l'Immigration.
<P>
	Québec has made progress, but insufficient progress 
compared to what is at stake. Since 1971, Canada and Québec 
have signed several agreements on immigration. In 1971, the 
Cloutier-Lang agreements were signed; in 1975, the 
Bienvenue-Andras agreements.
<P>
	The third and most important is the Couture-Cullen 
agreement which was signed in 1978 under the Parti québécois 
government. The agreement signed in February 1991 by 
ministers McDougall and Gagnon-Tremblay increases and 
clarifies Québec's powers in the field of immigration. 
According to that agreement, Québec has the right to select the 
independent immigrants who wish to settle in the province.
<P>
	Apart from selecting immigrants, Québec looks after their 
integration and determines the immigration levels for the 
province. The francization of immigrants is the responsibility of 
the COFIs.
<P>
	According to this agreement, Canada remains responsible for 
national standards and objectives concerning immigration, the 
admission of immigrants and the control of visitors related to 
criminality, health and security as well as the administrative 
handling of requests and the physical admission at the various 
entry points.
<P>
	Québec is therefore exclusively responsible for the selection, 
reception and integration of immigrants destined for the 
province. As for the immigration levels, the federal government 
must, before April 30 of each year, inform Québec of the options 
under study concerning future levels of immigration by category 
of immigrants.
<P>
	For its part, Québec must, before June 30 of each year, that is 
in a couple of weeks, inform Canada of the number of 
immigrants, also by category, which it expects to admit in the 
year or years to come.
<P>
	I might add that the Immigration Act requires the minister to 
consult the provinces on demographic needs, labour-market 
issues and regional distribution.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	One very important aspect of this agreement is the formal 
commitment on the part of the federal government to withdraw 
from reception services, linguistic and cultural integration, 
counselling and placement programs for immigrants.
<P>
	The Government of Canada provides fair compensation to 
Quebec in respect of such services. The province was awarded 
financial compensation as follows: $75 million for 1991-92; 
$82 million for 1992-93; $85 million for 1993-94 and $90 
million for 1994-95. Any subsequent compensation levels will 
correspond to the basic amount of $90 million and will increase 
to keep pace with overall federal expenditures.
<P>
	Getting back to my historical narrative, with an eye to 
industrializing the country and opening up the West, Canada 
recruited a vast pool of foreign labourers, primarily Chinese 
peasants. The Rockies were breached and East and West were 
united by the railway. This migration movement which lasted 
until World War II involved solely the Northern Hemisphere. 
Immigrants were British, Americans, Finns, Italians, Russians, 
Germans, Ukrainians, Jews, French and Polish.
<P>
	However, following World War II, decolonization and 
communication advances gave rise to new migratory flows, and 
these are likely to increase in the coming years.
<P>
	In 1990, the United Nations Population Fund warned that the 
global population would increase by one billion during the 
decade of the nineties.
<P>
	Most of this increase would occur in developing countries 
where the birth rates were highest. Many of those seeking to 
immigrate favour the more prosperous, less populated 
countries. Canada and Quebec rank high on their list because of 
their resources and wide open spaces.
<P>
	Canada and especially Quebec are interested in taking in a 
considerable number of immigrants because of their low birth 
rates. Moreover, we also lose a part of our population to 
emigration. It is estimated that emigration levels represent one 
quarter of immigration levels. For example, during the 1980s, 
more people emigrated to Italy from Canada than vice versa.
<P>
	Under the McDougall and Gagnon-Tremblay agreement, 
Quebec can receive a number of immigrant proportional to its 
demographic load, plus 5 per cent. This means that in theory, 
Quebec could receive 30 per cent of all immigrants admitted to 
Canada.
<P>
	In fact, Quebec received 47,532 of the foreign nationals 
admitted to Canada in 1992, that is to say approximately 19.2 
per cent, which is roughly equivalent to the average observed 
over the past five years, which was 19.1 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5198"> 5198 </A></B>
<P>
	This debate on Bill C-35 leads us to take a brief look at this 
government service, the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration, which is seeking to legalize its organization but 
has in fact already moved beyond the preliminary stage. And 
what we have before us is not very encouraging.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Because of timid, ambiguous and inconsistent policies, we 
cannot find out where the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration is going. He favours never-ending consultations 
and takes forever to make decisions. He enjoyed a period of 
grace, but it is over. He had raised some hope after the 
questionable, inefficient and at times inhuman management of 
the Conservatives. Today, his inconsistent policies are widely 
criticized, in particular by immigration lawyers, refugee 
advocacy groups, ethnic groups, government officials, and so 
on. You will probably find that out this evening in Montreal.
<P>
	He has made public two reports he had commissioned 
himself, namely the Hathaway report and the Davis-Waldman 
report. Clear and specific recommendations were made, but the 
minister does not know what to do with them. He suspends 
deportations, but does not say what will happen to the 10,000 
refugee status claimants whose applications were turned down 
by the Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>
	My office has received numerous inquiries on this subject and 
officials know as little as we do. Meanwhile, asylum seekers are 
left in limbo. Which files will re reviewed? By whom? When? 
Under what circumstances? No one knows.
<P>
	Another example of inconsistency is this announcement made 
by the minister to the effect that potential refugees may be 
submitted to a lie detector test to prevent fraud, which is illegal 
as far as we are concerned. What a ridiculous idea!
<P>
	The minister and immigration authorities sometimes show 
deep ignorance of the extremely dangerous political situation in 
some countries that refugee claimants come from and 
occasionally they show a lack of compassion as well. For 
example, take this case of a pregnant young woman who was 
deported on February 23, given sedatives without her consent 
and returned to her country of origin, Zaire, which is devastated 
by an insidious civil war. I said to the minister and I repeat: 
``Such a serious case deserves an independent inquiry because 
such behaviour is unworthy of a civilized society''. Why does 
the minister refuse to order such an inquiry?
<P>
	There is another area where mistrust is systematic. More and 
more people who do not have passports are required to go to the 
consulate or embassy of their country to get one, even though 
they are already recognized as refugees. You know, if a refugee 
has to go to the consulate or embassy of his home country, his 
life could be in danger, and especially the lives and safety of his 
family still in the home country.
<P>
	Furthermore, I ask the minister to refer any new appointment 
of IRB commissioners to the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration. So far, this committee has 
reviewed no appointment, despite allegations of patronage in 
some cases.
<P>
	Finally, I wish to denounce the minister's decision to hold 
consultations outside Parliament on immigration levels and 
policies for the next five years, at a cost of over $1 million.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration 
should be responsible for these consultations, which are a 
priority for the Official Opposition and for public opinion in 
Canada and Quebec. All parties are represented on the 
committee-the government party, the Official Opposition and 
the Reform Party. This is not the case on the various working 
groups set up by the minister, from which the Bloc Quebecois is 
totally absent. It is not democratic to hold these consultations 
without the opposition being present.
<P>
	For all these reasons, we will vote against Bill C-35.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Madam Speaker, let 
me preface my remarks by saying I support the consolidation of 
the functions of immigration and citizenship within the new 
ministry of citizenship and immigration. It is a logical 
combination and needed to be done. I am glad it has been done 
with such expediency providing the hon. member from the Bloc 
here a follow through, at least not with objections but rather 
support.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to wish my hon. 
colleague, the soon-to-be official Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, the very best. This portfolio needs a lot of support 
and I realize it is a difficult position. It requires extreme 
wisdom, caution and concern. The department deals with more 
than just dollars and cents. It deals with people's lives. At the 
same time we must also realize that this department, along with 
all other departments in the government, must examine their 
financial commitment and the way money is spent.
<P>
	As opposition members we must bring to the attention of the 
department of immigration the requirement to examine all its 
expenditures and do its share in reducing the massive debt and 
deficit that the country faces. The Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration is also required to balance the needs of Canada 
with our international commitments, that portion of the 
hundreds of millions or so of migrants in the world that are 
seeking a place in Canada.
<P>
	Canada has a long tradition of humanitarianism when it comes 
to immigration. We have a legacy that is unique to just a few 
nations on earth of being built almost entirely by succeeding 
waves of immigrants. That legacy  has become etched into 
Canada's collective conscience. It has become part of our 
self-image as Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5199"> 5199 </A></B>
<P>
	However, the present day manifestation of a legacy of 
immigration in Canada is now in a precarious position. The 
majority of Canadians, while being thankful for our immigrant 
past and while still treasuring Canada's tolerance toward 
newcomers, are mystified at the direction the immigration 
policy has gone in the last 10 years or so.
<P>
	They see present day immigration patterns no longer as a boon 
but are concerned about what is happening. That is a problem to 
which our new immigration and citizenship minister must pay 
very careful attention. Any government that ignores the wishes 
of the majority of the population for significant policy change is 
staring grave political danger in the face.
<P>
	While I congratulate the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration on his post and on behalf of Canadians wish him 
the best of luck I am saddened to report that some of the policies 
of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration have gone 
awry. Canada had grave problems with immigration policy six 
months ago and those problems are even greater today.
<P>
	Six months ago concern was expressed that Canada was 
accepting too many immigrants. That is a frank statement I 
know. It is a statement that will send many stakeholders, as they 
are called in modern bureaucratic parlance, into a tizzy. It is a 
fact. Today there are but three major immigrant-accepting 
countries in the world: Canada, Australia, and the United States.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is fond of 
talking about immigration targets in percentages, so let us do 
that. The United States and Australia both take in yearly about .4 
per cent of their population as immigrants. This year, as this 
government frequently points out, Canada will accept 1 per cent 
of its population as immigrants. That is .25 times the number of 
immigrants per capita as the next closest immigrant accepting 
nation on earth, 2.5 times as many immigrants yearly.
<P>
	The Reform Party on the other hand thinks that Canada should 
accept about 150,000 immigrants yearly. For this modest 
proposal my colleague, the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, accuses us of being inflammatory and 
anti-immigrant. Getting back to percentages, 150,000 
immigrants per year represents about .55 per cent of the 
population.
<P>
	Therefore, if the policies of the Reform Party were enacted 
Canada would still be accepting by a wide margin more 
immigrants than any other nation on earth, even with that 
adjustment. For that we have sometimes been accused of being 
anti-immigrant and inflammatory. Who is being inflammatory: 
the Reform Party for suggesting that Canada continue to be the 
leading immigrant-accepting nation on earth, or the minister for  
suggesting that we are anti-immigrant or that we have an 
anti-immigrant bias? The answer is more than clear.
<P>
	The Canadian people have been told that immigration targets 
were based on facts, that there was data which suggested the 
necessity of accepting one-quarter of a million immigrants per 
year. Well, we are still waiting. Where are those facts? They 
have not been presented in this House and they have not been 
presented to the Canadian people.
<P>
	The closest the minister has come to presenting a factual basis 
for his government's claim that Canada needs to accept the 
equivalent of the population of Calgary in the next three years 
has been to dredge up a 1991 report by the Economic Council of 
Canada, despite the fact that on page 32 of the report in its 
conclusion it calls this year for a target of about 175,000 
immigrants. It also says that 250,000 immigrants per year or 
more would not be advisable because Canada would have 
difficulty integrating that level. Some facts, and that is all this 
minister has been able to produce.
<P>
	I am happy to say there are facts out there. If this minister is 
short on empirical data, I would be more than happy to help him 
with some of the numbers. Here are some facts: Since 1979 the 
performance of immigrants in the economy has dropped 
dramatically. It used to be that immigrants had a higher level of 
education and higher levels of income than Canadians. Well, no 
more. The sheer number of immigrants means that immigrants 
are having more and more difficulty adapting socially and 
economically than they ever did before.
<P>
	The minister talks about the need to replenish an aging 
population. The facts are these: Canada's population is not in 
decline. In fact it is growing and will continue to grow even 
without immigration until the year 2026, when our population 
will top 30 million. That is without immigration. From then it 
would go into a slow decline before levelling off some 100 years 
from now at between 18 to 20 million. The fact is that even the 
demographic review says if Canada really wants to increase its 
population, the way to go about doing that is to create incentives 
to fertility, in other words within and not through immigration.
<P>
	The minister has spoken about an aging population and about 
a demographic shift that can only be cured through immigration. 
Again the facts are quite different. All the demographic research 
to date makes it very clear that immigration will never solve the 
aging of the population. Why? Because immigrants are getting 
older too. Research has already clearly proven that the average 
age of immigrants coming into our country is about four years 
younger than the average age of the Canadian born or the 
Canadian population.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5200"> 5200 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Research indicates that trying to make the population younger 
with immigrants will not solve the impending social security 
crunch. The only way to do that is to raise the productivity of all 
Canadians, to raise everyone's standard of living in order to 
replenish and enrich the tax base. Right now, countries like the 
United Kingdom and Sweden are where Canada will be in the 
future in terms of an aging population. They have solved the 
social security crunch not with immigrants but through sensible 
economic measures.
<P>
	Those are just some of the facts. Unfortunately, I do not 
believe this minister has the facts to support the government's 
contention that 250,000 immigrants are vital to Canada. Why 
250,000? Why are these incredibly high immigration numbers 
maintained? I do not know and I do not believe the Canadian 
people know. Does the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
have the answer? If he does, where is the data to support it?
<P>
	When this year's immigration targets were released in 
February the question remained about selection and the 
selection process. The government said that of the 250,000 
immigrants to Canada this year 44 per cent would be immigrants 
from the independent class. Those are immigrants who have 
been selected according to their skills, their education and their 
ability to quickly adjust to Canada and to make a positive 
contribution.
<P>
	The government's own numbers reveal that there is not 44 per 
cent from the independent class, not 40 per cent, not 30 per cent. 
In fact only 15 per cent of a quarter of a million immigrants this 
year will be from the independent class. The minister arrived at 
this questionable 40 per cent figure by adding to the number of 
independent immigrants their spouses, their children and their 
parents, all brought in under the family reunification program.
<P>
	That is not what we should expect from this department which 
indicates the minister and the department wants to make the 
immigration program more transparent for Canadians. Let us 
lay it all out on the table the way it really should be.
<P>
	The Reform Party wants to bring some sense back into the 
refugee system. Canada should be proud of its record of 
accepting immigrants. Over the past few years no other nation 
on earth has accepted as many refugees as Canada on a 
percentage basis of our population. However, our refugee 
determination system is out of control. We are now accepting as 
refugees about 70 per cent of all claimants who make it to our 
shores. The world-wide average for refugee acceptance is 14 per 
cent. We will accept about 30,000 refugees this year.
<P>
	The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has 
estimated that there are about 60,000 people in the world who 
meet the description of a true or genuine refugee. That same 
agency estimates that last year of those 60,000 refugees fully 
35,000 did not find a safe refuge. In other words they had no 
country that would accept them. How is it possible then that 
Canada could accept 30,000 refugees while the UN estimates 
that world-wide between all of the refugee receiving nations on 
earth less than 30,000 refugees were accepted?
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	The truth is that only a small percentage of the people Canada 
accepts as real refugees are real refugees. The hard truth is that 
the majority of people who are granted refugee status in Canada 
are not refugees at all but economic migrants. These are people 
who see how attractive Canada is and want to start a new life 
here. We certainly cannot fault them for that, but they are not 
real refugees. They are not genuine refugees.
<P>
	If they desire to start a new life in Canada then they should 
have the opportunity to apply through regular channels like all 
other immigrants. Let us leave the quota spots open for real 
refugees, people who are languishing in camps and are displaced 
overseas, people who the United Nations tell us are in the most 
desperate of straits. Those are the truly needy. Those are the 
most deserving: Rwandans, Bosnians.
<P>
	The inland refugee determination process is an unbelievably 
expensive mire. When the minister says that Canada is living up 
to its humanitarian commitments, that just will not wash. We are 
not. We could be doing far more with far less.
<P>
	On page 337 of this year's estimates under the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration we read that the inland refugee 
claims cost Canadian taxpayers anywhere from $30,000 to 
$50,000 just to process their claims. Those are direct costs. 
Multiply that out and the bill to Canadian taxpayers is 
somewhere around $750 million to $1.25 billion, just to settle 
16,000 people whose refugee claims are accepted inland. It is 
easy to misunderstand big numbers like these until they are put 
into the correct perspective. Allow me to put that billion dollar 
number into perspective.
<P>
	The entire budget last year for the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees was just over $1 billion. With that 
amount of money the UN resettled or repatriated five million 
refugees. With that amount of money Canada resettled 16,000. 
There is something wrong.
<P>
	The refugee determination system is an injustice of mammoth 
proportions. Not only is it an injustice to Canadian taxpayers 
who have to foot the bill, but also to those tens of thousands of 
desperate genuine refugees overseas who are literally bumped 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5201"> 5201 </A></B>
<P>
off the list to make way for economic migrants who arrive, 
along with some refugees, and claim refugee status in Canada.
<P>
	The minister is aware of these facts. The minister is more than 
aware of the outcry which has been issuing forth from Canadians 
over some of the people the Immigration and Refugee Board is 
either allowing into the country or allowing to stay when their 
deportations are appealed.
<P>
	Several weeks ago in this House the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration promised to get tough with the system. Those 
are fine words but they do not correlate with his actions. This get 
tough minister has to answer for the following record which he 
has created in just six months on the job.
<P>
	The number of refugees accepted through the inland 
determination system has skyrocketed even from the 
non-refugee producing nations.
<P>
	This minister has appointed several dozen of the most 
unrepresentative appointees to the IRB that have ever graced the 
board. The vast majority of them have been immigration 
lawyers or advocates. It is little wonder that the acceptance rate 
has gone through the roof.
<P>
	He has supervised the expanding of the definition of refugee 
well beyond what it used to mean in Canada. It is well beyond 
anything the UN which wrote the definition ever intended. He 
intends to create a whole new layer for refugee determination, 
making it easier for failed refugee claimants to stay in Canada 
under humanitarian and compassionate grounds. All this is to 
happen in six months.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	The minister says he wants to do what all Canadians want for 
the refugee system. They want a fair, sensible system that is 
humanitarian, which takes care of those who are genuine 
refugees. We want to do our international share but we are not 
doing that.
<P>
	The minister says he wants to get tough. That is what we need 
to do. We need to get tough with the inland refugee 
determination system so that we can channel more of our 
resources into helping people who we know need the most help. 
That is not happening. Instead, the system is being fed this 
massive immigration and refugee bureaucracy. It feeds this 
massive industry of advocates and lawyers who are earning 
more than a decent living at the expense of the taxpayer and real 
refugees.
<P>
	Some years ago Canada began the process of drafting a treaty 
agreement with the United States relating to asylum. This treaty 
would mutually recognize Canada and the U.S. as safe third 
countries for the purpose of asylum. The effect of such a treaty 
would be to stop people from asylum shopping between Canada 
and the United States. It would prevent those with the economic 
wherewithal to travel from passing through the United States 
before entering Canada and declaring themselves to be refugees.
<P>
	This is not a hard measure. This is not an inhumane measure. 
It is common sense. This process should stop. Over 7,000 people 
last year travelled through the United States before registering a 
refugee claim in Canada. That caused an enormous drain on our 
refugee determination system and has the effect, once again, of 
limiting our ability to divert our resources to those refugees who 
need our help the most.
<P>
	There have been calls for the minister to sign the agreement 
which has been in the drafting stage for some time now but he 
refuses. The minister says that until the United States adopts a 
refugee determination system similar to Canada's, he will not 
enter into the treaty. I can assure the minister that will not 
happen. The Americans will never adopt our system.
<P>
	Canada has an international reputation for accepting almost 
anyone as a refugee who manages to make it here. This year, 
almost 70 per cent of all claimants have been accepted as 
refugees. The U.S. would never agree to adopt our system. In 
fact it is talking otherwise. Neither will Australia and neither 
will Europe.
<P>
	I believe the minister, before he left for the western European 
nations really could not teach those European nations much 
about immigration that would be acceptable to them. It is time 
for Canada to sign the treaty with the United States. It should 
have been signed a long time ago. It is not enough just to talk 
tough. There has to be some action.
<P>
	Since this department began its operation, the minister 
promised he would consult Canadians to determine what the 
future would hold in terms of immigration policy. The minister 
is spending $1 million to set up town halls, to distribute 
questionnaires around the country in order to determine what 
Canadians think about immigration. At least that is what he 
says.
<P>
	In fact the concluding document of the Montebello meeting 
where this consultation process was devised makes the 
minister's real intention more than clear. In the document, we 
read of the need to convince the majority of Canadians who 
oppose current immigration levels that they are wrong and that 
the government is right. We read of the need for public 
education. We read of constructively engaging the press and 
putting a positive spin on ultra high immigration levels. That is 
called consulting when in fact it is nothing of the sort.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party stands for including the public in national 
debates on vital issues. It is necessary. The minister knows that 
Canadians want to be included, so this process was set up. Is it to 
pacify Canadians? Is it to make them feel included when the real 
goal is to shut them out by controlling the dialogue? It is a good 
question to ask.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5202"> 5202 </A></B>
<P>
	Needless to say the Reform Party wants all Canadians to have 
their voices heard in the immigration debate. In fact we want to 
let Canadians decide the major immigration issues by way of 
national referenda. Why could there not be a referendum on the 
levels, the numbers and why should there not be one on the 
selection process? It is quite easily arranged. However there will 
be no immigration debate under this government. There will be 
an immigration mandate. If Canadians do not like it, then they 
can attend one of the education classes to learn how to properly 
think about immigration.
<P>
	The minister said that he wanted an expanded role for the 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. What has 
been done? The committee has derailed the important work and 
a strawman issue has been developed instead. The minister has 
decided that the Citizenship Act needs to be rewritten. He has 
decided that the committee needs to spend its valuable time 
looking at issues that no one thought needed review at this point 
in time, certainly not a review that would cost the taxpayers tens 
of thousands of dollars, a review that would take up weeks of the 
committee's time, a review that will call on Pierre Trudeau and 
Mr. Dressup to tell us what it means to be a Canadian.
<P>
	What a waste of time. The committee ought to be spending its 
time reviewing the very questionable appointments to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. It ought to be examining the 
effect that the highest rate of immigration in the world is having 
on Canada. It ought to be looking at ways to make the refugee 
determination system more effective, more humanitarian. 
Instead the minister insists that we redefine Canadian 
citizenship. Is that reasonable?
<P>
	It was revealed to the House that immigrants are not tested for 
HIV before entering Canada. They are tested for TB. They are 
screened for cancer or kidney disease. They are tested for 
syphilis. But there is no testing for AIDS.
<P>
	After this revelation the minister promised to look into the 
issue and take the necessary steps to bring Canada's medical 
testing requirement into the 20th century. That was a month ago. 
What action has been taken? Nothing.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No committee?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> No improvement. At one time immigration was 
a boon for Canada. It could be again. But in order for 
immigration to play a positive role, in order to truly balance the 
needs of Canada against our humanitarian role in the world, we 
need to bring a little common sense into the debate. We need to 
make tough decisions. Talking tough is not enough. Talking 
about lie detector tests and opening the doors even wider to 
inland refugee claimants and appointing people with vested 
interests to the Immigration and Refugee Board is the height of 
hypocrisy. It is pandering to the old style. Talk tough and then 
take the opposite direction.
<P>
	Canadians expected more from this government, much more, 
but they have gotten the same old gang. Nothing has changed. It 
is just getting worse. With the consolidation of the functions of 
immigration and citizenship in one department came a mandate 
to really do some good: to respond to Canadians, to make some 
changes that would benefit newcomers to Canada and Canadians 
born here. But we have nothing of the sort. Canadians are 
demanding change. They want immigration levels to be tied to 
economic cycles. They want immigration to have a positive net 
effect on the economy. That is not too much to ask. The world's 
other immigrant receiving nations tie immigration levels to the 
state of the economy. Why do we not?
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	In fact one of the provinces sets immigration levels to the 
economic priorities of the province, the province of Quebec. I 
believe that the government has something to learn from what 
the province of Quebec is doing on immigration levels.
<P>
	Canadians are telling me that the bulk of immigrants, not just 
a tiny percentage, should be chosen by Canada as independent 
immigrants. We need immigrants. We need immigrants with 
education, high tech skills, an ability to quickly adapt and 
contribute. Instead 85 per cent of immigrants are not chosen by 
Canada. They chose us.
<P>
	It is neither unreasonable nor uncompassionate for Canadians 
to demand that those immigrants who come to Canada be chosen 
by Canada. The minister knows that. He has had the time to react 
or enact reform that would ensure that a higher percentage of 
immigrants are hand picked but that has not been done. If 
anything, the number of independent immigrants could actually 
be falling.
<P>
	We need this new ministry to fundamentally re-examine the 
refugee determination system, a review that is more than just 
window dressing and more than just adding new layers of 
bureaucracy in an attempt to streamline. It is time to make the 
refugee system answer to taxpayers and to answer to a 
world-wide need for Canada to accept a higher percentage of 
UN recognized overseas refugees.
<P>
	Canadians want the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration to have the sort of review and reporting power the 
government has promised. The committee should be choosing 
its agenda rather than having an agenda handed down to them 
from the minister in order that it be distracted from the real job 
at hand. Immigration is in trouble in Canada. Never has a higher 
percentage of Canadians expressed such opposition to the 
current immigration policy.
<P>
	The <I>Financial Post</I> over the weekend reported that even the 
government's backbenchers are expressing outrage and 
frustration in their communities over an immigration policy 
which has gone wrong.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5203"> 5203 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians recognize, rightly, that immigration is no longer 
working for anyone. It is not working for Canada. It is not 
working for immigrants. Most disappointing of all, the minister 
in the past six months has not taken any substantial action to 
solve the immigration problems. In fact he has exacerbated them 
by increasing the levels, loosening the refugee system, 
appointing the wrong people to the IRB, and trying to 
manipulate the opinions of Canadians.
<P>
	I would caution the minister. The Canadian people are not 
easily manipulated. It is time to start listening. It is time to take 
real action, action that is in line with the get tough promises that 
the minister made in the past.
<P>
	I wish the minister success for the sake of Canada and for the 
future of immigration to Canada. I hope he does well but if the 
past several months of the workings of the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration are any indication I am not 
optimistic.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would advise the 
House that we are now on 20 minutes for debate and 10 minutes 
for questions and comments.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to rise and take part in this debate today. Although this 
effectively is basically a piece of housekeeping legislation, it 
nonetheless has quite significant meaning.
<P>
	The previous government had moved the Department of 
Immigration into the realm of public security as if perhaps there 
was some danger to the security of Canada to be feared from 
those who choose to come here or who come here to find refuge 
from countries where law and order and justice and those values 
that we treasure so dearly in Canada are not treasured quite as 
dearly.
<P>
	We on this side of the House do not feel we have anything to 
fear from people who seek to come to this country for a variety 
of reasons. We on this side of the House are proud that Canada is 
one of only four countries in the world which receives people.
<P>
	There is a certain amount of babbling going on across the way, 
but I shall endeavour to rise above it. The hon. member from 
Calgary tells me he is returning the favour. He should return it 
slightly more sharply. I might appreciate it more.
<P>
	In any case, there are a number of points that were raised by 
the other hon. member from Calgary who is the third party critic 
for immigration and citizenship. A couple of those I would like 
to address because I was offended. I want to say that I was 
offended.
<P>
	I am offended that the hon. member does not think that 
citizenship is important in this country. I am offended that here 
in this wonderful and historic Chamber, the Chamber of Laurier 
and Macdonald and Trudeau, that someone who represents the 
people of Canada could think that citizenship is not important, 
that  someone could suggest that the people who have been 
requested to give their opinions on the review of the Citizenship 
Act are somehow not of importance.
<P>
	I am surprised this would be the response. I am surprised 
given the very hard work that has been put in over the last 
number of weeks and the hard work that will be continued into 
this review on citizenship. I am surprised and a little bit 
disappointed. To be quite frank, I am a lot disappointed. 
However, in the words of a former great cabinet minister in this 
House, the late Angus L. Macdonald, when he was premier of 
Nova Scotia, perhaps one should just consider the source.
<P>
	I have a few other things that I would like to say. First of all, I 
am absolutely astounded at the numbers that the hon. member 
suggests are legitimate refugees. We know that the 
displacements in the world, the horrors in the former 
Yugoslavia, the problems in numerous African countries, and 
the problems with totalitarian governments in other areas of this 
world have created an unprecedented number of refugees.
<P>
	To hear the hon. member speak, you would think this was not 
even a ripple on the horizon. That is just not so. There are more 
refugees than that in one refugee camp. The hon. member should 
retract that statement. However, I leave that to his notable good 
judgement.
<P>
	I am also absolutely astounded at his percentages. There are 
words that can be quoted, for example his very famous quotation 
that even the devil can quote Scripture. With regard to his 
statement that the percentages that we are allowing in are 
somehow at an unprecedented high, if the hon. member would 
like to look back just to two or three years ago, he would see that 
the number of refugees accepted in this country was higher by, I 
believe, 12 per cent than it is today. Where we are is definitely 
within the normal realm of acceptance of refugees.
<P>
	He talked about the 14 per cent that is the world average. Of 
course that would be the world average if we add in all those 
myriad countries that do not accept any at all. Either the hon. 
member's logic or his mathematics tends to suffer. Of course it 
would be unkind of me to say that, so I will not.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I also want to talk about something the hon. member raised 
with regard to the fact that people coming into Canada are not 
tested for HIV and that the minister promised to do something 
about it four weeks ago. The hon. member should know-I 
thought he knew; maybe he does not know-that the enabling 
legislation and regulation on medical matters under this 
department's aegis has remained unchanged for 40 years.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member advocates a screaming leap into the 
void by the government without a proper review before bringing 
in legislation and amendments, but I want to make perfectly 
clear that neither this minister nor the department has any 
intention of bringing legislation before this House until it is 
adequately prepared and until the situation is adequately 
covered.  That is the way good government works, to make sure 
that when we bring in legislation to change things that definitely 
need to be changed in this country, that we have covered all the 
bases. In other words, going from A to B to C to D will probably 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5204"> 5204 </A></B>
<P>
prevent grief as opposed to jumping from A to D and probably 
falling in a ditch, if I may mix my metaphors, on the way there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Careful the wheels don't fall off.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Oh no, they will not fall off. The hon. member 
for Edmonton knows very well that will not happen.
<P>
	The figures and statistics quoted by the hon. member for 
Calgary were most puzzling, given in particular that I know he 
has received many of the briefings from the department. For 
example, the $30,000 to $50,000 for the processing of a refugee 
in Canada is far out of line. That is so incorrect as to almost be 
ludicrous except for the fact that when the hon. member stands 
in this House and makes this statement with his authority as a 
member of Parliament, people out there might believe that he 
was accurate if it was not corrected, if the facts were not brought 
forward.
<P>
	It reminds me of the old joke I know what I believe in, don't 
confuse me with facts. The facts are that when a processing costs 
that much-oh, they are getting upset, calm down, take a 
Prozac-it occurs when all avenues of the system are being 
exhausted. In other words, that includes an appeal to the Federal 
Court of Canada. It includes all of the side venues that may be 
taken by a refugee in dealing with the Immigration and Refugee 
Board. It is not the average. It is not even close to the average. 
What is particularly offensive is that the hon. member knows 
that. If he does not know it, he should try and find out.
<P>
	What we are talking about ostensibly today is the setting up of 
the immigration and citizenship department. This is long 
overdue. It is very important. What it does is streamline and 
modernize government to give government the tools needed to 
deal effectively with all of the complex citizenship and 
immigration issues.
<P>
	On that note, it is necessary to remind hon. members opposite 
who sometimes look at the area of immigration with perhaps, 
forgive me, a less than generous attitude of mind that these are 
very complicated issues. We live in very complicated times.
<P>
	In my travels around the country since I was honoured to be 
appointed the parliamentary secretary to the minister, I have 
talked to many, many people about the subject of immigration. I 
am absolutely edified every time I come away from town hall 
meetings, meetings with NGOs, meetings with people who live 
and work on the front lines of day to day Canadian society 
dealing with the settlement of new Canadians. I am edified at the 
generosity, at the open hearts of communities across the 
country, at the belief in the hearts of average Canadians that 
immigration is something that built this country, that 
immigration is good for this country and that continued  and 
expanding immigration can only improve this country. Every 
one of us here is an immigrant. Whether we came here 50 years 
ago, 200 years ago or whether, like my hon. colleague the 
member for the Eastern Arctic, we came across the land bridge 
from Asia 5,000 years ago, we are all immigrants.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I look around on this side of the House right now. Just in front 
of me I can see four different ethnocultural backgrounds. Over 
here in this corner we have too many Irish people. However, that 
is the glory and the wonder of this country, that we come here 
together, that we represent all the aspects of Canada at its most 
diverse and that we continue to do so. Immigration is what made 
this country strong. Immigration is what made it diverse and 
immigration is what will keep it strong, diverse and unified.
<P>
	I think it is a little sad that some of our colleagues are not 
prepared to understand just how important not just for Canada to 
thrive but the survival of Canada the continued inter-weaving of 
this mosaic is. We are not a white-red country. We are not a 
country that is homogenized and ever so slightly dull. 
Sometimes it can be a little too exciting living in this country, 
fortunately not dangerously so but sometimes stressfully so.
<P>
	I do not think that any one of us, certainly on this side of the 
House, would change where we live. I do not think we really 
want to change the conditions under which we live our day to 
day lives in spite of some of the things we hear from day to day. 
In spite of some of the things that are said I think we as 
Canadians understand just how desperately important the peace 
and security of this country is to our continued success.
<P>
	Part and parcel of that is the way the government deals with 
immigration. The government feels so strongly that on the day 
the government was sworn in the Prime Minister stated that the 
creation of a separate Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration under its own minister which would bring together

Public Security and Human Resources portfolios plus the 
citizenship registration and promotion programs of the 
Canadian heritage department would be established. This is 
what this legislation is doing.
<P>
	I might make a comment also on some remarks made by the 
critic from the Official Opposition when he talked about the fact 
that there was confusion because of overlap between 
immigration, citizenship and multiculturalism. With the 
greatest of respect to the hon. member, I beg to differ. I beg to 
differ with the hon. member on a number of things but I beg to 
differ, there is no confusion. Yes, there are overlapping areas. 
This is only sensible and only to be expected because clearly 
there are areas in all three that tend to come together.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member that the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration along with the Department of 
Multiculturalism are very clear where the  complementary and 
where the overlapping policies lie. This government has a very 
strong commitment in each of the areas to ensure that policy and 
program go forward in the best interests of all Canadians from 
coast to coast.

of immigration to Canada. I feel most strongly that the hon.

	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House 
to pay tribute to a truly great Canadian, Ambassador Arthur 
Andrew.
<P>
	The late Mr. Andrew was a resident of Halifax and I am proud 
to say my friend. He made a career out of promoting Canada and 
Canadian values. He described himself as a professional 
Canadian; a very accurate phrase indeed. He had a distinguished 
32-year career with the Department of External Affairs serving 
in various high ranking diplomatic posts across the globe, 
including ambassador to Israel, Sweden and Greece. He was 
assistant undersecretary of state for External Affairs for three 
years.
<P>
	After this major career with the Department of External 
Affairs, Mr. Andrew became a professor at the University of 
Kings College in Halifax. While teaching at Kings he continued 
to be involved in Canadian diplomacy and foreign policy 
publishing many articles on these issues. He also was one of 
three founders of the Ethiopian airlift out of Halifax along with 
our colleague the MP for Don Valley West and Peter Dalglish.
<P>
	On behalf of the House of Commons I would like to extend my 
most sincere condolences to Arthur's wife, Joyce; his daughters, 
Stephanie and Victoria; and to the rest of the family. He was 
truly a great Canadian.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian citizens are still allowed to own a very large 
number of military and paramilitary weapons and they can also 
own revolvers as long as they first obtain a free certificate. A 
majority of Quebecers and Canadians favour a complete ban on 
these weapons. I think that there should be a ban on the 
possession of military-and paramilitary-type weapons and of 
most semi-automatic weapons.
<P>
	It is unacceptable that the Mini-Ruger 14 used in the 
Polytechnic massacre is still a legal weapon in Canada. This and 
other types of weapons cannot be tolerated in a free and 
democratic society.
<P>
	We can no longer hide from the reality that weapons are a 
scourge in our society. And we can no longer ignore the 
smuggling of military armaments and weapons of all kinds that 
the Liberal government prefers not to see. The time to act is now.

want to apologize to all members of the House, aboriginals and 
residents of the Atlantic provinces who have been offended by 
remarks I made or was alleged to have made in the House 
recently.
<P>
	From the controversy over my remarks I have learned that it is 
not wise in the political arena and in front of the media to use the 
same techniques I have employed successfully during my long 
career as a lecturer. In the future I will be very careful in the use 
of strong analogies and illustrations to bring out crucial points 
of analysis.
<P>
	The main point of my remarks was that the policies of the 
government toward those in need of support require a 
fundamental re-examination because they have not worked. 
These policies have created dependence and significant social 
problems. New approaches to these problems are needed.
<P>
	I am saddened that analogies taken out of context and the 
misrepresentation of my basic points have distracted from an 
open and frank discussion of problems which are of vital 
importance for the well-being of all Canadians.
<P>
	Judging from the messages I have received, very many 
Canadians want to see such a discussion.

Speaker, yesterday, the president of the Université du Québec à 
Montréal, Mr. Claude Corbo, concluded to the failure of a 
federal policy. Indeed, by stressing ethnical and cultural 
features, the Canadian policy on multiculturalism leads 
immigrants to the impasse resulting from a fragmented culture 
and an extended marginalization.
<P>
	According to Mr. Corbo, the efforts made by the federal 
government for ethnic and cultural communities are suspicious. 
Mr. Corbo added that the policy could increase the minorization 
of the Quebec identity or to rob it of its originality.
<P>
	We can only conclude that this policy, which dates back to the 
Trudeau era, has failed in two ways. Indeed, on the one hand, it 
has not helped integrate minority groups, while on the other 
hand it has failed, in spite of the unspeakable objectives of its 
architects, to rob the Quebec identity of its originality.

children. It is vital to the preservation of our sense of justice, our 
values and our convictions.
<P>
	Given the significance of the family's role in society, state or 
special interest agendas must not be allowed to diminish the role 
of the family. The freedom of the family to raise its children 
according to its own unique needs and convictions must be

preserved. Government programs should encourage rather than 
discourage parental responsibility for their family and any 
trends that demean the role of the family must be challenged.

	Canadian families have been lacking a clear, strong federal 
voice. My colleagues and I intend to change that and provide 
leadership by speaking for the family and developing policy 
alternatives that would encourage, strengthen and protect the

<P>
	The importance of the transportation component to business 
is fundamental. We are reminded of it almost every day. 
Transportation plays an essential role in the competitive cycle. 
In the business community where advantages are harder than 
ever to come by, efficient, intermodal and competitively priced 
transportation is essential to success.
<P>
	With the emergence of a truly global economy, the ability to 
forecast and adapt to international and national change is 
essential for transportation.
<P>
	Given the world-wide demand for effective intermodal 
services, it is most appropriate the theme of the 25th National

<P>
	In just 23 years Environment Canada has made significant 
contributions to our understanding of the environment and the 
consequences of our interaction with it. The department in 
broadening its approach to environmental issues no longer 
focuses on individual problems but treats the entire ecosystem 
as a unit of interdependent elements.

development and the notion that everything we do affects the

well as Jewish. He built the movement which today has 
representatives in every centre of Jewish life working to build a 
better quality of life for Jews and non-Jews alike.

	We are witnessing in his departure the end of an era. I am sure, 
though, that it is not the end of the ideals of Jewish values and

Saturday's issue of the daily <I>Le Droit </I>mentions that a report 
tabled in the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages 
reveals, once again, the true nature of Canadian federalism. The 
Prime Minister refers to an idyllic country where one can freely 
express himself or herself in French from coast to coast. 
However, that vision does not reflect the daily reality in the 
federal public service.
<P>
	Indeed, some French-speaking civil servants feel they could 
be severely penalized, by being isolated, excluded or by having 
their career opportunities affected, if they express their right to 
work in their mother tongue. The notion of a bilingual Canada 
was probably a nice dream, but the fact is that the public service 
is not bilingual: francophones are merely tolerated. Also, 
Canada is not recognized as the union, based on equality, of two 
founding nations, since Quebec is also merely tolerated in that 
federation.

Reform Party principles are designed to preserve and strengthen

<P>
	Reforming our parliamentary system and putting the levers of 
direct democracy into the hands of Canadians will ensure that 
family values carry more weight with the federal government. It 
will also ensure that national policies reflect the interests of all 
Canadians and their families rather than the interests of a 
politically connected elite.

	Through fiscal and economic reforms the burden of taxation 
would be reduced, sparing tomorrow's families the economic 
consequences of still more borrowing and wasteful spending.
<P>
	Reform's tax policies would ensure fair treatment for

against Haiti at this time, including the cessation of commercial 
flights into Haiti. Commercial flights on the part of Air Canada 
are to cease by June 25. We are doing what we can to make sure

dual Canadian-Haitian citizenship.
<P>
	We are in day to day contact with Air Canada to make sure that 
all those people who so desire will leave Haiti. Air Canada today

force to Haiti.
<P>
	Is the government prepared to indicate whether Canada still 
rejects the option of military intervention in Haiti, an option that 
is being mentioned more and more in Washington and that is 
apparently the only option that will be sufficient to get rid of the 
military junta and bring back President Aristide?

before to strenghthening existing sanctions against Haiti 
including an increase to commercial sanctions in terms of the 
freezing of bank accounts against Haiti. It is our view that 
sanctions have to be given a full opportunity to be effective.
<P>
	I just returned from a meeting of the Organization of 
American States in Belem, Brazil last week and it was also the 
view of the majority of the states of the hemisphere that 
sanctions should be given as much support as possible at this 
time in order that there could be a peaceful resolution to the 
difficulties in Haiti and that President Aristide can be returned 
to his rightful place as president of Haiti.

law also reflects a common understanding. To change the 
definition of family would be to shift some of the most deeply 
felt foundational values of our culture.
<P>
	Could the minister on behalf of the government define family 
for this House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think I would refer the hon. 
member to a much more reliable source of dictionary definition 
than I can provide. I can tell her that those of us on this side of 
the House share her sentiments about the importance of family. 
It motivates what we do. It influences policies we develop. 
Strengthening the family is a fundamental objective of the 
government.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Insofar as a definition is concerned, we are quite happy to go 
with the commonly accepted definition. I commend the 
dictionary to the hon. member if she wants more detail than that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Dictionary of Canadian Law gives this definition: 
``Family includes a man and a woman living together as husband 
and wife, whether or not married, in a permanent relationship, or 
the survivor of either, and includes the children of both or either, 
natural or adopted-and any person lawfully related to any of 
the aforementioned-''.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair is having difficulty in that we are 
asking for definitions and then giving definitions. The Chair 
always waits for the final question to come, but I would ask the 
hon. member to please couch her questions so that they deal with 
the administrative responsibility of the minister in charge. If the 
hon. member could please put her question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, could the minister tell us if he 
agrees with the definition as found in the Canadian Dictionary of 
Law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, if that is indeed what the 
Canadian Dictionary of Law says I am sure that for the purposes 
of that dictionary it is quite adequate.
<P>
	I am sure also that, as the hon. member well knows, the 
English language is a rich and beautiful one which can be used 
and adapted to suit contexts as appropriate. I am sure the hon. 
member will bear that in mind.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure that we do have ministers who can 
deal with the more precise English, but if the question is to be 
put to a specific minister I would ask that it deal with his or her 
administration responsibility in government
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, not long ago the minister floated a trial balloon 
suggesting that the Liberal government is considering 
redefining the family perhaps as households.
<P>
	Given the historic gravity of such a redefinition, will the 
minister commit to a broad formal process of consultations with 
Canadians before undertaking such a monumental task?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can remember testifying 
before the standing committee on human rights and persons with 
disabilities, speaking in answer to a question about the prospect 
of relationships being relevant for the purposes of government 
programs. I did not deal with households but rather with 
relationships, a term for which there is a precise definition 
available.
<P>
	At the same time I made it clear that we would be consulting, 
discussing and listening to Canadians as we explore the best 
possible ways to deliver essential government programs in 
accordance with fairness and equity.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Human Resources Development. For 
millions of parents the preferred method of caring for their 
preschool children is to care for them at home. The Income Tax 
Act only allows tax breaks for parents who send their children to 
daycare, but not for those who forgo income in order to take care 
of their kids at home.
<P>

treatment to the majority of families who prefer to care for their 
children in their own homes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a matter which can be 
properly and very effectively addressed during the course of the 
major review we have under way on a wide range of social 
programs. I advise the hon. member to submit his views in a 
brief for consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my brief was 
duly submitted about two weeks ago. I hope the minister gets a 
chance to read it.
<P>
	An Angus Reid and CTV poll released today suggested that 
most parents would rather care for their preschool children in 
their own homes. This confirms much of what my colleagues 
have been saying all along. The current federal tax rules make it 
more expensive for parents to care for their children at home 
than to send them to daycare. All parents should have the 
freedom to choose what form of care is best for their children.
<P>
	When will the government stop penalizing millions of parents 
who choose to care for their preschool children at home?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is expressing a 
strong concern about the strength and value of the Canadian 
family. I am sure he also recognizes there is a wide variety and 
diversity of family activities.
<P>
	Many families are involved in the workplace these days. It has 
become a very major change and a very positive change in our 
society. It also creates certain pressures and certain kinds of 
responsibilities which can best be handled if good child care is 
available. We want to make sure there is a balance between the 
interests of looking after children, whether the parents decide to 
stay at home or whether they are in the workplace. In keeping 
with the broad philosophy of our party we want to make sure 
there is a balance of views and not simply one-sided views.

	There are alternative ways of interpreting this term that are

<P>
	Quebec has already done more than its share to rationalize 
Canadian shipyards and MIL Davie has also done its duty by 
submitting a new business plan. Yet its order book remains 
empty and the federal government is still slow to make clear its

contraband cigarettes were really working against the health of 
Canadians and cheap cigarettes were readily available for young 
people to start up smoking. We had to take action and we did. We

	As you know, Mr. Speaker, I am unable to go into the specifics 
of this case because of the ongoing investigation. I want to 
assure this House that the serious allegations against this 
individual are being investigated by immigration officials.

<P>
	Will the minister please clearly state the Canadian position 
regarding military intervention in Haiti.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America

last time I was asked this question. Canada is committed to 
trying to make sure that sanctions are enforced and that they 
have their total possible effect before any other action is taken. 
Canada is not contemplating or supporting at this time any other 
action except the support of total sanctions. For that reason we 
are cancelling our commercial flights into Haiti and 
strengthening our commercial sanctions against Haitians at this 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the problem 
is that the sanctions are just not working. In fact the abuses are 
getting worse and worse.
<P>
	I think the Canadian public is demanding more serious 
answers to the questions that we are raising about decisions that 
are being made. I think the big concern is what kind of clean-up 
action might be necessary for Canadian peacekeepers if in fact 
military intervention did occur.
<P>
	We need to know the answers to these questions before we can 
make that decision.

have not been as effective as they might have been. But the fact 
is also that we have not had the opportunity to enforce total 
sanctions against Haiti. We believe that given that chance and 
the co-operation of all members of the international community 
that sanctions can have a positive effect and we will be able to 
bring about peaceful change to democratic government in Haiti, 
including the return of President Aristide to Haiti.

Indian Affairs what Mr. Jerry Peltier's responsibilities and 
status in that department were during the Oka crisis, in the fall of 
1990. The Minister of Indian Affairs was not able to provide an 
answer. Can the minister now tell us what Mr. Peltier's mandate

Affairs during the Oka crisis, in 1990?
<P>

has said I do not know if I could look into what the former 
government's thought process was or what it was doing.
<P>
	My friend makes mention of a response. I did give him a 
response. I gave my friend the response in writing. It was to the 
extent that there was, I forget the exact numbers because it has 
been a couple of months now, about $200,000 paid to a group in 
Oka. Of this I think $50,000 approximately-I will give him the 
correct figure later, as a matter of fact he has it in his letter-was 
paid to a numbered company. Beyond that I do not know the role 
of Mr. Peltier in any shape or form. I know he was in there. I 
know he was helping out. We would have to go back to what the

<P>
	Last week in Paris the minister stated that the government 
would not cut old age security payments. He said: ``This helps to 
protect the purchasing power of Canada's seniors and adds a 
measure of stability to their income''. I am glad to hear that.
<P>
	With the cuts in the last budget and the proposed cuts that the 
Minister of Finance has indicated, can the minister explain why 
the rationale for protecting seniors' pensions is not applicable to 
younger Canadians who cannot find a job and who are trying to 
feed and clothe their children? Why is not protecting their 
purchasing power and adding a measure of security to their 
incomes reason to protect them from cuts?
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member, 
let me give him one example. Because of the changes we 
brought about in unemployment insurance, a substantial 
reduction is taking place in the premium rate.
<P>
	As a result, beginning in July of this year the net addition into 
the pockets of all workers covered by unemployment insurance 
will be $230 each. That is a lot of purchasing power. It can buy a 
lot of kids' clothes, a lot of furniture and a lot of extras.
<P>
	That is the reason we need to reduce the premiums. Not only 
will it bring about more employment but it will put more money 
back in pockets so they can take it out and put it on the counter to 
buy Canadian goods or services.

Will the minister tell the  House if the required training courses 
introduced by the previous administration will be maintained 
and implemented in a cost efficient manner?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the primary focus of our 
effort is safety in the community and attacking crimes of 
violence. We will focus on illegal weapons being smuggled into 
the country. We will focus on enforcing those laws already on 
the books whereby people are punished for using guns in the 
commission of criminal offences.
<P>
	We will also look at other steps that can be developed with the 
support of caucus for making this a safer society. We will, as the 
hon. member has suggested, bear in mind the use which is made 
for sporting and other purposes of rifles and shotguns in the 
course of that work.

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
question of personal privilege.
<P>
	On June 2 and June 3 when I was not present in the House, the 
member for Simcoe Centre made some serious allegations, 
allegations which I think damage my credibility and thus 
impede my ability to function as a member of the House. The 
member opposite has brought into question my compliance with 
the conflict of interest code.
<P>
	I would like to set the record straight. I am disappointed that 
the member for Simcoe Centre made no effort to contact me or 
the assistant deputy registrar general in advance to ask for 
clarification. If he had taken the time to do some research he 
would have found that he was incorrect in his allegations.
<P>
	Within 30 days of my election as a member of Parliament, I 
spoke to and clarified with the assistant deputy registrar general 
what my requirements were to comply fully with the federal 
conflict of interest code. I then proceeded to meet these 
requirements by formally resigning as director and officer from 
the management of Dynamic on December 1, 1993.
<P>
	I would like to point out for the record that I was not 
technically required to resign from Dynamic until April 5, 1994, 
120 days after my appointment as parliamentary secretary. I did 
so because of my desire to act responsibly as a member of the 
House.
<P>
	I received a letter from Mr. Howard Wilson dated March 31 of 
this year in which he stated that he was satisfied that I had met 
all the requirements of the federal conflict of interest code. 
From this letter I quote: ``I am pleased to approve the 
arrangements you have made to comply with the requirements 
of the conflict of interest code''. With the unanimous consent of 
the House I would like to table this letter.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, the Chair of course never wants 
to cut off debate, especially on something so important as a 
point of privilege. I wonder if the hon. member for Vancouver 
South could please indicate to the Chair precisely which point of 
privilege he is raising and how this has impacted on his ability to 
serve in the House.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	Could the hon. member please be a little more precise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, my integrity is in question and I 
will be getting to that in just two more statements.
<P>
	The member for Simcoe Centre stated that on May 24 I was 
still an officer of Dynamic. This statement is incorrect. The 
member stated that I currently reside at the same address as my 
father. This too is incorrect.
<P>
	Let me state categorically for the record that my father does 
not live with me and, for that matter, I would be very honoured 
in my culture if my father did live with me. I would be happy to 
have him stay there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is this on the same point that the member is 
bringing up now?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Yes it is.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With all respect to my colleagues, I am not 
inclined at this point to see a point of privilege but perhaps if we 
heard from the other member who is involved in this there might 
be clarification.
<P>
	At this point, always keeping in mind that I reserve the right to 
come back to hear the wrapping up of the point of privilege, I 
would like to hear from the member for Simcoe Centre.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Point of 
order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I make these comments as government House leader with the 
utmost respect to you and your position. I think if we search the 
precedents of the House you will find many occasions when 
members have risen to make a personal statement under the 
guise of a statement of personal privilege to put on the record 
their understanding of a situation involving themselves person-
<P>

<B><A NAME="5218"> 5218 </A></B>
<P>
ally where things have been said about them that they do not 
consider to be accurate.
<P>
	I respectfully ask you, Mr. Speaker, to follow these 
precedents and allow the hon. member for Vancouver South to 
finish his statement before calling on anybody else.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With your permission, my colleagues, the 
Chair will finish hearing a wrap-up from the member for 
Vancouver South and then I will go to the member for Simcoe 
Centre.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, this member has questioned my 
integrity. He has not offered a shred of hard evidence. I ask the 
member for Simcoe Centre to apologize for misleading the 
House and for spreading misinformation.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will hear from the hon. member for Simcoe 
Centre.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, on June 2 and 
again on June 3 I raised the issue of a possible conflict of interest 
with regard to an arm's length blind trust set up by the member 
for Vancouver South for his company Dynamic Maintenance 
Limited of which he is a 50 per cent owner. The company was 
doing business with the government.
<P>
	The issue was brought to the attention of the government 
because of public information on file with the B.C. Ministry of 
Finance and Corporate Relations regarding the officers and 
directors of this company.
<P>
	The public record from the last annual statement with an 
accuracy date of May 24 showed the member as an officer of the 
company and listed both his father and father-in-law as 
directors.
<P>
	The home address-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I believe the hon. member for Simcoe 
Centre has put that information on the record prior to this. I 
wonder if the House would give the Speaker a chance to review 
the statements made prior to today and to come back to the 
House tomorrow with a ruling on this particular issue.
<P>
	The hon. member, would you please finish.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, it appears that 
someone agrees with the point we raised since on Monday, June 
6, just three days after I raised the issue, the B.C. ministry 
received a notice removing both the father and father-in-law as 
directors of the company.
<P>
	Rather than demanding a retraction, the member should be 
offering answers to questions raised about arm's length 
relationships.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, any time we get into this type 
of views in the House of Commons, by their very nature we are 
going to have different opinions. The Chair will review 
everything that has been said by the hon. member for Vancouver 
South and the Chair will review what has been said by the hon. 
member for Simcoe Centre.
<P>
	I would prefer not to make a decision now but I will come 
back to the House with a decision at the earliest possible time.

of witnesses and for the ability of the state to help to relocate 
witnesses and people who are able to help in the prosecution of 
crimes.
<P>

ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-35, an act to establish the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe I have 
three minutes but I would like to wind up, particularly since hon. 
members of the third party were so anxious to hear more of my 
speech before we broke for Question Period. I did not want to 
disappoint them.
<P>
	In conclusion, this bill is, as was stated by the minister and by 
others earlier, basically a housekeeping bill but it is a very 
important bill. It sets up the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration as a department standing on its own, not in the 
realm of public security, but in the realm of nation building.
<P>
	We are here in this government to fulfil our red book 
promises. We believe that a great way to fulfil those promises is 
through the method of immigration. We know that setting up this 
department in the manner to which the minister has alluded and 
in the manner the legislation sets up will be a good thing for 
Canada. We are in the business of building this nation to make it 
as strong and united from coast, to coast, to coast as we can.
<P>
	I support this bill with great hopes for the future of our great 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to get one item clarified on where the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration stands with regard to criminals 
who are non-citizens in our country.
<P>
	I want to make it perfectly clear that I am honoured to be here 
as an MP and an immigrant who received his citizenship not too 
many years back. I consider it a privilege to have been selected 
by my constituency to represent these people.
<P>
	One thing that is quite concerning in the hearts of the 
individuals in Wild Rose reverts to the case of Charles Ng in 
which we kept this individual in the country for a number of 
years, an extremely costly venture, millions of dollars I 
understand. We also recently had a conviction in the city of 
Calgary by another non-citizen who was considered to be here 
illegally and was a corrupt policeman I believe in his country of 
origin. He was convicted of murdering a policeman in my 
riding.
<P>
	Having visited the Kingston penitentiary recently I talked to a 
number of inmates who are non-citizens. Drumheller, Bowden 
in my riding, federal institutions, have a great number of 
non-citizens. One of the inmates who was a non-citizen stated 
that he purposely came to Canada because he found it easier to 
operate his particular drug ring in this country than anywhere 
else on this continent.
<P>
	I hear these kinds of things. What I am concerned about is the 
fact that we do have a number of non-citizens, serious criminals 
who are now confined and others who are awaiting indictment. 
Would the Department of Citizenship and Immigration support 
the idea of deportation of non-citizens who are convicted of 
serious crimes?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Wild 
rose for his intervention and his questions. I might add that we 
too are delighted that he is here both as an immigrant and as an 
MP and I hope that at a future time the hon. member as an 
immigrant and as a member of Parliament will stand in this 
House and talk about his own success story as a new Canadian 
and the success stories of many other new Canadians as well.
<P>
	As the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration frequently 
says, unfortunately it is too often the planes that crash that get 
coverage and get notice even here in this House as opposed to 
the planes that land. I look forward to the hon. member's 
intervention in that area.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	With regard to his comments about criminals and deportation, 
certainly the hon. member should know that the minister has 
said frequently, on more than one occasion both in the House 
and outside, that he has zero tolerance for abusers of the system, 
for people who commit crimes in this country or commit certain 
acts that were they within this country would be considered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5222"> 5222 </A></B>
<P>
crimes. We do not want to see or tolerate that kind of activity 
within our policy levels.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that the minister has promised 
legislation addressing these concerns will be forthcoming very 
soon in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to follow up on the point raised by my hon. friend from Wild 
Rose. I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary a question 
based on a statement he made which perhaps was not quite clear. 
Perhaps the parliamentary secretary will comment.
<P>
	If I understood the hon. member for Wild Rose correctly, he 
was proposing that criminals upon conviction be deported. If 
this is the suggestion in my respectful submission it does not 
make much sense at all. We would then be saying that if 
somebody who happens to be a non-citizen commits a murder 
and is convicted his sole penalty would be deportation to his 
country of origin, which does not make the slightest bit of sense.
<P>
	If the hon. member is suggesting that upon completion of 
serving any sentence imposed for the commission of a crime the 
Government of Canada should consider deporting a criminal, 
that is an entirely different matter.
<P>
	Would the hon. parliamentary secretary agree that it does not 
make much sense to deport criminals who have been convicted 
immediately? In my view that would encourage more people to 
come to Canada to commit crimes, knowing that their only 
penalty would be deportation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Scarborough West, my colleague both as a member of the House 
and as a member of the bar. Of course the member is absolutely 
right. The forthcoming legislation will respect all the principles 
of due process.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Wild Rose is suggesting that we would 
be saving money-heaven forbid that I should anticipate the 
hon. member's theories-the hon. member for Scarborough is 
absolutely right that we would be opening ridiculous floodgates 
for people who would come here and think they could do pretty 
much as they please: walk into any place in Canada and rob a 
bank and the only sanction would be deportation to the country 
of origin because there is no real process for these people to be 
tried, convicted and punished elsewhere.
<P>
	The point we are concerned about is ensuring at the end of the 
process that these people do not abuse the immigration and 
citizenship system in our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I 
should have clarified that a bit. I am talking specifically about 
those people who come here, commit crimes and are desperately 
wanted in their countries of origin.
<P>
	I am thinking of Charles Ng particularly. Why did we house 
him and spend millions of dollars for six years? We did not want 
to send him back to California where he was wanted for 22 
murders or something. Inmates from Drumheller, for example, 
have expressed openly that even though they were caught the 
penalties in this country were not very severe. They would 
rather be caught here then go back and face the penalties they 
would have to face in other parts of the world.
<P>
	I think we should analyse the whole issue. If it is a bigger 
benefit financially than punishment wise or whatever, we should 
probably consider sending them back.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand and sympathize with 
the sentiment of the hon. member. He and I have had this 
discussion before on other matters.
<P>
	One cannot legislate for individual cases such as Charles Ng. 
One has to legislate in the broad spectrum for all people. We 
cannot create a law that says this is what we will do here because 
we would be omniscient. We cannot anticipate what every 
situation will be.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	We have to pass laws within the context of the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, within the context of our criminal law and 
its precedents, and within the context of English common law 
and its belief in justice and due process. We have to do the very 
best we can within that context. The passage of law and the 
philosophy behind the criminal law, the immigration law, et 
cetera, is not entirely driven by financial exigency.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
we are debating Bill C-35 to formalize the department of 
immigration and citizenship. I do not oppose the creation of the 
department. However it is important for the House to consider 
the mandate of the department and the way that mandate is 
fulfilled. I would like to discuss one aspect in particular: the 
department's processing of refugees.
<P>
	Canada has undertaken, with the support of its citizens, to 
offer safe haven to people the world over who are in danger of 
death or serious harm in their countries of origin. It is help we 
are proud to be able to offer.
<P>
	I therefore want to talk not about whether we should continue 
to accept refugees-I believe we can and should do that-but 
about the process of how we determine to whom we should offer 
assistance in this regard. More specifically I want to talk about 
the acceptance of inland refugee applicants, those who are now 
in Canada, and how it affects refugees who cannot afford to 
come to Canada before applying.
<P>
	There are literally millions of people from all over the world 
who are in dire need of help. Even as we sit here safe and 
comfortable, many of these people are experiencing starvation, 
injury and even death. Most cannot afford or find a way to travel 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5223"> 5223 </A></B>
<P>
to safety in other  countries and are instead forced to wait until 
help reaches them where they are.
<P>
	According to a report by the executive committee of the 
United Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, in 1992 the world 
refugee population rose to a staggering 19 million. Some of the 
numbers mentioned in the same report were as follows: 420,000 
Somali refugees in Kenya; 80,000 Bhutanese in Nepal; 250,000 
refugees from Myanmar in Bangladesh; and 280,000 Togolese 
in Benin and Ghana. These are only a few of the many people 
around the world whose lives have been shattered and who are 
often living on the edge of survival. Nor is there any end in sight. 
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, already 
strained to the limit, has said in stark terms that ``the number of 
refugees continues relentlessly to grow''.
<P>
	In the face of this massive need for safe haven, Canada has 
offered to take in approximately 30,000 refugees this year. Of 
these, approximately half of the spaces are reserved for inland 
refugees already in Canada. Many of these refugee applicants 
are legitimate refugees who have overcome incredible odds to 
arrive on our shores and ask for help.
<P>
	We should also realize that a large number of inland refugee 
applicants are not legitimate refugees and come to Canada 
simply to find a better life. This is understandable and we should 
continue to encourage the arrival of productive individuals 
through immigration.
<P>
	Under the present policy there are well over 200,000 spaces 
available to people wishing to come to Canada as immigrants 
but a very limited number of spaces for refugees. In view of this 
it is important to take special precautions when deciding which 
inland refugees are legitimate claimants and which ones are 
simply seeking to skip immigration procedures, seeking to jump 
the queue by claiming refugee status.
<P>
	The United Nations has issued a warning to countries that 
offer asylum to refugees. In the words of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The line between the voluntary migrant and the refugee is a fine one. Yet it is 
important for states to be able to make the distinction in a fair and consistent 
manner so that people who genuinely need asylum are granted it, and so that the 
protection system for refugees is not overwhelmed with economically 
motivated migrants.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I share the concern of the UNHCR that if we continue to 
increase the numbers of inland refugee applicants accepted in 
Canada we will take away spaces from those people who cannot 
afford to come to Canada before applying for refugee status.
<P>
	A confidential report recently leaked to the media from the 
office of the minister of immigration brings to light some 
troubling facts. First, the acceptance rate of inland refugees has 
jumped under the minister's newly appointed board members. It 
is not a small increase but rather in the words of the minister's 
own staff it is:  ``the first really significant quarterly increase 
since the board's inception''.
<P>
	The report shows that fully 67 per cent of all inland refugee 
applicants are currently being accepted by the new board. This 
has had the effect of allowing 4,855 refugee claimants to stay in 
Canada or almost one-third of the total annual target of 15,000 
in the first quarter of 1994 alone. At this rate the full annual 
target of inland refugees will be met well before the year is up.
<P>
	What happens then? Will the minister expand the total 
available refugee spaces in Canada even though the services we 
are able to provide to Canadians are already strained because of 
our economic situation? Or, will the inland refugee category 
alone expand and take away spaces from refugees who cannot 
afford to come to Canada to apply for refugee status?
<P>
	If all inland applicants for refugee status currently applying 
were truly in fear of their lives it would be one thing, but the 
increase in acceptance rate leads to the conclusion that the 
immigration board is weakening the criteria in the case of inland 
refugees. The new refugee board vice-chairman has offered two 
alternative explanations for the increase but the facts tell a 
different story.
<P>
	One explanation is that a new streamlining process is in place. 
Yet the leaked report states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The proportion of claims completed in under four hours at traditional full 
hearings declined from 60 per cent during 1993- to 53 per cent in the first 
quarter of 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The report goes on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>New CRDD member appointments may largely account for the general 
decrease in the percentage of claims completed at the regular hearing in less 
than four hours.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This can hardly be characterized as streamlining.
<P>
	The second explanation is that a large number of Somalis and 
Sri Lankans have finally had their claims heard. It is 
understandable that the recent crises in these countries have 
produced a large number of refugees. However, again according 
to the report, the acceptance rate for inland applicants from nine 
out of ten source countries mentioned has similarly shot up; the 
most significant rates of acceptance being for refugee claimants 
from China, Pakistan and Israel. This across the board increase 
suggests that something other than recent outbreaks of violence 
in the two countries mentioned or a streamlined review process 
explains the increased rate of acceptance for inland refugees.
<P>
	I believe we owe it to ourselves and to the millions of 
legitimate refugees the world over not to apply sloppy 
procedures or the lowering of standards to dictate who will fill 
the limited number of refugees Canada can afford to help.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5224"> 5224 </A></B>
<P>
	We have already broadened the category of what constitutes a 
legitimate refugee to be the most open in the developed world. 
With increasing budgetary restraints in the country and with the 
tenfold cost of processing refugee claimants here instead of 
overseas, perhaps it is time we re-examined the criteria under 
which we admit inland refugee claimants to Canada. At the very 
least we have to stringently apply existing criteria.
<P>
	The recent case of Pedro Hugo, an admitted terrorist, is a case 
that exemplifies the current laxity of our refugee laws. After 
being returned to Peru and living there for 18 months, Hugo was 
returned at taxpayers' expense to Canada because it was alleged 
that the board had ``erred'' in judgment. Only after Canadian 
taxpayers, including hard working immigrants, had paid for 
Hugo's plane flights, legal aid and housing did the board come 
to the obvious conclusion for the second time that Hugo was not 
a legitimate refugee.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	In the face of 19 million refugees world-wide the vast 
majority of whom cannot afford to come to Canada to claim 
refugee status, we have a moral duty to be very careful about 
which inland refugee claimants we allow to stay in Canada. It is 
imperative we do not let misplaced generosity interfere with 
these decisions. Every person who comes here claiming refugee 
status because they want to find a better opportunity or because 
they simply do not like it in their own country is taking the place 
of someone who is in desperate circumstances or truly in danger 
for their lives.
<P>
	The decisions to be made are not easy ones but they have to be 
faced. In the words of Sadako Ogata the UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees: ``Resettlement should be driven by need rather 
than want''. Let us make sure we find and admit the real 
refugees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague from Calgary North for her 
very fine remarks. I think we are all very much in agreement in 
this House that the problem of refugees is a very delicate and 
sensitive one. Although I do not agree in the case of the inland 
refugee situation right now that there has been laxity on the part 
of the government, it is certainly true those who are here have an 
advantage over those who are not. We certainly should bear heed 
to what she says. We must be very careful to try to be as fair and 
just as we can.
<P>
	My comment pertains to a little slip the hon. member made in 
her speech. When she began she referred to the department as 
the ministry of immigration and citizenship. I immediately took 
note of that because of course in this bill we are talking about 
combining citizenship and immigration in the ministry. If I may 
say so it is citizenship and immigration rather than the other way 
around.
<P>
	The very important point I am about to make is that it struck 
me as very wrong because there is one thing I would have 
changed in the bill. I would have changed it to immigration and 
citizenship instead of the other way around simply because 
immigration is the body of this country. When immigrants come 
here they come to be fed and to find shelter, heat and warmth and 
to sustain their physical selves. I would say that citizenship is 
the soul of this country. It is what the people of this country give 
in terms of their minds and whole beings.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's 
remarks. I assure him that referring to the department with the 
name reversed was not a Freudian slip. However, I do agree with 
his remarks. I believe that immigration comes before 
citizenship and if he would like to make an amendment to the 
bill to change the name of the department I would be very happy 
to second it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member made a distinction between refugees who are outside 
Canada and those who come here and apply for refugee status. 
She expressed a number of reservations and apprehensions, but I 
would like to tell her that we have a system in this country, the 
Immigration and Refugee Board, whose commissioners are 
asked to determine who is a bona fide refugee under the Geneva 
convention and who is not.
<P>
	I sometimes think such apprehensions are unfounded. I would 
also like to inform the hon. member that in all countries, in the 
United States as well as in Europe, refugees knock on the door to 
ask for political asylum. This is not unique to Canada. This is 
common throughout the world. That is why independent and 
autonomous bodies are asked to determine who is a refugee and 
who is not.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly acknowledge my 
colleague's expertise in this area. Having been an immigrant he 
probably has greater knowledge in some areas than I do.
<P>
	The concern is that one-third of the spaces available in our 
inland refugee program were filled in the first quarter of the 
year. That means either one of two things: Very few inland 
refugees will be able to be admitted as the year progresses 
because the quota has been filled so early; or that the quota for 
inland refugees will displace some of the quota for refugees who 
are in other countries and under severe stress. It was more a 
word of caution that our system be very careful to make sure it 
balances those two competing interests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-35, to consolidate citizenship and immigration 
functions, I believe is a laudable one to attempt to streamline 
and reduce duplication. I can only  applaud this manoeuvre and 
hope 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5225"> 5225 </A></B>
<P>
that when the two ministries are brought together there can be a 
streamlining of administration, increased efficiency and 
significant savings to the taxpayer, particularly important in 
these days of deficit spending. I have no real problems with the 
bill, but I think this might be a superb opportunity to address 
many of the unanswered questions on immigration and some of 
the efforts the new department should undertake.
<P>
	One of the greatest characteristics of our beautiful country 
and one I am very proud of is our cultural mosaic. Very few 
countries in this world of ours have been able to assimilate a 
heterogeneous group of people from all over the world. In fact, 
every country in the world is represented within our borders. We 
have managed to create a melting pot with a minimal amount of 
civil strife, prejudice and intolerance. As a result of this, we 
have produced a rich culture that has benefited all individuals 
who live within our borders.
<P>
	The exposure to different cultures, ethnic groups and 
religions is something that enriches us all and breeds tolerance. 
It is perhaps this tolerance and understanding that we as 
Canadians seem to have that sets us apart from almost every 
other country in the world giving us our unique international 
characteristics. It is this unique level of tolerance and 
understanding that has given us such a high level of esteem in 
international circles. There is no doubt in my mind that 
immigration has proven to be a benefit to us.
<P>
	Today in the 1990s much has been said about immigration. 
Often passionate and divergent views are extolled about 
immigrants from many quarters. The numbers of immigrants: 
Are they too high? Are they too low? Their characteristics: Are 
we allowing too many in with certain characteristics that would 
not benefit the country? The country of origin: Are some 
countries better suited to adapt to the Canadian way of life than 
others? Are immigrants a boon or are they a loadstone to this 
country?
<P>
	Those questions are even more pertinent today. They have a 
certain imperativeness about them in their response because of 
our high unemployment levels, our uncertain economic future, 
the rapidly shifting trends in the economy and our relatively 
lower standard of living that plagues current generations more 
so than others in the past.
<P>
	The arguments also become more passionate and more 
subjective as these pressures on Canadian society grow. 
Immigrants are often taken as a scapegoat for some of these 
problems in this country. In order to serve the Canadian public, 
the country and the immigrant population better, I believe it is 
imperative that these questions be addressed and that these 
problems be met head on instead of trying to avoid them.
<P>
	It does not pay to ignore life's realities. Thus there has never 
been a better time to ask for the truth about immigration. What 
immigration levels should we have?  What type of immigrants 
should we be selecting? The only way to get this is through cold, 
hard data. Let us not hide from this.
<P>
	First it would serve to have a brief overview of immigration in 
Canada. As I have said before, immigrants no doubt have been a 
tremendous boon to this country. I am an immigrant and I am 
proud and very thankful at being allowed to come to this 
country. In fact, I like to think of this country as a founding 
country of many different races.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Between 1967 and 1978 immigration policy favoured highly 
qualified and skilled immigrants with high education. They 
came to this country and got jobs. Their earnings grew and in 
fact exceeded those of indigenous Canadians. They became a net 
contributor to the treasury and there was minimal job 
displacement.
<P>
	After 1978 the immigration policy changed. The education of 
immigrants fell and their earnings fell. There was more job 
displacement, particularly by unskilled workers from third 
world countries.
<P>
	There is also less integration now than before. Immigrant 
adaptation has also taken longer than before. This adaptation is 
dependent upon a number of characteristics: the immigrants' 
education, language, age and the nature of the receiving society, 
the level of skills required by the country, the labour market and 
the extent to which the country is receptive toward them.
<P>
	In the last 10 to 15 years we have had a decreasing number in 
the independent class of immigrants, those who were selected to 
come to this country and went through a selection process and 
had a very high chance of getting a job. An increase in the 
number of family reunification class of individuals has 
happened in Canada in the last 10 years. Those are people who 
were allowed into the country purely on the basis of having a 
relative here.
<P>
	The immigration policy from 1967 to 1980 was undoubtedly 
successful. That was due primarily to the selection process I 
mentioned and the commitment of our country to minority 
cultures, tolerance, equal rights and human rights for all.
<P>
	However, recent trends in the labour market performance of 
immigrants have been disquieting. Much has been stated by 
various people on the level of criminality among immigrants 
and whether or not they are a loadstone or a benefit to Canada in 
terms of social services. I have not been able to see any data or 
information on this subject, but I think it is high time we started 
to look at the truth, not to create any scapegoats for this 
country's problems but rather to better serve the immigrant 
population and the citizens in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5226"> 5226 </A></B>
<P>
	If immigrants are having a difficult time and are going to the 
social services in a disproportionate fashion, then we need to 
determine what we can do to alleviate this problem. Perhaps the 
solution is in having a better selection process for what Canada 
needs in terms of its economy and also providing the immigrant 
population with more targeted services.
<P>
	It is also time that we looked at immigrant populations and 
determined what they are doing at perhaps six months, one year 
and two years after they come to Canada to determine whether or 
not they are an economic benefit. In times of deficit spending 
our country cannot tolerate a greater strain on social services. 
As I have said in the past, Canada cannot help other countries 
unless it itself has a vibrant and strong economy with low 
unemployment and a reasonable level of growth. It is only by 
providing this strong economy within our country that we can 
extend our hands economically and technically to other less 
advantaged countries.
<P>
	Another question is as to how many immigrants run foul of the 
law. This has been mentioned today. It would be prudent for us 
to determine this if the statistics are there, but they are not. We 
need to know what we should about it. Other issues which are 
important are the individuals who commit indictable offences in 
this country, after having their guilt or innocence proven, should 
automatically be deported back to their country if they are 
proven to be guilty. It is completely unfair for the Canadian 
taxpayer to foot the bill in excess of $50,000 to $60,000 per year 
per person for an individual who is incarcerated in a penal 
institution. Currently 85 per cent of individuals who commit a 
crime and are thought to be eligible for deportation stay in this 
country. This must stop now.
<P>
	Another aspect that is unfair is that we should not allow 
visitors to come to this country with the express interest of 
having babies on our soil so that their children will 
automatically have the rights and privileges of Canadian 
citizenship. In other words, Canadian citizenship should not be 
automatic if a child is merely born in this country to a person 
who is a visitor.
<P>
	Immigrants and Canadian citizens will benefit from a well 
thought out immigration policy.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	I would implore the hon. minister to do the following: Tie 
non-refugee groups of immigrants to the economic needs of the 
country and make these rules colour blind with no bias in terms 
of country of origin. We must also not forget our humanitarian 
obligations under the 1951 Convention on the Status of 
Refugees. Let us tighten up the definition of refugee class. It 
does not serve the legitimate refugees in this country or the 
independent class of refugees if they are queue jumped by 
individuals who come to this country with fabricated reasons.
<P>
	Let us also look at New Zealand and Australia as examples of 
countries whose policies of family reunification classification 
we should adopt. They are well thought out and they are fair to 
all parties.
<P>
	We also should do HIV testing for individuals who wish to 
immigrate to this country. People are tested for other groups of 
infectious diseases. There is no reason why HIV, a disease that 
tragically has a 100 per cent fatality rate, is not tested for.
<P>
	Also, amalgamating citizenship and immigration I would 
lastly suggest that the ministry consult with a private group that 
specializes in giving advice on streamlining the ministry. It may 
serve the Canadian public and the minister as well to have this 
expertise as it costs about $50,000 per year to have an immigrant 
processed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West):</B> Mr. Speaker, just a 
short question to clarify one portion of my hon. colleague's 
speech and in particular in connection with what I believe I 
heard him say, the automatic deportation of criminals who have 
been convicted of crimes who are not Canadian citizens. I want 
to be perfectly clear and I want to ask the member if he has 
actually thought this through.
<P>
	I want to give him an example and ask for his comments 
specifically. Is the member saying that if a person who is not a 
citizen is convicted of a crime in this country he should be 
immediately deported or is he saying that he should be deported 
after serving his sentence?
<P>
	Let us suppose someone comes up from Washington state and 
robs a bank using a handgun. If that person is apprehended and 
convicted of armed robbery in British Columbia, is the position 
of the hon. member that the only thing that should happen to that 
person is that person be returned to Washington state or is the 
hon. member in fact saying that after having served the 
appropriate sentence for armed robbery then the person should 
be returned?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
response to the hon. member's question the person should go 
through our courts, guilt or innocence should be determined and 
if he or she is found to be guilty then they should be deported to 
the country of origin with the understanding that the person 
should be faced with serving a sentence appropriate to the crime 
in the country of origin.
<P>
	My constituents have told me they think it is grossly unfair 
that the Canadian taxpayer has to foot the bill in the order of 
$50,000 or $60,000 per year to have this person sit in a penal 
institution for that period of time. It is a cost that I do not think 
Canadian taxpayers should have to shoulder.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
am looking for some clarification. I do not hold any particular 
brief for immigrants who commit especially serious crimes. If I 
understood the hon. member correctly  I think he indicated that 
he would like to see the collection of some data on the criminal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5227"> 5227 </A></B>
<P>
activity of immigrants here in this country. I really wonder 
about that, where that would take this and what some people 
might do with it.
<P>
	My concern would be that if we were to compile data on the 
criminal activity of immigrants it would be easy for some people 
to strike an average for any group of immigrants, whether it is 
Iran, Haiti or Scotland or wherever. If they were to be 
committing crimes above average, any more of them would be 
discouraged from coming to Canada. Those committing crimes 
below average would be encouraged to come to Canada. I am not 
too sure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
understand what the hon. member is saying. The last thing I 
want to do is institute any element of prejudice into this at all. 
There has been much said by various people in the media and 
groups in this country that certain immigrants are criminals and 
they should not be allowed into the country.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	I am looking for answers that have not been provided by the 
minister of immigration. I think it is important for us to 
determine whether there are individuals coming into this 
country who are criminals or who commit criminal acts in this 
country. If we can do a better job of determining who those 
individuals are beforehand, in other words have some way of 
predicting this behaviour in the future such as, for example, if 
they have a criminal record in the country of origin, perhaps we 
can use this data to protect the citizens of this country.
<P>
	That is what I am driving at, not to institute any prejudice on 
the country of origin. Rather, if there are characteristics of an 
individual who comes to this country who has had criminal 
behaviour in the past and is an incorrigible criminal, we should 
know this information before they come here in order to protect 
the citizens of this country and not allow them to enter into our 
borders.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to hear that the member on the other side is an 
immigrant and a new Canadian and that he will have some 
sensitivity to other new Canadians. I also understand that the 
member opposite is a physician. I was wondering if the member 
was educated in Canada.
<P>
	I would also like to ask the member, just as a bit of 
clarification and edification on his earlier remark, whether we 
should do an economic analysis of the benefits that immigrants 
provide this country. If indeed the member on the other side was 
educated as a medical doctor, which is an incredible cost to the 
Canadian taxpayer, I was wondering if he has figured out his 
economic benefit to this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
came to this country when I was eight years old from England. I 
will clarify what I said. I was saying in my speech that we need 
to find out whether or not individuals who come to this country 
are going on social services or are not.
<P>
	The only reason I say this is to dispel a lot of the myths that are 
being thrown around. I am trying to get at the answers. I am not 
making any prediction as to what immigrant groups are or are 
not doing, but I think it is important for us to find out if 
immigrants are or are not going on our social services. If they 
are, then perhaps we are doing something wrong and perhaps we 
can find ways of helping them to ensure that they do not go on 
social services or perhaps integrate them into Canadian society 
in a better way.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-23, an act 
to implement a convention for the protection of migratory birds 
in Canada and the United States, as reported (with amendments) 
from the committee.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in his book <I>The Living Planet</I>, David Attenborough, the 
British zoologist, tells the story of an ecosystem off the coast of 
Peru. Several decades ago, two islands, Chincha and San Gallan, 
were home to about 5.5 million guanay, a type of cormorant. The 
guanay lived within this very rich ecosystem, feeding on small 
anchovies that were abundant in the area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5228"> 5228 </A></B>
<P>
	The guanay produced guano, the accumulated excrement used 
by Indians and others as fertilizer. Excrement fell into the sea 
and fed the plankton which, in turn, fed the anchovies. It was a 
perfectly balanced ecosystem.
<P>
	When chemical fertilizers were developed, the Peruvians 
decided it was easier to buy fertilizer at the store instead of 
harvesting it on the islands. The birds were no longer needed. 
And meanwhile, the Peruvians started harvesting more and more 
of the small anchovies. In one year, they caught 14,000 tonnes! 
As a result, hundreds of thousands of guanay died, and guano 
production dropped to zero. The plankton were no longer 
fertilized, and their numbers deteriorated to the point that the 
anchovies practically disappeared.
<P>
	The moral of this true story is that the ecosystem maintains an 
almost perfect natural balance. However, when one link is 
removed, the whole chain is destroyed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I guess this is the reason for Bill C-23. We are trying to 
preserve the ecosystem by doing our utmost to preserve our 
species in Canada. Therefore I am glad to have this opportunity 
to speak on the amendments to the Migratory Birds Convention 
Act and to commend fellow members of Parliament for the 
interest they have shown and for their tremendous contribution 
in the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development to strengthening this legislation which protects 
these important species.
<P>
	Bringing this bill before the House for third reading is an 
appropriate follow-up to Environmental Week. Bill C-23 is part 
of the current effort to improve federal wildlife and habitat 
legislation, including amending the Canada Wildlife Act. These 
amendments will lead to the proclamation of the wild animal 
and plant protection, regulation of international and 
interprovincial trade as well as consultations which will lead to 
negotiations with the United States on amending the migratory 
birds convention itself.
<P>
	On April 25 Bill C-23 was introduced in the House of 
Commons on behalf of the Minister of the Environment. It will 
replace and repeal the current Migratory Birds Convention Act 
which was enacted 77 years ago in 1917.
<P>
	In the early 1900s, exploitation of birds led to the drastic 
declines in their population, particularly in eastern North 
America. The migratory birds convention was therefore signed 
by Canada and the United States in 1916 committing each 
country to protect migratory birds from indiscriminate slaughter 
and to sustain their populations.
<P>
	The Migratory Birds Convention Act was enacted in 1917 to 
implement the terms of the convention in Canada by managing 
the harvest of ducks, geese and of other game birds and by 
protecting migratory non-game birds.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Provisions of the act are designed to regulate hunting, prevent 
trafficking and commercialization, control the uses of migratory 
birds through permits and allow for the creation of migratory 
birds sanctuaries in order to control and manage areas important 
for the protection of the birds. There are currently 101 migratory 
bird sanctuaries in Canada which together protect 
approximately 11.3 million hectares.
<P>
	The act has remained relatively unchanged over the last 77 
years with only minor additions and amendments. In the context 
of the 1990s natural resource management must incorporate not 
only the environmental objectives but also must meet social, 
cultural and of course economic concerns.
<P>
	The amendments proposed in Bill C-23 are designed to 
ensure the sustainable life of migratory birds and their 
enjoyment by Canadians. They also address our international 
commitments to the wise management of an internationally 
shared resource, and are consistent with the objectives of the 
Convention on Biological Diversity.
<P>
	The Convention on Biological Diversity is one of the most 
tangible and important results of the earth summit in Rio two 
years ago. It was ratified by Canada in December 1992 and 
requires that countries regulate or manage biological resources 
to ensure their conservation and sustainable use and that 
countries establish a system of protected areas to conserve 
biodiversity.
<P>
	A comprehensive review of Environment Canada's 
regulations was conducted in 1993, including a review of the 
regulations adopted pursuant to the Migratory Birds Convention 
Act. The consultation process involved a broad range of 
stakeholders including hunters, aviculturists, taxidermists, 
farmers, members of environmental and wildlife groups, 
representatives of aboriginal peoples, researchers, provincial 
and territorial wildlife agencies, outfitters and representatives 
of industry. The findings of the review suggested improvement 
to streamline the administration, to modernize procedures and 
make the regulations more enforceable.
<P>
	A process not related to this bill is currently under way to 
amend the migratory birds convention in order to address 
aboriginal and treaty rights, harvest birds during the closed 
season as well as harvest eggs. That process involving extensive 
consultations with aboriginal people's organizations will lead to 
negotiations with the United States to amend the convention 
itself. In the meantime, special measures that allow continued 
pursuit of traditional harvesting in the spring and early summer 
are in place to address the closed season harvest of migratory 
birds.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5229"> 5229 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Preparing amendments to the Migratory Birds Convention 
Act has required extensive consultation on the federal 
regulations designed to protect these birds.
<P>
	After second reading, there was another opportunity for 
consultation on the proposed changes when the Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development 
carried out a thorough study of the bill, with some excellent 
comments by a wide range of witnesses. Several changes 
proposed by the committee have been included, and I am 
therefore confident that the bill now better reflects the interests 
of all Canadians and will help us protect migratory birds 
effectively, now and in the future.
<P>
	Many of these amendments are so-called housekeeping 
amendments to update and clarify existing provisions. Major 
changes include much higher fines for offences, greater 
flexibility in sentencing for the courts, better protection for 
migratory birds and stricter and more efficient implementation 
procedures.
<P>
	In using its power to legislate on these issues, Parliament 
reflects the values of Canadians and their interest in protecting 
our wildlife heritage. These changes will be compatible with 
other federal acts that regulate natural resources and the 
environment. Implementation of this legislation will be 
flexible, while acting as a major deterrent to unlawful activities.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The poaching and smuggling of migratory birds is a lucrative 
and growing business. Growing demand for Canadian species of 
migratory birds and eggs is increasing their value and could put 
some species at risk.
<P>
	A serious offence under the act is one in which an illegal 
activity is detrimental to the survival of a species, as such is the 
case when the activity involves an endangered species or a large 
quantity of specimens of a threatened or other species.
<P>
	Based on these factors, the committee decided to increase 
substantially the penalties for offences beyond what was 
proposed in the original bill. It must be recalled that the original 
bill, passed in 1917, is now 77 years old and what used to 
constitute significant fines then are completely insignificant 
today.
<P>
	For serious offences, the maximum fine will be increased 
from $300 in the existing bill to $100,000 for an individual or 
$250,000 for a corporation with provisions for increasing fines 
for a continuing or subsequent offence.
<P>
	The courts will also have greater flexibility in imposing 
sentences by providing court authority for special orders. Such 
orders can be particularly effective in the case of environmental 
legislation where those convicted can be ordered to remedy the 
harm, pay for their remediation, avoid activity which could lead 
to repeat offences,  publish the facts relating to the case or 
perform community service.
<P>
	They allow the courts to take into account not only the nature 
of the offence but also the particular circumstances of the person 
convicted. Therefore it allows for constructive and creative 
sentencing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Amending the Migratory Birds Convention Act has given us 
an opportunity to consider how, in the future, we can react to 
activities that are a threat to migratory birds. In accordance with 
the Biodiversity Convention, the sperm, embryos, and tissue 
cultures of migratory birds will now be included under the act. 
Eggs are already protected under the legislation. Although there 
is no immediate threat to migratory birds in this respect, there 
are constantly new developments in the use of biological 
materials.
<P>
	Instead of preventing such uses, the act, as amended, is 
designed to ensure that these developments do not threaten the 
conservation of migratory birds and the many benefits they 
bring to Canadians. Activities associated with tissue cultures 
and the use of sperm, eggs and embryos of migratory birds will 
be regulated and managed through licensing programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I mentioned previously, natural resource management 
must incorporate not only environmental and economic 
concerns but social and cultural values as well. Canada's 
aboriginal people have lived in harmony with the land and its 
wildlife for many centuries, for thousands of years as they say. 
Their heritage and even their survival have been linked to the 
sustainable use of wildlife resources.
<P>
	Migratory birds have had a particular significance to 
aboriginal peoples with a great tradition of knowledge 
developed over many generations, engendering both respect for 
the birds and an ability to ensure their sustainable use.
<P>
	In response to testimony from several witnesses, the standing 
committee amended the original bill to better reflect aboriginal 
concerns by including a non-derogation clause in the bill. It 
states: ``that nothing in this act shall be construed so as to 
abrogate or derogate from any existing aboriginal treaty rights 
of the aboriginal peoples of Canada under section 35 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982''.
<P>
	This in itself is not sufficient to accommodate and respond to 
the traditional practices of Canada's aboriginal peoples. For this 
reason, a separate process is under way, as I mentioned earlier, 
to address aboriginal and treaty rights to harvest migratory birds 
during the closed season as well as the harvest of eggs.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5230"> 5230 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Consultations with aboriginal peoples have been intensive 
over the past four years and will lead to negotiations with the 
United States later this year to amend the migratory birds 
convention. In the meantime special enforcement measures that 
allow continued pursuit of traditional harvesting in the spring 
and early summer are in place to address the closed season 
harvest of migratory birds under the existing and amended act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The standing committee believes that Parliament must be 
given the opportunity to examine any changes to the convention 
following these or any future negotiations. For this reason, the 
committee added a provision to Bill C-23 which states that any 
amendment to the convention shall be submitted to both houses 
of Parliament and be debated here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	A number of enforcement provisions have also been updated 
and strengthened in Bill C-23. These include provisions relating 
to inspections, searches, seizures, forfeiture and disposal of 
property as well as others consistent with the Criminal Code, the 
charter of rights and other federal enactments respecting the 
environment and natural resources.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment may also designate any 
person or class of persons to act as game officers. If these 
persons are employed by the government of a province, the 
appointment must be approved by that provincial government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I mentioned the enforcement provisions at the end of my 
summary of the more substantive changes to the act. The reason 
for this is that it brings up an issue extremely important to the 
conservation of wildlife. Neither the federal government nor a 
provincial government, or for that matter the governments of 
other countries, can hope to effectively conserve biodiversity in 
isolation. Co-operation and partnership are the keys to 
achieving this goal and other goals linked to sustainable 
development.
<P>
	From a point of view of both practicality and effectiveness the 
issue of enforcement is one in which a co-ordinated 
federal-provincial approach makes the most sense. There are 
many other areas for which this approach generates benefits, 
where the objectives and concerns are shared and where 
building on each other's strengths through co-operative action 
improves environmental results.
<P>
	An excellent example of such a partnership is the 
international North American Waterfowl Management Plan. 
The plan, originally signed in 1986 is an initiative to protect and 
enhance wetland and upland habitat on a continental basis so as 
to stem the decline of waterfowl. The NAWMP has evolved from 
a plan focused on waterfowl conservation to one that 
incorporates benefits toward biodiversity conservation.
<P>
	The plan exemplifies sustainable development in action by 
involving private land owners and resource sectors to integrate 
wildlife conservation practices with sustainable economic 
development, particularly through soil and water conservation 
initiatives.
<P>
	Partners include the United States federal and state 
governments, NGOs and certainly all Canadian provinces. As 
well Mexico is now a full partner, making the North American 
Waterfowl Management Plan a truly continental conservation 
plan.
<P>
	On June 9 of this year the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment signed the update to the plan extending 
Canada's commitment for another five years.
<P>
	As the minister pointed out, the success of the plan in the last 
six years has been to arrest the destruction and the loss of 
wetland habitat for migratory birds. Our common goal for the 
next five years is to set aside more breeding grounds and to see 
our skies filled with an annual migration of 100 million birds.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This co-operative approach offers some advantages for 
several other facets of wildlife conservation, some of which will 
be dealt with on third reading of the Canada Wildlife Act.
<P>
	Bill C-23 which amends the Migratory Birds Convention Act 
represents a major step forward in the protection and 
conservation of migratory birds and in the fulfilment of our 
commitments under the Biodiversity Convention.

<P>
	This year, 1994, another three species of birds were added to 
the endangered species list of Canada. In April 1994 the list was 
made public and we learned that the bobwhite, the king rail and 
the Acadian flycatcher were added to Canada's list of 
endangered species.
<P>
	The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in 
Canada stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Again this year, we are finding that we are designating species particularly 
from southern Ontario and the Okanagan area of British Columbia-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It stressed that the big problem for many species is that they 
were running out of places to live. The Acadian flycatcher, for 
example, is a songbird that needs large tracks of forest which are 
increasingly scarce.
<P>
	I quote from one member of the committee:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You can immediately see that as we cut up the forest into smaller and smaller 
patches there have been smaller and smaller numbers of these birds, and now it's 
down to a critical level of just a few dozen pairs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	This is the story as we deplete habitats. I know some will say 
this act is not important in itself, that it only concerns birds, and 
what are birds at a time of economic downturn when people are 
out of work and Canada faces a tremendous economic crisis. At 
the same time I would suggest that birds are part of the whole.
<P>
	We have to look at the broader context of our heritage as a 
country and as a people. There can be no heritage without nature 
and all its components. Can we imagine Canada without the 
snow geese? Can we imagine Canada without its wildlife, 
without all its birds? Our heritage has been bestowed on us; we 
are blessed that way. We have to make a special effort to 
conserve, to preserve or to maintain that heritage for future 
generations.
<P>
	There are good signs. The peregrine falcon had almost 
disappeared, and due to the efforts of volunteers all across 
Canada and a tremendous dedication by our wildlife services, 
including the federal wildlife service, the peregrine falcon is 
thriving again.
<P>
	We must resolve ourselves to take very seriously matters that 
touch environment, quality of life, our ecosystems and habitats 
that preserve our birds and our wildlife. They are essential parts 
of the fibre of our land, of the way we live and of our heritage. I 
urge all members to join with me in supporting the bill 
unanimously and reinforcing that resolve among us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I take part in this debate on Bill C-23 this 
afternoon, immediately after the parliamentary secretary, the 
hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis, in Quebec. These past few 
weeks, we have examined Bill C-23 to implement a convention 
for the protection of migratory birds in Canada and the United 
States.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	A great many witnesses have appeared before the committee 
to help us better grasp the problem. These individuals and 
organizations spokespersons were all experts from whom we 
have learned a lot. It is now obvious to me that this legislation, 
which was passed in 1917, really needed to be updated.
<P>
	Knowing how important it is to protect migratory birds from 
becoming an endangered species, we Bloc members have no 
major problem with this bill, including the amendments 
proposed by the committee. It is simply a matter of bringing an 
outdated act into line with the realities of the 21st century. As 
the saying goes where I come from, foresight is better than 
hindsight. So, as soon as the act comes into effect, all birds 
flying across Canada will be protected.
<P>
	You can imagine what it would be like if only certain species 
were to be protected. You can picture as well as me hunters 
noticing from afar something flying, shooting and then pleading 
rightly or wrongly that they thought it was a bird from another 
species. More illogical yet would be to protect only endangered 
species, letting other  species be fired on at will until they too 
become endangered.
<P>
	Amendments to this act will also enable us to pull the rug 
from under potential dealers in sperm, embryo and tissue 
culture.
<P>
	The Convention on Biodiversity ratified by Canada in 
December 1992 unveiled what trading in such things could 
represent. It would be possible to create hybrid species for 
experimentation, or even conduct experiments directly on 
tissue. The possession, purchase or sale of migratory birds are 
also strictly prohibited. Indeed, it is now stipulated in this bill 
that no person shall be in possession of a migratory bird or nest, 
or buy, sell, exchange or give a migratory bird or nest or make it 
the subject of a commercial transaction.
<P>
	So, that will be it from now on in living rooms or summer 
cottages where hunting trophies are displayed. In my part of the 
country, it is not uncommon to see displayed in summer homes 
stuffed specimens of these birds which are now so rare. The time 
for this is now past.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis noted 
earlier, the fines-the maximum fines, of course-are very 
high, so much so, in fact, that during our committee 
deliberations, I often wondered out loud and said to myself that 
``migratory birds will be better protected than our children''.
<P>
	The new Act will also give the minister more power in the 
designation of game officers. And I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. (1) The Minister may designate any person or class of persons to act as game 
officers for the purposes of this Act and the regulations-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I was somewhat intrigued by this provision, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I questioned witnesses in committee to find out whether the 
minister could, for instance, designate all members of a hunting 
and fishing association to act as game officers.
<P>
	I was told yes, but that such associations might have restricted 
powers. I find this provision a little scary. It would be difficult 
for an ordinary citizen to go to a farmer's land to tell him that he 
is breaking the law. He runs a great risk of simply being ejected 
from a private property.
<P>
	My fear is that some members of these associations may have 
big arms and small heads. A member automatically designated 
to act as game officer with little training but big arms could 
decide to play policeman.
<P>
	I will always remember a sentence I heard in my Grade 11 
course on social, political and economic life: ``In Canada, a free 
country, it is better to see 99 guilty persons go free than one 
innocent person unjustly punished''. That made a big impres-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5232"> 5232 </A></B>
<P>
sion on me. It is a minor concern, but we will still vote for Bill 
C-23.
<P>
	It is, however, a well-known fact that there are not enough 
game officers to enforce the act. In that case, we should 
recognize the need to designate civilian game officers 
immediately but with really restricted powers, to ensure that our 
laws are respected.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois think it would be worthwhile to take 
certain measures to ensure that the people collectively 
designated as game officers have the skills required to maintain 
credibility. That is why we suggested two amendments in 
committee.
<P>
	The purpose of the first amendment is to ensure that the 
people collectively designated by the minister have at least 
received the training appropriate to their functions. That of the 
second amendment is to make the designation of a class of 
persons conditional on the approval of the Standing Committee 
on Environment and Sustainable Development.
<P>
	As regularly happens when we vote here in the House of 
Commons, our two amendments were defeated, but I am still 
convinced that it would be important to exercise a little more 
control over this kind of appointment; otherwise these 
provisions could do more harm than good.
<P>
	If you allow me, I would now like to draw your attention to a 
presentation given to us by Daniel Jauvin, president of the 
Quebec ornithologists' association. This Quebec association of 
more than 30 bird-watching clubs or societies has produced 
many briefs on the protection of birds and their habitats.
<P>
	In particular, it does scientific research on birds and 
especially on endangered species. This organization supports 
the bill but has nevertheless carried out a very worthwhile 
exercise. Its members checked the translation in the schedule to 
Bill C-23, namely the Convention.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	According to these experts of the ornithological association, 
the French terminology used to name the birds is obsolete. They 
therefore suggested to the committee the terminology used by 
the international commission on bird names in French as 
published in <I>Noms français des oiseaux du monde</I>. This 
terminology is the one recognized throughout the world. The 
problems are of two kinds. First, an attempt was made to 
translate directly from English to French. As a result, names of 
genera were translated by names of species. Second, the 
association believes that the names of many species which 
should be there are still missing, unfortunately.
<P>
	As an appendix to their brief, they presented to us a proper 
translation of articles I to IV of the above-mentioned 
Convention. This presentation showed that we should go further 
than simply reading the legal terminology. Such translation 
problems can seriously affect the enforcement of the law. Some 
species might be in the English version but not the French one. 
This would cause interpretation problems that would slow down 
and complicate law enforcement.
<P>
	The hon. member for Terrebonne and myself were also very 
interested in the comments made by another speaker, Mr. Daniel 
Lacombe, who is the secretary general for the Fédération 
québécoise de la faune. That organization supports, of course, 
the proposed legislative changes but deplores the fact that all the 
regulations are left to the free will of officials from the Canadian 
Wildlife Service and Environment Canada. Mr. Lacombe also 
pointed out that it is unfortunate to see organizations such as the 
one he represents not being really consulted when regulations 
are drafted. It appears that the Canadian Wildlife Service merely 
informs these groups of the new rules in effect. Since these 
organizations use legislation such as Bill C-23, they should at 
least be consulted on a regular, effective, honest, and serious 
basis.
<P>
	Mr. Lacombe gave us an example which illustrates the 
inconsistencies of the current process. He told us that the 
hunting season-this is something I still have a lot of trouble 
understanding, but that is the way it is-opens one week earlier 
in Ontario than in Quebec. The reason why it is later in Quebec is 
to protect the various species of birds. The same birds are found 
in Ontario and in Quebec, but the season opens earlier in Ontario 
because there are sedentary species. In other words, there are 
birds which remain in Ontario because they must have figured 
out that there is an imaginary line between the two provinces and 
they do not come to Quebec. However, Quebec birds do visit 
their friends in Ontario, where they can get bombarded one week 
earlier. This is the official reason which was given to our 
committee.
<P>
	According to Mr. Lacombe, migratory birds mingle with other 
birds and the end result is the same for both groups. 
Consequently, Mr. Lacombe deplores that, when meetings take 
place with officials from the Canadian Wildlife Service, it is not 
possible to solve such issues, since those meetings are designed 
to provide information and not to consult organizations such as 
the one represented by Mr. Lacombe.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I want to make a comment regarding the Canadian Wildlife 
Service. I received documents from the president of the 
Association des sauvaginiers du Québec, Mr. Gaétan Fillion, 
who is upset at the lack of communication between his 
organization and the Canadian Wildlife Service. Mr. Speaker, 
the Fédération québécoise de la faune is not the only one 
suffering from this problem. It may be that this is a chronic 
problem only in Quebec, but it does seem persistent.
<P>
	In our review of Bill C-23, we should look at the issue of 
regulations with those testimonies in mind. In that regard, 
officials from the Department of the Environment should look at 
two major issues. There are of course migratory birds which are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5233"> 5233 </A></B>
<P>
endangered, but there are many others which pollute our 
environment, including gulls.
<P>
	At the Daishowa manufacturing plant, in Quebec City, it took 
almost two years to get permission, not to kill such birds, but to 
destroy their nests and their eggs. There were an estimated 
170,000 pairs of adult gulls capable of reproducing on the site 
and this situation was causing serious problems. When stringent 
regulations exist and when we have problems, we resolve them. 
When I was mayor, if I had taken two years to make such a minor 
decision, I would not have remained in office very long. This is 
one example. The process needs to be smoothed out so that 
effective solutions can be adopted quickly.
<P>
	Secondly, when we protect wildlife, we must protect their 
habitat. Imagine, Mr. Speaker, if a flock of geese decided to 
descend on your home for three weeks and you were not allowed 
to frighten them away. Believe me, I have tried. They merely 
circle about and land on your property, as if they had decided 
that it was their home. Imagine the condition of your lawn after 
three weeks. Do you know who would be responsible for the 
cleanup costs? You would. The legislation makes no provision 
for any compensation. I raised this question and an official told 
me that the farmer could rely on his crop insurance. I checked 
this out and while it is true, what if the poor farmer does not have 
crop insurance that covers this kind of damage? Then he would 
have to pay for the damages out of his own pocket.
<P>
	I am telling you this because I have received letters to the 
effect that the snow geese were chased-I am not sure how-out 
of the Montmagny region. The geese ended up in the 
Rimouski-Témiscouata area. Snow geese are lovely creatures, 
but when 40,000 or 50,000 of them descend all at once for a 
three-week to one-month stay, well it is nice to see them arrive, 
but it is equally nice to see them leave.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Just like houseguests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Just like houseguests, as the hon. 
member for Trois-Rivières pointed out. It can be quite a burden, 
and there is nothing in Bill C-23 to provide financial assistance 
for individuals who have to accommodate these animals for 
extended periods.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I hope that our senior officials, under the instructions of the 
Minister of the Environment, will look at regulatory measures 
and other ways to reach agreements that will make this 
legislation very effective.
<P>
	The legislator should take advantage of the experience of 
users to make these laws far more effective. It seems we will go 
ahead with Bill C-23, which I think is a step in the right 
direction towards protecting our migratory birds. However, as 
was pointed out earlier, the agreements are with the United 
States and Mexico. We should extend such agreements much 
further south, because we have birds that migrate very far south, 
and we could protect them so they are not killed in the south. 
These agreements must be concluded with our neighbours on a 
nation-to-nation basis.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as I said before, the Bloc Quebecois will fully 
support the Liberal government on Bill C-23.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose 
of Bill C-23 is to replace the existing Migratory Birds 
Convention Act which was originally proclaimed in 1917. It has 
essentially remained the same ever since.
<P>
	The original act regulated hunting in the use of migratory 
birds, prohibited traffic and commercialization, controlled the 
use of migratory birds through permits, and provided for the 
establishment of migratory bird sanctuaries in order to control 
and manage areas important for the protection of migratory 
birds.
<P>
	The original act was designed to protect migratory birds from 
indiscriminate slaughter and to sustain their populations.
<P>
	The proposed migratory bird act now before the House would 
modernize the language of the original Migratory Birds 
Convention Act and clarify the extent of its application, the 
prohibitions, the regulatory authorities, the administrative 
provisions and the offences and punishment sections.
<P>
	The highlights of this bill are the broadening of the legislation 
to include all migratory birds, the broadening of the authority 
under the act given to wildlife enforcement officers, and the 
levels of fines to be increased.
<P>
	The new act provides the legislative basis for managing the 
harvest and other uses of ducks, geese and other game birds, as 
well as for the protecting migratory birds, and provides for the 
creation of migratory bird sanctuaries.
<P>
	In conjunction with the Canada Wildlife Act the new 
Migratory Birds Convention Act will provide a greater deterrent 
to illegal activities such as poaching by providing a maximum 
penalty of $25,000 or six months in jail or both for serious 
offences.
<P>
	The mandate of the federal environment department in 
Canada is to manage and conserve migratory birds and in 
co-operation with the provinces and territories other wildlife of 
national and international concern. Canada as a member of the 
international community has obligations to help preserve and 
protect our wildlife and wildlife areas, including bird 
populations and bird sanctuaries.
<P>
	Protecting and conserving Canada's bird diverse populations 
are an important part of our ecosystem. As the planet's human 
population swells and spreads over once wild areas, some 70 per 
cent of the world's 9,600 bird species are responding with 
declines, and 1,000 species are threatened with extinction in the 
near future according to a report by Birdlife International, a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5234"> 5234 </A></B>
<P>
conservation group based in England that charts the loss of 
habitats and species.
<P>
	What is especially alarming beyond the direct losses that are 
taking place is that bird populations are a particularly good 
indicator of the health of the whole ecosystem. Canada must 
take a leadership role in the push for conservation and protection 
of bird species, and this leadership must begin with the changes 
made to the Migratory Birds Convention Act.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	Conserving and protecting our environment has become a 
major political and economic issue in our country. Opinion polls 
consistently show that over 90 per cent of Canadians are 
concerned about the state of our environment. These same polls 
also show that the Canadian people are split with regard to their 
satisfaction with the federal government's handling of difficult 
environmental issues.
<P>
	Last week all across Canada, Canada Environment Week 
activities were taking place and provided Canadians with a good 
opportunity to think about ways they can help improve our 
environment. Environmental citizenship, being informed and 
taking action was the focus of this year's Environment Week.
<P>
	Canada's policymakers should sit up and take notice. 
Canadians are becoming increasingly aware of the importance 
of the environment to our society. We as politicians hold the 
responsibility to act as prudently and effectively as possible in 
order to protect our environment and our wildlife areas for 
future generations.
<P>
	Government legislation is just one aspect of this 
environmentally conscious trend, albeit an important one.
<P>
	The Reform Party is deeply concerned with Canada's 
environment. In this regard one of the principles of the party is 
that we believe Canada's identity and vision for the future 
should be rooted in and inspired by a fresh appreciation of our 
land and the supreme importance to our well-being of 
exploring, developing, renewing and conserving our natural 
resources and physical environment.
<P>
	In general, the Reform Party supports the changes made in 
this act after having had the opportunity to examine possible 
amendments in committee. Many groups made representations 
to the committee and some changes to the bill could be made.
<P>
	One aspect of the bill with which my party is very pleased is 
the stronger enforcement and punishment section. Although this 
bill finally puts some teeth into the existing Migratory Birds 
Convention Act that up to this point it has lacked, we believe 
that the enforcement provisions for maximum penalties could 
have been made even tougher by increasing the punishment 
provisions as proposed at the committee stage.
<P>
	One part of the amendments that is of great concern to our 
party is the part that gives the minister more power to implement 
changes to the convention without Parliament's approval.
<P>
	During the committee meetings it was felt that this concern 
was not adequately addressed. Under the existing act should 
Canada and the United States agree to amend the convention 
such amendments in order to come into force in Canada would 
require an amendment to the act. Specifically, the schedule to 
the act would have to be amended by legislation approved by 
Parliament.
<P>
	However, under Bill C-23 a different implementation process 
would apply in which convention amendments would be 
implemented by ministerial order and the approval of 
Parliament would not be needed for such amendments to take 
effect.
<P>
	Since Canada is seeking to renegotiate the convention to 
address aboriginal and treaty rights to harvest migratory birds 
during the closed season and to harvest eggs, if Bill C-23 is 
adopted any changes that were made under the convention in 
this regard would accordingly be implemented by ministerial 
order.
<P>
	Parliament would have no role with respect to any changes 
that might be made from time to time under the convention. 
Although the implementation of convention amendments would 
be expedited under the process proposed by the bill, the fact is 
Parliament would not be involved in any way.
<P>
	The Reform members believe that this is the wrong approach 
and that the bill should be amended so as to provide that 
amendments to the convention be laid before Parliament before 
being added to the order on the schedule.
<P>
	We do believe in protecting and conserving Canada's 
environment and its wildlife. We believe that this legislation 
does begin to address some of the concerns that Canadians have 
in these areas.
<P>
	There is one part of the amendments which I have some fairly 
close knowledge of and which I would like to draw to the 
attention of the House. I am hoping that there might be some 
Liberal members following my presentation who will address 
this question.
<P>
	On May 6, I was approached, as the member responsible in my 
party for the shepherding of Bill C-23 through the House of 
Commons, by our House leader and was informed that there was 
a representative of the environment minister who wished to 
meet with me and wanted to push the bill through to third 
reading at that particular time.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5235"> 5235 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	I was only partially in favour of that. In other words, I felt as 
though I was under pressure because I had not had an 
opportunity to seriously consider it going through to third stage 
but there was a tremendous amount of arm twisting. Perhaps the 
parliamentary secretary to the environment minister may recall 
and the deputy chair of the Standing Committee on the 
Environment may recall.
<P>
	We had meetings. There was this tremendous pressure to 
bring it through to third reading. I resisted as a result of the fact 
that there was advice that they wished to bring some small 
amendments to the act. Not being a lawyer, I was concerned 
about the fact that I would be letting something go over which I 
did not have any control or knowledge. As a consequence I said, 
no, I would not give unanimous consent to see the thing go 
through to third reading. That was on May 6.
<P>
	On May 26 Grand Chief Matthew Coon-Come on behalf of 
the Grand Council of the Crees appeared before our standing 
committee. He drew to our attention information about the 
James Bay and northern Quebec agreement and in part the 
statement that he read into the record at that time said: ``The 
agreement which we signed obligates the Government of 
Canada and the province of Quebec in perpetuity to respect Cree 
rights and carry out certain obligations.
<P>
	Our treaty, then, forms the basis for the protection of our way 
of life. Several principles were embodied in these regimes: 
co-operative co-management of resources with government; 
family based Cree hunting territories; the beaver preserve 
system; the Crees as guardians of the land and animals; 
recognition and training of Cree game wardens and finally the 
paramount guiding principle of conservation''.
<P>
	I am absolutely prepared to accept the representation by the 
representative of the Cree totally at face value. I accept what he 
said there completely without question. He goes on to say: ``In 
light of this brief background on our treaty rights, you might be 
able to understand our consternation at the provisions contained 
in the legislation which has been tabled before the standing 
committee''.
<P>
	He adds: ``This bill purports to address through its substantive 
and enabling provisions the management and harvesting of 
migratory birds. Indeed, it is entitled an act to implement a 
convention for the protection of migratory birds in Canada and 
the United States''.
<P>
	He underlines: ``For legislation emanating from the 
Parliament of Canada in 1994 and in view of the solemn 
commitments made in the James Bay and northern Quebec 
agreement and in addressing issues so critical to the identity, 
livelihood and culture of aboriginal people, how is it possible 
that this legislation does not make the least mention of 
aboriginal people, their dependence on the resource or their 
rights to the resource? We find this, to say the least, 
extraordinary''.
<P>
	He goes on to say: ``We are not invoking simply a legal right 
or an apparently failed treaty provision. Neither are we arguing 
for the respect of our rights at any or all cost to the environment, 
but how did this legislation come this far without any 
consultation with us? How can the drafters of these acts be so 
oblivious of Canada's constitutional and statutory duties to 
protect aboriginal harvest rights? Bear in mind that the Crees 
have hunted in our territory since time immemorial''.
<P>
	He goes on to express a feeling of real distress about the fact 
that he had not been consulted. I asked the legal counsel for the 
Cree at that time to get back to me with the time at which it was 
informed or brought into the picture and I was informed by the 
legal council for the Cree that it was brought into the picture 
May 16, a full 10 days after a representative of the environment 
minister was trying to arm twist and get this through without any 
provision for aboriginal concerns.
<P>
	I am very sensitive to the fact that last week in particular we 
had representations from a member of our party that raised a 
tremendous amount of consternation and concern in the way that 
he was speaking about aboriginal questions. I am very sensitive 
to that issue. I wish to raise the issue without emotion. I am 
hoping that there is someone in the House who will be prepared 
to answer this question.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	Section 5 of the proposed legislation reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Except as authorized by the regulations, no person shall, without lawful 
excuse,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) be in possession of a migratory bird or nest; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) buy, sell, exchange or give a migratory bird or nest or make it the subject of a 
commercial transaction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Further on in the legislation, section 12 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Governor in Council may make any regulations that the Governor in 
Council considers necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions of this Act 
and the Convention, including regulations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One of the regulations is for granting permits to kill, capture, 
take, buy, sell, exchange, give or possess migratory birds or to 
make migratory birds the subject of a commercial transaction.
<P>
	The act calls for penalties, for example, in section 13:
<P>
	``Every person who contravenes section 5, subsection 6(5) or 
any regulation is guilty of an offence punishable on summary 
conviction of up to $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding six months, or both; or is guilty of an indictable 
offence and is liable for $100,000 or imprisonment for a term 
not exceeding five years, or both''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5236"> 5236 </A></B>
<P>
	In my constituency last year we had someone who received 
the designation on a piece of plastic that said that he was now 
recognized as being-I apologize, I am not familiar with the 
terminology-an Indian or of Indian status. Upon receipt of that 
recognition he then drove 200 miles, went to a feeding station 
and blew away a world class ram and said that he had the right to 
do that.
<P>
	Any members in this House who takes my comment to be a 
slam or a slur would be sadly mistaken. I am asking a very blunt, 
open, honest question here. I would like to know, with the 
inclusion in Bill C-23, if a person may be subject to up to 
$100,000 fine because they are in possession of a migratory bird 
or nest or they attempt to buy, sell, exchange or give a migratory 
bird or nest or make it the subject of a commercial transaction. 
Basing that on one's parentage because of clause 2(3): ``For 
greater certainty, nothing in this act shall be construed so as to 
abrogate or derogate from any existing aboriginal or treaty 
rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada under section 35 of 
the Constitution Act, 1982''.
<P>
	I am having some difficulty and some confusion in my mind 
about that in terms of the long term picture. I believe that the 
statements made by Grand Chief Matthew Coon-Come in his 
presentations to the standing committee have some merit. What 
he was basically stating there, as I understood it, was that this 
issue should be looked at as to how we are going to work it out.
<P>
	He undoubtedly will be coming at it from a different 
perspective than I am. I am coming at it from the perspective of 
saying that if a person shoots a bird the bird is dead. If we 
assume that there might be one or two people of the Cree nation 
who are not prepared to obey the law under what law will they be 
prosecuted, and would I or the secretary be prosecuted to the 
extent of $100,000?
<P>
	I guess that is the one final question. Understand that the 
Reform Party supports the intent of Bill C-23. We wish to go 
ahead with the protection of the migratory birds. That is not the 
question. Also, we want to recognize that there are some long 
standing historic rights that the Cree and other aboriginal people 
have that have to be taken into account. What I am having 
difficulty with is the inclusion of that one amendment. I am 
having some difficulty understanding how we will be able to 
bring about regulations that are fair and equitable to all people 
in Canada.
<P>
	With that, recognizing that the probability is that recognition 
of aboriginal rights would nonetheless supersede Bill C-23, the 
inclusion of it is simply a statement of what is a fact. I would 
like, if possible, if someone is going to be following me, 
particularly from the government side, if they could help me 
understand how we are going to address this issue.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> On the first round there is no right for 
questions or comments as members will know, but with 
unanimous consent since the member has posed obvious 
questions and comments to the parliamentary secretary, perhaps 
we could seek unanimous consent to allow the parliamentary 
secretary to respond to the questions.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to have the parliamentary 
secretary reply to the comments made?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are two questions that I 
would like to answer.
<P>
	The first one relates to the process. In fairness to the person 
the hon. member is referring to, the representative of the 
environment minister, who suggested that the law be passed on 
that day, I can, knowing this person well, confirm that there was 
no hidden agenda, no intention to steamroll the thing.
<P>
	First of all, the person in charge of the legislative agenda for 
the minister had been advised that the timetable for legislation 
was getting much shorter and that it was very important to get 
these two bills through before the session recessed.
<P>
	More than that, the fact is that under a review of the powers of 
regulation and the regulations of the Ministry of the 
Environment in 1993 which I referred to in my speech, an 
extensive consultation had been carried out on a very broad 
basis of all the stakeholders, including a review of the migratory 
birds convention, which included representatives from 
aboriginal peoples, from the various stakeholders involved and 
interested in this bill.
<P>
	Further, amendments have been discussed for four years now 
with regard to the convention itself involving representatives of 
the aboriginal peoples. In complete objectivity it was felt by the 
people who advised the legislative assistant to the minister that 
we could proceed because consultation had been extensive all 
along.
<P>
	Seeing we did not have a consent, we recognize because we 
found out there would be time that it was a better process to have 
gone to the committee. I can assure the House that the person 
concerned backs this up 100 per cent.
<P>
	I can assure the member there was no hidden agenda there, no 
need to sort of steamroll the House or anything like this. It was a 
genuine attempt to complete the process, having taken into 
account that consultations had been extensive in the past.
<P>
	With regard to the second question, the aboriginal treaties and 
rights under the Constitution, what we want to do in the act is 
really confirm the position that exists today, that the aboriginal 
people hunt and harvest during the closed season for other 
hunters. That does not mean to say that they are not subject to all 
the penalties of the law should they infringe any of the provi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5237"> 5237 </A></B>
<P>
sions of the act,  except that the season is open as far as they are 
concerned.
<P>
	That has been the tradition for thousands of years. It is a fact 
of life that we want to enshrine in the law. Even if it were not in 
the law they would still have this right. What we wanted to do as 
a very important symbolic gesture as required by Chief 
Coon-Come to sort of enshrine it in the law here. Certain legal 
advice obtained differed according to whether we did or did not 
recognize the rights of aboriginal peoples. They must be 
recognized anyway in actual practice. This is the position, 
whether we do or do not recognize their rights. We felt it was 
very important that we do.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I begin I would like to thank all the members of the 
environmental and sustainable development committee for their 
hard work and commitment to this important piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	As a committee we listened to a number of witnesses 
representing conservation groups, hunters and anglers, and 
native groups who all have a stake in the outcome of what we 
have to do today regarding this legislation.
<P>
	While the state of migratory birds in Canada may seem to 
some as less significant and less newsworthy than bills 
pertaining to economic matters or crime and justice issues, it is 
very significant.
<P>
	As this legislation has remained relatively untouched since 
1917 and if the future mirrors the past then it is possible that 
changes to this new legislation may not occur for another 50, 60, 
or 70 years.
<P>
	More important, the health of our migratory birds, indeed the 
health of all of our wildlife reflects the quality of human health.
<P>
	It is with these thoughts in mind that the committee members 
gave very serious consideration to Bill C-23 as drafted and the 
subsequent committee amendments. The Migratory Birds 
Convention Act implements the terms of the migratory birds 
convention signed in 1916 by Canada and the United States.
<P>
	The migratory birds convention will be undergoing 
renegotiation in the fall of 1994 to better reflect realities of the 
1990s. Bill C-23 will support these changes.
<P>
	The original migratory birds convention signed in 1916 by 
Canada and the United States was intended to curb blatant 
overhunting practices which in some instances led to the 
extinction of species of birds and of near extinction with other 
species.
<P>
	As one witness told us, we were able to create an incredible 
success story on the northern part of this continent through the 
migratory bird convention and other strategies to stem the 
slaughter and near annihilation of certain bird species.
<P>
	Conditions have changed since the turn of this century and as 
we approach the next century we must design and implement 
legislation that acknowledges and better reflects current 
demands.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development reviewed Bill C-23, heard witnesses, received 
briefs, and as a result decided Bill C-23 was supportable with a 
few additional changes.
<P>
	While a separate process to address First Nations aboriginal 
or treaty rights is under way and will be included in negotiations 
to the Canada-U.S. migratory bird convention it was decided by 
the committee to include a non-derogation clause that clearly 
acknowledges aboriginal or treaty rights.
<P>
	For greater certainty nothing in this act shall be construed as 
to abrogate or derogate from any existing aboriginal or treaty 
rights of the aboriginal people of Canada under section 35 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	For First Nations people migratory birds play a key role in 
sustaining a way of life. Migratory birds and wildlife are central 
to the preservation of not only First Nations culture but in some 
communities their nutritional survival as well.
<P>
	This is not to say that conservation and sustainability are at 
risk. Matthew Coon-Come, Chief of the Grand Cree Council, 
simply and eloquently stated: ``Geese first then Cree and third 
sports hunting''.
<P>
	Until negotiations to the migratory bird convention that 
reflect aboriginal treaty rights are complete, special 
enforcement measures exist that allow for traditional harvesting 
in closed season of migratory birds and eggs.
<P>
	Another amendment to Bill C-23 allows for game officers 
who carry out duties or functions under the act to be exempt 
from any of its provisions or regulations. This will greatly 
facilitate the enforcement aspects of the act, as game officers 
will be able to undertake undercover operations with suspected 
offenders without fear of being charged. This should improve 
their ability to gather clear and decisive evidence against 
offenders.
<P>
	Canadians value wildlife and the natural resources of this 
country. While a great many Canadians hunt or fish over 75 per 
cent enjoy wildlife through non-consumptive participation. 
They spent $2.4 billion on primary non-consumptive wildlife 
related trips and outings in 1991; $1.2 billion was spent on 
hunting.
<P>
	Preservation of migratory birds is very important to 
Canadians and contributes in very positive ways to the economy.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	Commercial poaching and smuggling of migratory birds pose 
grave risks. With this in mind, the committee spent a long time 
deliberating over the level of fines for offenders. After a great 
deal of thoughtful consideration, it was decided to increase the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5238"> 5238 </A></B>
<P>
fines for summary offences for individuals to a maximum of 
$50,000 and for a corporation to a maximum of $100,000.
<P>
	Maximum fines for indictable offences have been increased 
for individuals to $100,000 and for corporations to $250,000. In 
the case of subsequent offences, the subsequent fine may be 
doubled from the previous offence, notwithstanding the 
maximums already outlined.
<P>
	Some may scoff that the value of a bird being $100,000 or 
$250,000 is far too exorbitant. I would suggest that if they do, 
they do so in ignorance. No monetary value can be placed on the 
killing of a bird or other wildlife where that killing contributed 
in a real way to the endangerment of the species.
<P>
	This government is committed to strengthening the 
participation of committees in the work of governing the 
country. I applaud this initiative and see as a result of this new 
attitude toward governing the substantial contributions made by 
members of the environment and sustainable development 
committee in proposing amendments to Bill C-23.
<P>
	The final amendment I would like to address today arises 
from suggestions made by witnesses appearing before the 
committee. I believe the inclusion of this amendment 
strengthens the democratic process by increasing participation 
in that process. This amendment proposes that any amendment 
to the migratory birds convention be tabled in both Houses and 
debated in the House of Commons.
<P>
	As we proceeded with the witnesses, it became quite evident 
that a number of other issues beyond the scope of this legislation 
must also be addressed if we are to truly protect and enhance the 
health of migratory birds.
<P>
	The committee examined both Bill C-23 and Bill C-24, a bill 
to amend the Canada Wildlife Act. A number of concerns 
articulated by witnesses pertain to the wider category of 
wildlife, not only migratory birds.
<P>
	Issues related to enforcement and habitat protection were 
most often identified by witnesses. From my experience with 
the two pieces of legislation, Bill C-23 and Bill C-24, I have 
come to respect the dedication and commitment shown by 
officials of the Canadian Wildlife Service.
<P>
	However, in terms of enforcement they are in dire need of 
support to increase the number of game officers. Witness after 
witness spoke of real problems that existed because required 
coverage was far too vast for the number of available game 
officers.
<P>
	As a result, it may be difficult to implement even the best 
legislation. Habitat protection, another key concern of 
witnesses, has many dimensions. Many strategies need to be 
deployed in order to ensure sustainability and viability.
<P>
	The migratory birds convention was originally intended to 
deal with the severe overhunting problems that threatened many 
species at that time. While commercial poaching and smuggling 
are still significant threats, habitat protection is the number one 
concern for the preservation of not only migratory birds but all 
Canadian wildlife.
<P>
	The amendment to the Canada Wildlife Act to expand the 
scope of coverage of wildlife to include all living organisms is a 
much needed change and provides not only a valuable starting 
point but also a valuable rethinking of what species preservation 
really means.
<P>
	If we are really serious about preserving and protecting 
wildlife in this country, we must first and foremost be very 
serious about habitat protection. Wildlife have been called the 
barometer of the landscape. The capacity of the land or habitat 
to support fish, birds and mammals is a good indicator of its 
capacity to meet human needs; wildlife habitat is human habitat.
<P>
	As long as we have endangered spaces in this country we will 
continue to have endangered species. There are a number of 
strategies and programs designed to rehabilitate, preserve and 
protect habitats.
<P>
	We have entered into agreements with the United States and 
now recently with the Mexican government through the North 
American waterfowl management plan to ensure that migratory 
waterfowl have safe and healthy areas for nesting and feeding.
<P>
	As I stated earlier in my speech, even though we have 
achieved a truly unique and wonderful success story in reversing 
the trend toward endangerment and annihilation for some 
species, I fear we are falling behind. Our precious wetlands, the 
most biologically diverse ecosystems, are under attack. They 
are being drained for agricultural uses and development 
purposes.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Toxic substances have entered our watersheds and 
contaminated the fish the birds eat resulting in deformities, soft 
eggshells that cannot withstand the pressure of parental 
incubation, crossed bills, jaw defects and malformed feet and 
joints. Forests that provided habitat protection for wildlife have 
been lost due to clear-cutting.
<P>
	These are for the most part beyond the scope of the legislation 
before us. However, they are important considerations that we 
must not forget if we are to truly preserve the sustainability and 
health of migratory birds.
<P>
	I urge the members of this House to support Bill C-23 and its 
proposed amendments fully without delay.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, just like 
my colleague from Frontenac, I too am pleased, as a member of 
the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development, to speak on Bill C-23 today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5239"> 5239 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill replaces the Migratory Birds Convention Act which 
dates back to 1917. Needless to say that many things have 
changed since 1917. That is why I consider essential that this act 
which has remained basically unchanged over all those years be 
reviewed.
<P>
	To fully grasp the meaning of the federal legislation on the 
subject, some background information is required concerning 
the origins of this act. The act was passed in 1917 after an 
international convention was entered into by Canada and the 
United States in 1916. The purpose of the Migratory Bird 
Convention was to protect migratory birds from the slaughter 
they were facing at the time and save their population from often 
senseless human action.
<P>
	The 1917 enactment regulated the hunting of migratory birds 
and prohibited trafficking and commercialization of them. The 
goals of the act remain relevant today, but over the years the 
means by which they were to be achieved have become outdated.
<P>
	Lawmakers could certainly not be expected to foresee in 1917 
the sharp scientific and technological expansion that lay ahead, 
over the course of the 20th century. As we know, phenomenal 
advances were made in science. Protection of embryos and 
tissue cultures as well as the protection of endangered species 
and prohibition of trafficking are the main considerations the 
new legislation must be based on.
<P>
	This new legislation, that is to say Bill C-23, is indeed 
essential to protect migratory birds. Recent reports in the 
<I>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</I> and <I>La Presse</I> indicated that 1,000 out 
of 9,600 bird species, or 10 per cent of our bird population, 
threaten to become extinct in the short term. This is quite 
obviously a matter of urgency.
<P>
	Also, one of the reasons stated by the American magazine 
<I>World Watch</I> for the decline in the number of birds world-wide 
and in Canada was as follows, and I quote: ``Most bird species 
are in decline because the natural balance is upset by the global 
expansion of mankind. We are entirely to blame for the problem 
and must find ways to resolve it.''
<P>
	For example, the problems caused by deforestation due to 
urban spread or farmland expansion and exponential population 
growth contribute to the degradation of wildlife habitat. 
Industrial and domestic pollution are also among the new 
concerns that must guide us in drafting legislation respecting the 
protection of migratory birds and environmental protection in 
general.
<P>
	Let us now take a closer look at the proposals contained in Bill 
C-23 to update the former act which dated back to 1917. Clause 
2, the interpretation clause, was changed to broaden the scope of 
the act. For example, the definition of the word conveyance will 
now include any contrivance used to hunt birds.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, the definition of ``migratory bird'' is amended so 
as to include the sperm, eggs, embryo and tissue cultures. As I 
said earlier, this change is essential for the survival of species in 
this era of technological revolution.
<P>
	Another important change, which consists in distinguishing 
between to ``be in possession'' and to ``buy or sell'', will allow 
the courts to treat the illegal marketing and trade of birds as a 
more serious offence than mere possession.
<P>
	Several technical changes reaffirm the power of game officers 
to inspect and search. However, a provision is added to protect 
people against abusive searches, in compliance with the charter 
of rights and freedoms.
<P>
	Moreover, regulations can be made under clause 12.(1)<I>(f</I>) to 
ensure better control over the issuance of permits. Indeed, 
problems can often be solved at the root. It is more than 
desirable that the government makes such regulations soon, as 
authorized by this legislation.
<P>
	A major change which, in our opinion, will be welcome if it is 
used properly, is the considerable increase regarding fines 
imposed to offenders. Since the applicable provisions of the 
1917 legislation have never been amended, the current act only 
provides for fines of $10 to $300. This will no way deter a 
modern-day offender.
<P>
	The proposed amendments provide for fines of $50,000 to 
$250,000, depending on the type of offence. In the case of a 
repeat offender, the amounts can be doubled. This is a big 
improvement. I do hope that the legislator will not wait another 
77 years to update these amounts, and that in the future 
parliamentarians will closely and regularly review this 
legislation.
<P>
	I want to conclude by reminding you of the importance of 
protecting and preserving migratory birds in Canada. Think of 
the loon on our dollar. Think of the snowy owl and other birds 
which are symbols in our country. This is a good example of the 
international scope of environmental problems. Indeed, 
migratory birds, like pollution, cross borders, making it all the 
more important to conclude international agreements, instead of 
just passing national laws.
<P>
	If Canada wants to ensure sustainable development, not only 
will it have to pass effective legislation, but it will also have to 
sign good international conventions, so as to adequately protect 
itself from transborder environmental problems.
<P>
	It might also be wise to reflect on the opportunity of having a 
chart promoting the environment and sustainable development. 
This would be a comprehensive and practical document, such as 
the charter of rights and freedoms, which would ensure 
individuals that, like them, the environment is well protected.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in introducing the debate on third reading of Bill C-24, 
I would like to quote from <I>Life in the Balance</I> by David Rains 
Wallace: ``Yet wildlife and wilderness are not the cause of 
poverty. Humans would hardly be better off were the last forest 
logged, grassland ploughed, mountain mined, desert irrigated, 
tundra drilled, river dammed, wetland drained, ocean depleted 
and islands stripped of native flora and fauna. Scientific 
evidence and simple logic suggest that civilization cannot 
deface the planet with impunity''.
<P>
	I think this is at the basis of the wildlife act that we are trying 
to pass today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to present the bill to amend the Canada Wildlife 
Act at third reading. At a time when the health of the economy is 
the number-one concern of many Canadians, some may ask why 
we are looking at the issue of wildlife protection. My answer is 
this: ``Protecting wildlife and the Canadian environment is 
essential to our country's long-term prosperity in the broadest 
sense of the word''.
<P>
	For Canadians and for people around the world, our wildlife is 
part of our country's identity and uniqueness. Wildlife remains 
at the centre of Native Canadians' traditional way of life. It can 
offer still undiscovered treasures; some species could be used in 
various ways in the interest of human beings. Wildlife is an 
essential evironmental, social and cultural resource.
<P>
	Wildlife-related recreational activities are important in 
Canada. They inject billions of dollars into the economy and 
create tens of thousands of jobs. In fact, a vast majority of 
Canadians want our wildlife to be protected so that future 
generations can enjoy the same abundance. According to a 
recent Statistics Canada survey, over 90 per cent of Canadians 
say they have a sustained interest in wildlife conservation. They 
are not motivated only by feelings but by a realistic 
understanding.
<P>
	They heard and they support the sustainable environment 
message: that the health of the environment and economic 
development are interdependent, that no economy is possible 
without the environment and that we cannot have quality of life 
if the economy is not built around the environment. Canadians 
are willing to do their part for sustainable development and they 
are asking the government to do its part.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1990 the Wildlife Ministers Council of Canada comprised 
of federal and provincial ministers responsible for wildlife 
wrote a wildlife policy for Canada. The Canada Wildlife Act was 
enacted in 1973 to enable the federal government to carry out 
wildlife research and in co-operation with the provinces to 
undertake a wide range of wildlife conservation and 
interpretation activities for wildlife and its habitat, including 
the protection of endangered species. The act allows the 
minister to acquire any lands for the purposes of research, 
conservation, and interpretation in respect of migratory birds 
and if international interests and with the support of the 
provinces other species including endangered species.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Areas of key significance to Canada's wildlife are protected 
through regulations under this act. There are currently 45 
national wildlife areas in Canada comprising 287,000 hectares. 
Traditionally wildlife conservation has focused on particular 
species or species groups and has generally been limited to the 
higher orders of animals. It is now widely recognized that a 
broader approach to conservation is needed, an ecosystemic 
approach that considers all ecosystems, factions and values 
including all animal and plant species and the full range of their 
habitat requirements.
<P>
	This is the approach recommended in the policy of the 
provincial and federal ministers in wildlife policy for Canada to 
which I just referred.
<P>
	Conservation of wildlife often requires protection of habitat 
critical to the survival of a species. Traditional habitat 
protection has focused on terrestrial wildlife species and the 
habitats. The marine ecosystem and its biodiversity remain 
largely un-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5241"> 5241 </A></B>
<P>
protected from the habitat perspective. At present application of 
the act is limited to the territorial 12-mile limit.
<P>
	Critical wildlife habitat, including areas with significant 
concentration of seabirds and breeding and feeding grounds for 
whales exist or extend beyond the territorial sea. Such areas 
include polynyas, openings in the ice cover, and sea mounts, 
upwellings of nutrients in the ocean and other areas associated 
with Canada's continental shelf.
<P>
	We therefore have a provision to allow for the establishment 
of protected areas within the area bounded by the territorial sea 
and the 200-nautical mile limit so that this would contribute to 
sustaining the biodiversity and associated benefits of the marine 
ecosystems.
<P>
	In introducing this bill the federal government is meeting the 
demand of Canadian citizens, reflected in the red book, that we 
follow the path of sustainable development.
<P>
	We appreciate the implications of that commitment. It means 
adopting an ecosystemic approach, tackling problems in their 
broad context. It means working in partnership with other 
governments, with other sectors of activity, with individual 
Canadians toward our common goals.
<P>
	This is how we will make sustainable development happen 
and this is how the federal government is now addressing the 
issue of wildlife. Amending the Canada Wildlife Act is not an 
isolated gesture, it is part of a co-ordinated strategy to give our 
country effective wildlife legislation, reflecting the latest 
science and meeting the needs of our times.
<P>
	Other components of that strategy are the bill to amend the 
Migratory Birds Convention Act which we just passed, Bill 
C-23, the drafting of regulations for the Wild Animal and Plant 
Protection and Regulation of Interprovincial and International 
Trade Act, and the forthcoming negotiations with the United 
States in amending the binational migratory birds convention.
<P>
	The Canada Wildlife Act is a vital piece of legislation. It 
provides a framework for the federal government's effort to 
promote wildlife and habitat conservation programs. It enables 
productive partnerships and implementation of wildlife 
programs and policies with provincial governments and with the 
private sector.
<P>
	Since the act was passed in 1973 however we have come to 
recognize certain limitations in its legislation. Bill C-24 has 
been brought before Parliament to address these limitations. 
Following second reading, the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development conducted a 
thorough review of Bill C-24, including public hearings and 
submission of briefs by a broad range of witnesses. This review 
has lead to additional changes that reflect the concerns and 
views expressed in the committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-24 will replace the definition of wildlife found in the 
old act, which seems much too narrow. Instead of non-domestic 
animals, the amendments will include all wild animals and 
plants in the definition of ``wildlife''. This broader definition 
will allow us to adopt an ecosystemic approach to wildlife 
protection; in an endangered habitat, we can therefore work to 
help all of the different species which, together, support life, and 
not just the well-known birds and mammals.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The new definition also brings the act into line with the 
federal-provincial policy on wildlife in Canada, adopted in 
1990, and the Biodiversity Convention, which Canada signed at 
the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
<P>
	Another important change brought about by Bill C-24 is that 
Canada will now be able to protect wildlife habitats in marine 
areas. The bill presently before the House makes it possible to 
establish protected marine areas anywhere within the 
200-nautical-mile zone, outside the previous 12 nautical miles. 
This zone includes vital breeding areas and feeding grounds 
used by whales, sea birds and other species. The extended 
coverage to these areas will make it possible to provide far more 
complete protection to many species.
<P>
	Another change will make the act more effective by 
improving its administration and enforcement. The amendments 
will give more teeth to the act by raising the penalties faced by 
potential offenders, thus making the penalties real deterrents. 
The maximum fines for serious offences would be $100,000 for 
an individual and $250,000 for a corporation, with provisions 
making it possible to increase fines for a second offence or for 
continuing offences. At the same time, the amended act will give 
enforcement officers and the courts more flexibility in respect 
of offences and punishment. They will now be able to choose the 
most appropriate punishment in response to an offence, even 
community service or payment of the cost of damages caused to 
a national wildlife area.
<P>
	The amendments concerning provisions related to 
punishment, powers and enforcement procedures and a clause 
safeguarding ancestral and treaty rights are similar to those 
described in the third reading of Bill C-23.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore I will take this opportunity to discuss some of the 
broad aspects of wildlife conservation which this legislation 
supports.
<P>
	Bill C-24 will enable Canada to meet its commitments and 
international agreements. One such key agreement is the 1975 
Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance 
which Canada signed in 1981. This is one of the most widely 
adopted conservation treaties in the world and over 80 nations 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5242"> 5242 </A></B>
<P>
have agreed to  promote the conservation and wise use of 
wetland habitat, particularly for waterfowl.
<P>
	Wetlands are of special importance to Canada. They provide a 
large proportion of our fresh water supply. They filter out 
pollutants from the ecosystems. They protect against flooding. 
They enhance water quality and they are essential wildlife 
habitats. They also make a significant contribution to our 
economy, estimated at over $10 billion a year. That figure 
covers a wide range of recreational activities, both commercial 
and non-commercial.
<P>
	Canada's wetlands have a global importance as well. Within 
our borders lie roughly 24 per cent of the world's total wetland 
resource. This gives us a special responsibility for using our 
share of the resource properly. Unfortunately we have not 
always done so. Though we still have 127 million hectares of 
wetland we have allowed over one seventh of our original 
wetland area, most in southern Canada to be converted to other 
land uses.
<P>
	Since signing the Ramsar convention we have been working 
to improve our record. Canada now has a total of 32 designated 
wetlands of international importance, a network spanning all 
our provinces and territories, and many of these are also national 
wildlife areas established under the Canada Wildlife Act.
<P>
	Canada's Ramsar wetlands cover 13 million hectares which is 
over 30 per cent of all the wetland areas designated under the 
convention. In addition since 1992 we have had a federal policy 
on wetland conservation which fosters the conservation of 
Canada's wetlands to sustain the ecological and socioeconomic 
factions for both now and in the future. Many provinces have or 
are developing complementary wetland policies and the private 
sector and non-government organizations continue to play a 
significant role in wetland conservation.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Today wetland conservation in Canada is a co-operative 
undertaking of different levels of government, different sectors 
and individuals, with the federal government playing a key role. 
The North American waterfowl management plan, which I 
described during the third reading of Bill C-23, is an excellent 
example of this co-operation. This is a sustainable way of 
managing our wetlands.
<P>
	Better wetland conservation will lead to many direct benefits 
for Canadians, the most obvious, of course, improved wildlife 
habitat and the higher population levels for waterfowl.
<P>
	There are other benefits as well. Among them, reduced soil 
erosion, improved ground water quality, less degradation of 
farmland, less damage from flooding and storms, and extended 
protection against the effects of drought and climate change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Biodiversity Convention is by far the most important 
international wildlife agreement to come along in many years. It 
is one of the major achievements of the 1992 Earth Summit in 
Brazil. It was not an easy task to get such a large number of 
parties to find an acceptable common ground and Canadians 
should be proud of their efforts to obtain widespread approval 
for the Convention.
<P>
	We have also demonstrated our commitment to the 
Convention by moving quickly to sign and ratify it. 
Furthermore, the federal government has begun working with 
the provinces and territories to formulate a Canadian 
biodiversity strategy which will enable us to meet our 
commitments under the convention.
<P>
	Under the terms of the convention, countries are required to 
regulate or manage biological resources in such a way as to 
ensure their conservation and sustainable use and to establish a 
system of refuges to preserve biodiversity. Moreover, as part of 
the conservation process, all species of an ecosystem must be 
taken into consideration and countries must draft legislative 
provisions to protect species threatened with extinction.
<P>
	Bill C-24 will help Canada fulfil the requirements of the 
convention. The Biodiversity Convention and the other 
international agreements I mentioned are important not for what 
Canada brings to them, but for what they bring to Canada. They 
establish a framework for our actions. They set global 
objectives. They recognize the importance of fragile habitats in 
Canada and in at least one case, that of the North American 
Waterfowl Management Plan, they channel funds for habitat 
protection. But above all, these agreements advance concepts on 
which our actions aimed at protecting Canada's wildlife should 
be based.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is in this context that the federal government is proposing 
amendments to the Canada Wildlife Act and to the Migratory 
Birds Convention Act.
<P>
	Times have changed since this legislation was enacted and we 
must move with them. We must conform to higher 
environmental standards domestically and globally. We must 
integrate the latest scientific understanding into our programs. 
We must deal with changing environmental priorities. Most of 
all, we must respond to the demand and expectations of 
Canadians, young and old.
<P>
	Across the country Canadians have recognized the need for 
sustainable wildlife policies and practices and they are calling 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5243"> 5243 </A></B>
<P>
on government, especially the federal government, to take the 
lead on this issue. That is why we have brought forward the 
amendments to the Canada Wildlife Act.
<P>
	Today there was an article in the <I>Gazette</I> about the St. 
Lawrence National Institute of Ecotoxicology. Dr. Pierre 
Béland, who started the institute 11 years ago is somebody I 
know well. For many years he has been recovering the belugas in 
the St. Lawrence that die on our shores. He has carried out 
autopsies on these belugas, 69 of them since 1983.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	The <I>Gazette</I> article described the plight of the belugas. The St. 
Lawrence institute scientifically dissected 69 belugas which 
were found to have 100 parts per million of PCBs in them. The 
industrial norm is 50 parts per million of PCBs. The norm is two 
parts per million of PCBs for edible fish. Yet 69 of these belugas 
were found to have 100 parts per million of PCBs in their bodies. 
Dr. Pierre Béland joked, and I am sure it was a very bitter joke, 
that the belugas in the St. Lawrence should have permits to swim 
there because they are so toxified.
<P>
	Among those 69 whales they have dissected since 1983 they 
found: 28 had tumours, including malignant tumours; 37 had 
very bad lesions in their digestive systems; and 31 of the 
females had lesions on their mammary glands. This is a terrible 
indictment on all of us for having neglected our heritage to the 
point that we have allowed toxins to fester our lakes, our rivers, 
our land and our air. It is to the point that today the animals, the 
innocent residents of the ecosystem, suffer the ills of our guilt 
and our fault.
<P>
	We should reflect on what is happening to the belugas of the 
St. Lawrence. What would Canada be without the polar bear in 
the Arctic? What would Canada be without the black bear or the 
grizzly in the Rockies? What would Canada be without the 
belugas in the St. Lawrence or the northern seas? What would 
Canada be without the snow geese and other birds? Would it be a 
heritage of nature or would it be a dead heritage, a silent 
heritage?
<P>
	That is why we are so intent on seeing that Bill C-24, the 
Canada Wildlife Act, as well as Bill C-23 which we just passed, 
become essential legislation. It fortifies our resolve to preserve 
habitats, the ecosystem and the environment which is at the base 
of the quality of life and living for all of us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
again today on an environmental bill, C-24. This bill amends the 
1973 Canada Wildlife Act. According to the minister, the 
purpose of this act is to permit the government to conduct 
wildlife research and, in co-operation with the provinces, to 
undertake various activities related to wildlife conservation and 
interpretation. The provinces are responsible for managing 
wildlife, except for most species of migratory birds, fish and 
mammals.
<P>
	Like C-23, the bill updates an existing law. Basically, it 
modernizes the law and includes some new features. It is 
essential to watch out for environmental problems and to have 
the tools required to avoid them, especially those affecting 
biodiversity.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Chapter 6 of the Brundtland report says: ``Conservation of 
living natural resources-plants, animals and micro-organisms, 
and the non-living elements of the environment on which they 
depend-is crucial for development. Today, the conservation of 
wild living resources is on the agenda of governments; nearly 4 
per cent of the Earth's land area is managed explicitly to 
conserve species and ecosystems, and all but a small handful of 
countries have national parks. The challenge facing nations 
today is no longer deciding whether conservation is a good idea, 
but rather how it can be implemented in the national interest and 
within the means available in each country''.
<P>
	Like the leaders of other countries that signed the Brundtland 
report, we in this House are all convinced, I am sure, of the 
importance of protecting endangered species. The issue is 
finding ways to achieve our goals. The old law essentially 
protected wild animals, plants and other organisms. Replacing 
the French word ``faune'' by ``espèces sauvages'' considerably 
broadens the scope of the new law. We think that it is essential to 
extend the law in this way in order to protect the natural habitats 
of the wildlife that we want to protect. This amendment to the 
law fills a gaping legal hole in the 1973 act.
<P>
	Furthermore, the amendments to be made to the Act will 
create protected marine areas within any fishing zone prescribed 
in the Territorial Sea and Fishing Zones Act. It will be possible 
to conduct research on marine wildlife and to undertake various 
activities related to wildlife conservation and interpretation. 
This very useful addition to the act will enhance the protection 
of a larger number of marine wildlife species.
<P>
	From now on, wildlife officers will have the powers of peace 
officers. This means they will be able to apply the provisions of 
the Criminal Code. In an emergency, they will also be 
authorized to carry out inspections and searches without a 
warrant. These special powers will make it easier for wildlife 
officers to operate in an isolated forest areas, for instance.
<P>
	Although, we in the Bloc Quebecois would have liked to see 
some guarantee of federal co-operation with the provinces, but 
it would have been difficult to obtain such guarantees in 
committee. In the act, it says that provincial government 
employees appointed by the minister require the agreement and 
consent of the province to perform their duties in the province. 
The act also says that the Minister of the Environment may, in 
exceptional circumstances, give these officers special powers. 
We said yes, the minister may give them special powers, but 
since they were appointed with the agreement of the province, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5244"> 5244 </A></B>
<P>
we felt that this was an amendment that would  be hard to sell, 
although it would reinforce the legislation.
<P>
	Officers will be able to inspect any premises or vehicle for the 
presence of wildlife. Everyone agrees that without this 
provision, effective application of the act would be in jeopardy. 
However, the bill observes the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
with a provision to project the public against inspection without 
just cause. That is a very important point.
<P>
	As in Bill C-23, the legislation includes a provision to 
recover any costs arising from the offence from the violators. It 
is very important that such costs not be borne by the taxpayers. 
Finally, a substantial increase in fines for violations of the act 
will surely enhance the deterrent effect of this legislation. I hope 
that the maximum fine of $250,000 will have that effect and that 
the government will not hesitate to revise this amount if it 
appears insufficient to achieve the aims of this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the bill allows the court to order offenders to 
remedy any harm they may have caused to the environment. The 
inclusion of this provision surely increases the legislation's 
desired deterrent effect.
<P>
	In conclusion, the efforts made to achieve the goals of 
environmental protection and sustainable development must be 
followed up by the stringent enforcement of the act. Concrete, 
ongoing action must be taken in the environmental field to 
achieve sustainable development, the mark of a healthy 
economy and a healthy, flourishing society.
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians have given us a clear mandate to 
deal with environmental issues and we must do everything in our 
power to fulfil the terms of our mandate. We must atone for past 
mistakes and see that we do not repeat them. We can never say it 
enough: the environment knows no borders or party affiliation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose 
of Bill C-24 is to amend and strengthen the existing Canada 
Wildlife Act which was originally proclaimed in 1973 and has 
essentially remained the same for the last 20 years.
<P>
	Reform members in the House strongly believe that the 
current wildlife protection legislation is inadequate. We believe 
that it must be changed and updated to properly address the 
environmental concerns Canadians have in the 1990s.
<P>
	The Reform Party is a party that is deeply concerned with 
Canada's environment. One of the principles of the party is that 
we believe Canada's identity and vision for the future should be 
rooted in and inspired by a fresh appreciation of our land and the 
supreme importance to our well-being of exploring, 
developing, renewing and conserving our natural resources and 
physical  environment. This forms part of our party's 
commitment to a clean healthy environment for all Canadians.
<P>
	The proposed changes to the Canada Wildlife Act will expand 
the definition of wildlife to include all wild organisms, 
including plants, fungi, insects. It will thereby make it 
consistent with the convention on biodiversity which was 
ratified by Canada in 1993.
<P>
	Some of the other amendments to the act will allow for 
national wildlife areas to be established in marine ecosystems in 
Canada's coastal waters out to the 200-mile limit to protect the 
beluga whales in Isabella Bay, west coast salmon and seabirds. 
The legislation will also enable the federal government to carry 
out its responsibility for wildlife research and a wide range of 
conservation and interpretation activities for wildlife and its 
habitat.
<P>
	The act will also provide a greater deterrent to illegal 
activities such as poaching, by providing a maximum penalty of 
$100,000 or five years in jail, or both for serious offences.
<P>
	The mandate of the federal government environment 
department in Canada is to manage and conserve migratory 
birds and, in co-operation with the provinces and territories, 
other wildlife of national and international concern. Canada as a 
member of the international community has obligations to help 
preserve and protect our wildlife and wildlife areas. However, 
sustaining healthy, thriving populations of wild species 
contributes to the economic, social and cultural well-being of 
our nation as well.
<P>
	The Canada Wildlife Act recognizes the benefits that wildlife 
has and is a recognition that legislation and regulation should be 
the essential tools in helping to preserve them for future 
generations. It must be remembered that other things must also 
be done to improve the current situation.
<P>
	Canadians must educate themselves on the serious threat that 
illegal activity such as poaching poses for our wildlife. This 
information is currently available from a number of different 
sources, including government organizations, 
non-governmental organizations and hunting and angling clubs. 
If you want to meet a group of dedicated environmentalists, then 
turn up at your neighbourhood rod and gun club.
<P>
	In economic terms the federal environment department has 
estimated that expenditures associated with all types of fish and 
wildlife related recreational activities have contributed 
approximately $11.5 billion to our gross domestic product, $4.4 
billion in tax revenue, and more than one-quarter million jobs 
for Canadians. Clearly Canada's living natural resources are a 
valued part of our social and economic well-being. I state again 
that real environmentalists, those who value our wildlife most 
highly, are the responsible hunters who pour their time and 
money into the enhancement and maintenance of this resource.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5245"> 5245 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	It is very doubtful that anyone in the House needs to be 
convinced that conserving and protecting our environment has 
become a major political and economic issue in our country. 
Opinion polls show that over 90 per cent of Canadians are 
concerned about the state of our environment. The polls also 
show that the people of Canada are split with regard to their 
satisfaction with the ability of the federal government to handle 
difficult environmental issues.
<P>
	Responsible hunters work with game wardens and law 
enforcement officers to protect wildlife from illegal harvesting 
or killing; in other words poaching. Every year poaching, which 
is the illegal taking of wildlife, results in millions of animals 
being killed for personal use or profit. They are sold on the black 
market in Canada and in other countries. It has often been 
estimated that the illegal kill in Canada is approximately double 
the legal kill. Poachers know that there is little risk involved in 
their activities including the risk of being caught. As little as 1 
per cent of poaching crimes are investigated. Even if they are 
caught the fines are considered a cost of doing business.
<P>
	The illegal trade in wildlife in Canada is a multi-million 
dollar business. The combination of high profits, low risk and 
the thrill of illegal activity makes poaching a very attractive 
business enterprise.
<P>
	Responsible hunters, the ones we see in hunting vehicles 
carrying and wearing their hunting equipment in the fall, in 
unison say that Canada's wildlife protection and conservation 
legislation must be enforced to stop illegal activities such as 
poaching.
<P>
	However we must ask ourselves if the provisions of the bill 
are tough enough. What about the enforcement of and 
punishment for these crimes? Any new or improved existing 
laws must also be strictly enforced if they are to protect 
Canada's wildlife. There must also be recognition on behalf of 
Canada's court system including prosecutors and judges that 
wildlife offences are serious and should be treated in a serious 
manner.
<P>
	In general the Reform Party supports the changes made in the 
act after having had an opportunity to examine possible 
amendments in committee. Many groups made representations 
to the committee and some changes to the bill could be made.
<P>
	One aspect of the bill which my party is very pleased to see 
receive almost total agreement is the stronger and improved 
enforcement and punishment section. Although the bill finally 
puts some teeth into the existing Canada Wildlife Act that up 
until this point it has lacked, we believe the enforcement 
provisions for maximum penalties could have been made even 
tougher.
<P>
	Also the section on the recovery of administration costs in the 
act is to be improved. This is a development that the Reform 
Party, as a party built on the premise that government should be 
as fiscally prudent as possible and in light of Canada's current 
fiscal financial situation, can easily agree to.
<P>
	We believe it is the proper approach to recover costs related to 
the management of public lands and protected marine areas. It 
will mean reduced expenditures on government's behalf, a more 
self-sufficient regulatory system, and will allow for greater 
financial sustainability over the long term.
<P>
	However, as I raised in the debate on Bill C-23, again I raise 
the issue of aboriginal exclusion from the act and the problems 
that generates. I cite four examples. First, there is a domestic 
herd in northern Saskatchewan that from time to time is 
bothered or pestered by a wild herd. The answer on the part of 
the owner of the herd is to hire an aboriginal hunter who can 
shoot the elk out of season.
<P>
	Second, in northern British Columbia a non-aboriginal group 
put together the start of a full buffalo herd. They were going to 
be setting it up as a venture wherein they could bring in hunters 
from around the world. However they were thwarted in that 
some people from the aboriginal population in northern B.C. 
went in and wiped out the herd.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Third, there are deer around Princeton, British Columbia, 
about a three-hour drive east of Vancouver. It is well known and 
documented that aboriginal hunters from the Cariboo, a 
five-hour drive away, drive there and harvest out of season.
<P>
	Fourth, in my constituency a person, upon receipt of 
designation as a status Indian, drove two hours past a sheep 
herd, went to a feeding station and shot a world class ram 
because of the curl of his horns.
<P>
	These are examples of what happens when a particular group 
of people are taken out and given exclusion from bills like Bill 
C-23. They are not by any means a constant example; they are 
not by any means suggesting that all people of aboriginal 
descent would involve themselves in this. As a matter of fact 
those people would be a very rare exception. Nonetheless by 
having them outside the act makes this a possibility. It creates a 
serious concern and a lot of hostility on the part of people who 
cannot take advantage of the exclusion.
<P>
	Canadians have been telling us that they want governments at 
all levels to protect and conserve our nation's wildlife. I believe 
as part of that we must get together to somehow address the 
aboriginal issue. We as policy makers and regulators must take 
this responsibility very seriously and deliver on this 
commitment for a healthier environment. If we are successful it 
will be to the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5246"> 5246 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity of supporting Bill C-24 
during third reading in the House today. While the legal text of 
the legislation defines the scope of the act, the regulatory 
authorities, penalties, enforcement powers and administrative 
procedures, it is the overall intent of the act and its amendments 
that makes it truly significant.
<P>
	Sustainable development is a phrase commonly used today to 
describe how we should approach decision making in matters of 
the environment and the economy. Although there are many 
interpretations of how this approach should be applied, it is 
generally accepted that it involves adopting a forward looking 
and broadly based approach which considers both the long term 
economic and environmental consequences of any decision or 
action.
<P>
	Implicit in this is the understanding that sustaining or 
enhancing the health of our economy intimately depends on the 
health of our environment and the sustainability of its resources. 
We have many situations where tough decisions have been made 
to ensure sustainable use of our renewable resources. Atlantic 
cod in the Pacific salmon fisheries is a recent example in which 
drastic action is necessary.
<P>
	Conservation has become a priority. To avoid these situations 
we must ensure that we understand and anticipate problems and 
that all sectors are able to work together and build on each 
other's strengths to find the best means of managing and 
integrating our economy and our environment.
<P>
	Solutions must be based on good science, consultation, 
co-operation and agreement. That is why I consider Bill C-24 so 
significant. We cannot hope to achieve sustainable development 
unless we have the tools. The Canada Wildlife Act is a tool for 
sustainable development and the amendments will make it an 
even more effective tool.
<P>
	The act does not position the Government of Canada to act 
alone. Some may criticize it for that very reason, but by now we 
must have learned it is not possible to impose solutions for the 
kinds of problems we are talking about here: problems of loss of 
species and habitat conversion, problems of lack of information 
or informed decision making and so on.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	We must ensure that we come to an informed consensus of a 
need to take action and we must in fact act together. That is why 
the act is set up as enabling legislation. That is why it demands 
that the government establish partnerships with the relevant 
provincial and territorial agencies and with other 
non-governmental partners.
<P>
	The programs that have been and will be established under the 
authority of the act are models for the way we need to 
co-operate in Canada to deal with issues that cross 
jurisdictional boundaries. We need to recognize the strengths 
that various partners bring to the table and use  those strengths, 
not argue who should get credit for what, in support of our 
commonly held objectives of habitat conservation, conservation 
of threatened endangered species and making sure that citizens 
know and appreciate the importance of wildlife to their 
economic and social well-being; in short in support of 
sustainable development.
<P>
	Many examples of conservation programs, co-operative 
research efforts and bilateral and multilateral conservation 
agreements have resulted from the act's implementation. For 
example, RENEW, an acronym for the recovery of nationally 
endangered wildlife, is a co-operative program of the federal 
and provincial governments and national conservation 
organizations to develop and implement recovery plans for 
Canada's endangered species.
<P>
	The protection of habitat under the act also depends on 
co-operation and partnership. There are currently 45 protected 
areas, as we have already been told, covering 287,000 hectares 
of Canada. If we include the areas protected under the Migratory 
Birds Convention Act, the total area protected is more than 
twice the size of Nova Scotia. These protected areas are 
established in full consultation with local communities and the 
provinces or territory involved. Once the conservation 
objectives have been determined, agreement on the type of 
protective measures that would be appropriate are decided. A 
distinct management regime thus evolves reflecting the 
concerns of all stakeholders.
<P>
	An example of this process is the current work with the Inuit 
of Clyde River to establish a marine national wildlife area at 
Isabella Bay, Baffin Island. The Inuit originated the proposal 
because of concerns for the endangered population of bowhead 
whales which use this area as summer feeding grounds. The 
national wildlife area will form the core of an international 
biosphere reserve. Co-management of the area will focus on 
protecting critical habitat, ensuring continued traditional 
sustenance practices and promoting ecotourism and research on 
whales.
<P>
	Two provisions in Bill C-24 will significantly enhance the 
potential scope for establishing protected areas. The first is the 
expanded definition of wildlife which includes all wild species 
of animals, plants and other organisms. Traditionally wildlife 
conservation has focused on particular species or species groups 
and has been limited to the higher orders of animals.
<P>
	It is now widely recognized that a broader approach to 
conservation is needed, an ecosystem approach that considers 
all ecosystem functions and values including all animal and 
plant species and a full range of their habitat requirements. 
Expanding the definition of wildlife is consistent with the 
recommendation of the wildlife policy for Canada which was 
endorsed by the Federal-Provincial Wildlife Ministers Council 
of Canada in 1990. It will allow for research and establishment 
of protected areas based on an ecosystem approach and will  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5247"> 5247 </A></B>
<P>
respond to the recommendations of the convention on biological 
diversity dealing with habit and ecosystem conservation.
<P>
	The second change introduced in Bill C-24 which affects a 
scope of protected areas is a provision allowing for the 
establishment of protected areas beyond the territorial sea to the 
200 nautical mile limit. Critical wildlife habitat, including areas 
with significant concentrations of sea birds and breeding and 
feeding grounds for whales, exists or extends beyond the 
territorial sea. Such areas include seasonal or permanent 
openings in the sea ice where birds, whales, polar bears and 
other wildlife concentrate; underwater mountains, upwellings 
of nutrients in the ocean and other areas associated with 
Canada's continental shelf.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Protecting these key areas contributes to sustaining the 
biodiversity and associated economic benefits of marine 
ecosystems, benefits such as improved recreational 
opportunities.
<P>
	As I have stated, the value of the Canada Wildlife Act is that it 
provides a basis for research, partnership and co-operation. The 
amendments included in Bill C-24 which I have just described 
present a new challenge to Canadians to be successful in 
understanding and protecting ecosystems and their biodiversity, 
including moving into the area of marine protected areas, which 
will require new and innovative partnerships involving a wider 
range of interest groups and stakeholders than has been the case 
in the past. Broad based strategies of a co-operative nature must 
be developed to ensure both environmental and economic 
objectives can be met.
<P>
	I am convinced that Bill C-24 will help in achieving these 
ends. I strongly encourage my fellow members in the House to 
support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Debate!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must 
tell you that I am delighted to speak on Bill C-24 immediately 
after my colleague from Thunder Bay-Atikokan because both 
of us have been sitting on the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development for several weeks 
now and he is one of the members of the committee who have 
made a very significant contribution to the committee by his 
attendance and his comments.
<P>
	In the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development, we reviewed at the same time as Bill C-23, Bill 
C-24 to amend the Canada Wildlife Act. This act was passed in 
1973. The purpose of this act was to enable the government to 
conduct wildlife research and in conjunction with the provinces, 
undertake various activities related to wildlife conservation and  
interpretation as well as the protection of wildlife habitat and 
endangered species.
<P>
	Apparently, only minor changes have been made to this act 
since its coming into force. As in the case of Bill C-23, we are 
simply proposing amendments to ensure the act keeps up with 
the times. That is why we, from the Bloc Quebecois, are jumping 
on the government band wagon and supporting these measures 
to protect our wildlife more effectively.
<P>
	One of the most important changes in my view is that, as soon 
as it comes into effect, the act will protect-and that is the 
important part-not only any animal other than a domestic 
animal, but also all living organisms, and that covers a lot.
<P>
	Living organisms include not only animals, birds and fish, but 
also those tiny unicellular microorganisms, you know, the kind 
that you cannot see with the naked eye but play a major role in 
the food chain.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	It covers plants like hay or clover, large trees like century-old 
oak trees as well as the tiny, delicate flower which lives but a 
short season. Bill C-24 will ensure that not only animals are 
protected but plants as well, so that all living organisms will be 
protected from now on.
<P>
	Twenty years ago, people probably did not see the need to 
protect animals and their habitats. But it is now crystal clear that 
it would be illogical to protect the white-headed eagle, for 
example, while destroying its environment. This new provision 
will allow us to promote sustainable development, as my 
colleague explained earlier.
<P>
	I would now like to explain the life cycle in very simple terms. 
Earth, the blue planet, is made up of two kinds of elements: 
living and non-living. Living elements include the sun, which is 
Earth's main source of energy. We find in the air non-living 
gases including CO2 or carbonic gas. The soil and the minerals it 
contains are other non-living elements. Finally, water is another 
non-living natural resource which is very abundant in Quebec 
and Canada.
<P>
	The sun, water, carbonic gas and the mineral salts found in the 
soil are four non-living elements which cost absolutely nothing. 
These four elements sustain living organisms, which grow, 
reproduce and die. These plants are called producers because 
they produce their own food. These producers are eaten by 
herbivores, which are in turn eaten by carnivores or omnivores. 
These carnivores and omnivores are in turn eaten by more 
powerful carnivores or omnivores. My colleague from 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, you and I are at the top of the food 
chain. We, of course, are at the top of the pyramid.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5248"> 5248 </A></B>
<P>
	From now on, Bill C-24 will protect all living organisms. 
Water, earth, light and air are set aside. Let us hope that these 
non-living elements will not be lacking in the future. It is all 
profit since plants, including the clover that grows, cost 
absolutely nothing.
<P>
	I would like to take a few seconds to give you an example of a 
food chain. Carbonic gas, water, minerals salts in the soil and 
the sun make clover grow. The clover is eaten by grasshoppers; 
the grasshoppers are eaten by a frog; the frog is eaten by a grass 
snake; the grass snake is eaten by a racoon. Now what animal 
could be eating the racoon? Perhaps a coyote or a wolf, and so on 
and so forth.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	You see, the higher you go up the food chain, the bigger and 
more powerful the animals are, but there are fewer of them, 
fortunately. Mr. Speaker, imagine if there were more coyotes or 
wolves than hares in a given territory or ecosystem. There would 
be a short-term imbalance, that is for sure.
<P>
	So I continue. Bill C-24 will also allow us to create national 
wildlife reserves by regulation in the area going beyond the 
territorial sea. At present, it is limited to the territorial sea, 
which only extends 12 nautical miles from our shores. With this 
bill, the limit would be extended to 200 nautical miles.
<P>
	This extends the area in which we can act, since the marine 
ecosystem and its biodiversity are now almost totally neglected, 
as far as protecting their habitat is concerned. According to 
Environment Canada experts, the potential of this area is huge. 
Just take the areas with high concentrations of marine birds and 
the places where whales reproduce and feed.
<P>
	Just as in the bill that we adopted a few minutes ago, Bill 
C-23, the minister could designate classes of persons as wildlife 
officers with this bill that we will probably pass, since the Bloc 
Quebecois will give its consent, of course. So I quote part of the 
bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister may designate any person or class of persons to act as wildlife 
officers for the purposes of this Act and the regulations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am pleased to note that in this bill, just as in Bill C-23, the 
designation of provincial officers is subject to the agreement of 
the provincial government concerned. Since this provision 
whereby the minister can designate wildlife officers is the 
counterpart of the one in Bill C-23, with respect to game 
officers, the answer obtained in committee as to whether the 
minister could appoint a hunting or fishing association, for 
example, as wildlife officers is still valid.
<P>
	I was told then that it could be done, but that such associations 
could have limited powers. Still rather sceptical about the 
benefits of this provision, I contacted the Quebec wildlife 
conservation officers' union. The president of the union, Paul 
Legault, told us about the situation in Quebec, since similar 
powers have already  been given by the Government of Quebec 
under the Wildlife Conservation Act.
<P>
	In 1978, when private clubs in Quebec were abolished, a 
decision was made to appoint wildlife conservation assistants to 
perform the duties of the wardens of the now defunct private 
clubs. Originally, these assistants were supposed to be the eyes 
and ears of the wildlife officers and had no title or function as 
such. Over the years, expectations increased, but nothing was 
done about improving the training and supervision of these 
people.
<P>
	The results are not encouraging. It seems these individuals 
were not very productive and often had a conflict of interest, 
since they had to enforce the regulations but were also earning a 
living as hunting and fishing guides.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Imagine, an outfitter who is your guide and at the same time 
acts as a wildlife officer. If you give him $200 or $300 a day and 
have nothing to show for it, I imagine you would fire him right 
away so he has to deliver or else he will lose his customers. This 
creates a very ambiguous situation.
<P>
	Incidentally, less than one violation report is filed per 
assistant annually. At this rate, some assistants do not file any 
reports at all. Some file one or two, and if some assistants file 
ten reports, there must be quite a few who do not file any at all. 
So the Government of Quebec is reviewing this system.
<P>
	There are also a number of shortcomings in the system itself, 
and I will name three: the selection process suffers as a result of 
criteria that are not strict enough; the training program is too 
short and is not adapted to the needs of the assistants; finally, 
there is no mechanism to follow up the work being done by the 
assistants.
<P>
	However, as in the case of game wardens, there are not enough 
wildlife officers to enforce the legislation. That being said, we 
might as well admit we have to appoint more staff to ensure 
compliance.
<P>
	According to the Bloc Quebecois, it would be useful to take 
certain steps to avoid a situation where wildlife officers do not 
have the required qualifications and thus lose their credibility. 
That is why we suggested the same amendments to the Standing 
Committee. As I explained earlier, and this happens regularly, 
our amendments were defeated. We will not vote against Bill 
C-24, but I think accepting our two amendments would have 
benefited the legislation.
<P>
	I will repeat them quickly. The purpose of the first 
amendment was to ensure that individuals designated by the 
minister have received appropriate training. This amendment is 
particularly relevant since the Quebec experience has shown 
this is an important part of the problem. The purpose of our 
second amendment was to make the designation of this category 
condi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5249"> 5249 </A></B>
<P>
tional on approval by the Standing Committee on Environment 
and Sustainable Development.
<P>
	Both amendments were defeated, but I remain firmly 
convinced of the importance of taking a closer look at this kind 
of appointments. According to Mr. Legault, the rather careless 
approach to appointing assistants has caused quite some friction 
with the public, because some individuals ``play the enforcer''. 
As I mentioned earlier, and I will repeat this for the benefit of 
hon. members opposite, when you appoint a whole hunting 
association as wildlife officers, there may be a couple of people 
in the group with more brawn than brains, who use their brawn in 
a way that may discredit all wildlife officers. That is what I 
meant by playing the enforcer.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	The request to get new partners involved is more and more 
pressing, but there must not be a shifting of responsibility onto 
citizens' shoulders. Nevertheless, it is essential to do something 
about the inadequate protection of wildlife, and I believe that 
Bill C-24 does meet that objective. Good will and good laws are 
not sufficient to adequately protect our environment. Those two 
elements alone are like having good tools but no carpenter to use 
them.
<P>
	In conclusion, education is the best solution and the best tool 
to protect wildlife, flora, habitats and ecosystems. The 
government must understand that, instead of 2,000 or 3,000 
wildlife officers, we need 27 million such officers in Canada. 
Indeed, every one of us should be a wildlife officer, and when we 
witness things which are damaging to our environment, we 
should have the courage to confront those who are responsible 
for such action.
<P>
	Of course, we run the risk of being insulted, but this is the 
price to pay if we want to do our share. In the long term, this 
would be a welcome investment in publicity, particularly when 
you think that every day the government and the Minister of 
Finance must make new cuts to lower our national deficit. Let us 
start in school by telling our young ones that they, and their 
children, will inherit what is there now. Let us educate them and, 
in two or three generations, the mentality will have completely 
changed. It will be centred on sustainable development and 
biodiversity.

``way furnish

<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to request support from the 
government and the Official Opposition for our proposed 
amendment to Bill C -11.
<P>
	We have received representation from both the Canadian 
Cancer Society and the Action Committee on Smoking and 
Health. They have expressed concerns about the increase in the 
use of smokeless tobacco among young people.
<P>
	Twenty-one per cent of grade seven students in Red Deer, 
Alberta, had tried smokeless tobacco and up to 11 per cent 
indicated they were currently using smokeless tobacco. It was 
also reported that the use of smokeless tobacco has more than 
doubled among males between the ages of 12 and 17 since 1987, 
more than doubled.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5250"> 5250 </A></B>
<P>
	The main concern was again the smaller packaging targeted to 
younger persons. Our amendment would amend clause 11 to 
restrict the sale and packaging of tobacco other than cigarettes 
in quantities of at least 20 grams. This would make small 
packages of smokeless tobacco illegal, just like kiddie packs.
<P>
	Smokeless tobacco includes oral moist snuff and chewing 
tobacco. Nicotine is released from the product and absorbed 
across the membranes of the mouth into the body. Long term use 
of spitting tobacco leads to significant damage to soft and hard 
tissues of the oral cavity. It causes leukopakia, white patches in 
the mouth, some of which are premalignant. Between 3 per cent 
and 6 per cent develop into cancer.
<P>
	Oral snuff has high levels of cancer causing nitrosamines with 
levels 10,000 times greater than allowed in regulated products 
such as beer, 10,000 times greater. Other cancer-causing agents 
are also present. Long term snuff users have a fifty-fold 
increase in cancer of the gums and mouth. Spitting tobacco is 
implicated in cancer of the larynx, esophagus, nasal cavity, 
pancreas, kidney and bladder. Gum disease occurs in 60 per cent 
of the users.
<P>
	According to a health and welfare report the more immediate 
effect of chewing tobacco and snuff is probably on the dental 
health of youth as smokeless tobacco may contain sweeteners 
such as sugar, honey, molasses, syrups and licorice.
<P>
	In addition to the statistics I have provided for Red Deer, 
Alberta, a 1991 Arkansas study found that 21 per cent of male 
kindergarten students were regular users. Among male 
school-age children in Ontario grades 7 to 13, 13 per cent 
reported using smokeless tobacco and cigarettes.
<P>
	The most disturbing finding was that many students felt the 
use of smokeless tobacco was not as addictive as cigarettes, that 
is what the students thought, and that using it was a good 
alternative to help quit smoking.
<P>
	In 1988 the World Health Organization issued an urgent call 
on the part of all governments with no history of smokeless 
tobacco use to ban the product before its use became 
widespread. It is not manufactured in Canada. We have to import 
these small little packs. I hope that the government and the 
opposition will support us on this.
<P>
	All the Reform Party is asking is that we take this one small 
step to ensure that we do not make smokeless tobacco products 
any easier for young people to obtain than a package of 
cigarettes. I sincerely hope the members and the government 
will support us in this amendment.
<P>
	I believe it is common sense to include this amendment in our 
legislation. That is why I propose it.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, everything that the hon. member just said 
is true. In fact, smokeless tobacco is extremely dangerous, and I 
applaud his amendment.
<P>
	However, it is inappropriate at this time for a few reasons. 
Eighty-five per cent of the tobacco sold is in the form of 
cigarettes in this country at the moment and, as he said, we do 
import all of our smokeless tobacco. Of the smokeless tobacco 
that we import, even of that small amount, only a very 
minuscule amount is in fact imported in sizes under 20 grams. 
What we have here is not a real marketplace problem. The act 
deals with banning the sale of tobacco to anyone under 18 
anyway, so no one should be selling any packages of anything to 
people under 18.
<P>
	However, we think it is inappropriate at this moment because 
there are some trade implications because all of our smokeless 
tobacco is imported and we need to analyze that. I would like us 
not to stall what is in fact an extraordinarily important bill right 
now in order to wait for that amendment to come through. You 
can always amend this at another time and it is quite acceptable 
to bring in an amendment later on. At this point while I applaud 
the amendment, I think it is inappropriate to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health 
responded a minute ago and said that this could be amended at 
any time, am I to assume that the government would support 
such an amendment at a future date?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. speaker, yes, I think we would like to look at 
some of the trade implications because of the fact that much of 
the smokeless tobacco is an import. We think it is an excellent 
amendment but inappropriate at this time.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-11, in Clause 11, be amended by adding after line 30, on page 6, the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(3) Sections 7.1 and 7.2 shall come into force six months after the day this Act 
is assented to.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the next few 
minutes to explain the thrust of the Bloc Quebecois' proposed 
amendment to Bill C-11.
<P>
	Let me begin by saying that the Bloc Quebecois supports this 
bill which is aimed, among other things, at amending the 
Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act to prohibit tobacco 
manufacturers from packaging cigarettes in packages 
containing fewer than 20 cigarettes.
<P>
	The provisions of Bill C-11 make it illegal to sell the 
packages containing 15 or 5 cigarettes which are currently on 
the market, or to sell single cigarettes. We support this bill 
because we care about people's health and in particular about the 
health of young people who are encouraged to smoke because of 
the availability of kiddie packs and single cigarettes.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Once again, my party believes that it is not enough to prevent 
young people from taking up smoking. A broad-based 
awareness campaign is needed to discourage young people from 
consuming products which are harmful to their health.
<P>
	Despite the best legislation or the most stringent regulations, 
we will always have to contend with unscrupulous retailers, just 
as I did in my youth, who encourage young people to start 
smoking by selling them single cigarettes. I started smoking 
when I was just 11 or 12 years old because of an unscrupulous 
store owner in the neighbourhood. He would hand out free 
cigarettes to young people to get them hooked, and after that he 
would charge them 10 cents, 15 cents and then 20 cents. There is 
a profiteer, there is an unscrupulous store owner. You all know 
cases like that. I have known a few myself in my time.
<P>
	We have nothing against the bill per se, but rather against the 
demand put on businesses, retailers, wholesalers and 
distributors to adapt quickly to the new provisions contained in 
Bill C-11 that provide that they take off the market almost 
overnight small size packs of cigarettes or tobacco. They stand 
to suffer substantial losses because of this, based on the 
representations made by The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Grocers, among others, which has testified before 
the finance committee to point out this deficiency while 
supporting government efforts to discourage smoking or 
tobacco use from an early age among young people. The 
Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers asked whether it 
would not be possible to defer the coming into force of that part 
of the regulations for a while.
<P>
	The intent of the motion the Bloc is tabling this evening is to 
give distributors, retailers, anyone who is holding stocks of 
packages containing fewer than 20 cigarettes time to clear their 
stocks without incurring excessive losses.
<P>
	As you know, since 1990, retailers as well as wholesalers and 
distributors have sustained substantial losses because of the 
recession. And say what we may, we are still experiencing a 
slack in the economy although some level of growth can be 
expected in a near future.
<P>
	I would call upon the leniency of the government and the 
Reform Party to pass such an amendment. Without adulterating 
or weakening in any way this bill, which we support, to 
discourage young people from starting to smoke early, our 
amendment nonetheless gives businesses a chance to adjust to 
the new context. Let us bear in mind also that we have been 
asking a lot from the tobacco industry and allied industries over 
the past seven or eight years in terms of adjustment.
<P>
	So, six short months to turn around would be welcome and 
that is the motion I am putting to you on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think that we can accept this 
amendment. Tobacco is the single most preventable cause of 
death and disease in the world today. There are 40,000 
Canadians a year who die as a result of tobacco smoking.
<P>
	It is a cost of $3 billion a year to the health care industry in 
this country and directly to the Canadian government. When this 
announcement was made that we would be banning kiddie 
packs, it was made by the Prime Minister in this House on 
February 8. That was a little over four months ago.
<P>
	That has been enough notice, we believe, for the 
manufacturers and for everyone who sells kiddie packs to take 
notice that we were going to do this. Second, kiddie packs are 
very accessible to young people. They like to buy them because 
they are attractive, because they cost less money and because 
they are easy to hide from parents and teachers.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	It is very important that we take steps now to prevent this very 
preventable cause of smoking among young people or this very 
preventable adjunct to smoking in young people.
<P>
	This is an addictive drug and I do not know how long we can 
continue to keep saying it is worthwhile keeping it up and 
allowing us to continue to propagate what in reality is a lethal 
and addictive drug. I think we have given enough time to the 
manufacturers and retailers to take this drug off the market.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5252"> 5252 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to concur with what the hon. member has just said 
and also to add a few remarks with regard to kiddie packs. The 
ban will be implemented.
<P>
	The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council denies that 
kiddie packs or 15s, as they are called, were designed for sale to 
young people. It said this recently in a written communication to 
the Minister of Health and again in its brief to the Standing 
Committee on Finance on June 7.
<P>
	It is very clear. The statistics provided to us show the largest 
percentage of sales of kiddie packs were to young people. While 
the tobacco manufacturers may not have designed the 15 packs 
for kids, the end result is that the kids end up using them.
<P>
	If the tobacco industry continues to make these kinds of 
claims that they are not designed for kids I think it brings into 
question its credibility and raises the whole issue of whether we 
can believe it on other issues as well.
<P>
	It claims that $2 million of existing packaging supplies for 
kiddie packs will be wasted, resulting in a $2 million write-off 
that will cost taxpayers about $1 million. It also believes that 
selling existing stock effective September 12 is quite unfair and 
will lead to further write-offs. I am sure this has already been 
addressed and so I will not continue on that.
<P>
	We have to balance the claims and the interests of the tobacco 
manufacturers, distributors and retailers with the interest of 
health of young people purchasing and smoking these kiddie 
packs. The Reform Party finds no difficulty in siding with the 
health of our young people.
<P>
	Rather than support the Bloc motion which supports the 
claims of the tobacco industry we would rather support the 
claims of the Canadian Cancer Society and the committee for 
action on smoking and health and move to stop the sale of kiddie 
packs to young people as soon as possible.
<P>
	If the tobacco industry claims that kiddie packs are designed 
to be sold to adults, we have an alternative proposal. Bundle 
them up in packs of two, put some cellophane or whatever 
around them, and sell them only to adults, which I think the law 
requires anyway, and we would no longer have kiddie packs. I 
think the solution is so simple the industry does not have to take 
this tremendous loss. We are saying simply sell them in packs of 
two and your problem is solved. I think it is very simple and only 
common sense.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YUKONFIRSTNATIONSLAND<BR>CLAIMSSETTLEMENTACT">YUKON FIRST NATIONS LAND<BR>
CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from June 9 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-33, an act to approve, give effect to and declare valid 
land claims agreements entered into between Her Majesty the 
Queen in right of Canada, the Government of the Yukon 
Territory and certain First Nations in the Yukon Territory, to 
provide for approving, giving effect to and declaring valid other 
land claims agreements entered into after this act comes into 
force, and to make consequential amendments to other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Crowfoot, to 
whom I might indicate he has five minutes left in debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be as brief 
as possible. I would like to cover three points in the time I have 
left.
<P>
	The intent of this bill is going in the right direction and we 
support the intent of this bill. There is not anyone in Canada who 
does not want to see the aboriginal people self-reliant and 
self-governing, but we believe this bill fails to bring us closer to 
that goal.
<P>
	The first item I will deal with is the power this bill will grant 
the new aboriginal communities to create citizenship. A 
question that has not been answered in the bill or during the 
debate is, if they have the power to create citizenship do they not 
have the power to extinguish citizenship? How will that work? If 
they have the power to determine who will be a citizen of their 
new country or nation, then do they not also have the right to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5253"> 5253 </A></B>
<P>
extinguish citizenship? If it comes to that, how will that work? 
What kinds of problems will that create?
<P>
	We have to look at their system of government that will be set 
up. What will that system of government be? Nothing in the bill 
indicates whether there will be an appeal process within their 
government. For people who believe they need to question a 
decision of their leaders, will there be an opportunity for them to 
do so through an appeal system? That question ought to be 
clarified in this bill so that members in this House and people 
across this country who support this bill will be satisfied that we 
are going to grant rights to these people equal to what we enjoy 
as Canadian citizens.
<P>
	My second point has been touched upon a number of times. If 
this bill is going to be successful and acceptable, it must have 
the answer to the extinguishment of the dependency the 
aboriginal people have upon the taxpayers and the Government 
of Canada. There is no indication that there is any light at the end 
of the tunnel within this agreement. Contrary to that, it is very 
clear these new aboriginal nations will be able to continue to 
look to the federal government for funding. There is no 
indication this dependency will stop.
<P>
	My last point is the one of equality of citizenship. Certainly 
the members of these new nations, the aboriginal people, will 
continue to remain citizens of Canada. This bill has created 
special rights and privileges in law based upon race and ethnic 
origin. While the rest of the world, including South Africa, is 
bringing barriers down between races and ethnic groups, we are 
in the process of erecting them. We saw this same kind of 
problem emerge within the Meech Lake accord and the 
Charlottetown accord and we are seeing it again in this umbrella 
agreement.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	People are being granted special rights and privileges based 
upon race and ethnic origin. These rights and privileges are 
being paid for by the Canadian taxpayers, even though they do 
not know it, thanks to the speed at which this bill has emerged, 
been debated and, I venture to guess, will pass all stages of 
reading.
<P>
	This formula of special rights cannot succeed in a 
multicultural society such as Canada. We must ensure that all 
Canadians stand equal before the law, regardless of race, 
language, culture or religion. This bill violates that principle. 
This may be the greatest failing of the Yukon First Nations 
agreement. It grants special rights based upon race and ethnic 
origin and destroys the principle of equality of citizenship in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it 
difficult to speak to Bill C-33 without some reference at least to 
Bill C-34, since both bills have been tabled simultaneously and 
will be dealt with simultaneously in committee.
<P>
	Generally my concerns with the land claim settlement portion 
of the two bills are the same as my concerns were with Bill 
C-16, the Mackenzie Valley land claim agreement. The very 
process the government has chosen to deal with these land claim 
settlements is most objectionable, to put it simply.
<P>
	Considering the importance of these bills, their 
unprecedented nature, their open endedness, their implications 
for the fundamental constitutional rights of all Canadians, and 
the breakneck speed with which these bills are being rushed 
through is nothing less than an abuse of the parliamentary 
process. It is a reckless invitation for legal and social disaster.
<P>
	Much of the confusion I feel and express is testimony to the 
inadequate time we have been given to deal with this immensely 
difficult and huge legislative package. There is much in this 
package that we could agree with. The fact that we can only deal 
with the bill itself and not the agreement as was the case with 
Bill C-16 makes it difficult to impossible for our party as well as 
other interest groups and individuals to discharge their 
responsibility and rights to comment on, criticize or improve the 
bill.
<P>
	In view of these concerns, I have to ask why these bills are 
being pushed through with such haste. The process thus far has 
taken 23 years. Why does the government want to pass them 
through Parliament without proper scrutiny? Could it be that 
given time to analyze and examine these bills, an effective 
public opposition to the content of these bills might come 
forward? Could it be that there really is not the overwhelming 
support for these bills, so we must rush them through without 
public awareness or examination?
<P>
	I must also ask, after negotiating for 23 years, why now, when 
only four final agreements exist, are we being asked to abrogate 
our responsibilities as an opposition party to examine the other 
10 final agreements? Why did the government not finish the 
negotiating process, instead of asking us to approve and pass 
these agreements that do not now exist? That is the same process 
which led to the failure of the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	The provision of the compensation package also raises some 
concerns for me. When I enquired of the departmental officials 
during our briefing what we were compensating for, I was told 
that it really was not compensation and perhaps compensation 
was a poor choice of words. That was the same answer to the 
same question I received on Bill C-16.
<P>
	There seems to me to be a very fundamental disagreement 
between the aboriginal people and the Government of Canada 
over where we are starting from and where we are going to. Are 
we beginning a process to now buy or rent Canadian territory 
from the aboriginal people, or does the crown in fact, hold title 
to the Canadian land and we are only providing an amount of 
money to help with economic development? The answer  to this 
question is vital to the future land claim settlements south of 60.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5254"> 5254 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	The entrenchment of these agreements as modern day treaties 
in the constitution should also be of concern to all Canadians. 
There appears to be some difference of legal opinion as to what 
this means, but it could mean that these rights gained through 
these agreements are not amendable except by constitutional 
amendments.
<P>
	This would mean that these rights are beyond the reach of 
future parliamentary amendments. This would give precedence 
to the obligation of Canadian taxpayers to these agreements over 
the obligation to provide to all Canadians health care, old age 
security, or other social security which are provided by simple 
acts of Parliament. I believe therefore these provisions to be an 
arrogant and tragic mistake to lock in forever the government 
policy regardless of what fiscal conditions might exist in this 
country in the future.
<P>
	The creation of 16 separate governments with 15 separate 
territories each with separate laws, regulations, and 
bureaucratic boards will create a bureaucratic nightmare for 
anyone wanting to do business in Yukon, not to mention the cost 
of all the new bureaucracies and government institutions.
<P>
	In conclusion, my feeling about this land claim agreement is 
the same as I stated in debate on Bill C-16. I believe and I am 
supported by Supreme Court precedents that the crown holds 
title to all Canadian territory outside privately held titled land.
<P>
	I do support the provision of deeded land, the provision for 
economic self-sufficiency in the form of a cash payment and 
resource sharing. I also support the right of aboriginal peoples to 
use the resources of their traditional territory for subsistence.
<P>
	I do not support the never ending dependence of these 
aboriginal people on the taxpayers of Canada. I believe having 
been provided the above-mentioned benefits the financial 
responsibility of the taxpayers must end. These people can once 
again become proud self-sufficient Canadians with the same 
economic and social benefits as all other Canadians, not 
disillusioned, discouraged, dependent people trapped in a 
segregated ethnic homeland dictated to by a dominating 
paternalistic federal government.

CLAIM SETTLEMENT ACT</A></H3>
	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-16, an act 
to approve, give effect to and declare valid an agreement 
between Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and the Dene 
of Colville Lake, Déline, Fort Good Hope and Fort Norman and 
the Metis of Fort Good Hope, Fort Norman and Norman Wells, 
as represented by the Sahtu Tribal Council, and to make related 
amendments to another act, as reported (without amendment) 
from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development)</B> moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with mixed feelings that I rise today to speak to Bill C-16. 
Certainly there are some positive developments in the bill. 
Negotiations toward aboriginal self-government for instance 
have been a long time in coming. Although the Reform Party 
does not adhere to the concept of inherent self-government we 
support self-government negotiations on a voluntary basis 
where neither party is coerced to come to the table. To my 
knowledge this is a voluntary agreement and that part of it is 
good.
<P>
	Our caucus is also pleased that the agreement has been put 
before Parliament in the form of a bill so at least we get a chance 
to discuss this particular agreement before Canadians and in 
public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5255"> 5255 </A></B>
<P>
	The presentation of this bill sets a precedent. Members on this 
side of the House fully expect that every negotiated settlement 
in the future will also come under the scrutiny of Parliament. We 
only regret that the last bill, the one approving the Nunavut 
agreement, received such a cursory examination by the House.
<P>
	My remarks therefore will be confined to the understanding 
that when agreements move aboriginals toward more 
self-reliance they are positive agreements. In concept the land 
claims settlement we are talking about tonight, a historic 
reconciliation between the Sahtu Dene and Metis people and the 
federal government could be and has the framework of a good 
deal.
<P>
	The Reform Party has long been on the record as wanting to 
settle outstanding land claims issues. However, since this is the 
first such agreement to come before this current Parliament and 
the Reform Party of Canada, it must come under more careful 
scrutiny than might otherwise be the case because it sets yet 
another precedent that other groups will surely point to in the 
future.
<P>
	Reformers must do their utmost to lay down principles that 
will guide lawmakers in this and future agreements because for 
all its good points there are many deficiencies both in the 
process of negotiation and in the bill itself that must be 
corrected before it can become law.
<P>
	Unfortunately the media and our intellectual establishment 
have done the country a disservice by pressuring the government 
to make sweeping agreements without regard to such minor 
details as cost, political process, definition of self-government 
or the wishes of non-aboriginal Canadians. It has been left to the 
Reform Party of Canada to ask searching questions on this 
subject and we are prepared to do just that.
<P>
	Reformers feel that barriers to free thought on a number of 
issues like this have been erected in the country. The political 
forces that have run government for the last 15 or 20 years have 
consistently confused reason and reasonable criticism with 
radical thought.
<P>
	For the media and our academics to do so much as question 
some topics is to reveal some sort of subversive, dangerous 
tendency. This is a sad commentary on the state of intellectual 
life in this country. The one who questions First Nations' policy 
in the minds of the media is quickly hounded to the wall as a 
racist and a bigot.
<P>
	This notion of the politically correct can occur in any country 
and it becomes an oppressive straitjacket that is truly dangerous 
to public policy.
<P>
	Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn tells an interesting story in his great 
work <I>The Gulag Achipelago</I> in which a large number of people 
gathered to hear a government official make a speech. In those 
days it was customary to applaud a political speech after it was 
done by clapping your hands over your head.
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
	After the speech the crowd began thunderous applause but no 
one dared stop or even slow down because secret agents were 
watching and the one who stopped clapping first might be seen 
as disloyal. The room was crowded and hot. Everyone was 
standing. There were no chairs and the clapping went on and on 
and on.
<P>
	Finally, after a few minutes, an old man fainted in the crowd 
and then a brave fellow standing on the platform, tired of all the 
foolishness, abruptly stopped clapping and sat down. Of course 
the rest of the room immediately fell silent as well.
<P>
	This somewhat comical example is sobered by the fact that 
the man on the platform who stopped clapping was later done 
away with by the communists.
<P>
	In a very small way this situation finds a parallel in our 
country today. The leaders of our country, the academics and 
special interest groups, have all made the same speech. That 
speech has been reiterated over and over again by them and then 
taken up in turn by the media. Then the politicians, willing to do 
just about anything to gain political victory, begin to include 
these thoughts in their speeches until all of them are clapping in 
unison.
<P>
	The fact that a particular policy may not really be in the best 
long term interest of the country is no longer addressed. 
Everyone is clapping. It would be a sign of disloyalty for the 
speech to somehow quit. The first one to do so much as stop this 
enthusiastic clapping might lose his career or his money or his 
power or prestige or face or tenure or something.
<P>
	What does it take to correct this situation? It takes someone 
on the platform with a little bit of spine and backbone to get tired 
of this foolishness and stop clapping.
<P>
	I am relieved to say that there is someone on Canada's 
national platform today and that is the Reform Party of Canada. 
It has the spine and the backbone it takes to stop this foolish 
applause so that Canadians can hear finally the public interest.
<P>
	Just like the Solzhenitsyn story where the room fell 
immediately silent when one leader stopped clapping, perhaps 
now for the first time intelligent, rational discussion can take 
place on these so-called delicate issues.
<P>
	Although everyone was afraid to question government policy 
on these politically correct issues, as soon as someone stood up 
tall and proud and said in front of the whole nation: ``I'm no 
longer willing to agree to a policy that is not in the public 
interest, a policy that people don't really want'', finally we are 
getting down to the crux of some of these important issues that 
have never been discussed in Parliament before. What we have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5256"> 5256 </A></B>
<P>
done already to break this stranglehold of intellectual faddism is 
a credit to our party and a great service to our country.
<P>
	The first question with regard to Bill C-16 that must be asked 
and answered is the question of fairness. The seeds for this 
question were planted by our forefathers who negotiated treaties 
with different Indian bands in the last century. They did it 
piecemeal and so different bands negotiated different 
agreements. Today the government is doing exactly the same 
thing, sowing new seeds that may produce the fruits of division 
and jealousy in the future.
<P>
	This problem was recently addressed by the national chief of 
the Assembly of First Nations, Ovide Mercredi, when he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each First Nation in Canada that has a treaty must benefit equally from the 
Liberal promises. There cannot be a selective approach by government as to what 
region or what First Nation will be able to move ahead on treaties or 
self-government or education.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Just a few weeks ago the <I>Star-Phoenix</I> quoted Mr. Mercredi 
as saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The inherent right of our people is not a pilot project. It cannot be implemented 
as a model in one province or one region for all First Nations to copy-he said 
chiefs throughout the country must accept self-government as a national policy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Non-natives want to be fair to all aboriginals in Canada, but if 
the government cannot be as generous to the Sto:lo Nation in my 
riding as it is to the Sahtu under this agreement, what will stop 
groups from returning to the table in 20 years and saying: ``We 
still have an historic grievance. We were shortchanged in the 
negotiations. Look what the Sahtu received in 1994. Now we 
want a fair deal''.
<P>
	How do we know that Bill C-16 is a fair settlement? Is this a 
national standard, a benchmark by which we judge all other 
agreements?
<P>
	When we bring all these agreements together, and a couple of 
the others have been discussed in Parliament tonight, and we 
find out their total cost, we must ask the Canadian people 
somewhere along the line if they are willing to pay this much to 
establish this land claim settlement and self-government.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Athabasca mentioned earlier, this bill 
should be put on hold until national negotiations have been 
completed and Canadians properly consulted. There is no rush. 
It is a mistake to rush ahead with this. Otherwise we will be 
renegotiating many of these deals well into the next century. By 
that time standards will have changed completely. This type of 
negotiation is irresponsible and the government is setting the 
stage for continuing conflict over land claims and 
self-government for decades to come.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	The next problem with the bill flows logically from the first 
and that is the huge cost of this agreement. One thousand, seven 
hundred and fifty-five people will benefit from this agreement. 
Each adult will receive 285 square kilometres of land. Over 42 
square kilometres of land will be given in fee simple to each 
member. I should  probably repeat that, 42 square kilometres for 
each person.
<P>
	For instance the land that is in the province of Ontario belongs 
to all Canadians, but under the Sahtu agreement 74,000 square 
kilometres of land will be owned by individual natives and they 
will control four times that much.
<P>
	Do Canadians realize how big this settlement is? Two hundred 
and eighty thousand square kilometres of Canadian land, that is 
one-third the size of my province, British Columbia, will be 
removed permanently from the public domain. Together with 
the last three agreements, including the ones I mentioned 
earlier, soon there will be very little public land north of the 60th 
parallel.
<P>
	No legal precedent equates aboriginal title with land 
ownership. The courts have always categorically rejected that 
idea. Where does it come from then? It stems from the Liberal 
Party of Canada, the party that has for the last 20 years nurtured 
interest groups and catered to their every whim. The Liberal 
government always gives first place to its political children and 
second place, I believe, to the people of Canada. This latest 
massive giveaway is a political present wrapped up in the 
backrooms of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	There is more. There is also a cash component of this 
agreement. One hundred and thirty million dollars will be paid 
out to just 1,700 people over 15 years which works out to 
$100,000 each, plus a percentage of resource royalties, plus 
fishing and hunting rights, plus a new complicated bureaucracy 
paid for by the taxpayers, plus the benefit of programs already 
available to natives elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	You or I might think this would be satisfactory, Mr. Speaker, 
but not at all. Canadians who hope that this agreement at last 
defines what self-government really means will be bitterly 
disappointed. This agreement is not a self-government 
agreement. It is simply a land claims agreement. 
Self-government has yet to be negotiated. No doubt it will 
confer many more benefits on the Sahtu, Dene and Metis. This is 
not the end of the process. It is just the beginning.
<P>
	I want to address another problem with this agreement. Many 
of the aboriginal people in Canada are concerned about this 
headlong rush into self-government and land claim settlements. 
During the Charlottetown accord debate aboriginal women's 
groups urged the rejection of that agreement on the grounds that 
they had not been included in the negotiations and that they were 
not secure in approving an agreement that could take away the 
protection, privileges and freedoms they now enjoy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5257"> 5257 </A></B>
<P>
	In my own constituency of Fraser Valley East many of the 
grassroots aboriginals who try to live with these agreements 
negotiated behind closed doors, things like the aboriginal 
fishing strategy or the make-up of local government structures, 
find themselves frustrated by decisions and a process that leaves 
the power in the hands of a very powerful few in these 
government structures.
<P>
	Obviously the demands for honest leadership, fiscal 
accountability and democratic principles transcend cultural 
boundaries. Canadians of all backgrounds want an open 
government and an open process.
<P>
	I have been approached by two different aboriginal leaders 
from my home town about this matter. There are 20 some bands 
in my constituency. Some of them doubt whether the concept for 
self-government is something whose time has come. Allow me 
to quote from a letter I received from a native official who is 
currently active in leadership. He says: ``The bands in my area 
cannot agree on the manner in which lands should be held or how 
control should be structured. The Chilliwack Area Indian 
Council and Sto:Lo Nation Group do not seem to be able to agree 
on the simplest matters. As far as funding is concerned 
everything is chaotic. There are many instances of funding 
abuses''.
<P>
	He goes on to cite instances of mismanagement of 
government funds, including federal money designated to create 
new positions used instead by the bands to increase existing 
salaries. The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development has been notified of this problem.
<P>
	If the bands demonstrate this type of behaviour now, it is no 
wonder that they are questioning whether this behind closed 
doors process is the proper process that will give them the type 
of leadership and the type of control that they are hoping for in 
the future. We need to take a close look at current band 
management before we entrust these sorts of things to 
legislative power equal to that of the provinces. Will the 
majority of aboriginals benefit at the hands of their own 
governments?
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	Let me cite one more example that has been brought before 
me, a personal experience. The aboriginal fishing strategy is an 
agreement granting unprecedented authority to natives to catch 
and sell salmon from B.C.'s Fraser River. The management 
regime over this resource is controlled by natives but native 
officials have approached me with allegations of surprising 
proportions, the latest one being that a proper audit has not been 
submitted on time, at the end of May as required in the original 
agreement, causing further doubt as to whether these funds have 
been used and allocated properly.
<P>
	The department again is aware of all these problems and doing 
nothing about it. One native leader wrote to me and said: ``It is 
disappointing to realize our Indian government prefers to 
impose authority on its membership rather than to be guided by 
it''. The same  man told me personally that in their case, in their 
band, they are not ready for self-government.
<P>
	A century and a half ago Canadians ruled by the British were 
champing at the bit to have a little more say over their own lives. 
Responsible government was finally granted by Britain but it 
was a long time in coming. It was only given after Canadian 
political leaders had demonstrated through action that they were 
ready for it. Budget by budget, decision by decision, crisis by 
crisis, the leadership of the colony built up a store of experience 
and dedication that showed they could be trusted to act in the 
public interest.
<P>
	Should there not be a companion requirement for aboriginal 
leaders? Is it not wise to require many small demonstrations of 
responsibility, sound management, compassion and 
trustworthiness so that we can ensure natives will act in the 
interest of other natives in all of Canada? Power and money 
alone cannot solve the problems of our aboriginal people. In fact 
they may only make them worse.
<P>
	Many aboriginal people want and need assurances that any 
new agreements move them toward a better, more responsive 
and responsible form of government. No one has the inherent 
right to govern; the privilege of governance must be earned.
<P>
	I want to draw on for a moment the process of this agreement. 
The Meech Lake fiasco provoked a general outcry about 
constitutional processes in Canada. No more were there to be 
negotiations behind closed doors. Canadians from all walks of 
life, except those in the old line parties, were quick to issue their 
angry denunciations. The group which felt the most betrayed, 
the ones who uttered the most embittered and angry 
denunciations, was none other than aboriginal people 
themselves. They condemned the deal and the deal makers alike.
<P>
	Have the Liberals learned from the Meech Lake and 
Charlottetown agreements? Not at all. Now that the Sahtu have a 
125-page agreement, every word of which will be entrenched in 
our own Constitution, what do we hear? A deafening silence. 
When 200 Canadian municipalities want input into the process 
they have to write a letter. Listen to a quote from their brief: 
``Municipalities have felt excluded from a process that has so 
far involved only aboriginal leaders and federal and provincial 
governments''.
<P>
	Even the provinces are in the dark. Even though negotiations 
for instance with the Manitoba chiefs are ongoing right now to 
dismantle Indian affairs in that province, the Toronto <I>Star</I> 
quoted the premier of Manitoba as ``having absolutely no 
information on which to build a provincial government policy''. 
Where is the openness of the process? Where are the promises of 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5258"> 5258 </A></B>
<P>
the Liberals about candour and public trust? Let me quote from 
page 91 of the vaunted Liberal red book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The people are irritated with governments that do not consult them, or that 
disregard their views, or that try to conduct key parts of public business behind 
closed doors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Liberals criticized the Conservatives about their lack of 
openness but it is all just politics. They are the pot calling the 
kettle black. Mr. Speaker, could you or I listen to the 
dismantling negotiations in Manitoba? Will they be public? 
Could you appear before the negotiators to make a presentation? 
Not on your life.
<P>
	I asked the minister a number of important questions about 
the Manitoba process. I wrote to him on April 5 asking how I 
might have input. I received a statement in return that ignored 
the questions I asked, although it did reveal that the government 
had given $400,000 to the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs to help 
them make their case against the Canadian people.
<P>
	This process is worse than Meech Lake. It is shut tight. 
Ordinary Canadians are totally excluded. Not even the media 
has access to them. The Sahtu package is presented before 
Parliament today as a fait accompli without the benefit of public 
discussion beforehand. The Liberal government will use its 
majority to ram it through the House, putting its trust in the 
continuing silence of the silent majority.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	While aboriginals, the media and the academic community 
exploded in anger over Meech Lake, they are all curiously silent 
today. Who speaks for ordinary Canadians who have to pay for 
this deal? They are the ones excluded from the process 
established over a decade of constitutional struggle, a process 
promised in the red book, a process ignored by the Liberals 
today.
<P>
	It makes a travesty of red book promises. It makes a mockery 
of the constitutional process. It treats the people of Canada and 
members of Parliament like children who cannot eat at the table 
with the big folks. They have to sit at the card table in 
Parliament and eat the leftovers thrown to them by the 
negotiators. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	There are principles of fairness and equality that every 
agreement should contain, principles that should be acceptable 
to the Canadian people. They would be. Let me enumerate them. 
The first is an open, national negotiating process.
<P>
	The second is definitive reasonable costs acceptable to 
non-aboriginal people throughout the country.
<P>
	The third is to ensure the supremacy of Parliament by 
agreeing that the charter will apply to every person in Canada. It 
disturbs me greatly to read in the May 12 edition of the <I>Gazette</I> 
that Canada's criminal law and the charter will not necessarily 
apply to aboriginal people. ``That is something that remains to 
be determined'', the Minister of Justice says. All Canadians, 
native and non-native, must be equal under the law.
<P>
	The fourth principle is that the text of these agreements must 
not be entrenched in the Constitution. Its complex details are too 
difficult to change and the process for changing them is not 
specified in the Constitution. Details need to be legitimized by 
practice over a long period of time before, if ever, they are 
entrenched.
<P>
	Fifth, every agreement must contain the extinguishment of 
aboriginal title. We want to know if the demands on Canada will 
be finished by signing any one agreement. I want to add that the 
Sahtu agreement does contain this necessary element. I am 
pleased about that one part of it. Every agreement should require 
aboriginals to be subject to some form of federal taxation. Every 
agreement should reduce native dependency on government, 
and finally no agreement should create parallel bureaucracies. 
The creation of one bureaucracy must be accompanied by the 
dissolution of another.
<P>
	To sum up, I am worried today that our government is 
recklessly making revolutionary changes in public land, public 
authority and public institutions without public input. It is doing 
so in the interests of a very few.
<P>
	So that I am not misunderstood, allow me to repeat my 
conviction once again. I do not oppose self-government. I do 
not oppose an agreement with the Sahtu Dene and Metis people, 
but I strenuously oppose the deal making process. On behalf of 
all Canadians I oppose the overly generous terms of the 
agreement.
<P>
	The minister needs to take the process back to the people and 
his legislation back to the drawingboard.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, after 
listening carefully to my colleague, particularly to his 
introduction and the early portion of his remarks, I must admit 
that I would like to say something on the subject of loyalty. It is 
my impression that I am being disloyal strictly to the Reform 
Party this evening because, in fact, I think that the government 
agrees with Bill C-16. We have already made it known that we 
support the bill as it now stands.
<P>
	I also tend to want to react to this type of argument; although I 
respect it, I do not agree with it at all. I do not think the Bloc 
Quebecois has been termed left-wing intellectuals in Canada or 
in Quebec. Nor do I believe that we are disloyal to anyone in 
saying that we share the views expressed in Bill C-16.
<P>
	I will go over some of the points I raised previously during the 
second reading of the bill-fairly quickly, because we are in the 
final stage before passage. During second reading, I said that 
one of the premises for this type of agreement, land claims, is 
the importance of having confidence in both parties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5259"> 5259 </A></B>
<P>
	Concerning the Dene, the Metis and the Sahtu Tribal Council, 
we fully agree that these people were representative, and they 
can rest assured that we have complete confidence in their 
negotiations and the outcome of those negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the agreement per se, Sahtu means ``great 
bear'' and naturally, reference is made to Great Bear Lake in the 
Northwest Territories. This vast territory is steeped in history, 
much of which has to do with oil. As you will see, the financial 
agreement which has been finalized is based on the price of oil, 
particularly at Norman Wells.
<P>
	There are five major communities within the territory covered 
by the agreement. Colville Lake is home to a tribe of Slavey 
Dene. The community was founded in 1962 on ancestral lands. 
Colville Lake is the only community in the Northwest 
Territories where all buildings are constructed entirely of logs. I 
believe this is worth mentioning because these are features of 
the landscape and communities covered by the agreement. 
Colville Lake is a very rustic and very beautiful village, and I 
felt that this was important to mention.
<P>
	Déline was formerly known as Fort Franklin. In 1825, Sir 
John Franklin made this community his winter headquarters. 
When oil was discovered in Norman Wells during the 1920s, 
Fort Franklin became a major trading post owing to its close 
proximity to transportation routes.
<P>
	Fort Norman has long been important to the Dene because of 
the excellent sites for placing traps. Trapping is a seasonal 
activity which is an important part of the traditional Dene 
economy.
<P>
	Fort Good Hope is the oldest trading post in the lower 
Mackenzie Valley; although it is within the territory of the 
northern Slave Dene, the Vuntut Gwich'in, as they are called, 
the mountain people and Inuit of the Mackenzie Delta used to go 
there regularly. But in Norman Wells, I think it is 
known-besides, we will soon have Bill C-25, which will allow 
more wells to be dug in Norman Wells and extracting oil from 
existing wells using a new method such as water under pressure, 
so that a well can produce in a much more healthy environment.
<P>
	Norman Wells is important in the discussion and I will come 
back to it soon. We shall see that the financial agreement is 
based on the oil resources at Norman Wells, among other things.
<P>
	The agreement before us was signed in 1993 at Fort Norman 
and the Act will simply implement that agreement. It also has 
constitutional protection. Some people think that is awful but 
we do not think so. It is simply one of the new treaties covered 
by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	My colleague raised a very important point about how 
representative the process leading to the signing of that 
agreement was. I think that the figures I will give will  reassure 
us on that point. More than 90 per cent of eligible voters 
participated because that agreement was put to a vote and 90 per 
cent of the people on a territory of 28,000 square kilometres 
went out and voted.
<P>
	This goes to show how important this agreement is to them 
and, in my view, we cannot doubt the representativeness of the 
people who have signed the agreement, not only because of this 
90 per cent participation rate but also because 85 per cent of the 
Dene and 99 per cent of the Metis are in favour of this 
agreement. It think it is important to point out that in terms of 
representativeness, a 90 per cent participation rate leaves no 
doubt about the representativeness of the signatories; they were 
backed by a democratic vote of the people they represented.
<P>
	Turning to the development of this agreement at the political 
level, it arises from land claims but does not put 
self-government in issue. In fact, these are two entirely 
different matters. A list of agreed subjects negotiators will have 
to look into again, self-government being one of them, has been 
appended to the agreement.
<P>
	For now, it must be understood that this is simply a bill which 
approves a land claim agreement.
<P>
	I will move along quickly because I mentioned many of these 
facts at second reading. The Dene and the Metis receive title to 
41,437 square kilometres of land, 1,813 square kilometres of 
which include mining and mineral rights. This is entirely 
consistent with the European economic tradition of the day: the 
subsoil teeming with precious metals and black gold, 
representing a considerable amount of wealth in the territory as 
such.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	Now about the settlement. The agreement does call for 
compensation of $75 million over 15 years.
<P>
	This settlement is based on the value of oil taken out of the 
ground at Norman Wells. Statistics indicated that approximately 
$75 million was extracted from the ground each year and shared 
by Esso and the Government of Canada, which are partners in 
the Norman Wells venture.
<P>
	This agreement is based on this $75 million. It simply 
acknowledges that it costs $75 million annually, that they 
incurred a loss of income of $75 million annually, and it is being 
conceded to them for a period of 15 years. The famous issue of 
economic development is also considered. Economic 
development is vital, in my opinion, for the aboriginal nations of 
this country and, in particular, the Dene and the Metis; the 
economic development that this $75 million will bring is 
certainly not negligible.
<P>
	It will be up to them to combine economic development and 
development of their traditional resources. Based on what I have 
seen in the agreement, they will surely succeed. This is a 
successful example of economic development, and I think 
congratulations are in order. I also want to draw an analogy with 
the Cree  and Naskapi in Quebec. As you know, the James Bay 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5260"> 5260 </A></B>
<P>
agreement also provided certain amounts of money to be 
administered by a company headed by the Cree. I want to say 
that what is happening with the Dene and the Metis is not a 
precedent and that a precedent was definitely set in Quebec in 
the eighties with the Cree and the Naskapi.
<P>
	The agreement contains provisions on wildlife. As you know, 
wildlife management is part of their tradition. They have an 
inborn respect for the environment, so to them it is important to 
preserve, both in the agreement and in this bill, this particular 
aspect of their tradition, which includes hunting, trapping and 
fishing rights. These are all included in the agreement and 
reflect the traditional culture and the traditional hunting 
grounds of the Dene and the Metis.
<P>
	I would like to add that a number of interest groups were 
consulted, not only the Dene and the Metis. These included the 
Northwest Territories Chamber of Mines, which approved this 
bill, the Mining Association of Canada, the Canadian 
Association of Petroleum Producers, the Northwest Territories 
Wildlife Federation, the Mount Mackenzie Outfitters and the 
Lynn Graham Trail Association.
<P>
	As far as outfitters are concerned, this is an interesting aspect 
of the agreement. There are people already involved in trapping 
and hunting activities in the territory who are not necessarily 
Dene or Metis. What is interesting in the agreement is that these 
people will be able to continue those activities. This is further 
evidence of the philosophy of aboriginal people when the 
Europeans arrived. To them, the land was something to be 
shared. The Dene and the Metis, like all other aboriginal 
peoples, have always agreed to share their land. What happened 
is that the Europeans got a lot of money out of their land and 
restricted them to reserves and certain territories.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	This agreement enables them to throw off at least partially the 
yoke of the Indian Act because this will be in fact the first step 
we will allow them to take toward financial autonomy and it is 
something we should consider for a few minutes.
<P>
	This financial autonomy is important to them because we 
know that, in fact, the Indian Act maintains all Native nations 
under trusteeship, where all decisions are made for them. The 
statement that we are witnessing the birth of a new bureaucracy 
must be toned down a bit.
<P>
	I think that the time has come for us, the people of Quebec and 
Canada, to end this trusteeship and allow these people to take 
control of their own destiny. Given the financial agreement 
before us and their eventual right to design and prepare special 
programs for the regions and, at the end of the day, to administer 
themselves, I do not think we are witnessing the birth of a new 
bureaucracy.
<P>
	We are simply giving them the power to take control of their 
own future. Ottawa will no longer decide what programs are 
good for them. They will decide for themselves what programs 
they want. I think that, in this regard, the negotiators' efforts 
were commendable. I see that, according to the agreement 
provisions that are, of course, linked to the bill, this bureaucracy 
or pseudo-bureaucracy will enable them to really administer 
their lands with their own programs while respecting their 
culture and promoting a new economic development.
<P>
	Finally, I must salute them. These people venerate their elders 
and often think in terms of the next seven generations. I am sure 
that seven generations ago, native people were in possession of 
their territory, but the situation changed drastically with the 
arrival of Europeans. These people have always wanted to 
regain control of what had been theirs as first occupants, and I 
think that, in these negotiations, they had future generations in 
mind.
<P>
	In fact, negotiators and representatives from the territory in 
question came to my office and told me that their elders had 
always persevered, and that they were very pleased to have the 
support of the Bloc Quebecois. Consequently, I am pleased to 
say once again that our party will fully support Bill C-16 in third 
reading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is again a pleasure to rise in debate on Bill C-16, the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis land claim agreement, this time in third 
reading.
<P>
	The terms, provisions and conditions have been well 
canvassed on this side of the House and unfortunately our 
concerns with Bill C-16 still apply. Our pleas, both in the House 
and in committee, have fallen on deaf ears.
<P>
	I want today only to make a few points beginning with a point 
which is general in nature but strikes at the very heart of my 
party's concern with federal land claims policy. The 
government's policy is based on a false assumption. In March 
1993 a document was published by the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development entitled ``Federal Policy for 
the Settlement of Native Land Claims''. Within that publication 
there is a glowing observation which states the evolution and 
development of the federal government's land claim policy has 
been closely linked to court decisions.
<P>
	The first claims policy statement in 1973 was initiated by a 
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the 1973 Calder 
decision which acknowledges the existence of aboriginal title in 
Canadian law.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5261"> 5261 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2010 ) </B>
<P>
	Further in the document: ``The common law concept of 
aboriginal rights was addressed in the 1973 decision of the 
Supreme Court of Canada in the Calder case. Six of the seven 
Supreme Court justices who heard the case acknowledge the 
existence of aboriginal title in Canadian law''.
<P>
	With respect to those departmental drafters, I do not accept 
these statements as properly reflecting historical fact. How can 
you base your federal land claims policy on these 
misinterpretations?
<P>
	The Calder case was a claim by the Nishga people to 
aboriginal title over the Nass Valley in B.C. It was a claim to 
aboriginal title without precisely delineating what those words 
meant. When the claim was brought to the Supreme Court of 
British Columbia it was dismissed. It was then brought before 
the Court of Appeal of B.C. in which a three man court again 
dismissed the claim for aboriginal title.
<P>
	Finally it was appealed before the Supreme Court of Canada 
where it was once again dismissed, with three judges finding 
that aboriginal title may have existed prior to colonial contact 
but that it was extinguished at the time of colonial contact. 
Three other judges ruminated and the seventh dismissed the 
appeal on technical grounds.
<P>
	In the final analysis the Calder case did not decide that 
aboriginal title exists in Canada.
<P>
	Even if the Calder had been ruled as aboriginal title it would 
have been title that was far less than a fee simple title. It was not 
ever proposed or put forward in the case that the aboriginal title 
amounted to fee simple ownership, unlike the transfer that Bill 
C-16 provides. Bill C-16 conveys 41,000 square kilometres in 
fee simple ownership, about three quarters the size of Nova 
Scotia, based on no court substantiation.
<P>
	In the four agreements thus far, north of 60 degrees latitude, in 
other words in what Canadians have collectively known as the 
Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory, the total fee 
simple lands amount to 505,000 square kilometres or about half 
the size of the province of Ontario. We should be very concerned 
over land claim agreements that remove from the public domain 
vast areas of public lands.
<P>
	My party's other major concern with Bill C-16 is the 
constitutional entrenchment provision. The bill states that the 
agreement is constitutionalized. If our interpretation is correct 
this means that it cannot be amended other than by virtue of the 
amending formula to the Constitution which was agreed to in 
1982. When we look at the 1982 amending formula it does not fit 
very well to these kinds of land claim agreements. There are, as 
the House knows, six amending formulae and none of them 
seems to apply to situations created by bills such as Bill C-16.
<P>
	I question the validity of section 3.1.26 of the act which says 
amendments can be made because if the agreement can be so 
readily amended by order in council of the federal government 
and approval of the Sahtu Tribal Council, if it can be so easily 
amended in that way then how can we say this agreement is 
constitutionally entrenched? Those points fell on deaf ears in 
committee but again I make them.
<P>
	In this same vein we again state our concerns with locking in 
such detailed and untried provisions as are in this document. 
Hundreds of pages of clauses and provisions are locked in and 
only time will tell if they are workable.
<P>
<B>(2015 ) </B>
<P>
	I would hope that in future these types of agreements that are 
to be constitutionalized be kept to land claim rights only. These 
are the ones that section 35 of the Constitution is really talking 
about. Maybe a 10 year clause should accompany these locking 
in provisions to allow for a shakedown of the agreement.
<P>
	Bill C-16 allows for law making power and thus raises the 
issue of the charter of rights. The question is will those laws be 
subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I know 
the minister has said yes to the above, but with the greatest of 
respect that cannot be achieved by degree or by fiat.
<P>
	My understanding is that the only way this legislation that is 
passed under self-government agreements can be subject to the 
charter of rights is for the charter itself to be amended to make 
certain that legislation passed by aboriginal governments is 
subject to the charter. That is what was proposed in the 
Charlottetown accord and that was and can be the only rationale.
<P>
	In the absence of a specific provision in the charter of rights 
itself it is most unlikely that the charter applies to legislation 
passed by native self-government.
<P>
	Finally, I am amazed by the layers of bureaucracy that this bill 
creates from renewable resource boards to administration 
panels, to planning and water boards, to an environmental 
planning board. We have it all. I submit that these functions are 
currently being performed by the department of Indian affairs or 
by the territorial governments.
<P>
	Our final litmus is does it provide for the self-sufficiency of 
the Sahtu and the independence they seek? I fear as I do for the 
Yukon agreement that this litmus test will fail in the long term 
and even perhaps in the medium term. The intentions of both 
parties to the agreement, the Sahtu and the federal government, 
have been hijacked by bureaucratic solutions albeit with the best 
intentions.
<P>
	There are built in disincentives to business, once again 
designed by bureaucrats. We have a precedent in the Indian Act 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5262"> 5262 </A></B>
<P>
with all the built in disincentives to business within the Indian 
Act. Surely we could come up with a simpler design than this.
<P>
	I have found my relationships with the Sahtu first class. I hope 
that they feel the same way and I wish them the very best with 
their challenge and their adventure. Much adversity can be 
overcome with the correct spirit and attitude. I know how 
important Norman Wells is to the area. I have talked to many of 
the players. This enterprise will continue. It is new industry that 
is the challenge. I certainly hope that I am proven wrong in my 
major assumptions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I spoke at 
some length on this bill during second reading debate and during 
committee. I have a few brief points that I want to make in 
closing the debate.
<P>
	This being another step into the process of the huge giveaway 
of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon territory of Canada 
and removing it from the ownership of the crown for the use and 
enjoyment of all Canadians is a dangerous precedent to be 
setting. Not only is that precedent a giveaway of that amount of 
territory with no legal obligation to do so, there is another 
precedent that I spoke of earlier, and I continue to go back to on 
this particular agreement, the precedent that there is a valid 
treaty in force covering this territory which provided for the 
extinguishment of land claims and rights of aboriginal peoples 
in that area.
<P>
<B>(2020 ) </B>
<P>
	We are now in the process of renegotiating, reopening that 
agreement to again negotiate a broader package, a more 
generous package and much more territory. I think that is a real 
dangerous precedent to be setting and bodes poorly for the 
future when we will again be negotiating treaties one through 
eleven under the same circumstances that we are now 
renegotiating this one.
<P>
	The richness of this agreement I can only object to on the 
grounds that it does not end the responsibility of the Canadian 
taxpayer for these aboriginal people. Surely the $100,000 per 
individual payout in the share of resource revenue from the 
Norman Wells oil field and other resources is enough to provide 
for self-sufficiency and for self-determination for this group of 
people to allow them economic development to participate in all 
the things that all Canadians enjoy and take for granted in this 
country.
<P>
	Having given that opportunity we should then end the 
responsibility of the Canadian taxpayer to continue to support 
these aboriginal people. The Bloc spoke on this bill, both in 
second reading and now in third reading, in support of the bill. It 
is quite easy to understand the Bloc's position on this particular 
bill.
<P>
	It goes a long way to reinforcing the proposal of the 
recognition of sovereignty for a particular ethnic group and 
plays to its own cause. It certainly does not have to be concerned 
with the financial cost or the financial responsibility for 
ongoing generations of Canadians because clearly it does not 
want to be part of Canada and part of that obligation to future 
generations.
<P>
	When we talk about the large amount of oil and the large 
amount of money that was taken out of the Norman Wells oil 
field, certainly there have been great amounts of oil and wealth 
taken out, but I have worked in the Norman Wells oil field and it 
is a hugely expensive part of Canada to develop that resource in 
and to extract that resource.
<P>
	When we talk about those kinds of things, we have to consider 
the cost of developing not only the oil field but the technology 
that goes with it. Let us talk about the net value of the resource 
that was taken out.
<P>
	Let us, at the same time, consider the huge amounts of tax 
dollars that have been returned to the area in social spending to 
cover all kinds of things from housing to economic 
development, to schools, to all those other things. I think a good 
share of that resource is being returned and continues to be 
returned to that area.
<P>
	The other thing that I would like to speak briefly on is the 
process of this legislation as it went through the House and the 
fact that we, as an opposition party, were not allowed any 
provision to make our views heard or make our views known in 
the final report on the bill when it was returned to the House in 
report stage simply because we were not allowed to recommend 
or to discuss changes in the agreement. We were only allowed to 
discuss the bill itself, which was very small and did not really 
address the terms of the agreement.
<P>
	In spite of the fact that in committee we heard a number of 
witnesses from the region, the aboriginal people from the area, 
and some of them clearly neither understood nor desired the 
terms of this settlement, their views were not taken into 
consideration.
<P>
	There has been no discussion on report stage of those people 
who opposed this. I want to make sure that I and my party go on 
record opposing this process and this agreement simply because 
I think it is a huge mistake to be moving Canada toward a system 
that South Africa is celebrating leaving behind.
<P>
	We are imposing ethnic homelands on these people and 
trapping them in these agreements. That is a terrible precedent 
to be setting. We should be moving at some point to the equal 
treatment of all Canadians no matter where they live or what 
their ethnic or racial background is.
<P>
	In closing, when the record is written the Reform Party 
opposed the agreement and the Liberals pushed it through in 
spite of the objections of our party and a number of the people 
involved.
