	He said: Madam Speaker, I am most pleased to rise and table 
this document with the House. It amends the Financial 
Administration Act and the Auditor General Act. Its intent is to 
review the revenue estimates provided to the people of this

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House implore the government to initiate immediate consultations 
with Canadian taxpayers and provincial governments on the creation of a fair 
and integrated reform of the entire tax system which incorporates the principles 
of equity, efficiency and effectiveness, thereby reducing the tax burden on 
Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the whip of the Reform 
Party I would like to advise the House that pursuant to Standing 
Order 43(2) our speakers on this motion will be dividing their 
time today.
<P>
	Someone once said that you cannot get there from here. 
Nowhere is this saying more applicable than to the Canadian 
government's reliance on a confusing, complicated and 
convoluted system of tax and revenue collection. I rise on this 
opposition day as the first of many Reform speakers to call on 
the government for a complete overhaul of Canada's taxation 
system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3794"> 3794 </A></B>
<P>
	The Chair read the motion so I will not do the same.
<P>
	Every year Canadians spend countless millions of dollars on 
accountants and lawyers to have their income tax prepared. The 
2,091 page Income Tax Act is an unmitigated mess of rules and 
regulations and is screaming for reform, as are millions of 
Canadians.
<P>
	This red book, which is not to be confused with the Liberal red 
ink book, has in the rules and regulations and various forms that 
make it so confusing that all the people who tried to do their own 
tax returns this year had a hard time coming up with the right 
answers, myself included.
<P>
	The Liberal government with its red ink book promised to find 
ways to achieve tax fairness, simplicity and harmonization, 
implying some sort of reform to our tax system itself. Are 
Canadians truly getting the changes that they demanded and 
were promised? The answer is no.
<P>
	After six months all we hear in answer to our questions is 
``jobs, jobs, jobs''. All the Liberal government has done is pass 
old Tory bills, introduce no new bills of their own and we have 
not been able to question the government whatsoever on the 
direction that it wants to take this country.
<P>
	What has happened is that the Liberals have dangled reform in 
front of the noses of Canadian taxpayers but they have not 
delivered.
<P>
	In question period yesterday-I hear an hon. member talking 
who was not here, so he might listen to this-the Prime Minister 
stated that the only way to reduce taxes is to get Canadians back 
to work. This is a noble gesture, but has the Prime Minister not 
considered that it is the high tax burden that Canadians face 
which is stifling our economy and economic growth?
<P>
	The fact is that revenue collected from personal income tax 
has more than doubled since the 1984-85 fiscal year. Tax 
collected from corporations has remained stagnant at 
approximately $10 billion because profits have been sluggish 
due to our recession.
<P>
	Canada's overall tax burden has become the second highest of 
the G-7 countries in recent years and the taxpayers, as we all 
know, have moved to the underground economy that is valued 
anywhere from a low of $20 billion to a high of $120 billion.
<P>
	The government has failed to address the problem. In its last 
budget it increased spending by $3.3 billion instead of holding 
the line or reducing the spending. This makes the private sector 
less productive which leads to greater unemployment. Will 
governments acknowledge that they are in fact part of the 
problem and not the solution?
<P>
	The current high taxation rates serve as a temptation for 
government to keep spending at its current levels which will not 
solve our problems of high debt and high unemployment 
expeditiously. We must learn to live  within our means like all 
Canadians and cannot look to the Canadian taxpayer before 
accomplishing this goal.
<P>
	It is our belief that to stimulate the economy and to increase 
revenues for government, lenders, investors and consumers 
must possess a larger pool of disposable income. In this light, 
the Liberals should start by throwing this Income Tax Act out 
the window and replacing it with a completely new, entire tax 
system.
<P>
	Why not reform the tax system? I would submit to the finance 
minister that less is more. Lower taxes will mean more revenue 
to the government. In this vein I would recommend the 
implementation of a flat tax on individual and corporate income. 
This model may work. We would suggest to start with a premise 
that would require input and consultation with Canadians, the 
provinces and individuals in the House, that the first $12,000 be 
tax free. One per cent of charitable donations would be 
deductible, but RRSPs would be limited to $5,000 to $6,000 for 
deductions so that the wealthy would not get the higher amount 
of deductions. There would be a spousal deduction and a child 
care deduction, and that would be it. We would draw a line, 
multiply it by 15 per cent or 20 per cent and send in our tax 
return.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Corporations would pay the same rate. The difference with 
corporations would be that their dividends would be deductible. 
We would not be taxing that and giving it out as after tax dollars. 
Dividends to individuals who invest would be deductible and 
taxable in the hands of the recipients. All investments in the 
future, all loopholes, exemptions and deductions defined here 
with rules, exceptions and counterexceptions would be gone. We 
would be investing as individuals with after tax dollars, and the 
corporations would be paying us based on their profits.
<P>
	The objective of this tax would be threefold. It would simplify 
the current complicated tax forms so that all Canadians could 
understand them. It would restore equity in the tax system, 
eliminating the perception that one group of taxpayers is 
favoured over another and people with the same level of income 
would pay relatively the same amount of tax. The inequity right 
now is that there are people making $100,000 a year and one 
person pays $40,000 in taxes and the other person pays $20,000 
because they might have better advice or they might have better 
borrowing power. That is not fair. Third, this tax would 
eliminate the triple hits that Canadians are taking in their 
pocketbooks with PSTs, GSTs and income taxes.
<P>
	Under this system there would be no loopholes for anyone and 
we would be rid of the expensive bureaucracies now required to 
co-ordinate tax collection.
<P>
	In National Revenue and Taxation, Customs and Excise, there 
are 44,000 employees at a cost of $2.2 billion. Savings to the 
Department of National Revenue in tax collection and the 
monitoring of all personal and corporate tax exemptions would 
be in the billions, not  just the $36 million the government has 
proposed to save by the wonderful amalgamation of two deputy 
ministers, one of taxation revenue and the other of customs and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3795"> 3795 </A></B>
<P>
excise. We need more savings than just $36 million out of a $2.2 
billion budget. That is ludicrous and the government should be 
embarrassed.
<P>
	Introducing a simple, fair and integrated system of taxation 
would lower these costs substantially while checking the powers 
of the bureaucracy. If the bureaucracy in Canada is left 
unchecked it will continue to increase costs and taxes, 
continuing the country on its present downward spiral. 
Canadians will never have an opportunity to pay less taxes in a 
current year than they did the year before.
<P>
	An example of the high cost of the bureaucratic action was 
brought to my attention by a CA firm in Calgary, Bogle, Duska, 
Robinson and Perry. Mr. George Duska did an analysis in a 
six-month period. The number of forms and taxation slips 
whether or not they were required that changed for him to do his 
job on a file, to make copies and do the necessary changes, was 
about an inch and a half thick over a period of a month and a half.
<P>
	Witnessing the cost in changes in tax forms that had taken 
place over the past 10 years, Mr. Duska did an analysis of the 
revised tax forms over the six months to see if these changes 
were truly necessary. In his opinion 16 per cent of the revisions 
were required by the tax system, while 84 per cent ``were useless 
and a waste of taxpayers' money''. This indicates that as usual 
bureaucracy is out of control.
<P>
	I challenge the government and cabinet to give existing 
standing committees more authority to look at the expenditures 
and the budget estimates. They should let them come back to 
cabinet and recommend cuts, prioritize them and cut off the 
bottom two, to start the government toward a balanced budget. It 
is a small area relative to government expenditures, but it 
illustrates the fact that our present system is becoming a 
bureaucratic nightmare.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by educating the Liberal government, 
which might be nearly impossible, on the reality of the private 
sector, not the perceived reality of the Liberal government. 
Government overspending results in the raising of tax dollars. 
Higher taxation means less capital available in the marketplace 
which leads to a drop in demand. When demand drops, 
consumption drops, businesses close their doors and the cycle 
continues.
<P>
	This vicious circle is the main reason why over one million 
Canadians are unemployed. It takes money to create wealth. The 
government takes too much of it and then wonders why 
unemployment goes up. Business people in the House know this 
but politicians in the House do not understand this. They do not 
understand the difference between the spending of debt capital, 
borrowed money and equity capital, especially when the  
government has not paid back $1 of the money it has borrowed 
since 1968, the first years of Trudeau.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Is that not embarrassing? Who in the House borrows money 
from the bank and has never had to repay $1 of it over 23 years? I 
would venture to guess nobody. Why is the government being 
treated differently or why is it treating itself differently? The 
private sector understands the difference. It is time that 
politicians did as well.
<P>
	It should not be beyond our means to create a more equitable 
system of taxation, one that inspires prosperity for Canadians 
and economic growth for the country. Let us work toward the 
restoration of public trust in taxation and create a tax system that 
reflects the principles of equity, efficiency and effectiveness, 
thereby reducing the tax burden on Canadians.
<P>
	We must listen to the comments of all members in the House 
today and see if we come up with some solutions. The real 
problem is a balanced budget. It is important. No tax system in 
the world is good if it does not address the real problem. If we 
continue to spend $160 billion and do not raise $160 billion, we 
are contributing to the problem, not solving it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I begin by congratulating the 
Reform Party for initiating the debate on comprehensive tax 
reform. I also humbly correct the member because he made a 
statement that the government had failed to address this 
problem.
<P>
	I would like to clear the record because we have started the 
process of addressing this problem. We started it in the finance 
committee. Just yesterday the Prime Minister reiterated our 
election commitment that the GST was going to be killed. I think 
that is what he said. It is important for Canadians to know this. 
They cannot think, because we campaigned for three years for 
tax reform, that we came here and did not begin the process. We 
have not solved it yet but we have started.
<P>
	I remind the member that I had the privilege of appearing 
before the committee last week on the single tax which many of 
us on this side of the House have been working on for the past 
few years. It is a very difficult and complex issue. The member 
announced that.
<P>
	I have a question for the member. When a single tax is 
designed, or a proportional tax, one basic principle is flushing 
out all corporate loopholes, all tax preferences. Some would call 
them grants. Will the Reform Party be consistent on that and 
agree, as those of us who support single tax agree, that when we 
flush out all those preferences we will flush out all preferences 
that pertain to the energy sector in the province of Alberta?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3796"> 3796 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to respond to the hon. 
member for Broadview-Greenwood on the GST replacement 
and the work in the finance committee.
<P>
	Although the intentions are honourable, we will really end up 
at the end of the day with a new tax that replaces an old tax. They 
will still try to collect $15 billion out of the pockets of 
taxpayers. They say that is a solution. We can simplify it and 
make it less expensive to collect but nevertheless it is still a tax. 
It is a band-aid approach to the problem. The real solution to the 
problem is an entire review of the tax system so that we do not 
have to worry about the GST replacement and we only have to 
tax the one time.
<P>
	With respect to corporate profits, the whole concept is that 
currently the Income Tax Act and the income tax system are 
being used to drive social and economic policy. We have to 
design an income tax system solely for the collection of 
revenues to pay for the government programs people want. The 
responsibility of politicians is to find out what the people want 
and raise the money to do it.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	If they come up with a program to support the oil and gas 
industry, to support the coal industry or to support 
manufacturing, fishing, forestry or whatever, then they should 
treat them all the same and not be selective with specific 
subsidies at a particular time that distorts the marketplace, that 
confuses the marketplace and that creates unfair competition 
within the industry. At that time they might be favouring a 
certain type of industry. Within that industry those who know 
how to make a profit will be making a profit and those who do 
not will be getting the subsidy. In a way that is rewarding failure.
<P>
	The system of a flat tax, a proportional tax or a single tax-I 
do not care about the name-is an important concept. The 
principles are important. If we can get members of the House to 
accept certain principles and concepts, we will go a long way 
toward solving the problem. No company or industry, even if it 
is in the city of Calgary where I have worked for 23 years, would 
object to the fact of eliminating all complications, pretax and 
after tax. If we just deal with after tax dollars and we all had 
more disposable income, it would really purify and clean up the 
system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am particularly pleased to rise today to speak to the 
motion. It is near and dear to all our hearts, particularly at this 
time of the year when we have just gone to the well to pay our 
taxes.
<P>
	The underlying consideration that must be part of a tax 
structure is the element of fairness. Members will know that all 
of us as Canadians do not mind doing our share, but we want to 
know with absolute certainty that we are doing our fair share and 
that there are no privileged persons and corporations in our 
society doing nothing and living off the sweat of others who 
contribute.
<P>
	I will spend a few moments speaking to the issue of the 
corporate tax structure in Canada, particularly with a view to 
small and medium sized businesses. The question is: Does it do 
the job? Does our tax structure do what we want it to do or does it 
not?
<P>
	Members will know many different types of taxes affect 
business in Canada. There are income tax, payroll tax, capital 
tax, sales tax and property taxes. Each of these affects business 
differently according to the firm's sector of activities and its 
size. The elemental question is: Is it fair and does it work? Does 
it do the job?
<P>
	We know the tax structure is different for small and large 
firms. Why is it different? It is different because payroll and 
property taxes account for a larger part of the small business tax 
burden than they do for large firms. These taxes that small 
business bears are independent of profit. It does not matter how 
much profit a company makes. It has to pay payroll taxes, the 
municipal taxes, the taxes on water and sewer and all those sorts 
of things. These taxes weigh more heavily on a small business 
than they do on a large business.
<P>
	Over the years governments have shifted the tax burden from 
corporate income tax to payroll and property taxes. All 
governments favour these forms of taxation because they 
provide a more stable revenue stream than income taxes which 
rely on profit.
<P>
	The negative impact on the development of the economy, the 
fairness of the tax system and the structure of the tax system 
should be a cause for concern as we go away from corporate 
taxes which are a result of profit and payroll and other taxes 
which are not profit oriented.
<P>
	For example, taxes related to profits account for a significant 
portion of the overall tax burden: about $36.5 billion in 1992 
representing 73 per cent of the $50 billion of direct corporate 
taxes paid in 1992. Therefore 73 per cent of the corporate taxes 
paid in 1992 had nothing to do with income.
<P>
	At this point I wish to acknowledge the source of much of my 
comments today. It is ``Growing Small Business'', a budget 
document presented by the Minister of Industry. Most of what I 
will speak to today is in the government's budget documents. I 
thank the Canadian Federation of Independent Business for also 
providing me with some information.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	There is also indirect taxation of business inputs that are not 
related to profits. These taxes are levied by federal and 
provincial governments and are paid by businesses when they 
purchase goods and services. Examples of this type of tax are the 
excise tax on fuel and provincial retail sales taxes. About 
one-third of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3797"> 3797 </A></B>
<P>
provincial retail sales taxes is collected on business input. Input 
tax credits under the GST reduces this on a federal level.
<P>
	The current tax scheme in Canada is a burden on existing 
small and medium sized business. Just as important, it is a 
disincentive for those who wish to start their own businesses. 
Therefore if the government is to realize its goal of creating 
more and more jobs, it makes sense that the government would 
also reduce the tax burden and subsequently reduce the tax 
disincentive for people to be entrepreneurs, to get into business 
and create their own jobs.
<P>
	Although the government realizes that unfair taxation is a 
problem for business and this realization is acknowledged in the 
budget documents, it is reluctant to do anything to rectify the 
situation.
<P>
	The government as a matter of fact went so far as to announce 
in the February budget that it is unable at this time to offer any 
tax assistance to small and medium sized business. Instead it has 
put the pressure on banks to allow easier access to loans.
<P>
	I submit that the problem is not exclusively access to loans. 
The problem is to be able to retain cash in a small or medium 
sized business to employ more people, to expand the business, to 
get involved in other businesses. The government must realize 
that all the start-up capital in the world will not assist small 
business unless businesses are profitable and are able to retain 
cash in the business.
<P>
	The problems facing businesses go deeper than just taxes. It is 
the result of a flawed philosophical approach to business. It is 
proven that small business creates up to 80 per cent of the jobs in 
Canada. Yet all governments continually put impediments in 
place that take away from business the ability to grow and 
prosper.
<P>
	Government after government has used small and medium 
sized business as a cash cow to balance the books. The current 
Liberal government must become the exception to the rule if it is 
to realize on its promise to create jobs. Claiming to want to 
create jobs yet not making changes in the tax environment for 
small and medium sized business just will not wash.
<P>
	Small and medium sized business must be allowed to retain 
capital for reinvestment in the business to create the jobs that are 
so desperately required in our economy. Capital from small 
businesses should not be taxed until it is taken out of the 
business.
<P>
	I would like to spend just a few moments if I may to speak to 
the equity position of taxation in business, small business versus 
large business or multinational business.
<P>
	I have a list of many businesses in Canada that have from $26 
million to $111 million in pre-tax profits which in the year 1992 
paid no taxes whatsoever. A member of this very House some 
years ago coined the phrase ``corporate welfare bums''. Ladies 
and gentlemen, that phrase was apropos then and it is apropos 
now.
<P>
	Canadians would be absolutely horrified to know of the 
tentacles large business has in this very House in Ottawa which 
is nothing but a siphon for business to get money from the 
government to promote whatever business has the tentacles and 
the ability to get into the House. I submit that individual 
Canadian taxpayers earning $7, $8, $10 an hour should not be 
subsidizing any corporations. If a business does not have the 
ability to compete on its own, it should not be in business.
<P>
	As this debate unfolds and as we move along we have to 
understand that the basic element of fairness has to be part of our 
tax system. As the day progresses we will be speaking to the 
notion of a single tax or a flat tax. The premise behind this is so 
that everyone understands that the system is fair, that nobody 
gets away with anything, that we all contribute equally 
according to our means.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to comment on some of the provisions the Reform members are 
making today.
<P>
	One is that the system is complex and indeed it is complex. 
Our society over the years has become more complex and that is 
a fact of life.
<P>
	One of my observations on the income tax system has been not 
so much that it is complex, but I think some of the things that the 
members have been drawing attention to is the fact that we keep 
changing it all the time. In fact 1972 was a major time of 
amendment and reform to the income tax system, as was the 
early eighties. Now members are proposing another change to 
the system. Every time we change the system it means we do not 
understand it any more. It takes us another 10 or 15 years to 
understand the system.
<P>
	I would like to suggest to the member that possibly a more 
beneficial method is just to leave the system partially alone. We 
need to change some things where some are getting better 
benefits out of the system than others.
<P>
	I would like the member to deal with another aspect which is 
the main part of my question. With the flat tax Reform Party 
members are proposing today, how can they justify the shift in 
tax burden from upper income groups to the middle class?
<P>
	Essentially the mathematics are very simple. If we have to 
collect <I>x</I> number of dollars from the system we are going to have 
to collect it from various aspects of our tax system. Right now 
our tax system is progressive. By definition it has to follow that 
with the flat tax they are proposing today there is a reallocation 
of tax burden from the upper income group to the middle class. 
Could the hon. member explain that?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3798"> 3798 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question and the opportunity to expand on a couple of 
aspects of this single tax.
<P>
	I think the hon. member's point about changes is that we have 
not been changing the tax system; we have been tinkering with 
it. There is a saying in the manufacturing industry that we have 
lost the handle. That means when you have tinkered with 
something so often and so much you do not know where you 
started and you lose the handle.
<P>
	We have lost the handle with our tax system. All the tinkering 
in the world is not going to change it. We have to go back to 
ground zero and reinvent it. We have to keep in mind the kiss 
principle: keep it simple stupid. It must be kept simple and 
direct. If a book three inches thick is needed to define the tax law 
and you have to be a Philadelphia lawyer to figure out how you 
are going to pay the taxes, then obviously people feel there are 
loopholes for some and not for others.
<P>
	As far as equity in a single tax is concerned, who is going to 
get nailed? Obviously you are only going to nail the middle 
class. That is where the money is.
<P>
	To presume the high income earners in our country are paying 
a fair portion now is to presume there are not such things as a 
capital gains exemption, that there are not all kinds of tax 
incentives to help people at the higher end of the income level. 
These are not available to people at the lower income level.
<P>
	To presume that things are fair and equitable in the tax system 
now, I just do not concur with the hon. member's premise. I 
think it is not fair now and it needs to be fair. The tax system is 
only able to get resources from people who have them. We have 
to understand that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to lead off 
the debate for the government side today and to thank the 
member for Calgary Centre for putting such an important issue 
in front of the House.
<P>
	There is not a member in the Chamber who does not have to 
deal from time to time with the question of tax reform. I was 
interested in the interventions first from the member on our side, 
the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood. He has been a 
great advocate of tax reform. The member for Durham just rose. 
He sits on the finance committee, as does the member for 
Niagara Falls. Since joining the House, all of them in their own 
way have been very active on the question of tax reform. I thank 
them for their contributions. I am sure all members will join me 
in wishing to hear more from them on questions of tax reform.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The motion itself at first glance has much to contribute to the 
debate. The first part reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House implore the government to initiate immediate consultations 
with Canadian taxpayers and provincial governments on the creation of a fair and 
integrated reform of the entire tax system-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	After looking at the first part of the motion I would like to get 
the House to consider where we have come from on the question 
of tax reform and where we might be going.
<P>
	The question of taking on the whole issue at one time at one 
level is quite attractive. It would be very nice to find a simple 
solution to the question of tax reform in this country, but the 
reality is that tax reform has been a very difficult process.
<P>
	Post-World War II Canada usually uses the Carter 
commission with its after the fact cliché that a dollar is a dollar 
as the beginning of tax reform efforts which now stretch over 30 
years. Successive governments including our own back in the 
1960s and 1970s have done more than their fair share to instil a 
better sense of fairness in the tax system.
<P>
	However, the job remains a daunting one. It is one in which we 
need the advice not only from members of our own caucus but 
also members from all parties in this House to find the best way 
to improve Canada's tax system.
<P>
	I hope each member in the House is most conscious of the tax 
system since the period for filing income tax returns has just 
ended. It is not just an abstract issue to members; it is one each 
of us as individuals contribute to annually, as well as daily 
through the consumption taxes. To remind Canadians, when 
members of the House of Commons and the Senate speak about 
tax reform, they are not just speaking about something in 
someone else's life, they are also speaking about something in 
their own lives. Therefore they are very conscious of the need to 
make things fairer at all times.
<P>
	As the member pointed out in the lead speech, the legacy of 
the last 10 years has been an increased shift to individual 
personal tax. This has caused a great deal of concern among 
Canadians on the question of fairness. At the same time in the 
business community the question of payroll taxes and the ever 
increasing burden of weekly and monthly remittances to 
provincial, local and federal governments drive small 
businesses to distraction and are a constant concern of big 
businesses in their investment decisions in Canada.
<P>
	We on this side of the House join the opposition in seeking 
ways to improve the tax system. We probably would differ on 
the ability of a government to find one solution to the entire 
question of tax reform. One of the great frustrations in 
governing is of course that every solution requires biting off a 
chunk of the problem and dealing with it in a practical sense. Tax 
reform is an ever evolving process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3799"> 3799 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to share with the House the ways in which we 
have begun to deal with the issue of tax reform at this time. 
There are three benchmarks for this government.
<P>
	The first one is that in our platform before the election we set 
out tax reform as a major initiative. Part of the commitments we 
made to Canadians is to make progress on questions of taxes and 
tax reform during our first mandate.
<P>
	Also, one of the first measures taken in this House was the 
approval of the work being done by the House of Commons 
finance committee, of which I am a member. There are at least 
four other members of the committee in the House of Commons 
today participating in this debate. The committee has sought to 
reform the GST.
<P>
	To observe the rules of the House, I will not dwell on the work 
of the committee. However I will make it part of the public 
record that in view of the witnesses who have been heard, the 
experts who have come in to help the committee and the wisdom 
of the members themselves, we are very much convinced the 
committee will produce a report which will be used as a tool by 
the Minister of Finance in his efforts to deal with the provincial 
governments.
<P>
	The second part of the motion deals with the negotiations with 
the provincial government. We would agree in the motion with 
the reality that we cannot sell the question of tax reform on our 
own.
<P>
	Consumption taxes are perhaps the best example. There are 11 
regimes in this country of which 10 are active in consumption 
taxes. Some provinces have differential rates. All 11 regimes tax 
different commodities and different services at different rates. It 
is very confusing for the consumer and we have set out as our 
highest priority in tax reform to bring some order out of the 
chaos and the GST/consumption taxes in this country.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Again, on behalf of the Minister of Finance I thank my 
colleagues in the House and in committee for their work. Like 
them, I look forward to seeing a report some time in the next 
month, on schedule, which then can be taken to the provincial 
ministers of finance and contribute to an ongoing national 
debate on tax reform.
<P>
	The third initiative that we have taken and that I would like to 
spend some time on is our February budget. Our February 
budget considered a number of measures to eliminate tax 
loopholes and inequities in the system. This is why in the budget 
we also announced that we would be rolling back unemployment 
insurance premiums of 1993 to deal with the question of the high 
cost of payroll taxes.
<P>
	Although the changes that we made to the UI system were 
minor, we consider that to be an important first step to indicate 
to Canadian businesses that we are conscious of the cost of 
payroll taxes. Often forgotten in this is that the worker bears a 
very high cost on a weekly basis for these premiums. Any 
initiatives that we can take to cut back on his or her weekly 
premiums is appreciated.
<P>
	During the prebudget consultations, Canadians told us that 
payroll taxes like these are a major barrier to job creation. We 
heard that message and we acted. These prebudget consultations 
are also bottom line proof that our pursuit of a better tax system 
is firmly rooted in a commitment to consultation with taxpayers 
and with other levels of government.
<P>
	As I noted at the beginning of my speech, the question of tax 
reform will take us several years. Next fall is the second stage in 
the work of the finance committee. The Minister of Finance is 
required by orders of the House to report for the first time in our 
history to the finance committee with an economic statement.
<P>
	The finance committee will then proceed with several weeks 
of hearings in a more public prebudget consultation process. I 
personally take this as a benchmark of changes in the attitude of 
the Canadian government toward taxpayers in the organization 
of the budget, the expenditures and on the revenue side.
<P>
	I ask those Canadians who are watching this debate and those 
members of the House who are participating in this debate not to 
consider it to be a sole opportunity to contribute toward tax 
reform but to proceed to prepare for the finance committee in the 
fall and to bring forward ideas for tax reform, to bring out ways 
that we can make the system fairer and to put those into the 
public realm for debate, discuss it with members of Parliament 
on the committee. Write a letter. For those members who have 
their own projects, bring it to the attention of the committee.
<P>
	One of the most interesting aspects of the GST hearings was a 
number of members of Parliament who came forward to present 
their ideas on GST reform. Around 24 or 25 members 
participated in this debate. I thought it was a very healthy 
process. Although my memory in the House is not long, I think it 
has been a while since members felt it efficacious to go in front 
of a committee in that number and present their own ideas.
<P>
	The fact is that officials from finance and other departments 
that deal with tax issues meet with their provincial counterparts 
year in and year out to discuss proposals for changes and 
improvements. The broad policy review process that the 
February budget outlined includes areas where tax concerns are 
being studied and Canadians are being consulted.
<P>
	This reality that consultations are taking place on tax 
improvements is just one reason why today's motion, although it 
is a good start, may perhaps do discredit to the tax reform 
process inadvertently if it is not  appreciated in the reading of 
the motion 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3800"> 3800 </A></B>
<P>
that the complexity of the issue is respected. No one can bring to 
the debate a holier than thou attitude that one solution will solve 
all of that.
<P>
	This is what I personally find disturbing inasmuch as the 
verbal game playing and intellectual cynicism in the motions, 
invocation of a triple-E solution of equity, efficiency and 
effectiveness goes together without creating other problems. 
Again, I want to assure Canadians that in developing tax policy 
these principles have been and will continue to be recognized as 
critically important by the government and the officials in 
finance and Revenue Canada.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, Canadians should recognize that these are not 
principles that always work well together. In fact sometimes just 
the opposite is the result. It is just this conflict that the 
opposition has chosen to ignore in its original motion.
<P>
	A bit of common sense history and philosophy will make it 
clear why this motion could contribute more to solving the 
challenges of tax reform. As Canada's income tax law gradually 
evolved over the past 74 years it has been shaped by several key 
forces which I would like to review for the House.
<P>
	The first is the use of the tax system to do more than just 
generate government revenues. It has also been a tool to carry 
out economic and social policies from child care assistance to 
research tax credits that play an important part in our national 
well-being. But each of these measures has needed specific and 
often intricate legislation on definitions, rules and procedures.
<P>
	A second force in shaping our modern tax system is the 
increasingly sophisticated tax planning evolved by individuals 
and corporations seeking to reduce their tax liability. This 
perfectly legal and entirely understandable activity has a clear 
corollary. We have had to put in place correspondingly 
sophisticated tax law in order to preserve the government's tax 
base.
<P>
	A third force is the evolution of the economy itself into one 
that has become more sophisticated and complex with every 
passing year and one more deeply tied to global currents and 
competition. Here again there is an unfortunate corollary. The 
fact is that it is becoming often impossible for a tax system to be 
truly simple, truly fair and truly effective given the 
extraordinary variety and complexity of commercial and other 
situations it must accommodate.
<P>
	Let me give just one high tech example of what I am talking 
about. We would all agree in the House that the high tech 
industry is the cutting edge of the new economy and that 
research in these areas is something that the tax system should 
encourage. That is something virtually all the participants in our 
prebudget consultations agreed on. But what about the situation 
where a company, say Ottawa's Bell Northern Research, used 
equipment to make experimental microchips and  yet uses the 
same equipment to produce proven commercial chips? Is this 
research equipment or manufacturing equipment? How do we 
determine the equipment's tax status? Especially, how do we 
determine its tax status without developing fairly detailed rules?
<P>
	If we eliminate any tax benefits for research facilities all we 
are doing is inviting Canadian researchers and manufacturers to 
move to jurisdictions where those benefits are available. Those 
are the sorts of real world situations and issues that tax policy 
makers must not ignore and they must not be ignored in the 
consideration of a resolution such as the one we have in front of 
us.
<P>
	A key element of a fair and equitable tax system is that it 
provides both taxpayer and government with all possible 
certainty. If you do not know what your obligations and 
entitlements are, you can never be sure you are not at a 
disadvantage. Only explicit law can be certain. To be explicit a 
law must be somewhat complex. It must cover all known 
eventualities and then be updated as new conditions warrant.
<P>
	I suspect that many critics of the government might try and 
argue the fact that many tax measures require interpretation. 
There is evidence that current laws fail this goal of certainty. 
What they do not realize is that radical simplification which 
must use sweeping generalities would actually make the act 
more ambiguous and ultimately increase the amount of 
interpretation necessary.
<P>
	I wish that reality was not so demanding on all of us. But 
wishful thinking and rose coloured spectacles are poor guides 
for policy and do Canadian citizens no favours. This is exactly 
the case when it comes to one form of tax simplification that 
some hon. members in this House have been known to espouse, 
what I call the seductive flat tax proposal. How much simpler, 
how much fairer it would be if there was just one rate of tax to be 
calculated on all income. Simpler perhaps, but perhaps not. 
Fairer? Well, that depends on your definition of fairness.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I suspect that many Canadians would not find a flat tax system 
less equitable and fairer than the current progressive system. 
After all, to be revenue neutral individuals in top income 
brackets would enjoy lower taxes while tax increases would be 
necessary for lower and middle income filers.
<P>
	The fact is that high income Canadians pay a considerably 
larger share of the total tax bill than their size as a group in the 
population. The lowest income groups pay a relatively small 
share of the tax take. Is this equitable? Not in the sense of 
mathematical equality. Is it fair? I suggest that most Canadians 
agree that those facing economic hardship who must devote the 
bulk of their incomes to basic necessities do not deserve to have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3801"> 3801 </A></B>
<P>
their tax burden increased. This government is committed to 
avoiding tax increases among low income families.
<P>
	I hold that justice without compassion is more tyranny than 
equity. By the same token, a tax system that places narrow 
numerical simplicity ahead of social conscience will be a 
betrayal of the values of mutual support and sharing that are a 
cherished part of our national Canadian fabric.
<P>
	It is also worth pointing out that the complexity in our tax 
system is not so much the result of having more than one tax 
rate. Let me again remind the House that complexity stems from 
a wide variety of complex situations that arise in the real world. 
The current tax system takes into account the reality of differing 
individual and family circumstances.
<P>
	For example, special measures such as the child care expense 
deduction provide relief to families which incur these expenses. 
Other measures such as the charitable donations credit 
encourage contributions to the voluntary sector. Under the 1994 
budget we in fact made it easier for Canadians to contribute to 
voluntary associations.
<P>
	Under the flat tax system such measures should not exist. If 
they are maintained then we are right back to the exemptions and 
credits in calculations that many of us wrestle with each year. 
The only difference would be in using one tax rate instead of the 
current three, hardly a dramatic improvement.
<P>
	That leads me directly to another problem I have with today's 
motion. That is perhaps the intimation that is implied, that there 
is some silver bullet or some simple one-step solution to these 
problems. However, there is no national consensus as to exactly 
what that one simple solution might be.
<P>
	At the start of my remarks I mentioned the series of cross 
country prebudget consultations that the Minister of Finance 
and myself engaged in. It might interest the member to know 
that while some participants wanted fewer rates and brackets, 
others took the opposite stance and urged us to increase the 
range of brackets and make the rates even more progressive. 
There was also real wisdom in the comments made by one 
Toronto participant who observed that one taxpayer's loophole 
was clearly another's entitlement.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I hope I have not, if you will, taxed the 
patience of the House too much by highlighting the real world 
conditions and obstacles that make a simple, fair and effective 
tax system such a challenge. It is a challenge that this 
government will continue to accept. I know that my colleagues 
here will have much to say on the action that we have taken and 
the activities underway to meet this goal.
<P>
	The challenges that must be overcome cannot be overcome by 
pretending there are magic cure-alls. Progress is not made by 
glibly lumping together principles that undercut each other. 
Success will not be achieved by pretending that panic and haste 
can achieve more than patience and steady sensible progress.
<P>
	In my speech I highlighted some of the problems that we have 
in developing proper tax regimes for corporations working in a 
very competitive international environment, with very difficult 
trade and tariff regimes. In the last few days I have had an 
opportunity to deal with people in the garment manufacturing 
industry, for example, whose whole world is being turned upside 
down by changing tax regimes and tariff regimes. We are all 
aware of just how difficult individual Canadian families are 
finding the tax system and how it leads members in this House to 
be impatient for a new system. I quote a famous American jurist, 
Oliver Wendell Holmes, who said: ``Taxes are what we pay for a 
civilized society''.
<P>
	That I guess is the message that I would like to leave with this 
House, that as we deal with taxes we also deal with the 
legitimacy of this country in the way that taxes provide us with 
the resources to do things together. Trying to change the tax 
system and to make it fairer also implies that we remember the 
usefulness of these taxes for everyone. I thank you for this 
opportunity to contribute.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
motion before the House today asks for more consultations, and 
today we may hear quite a few statements full of good 
resolutions in this respect.
<P>
	I think we heard this in what was said by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre who is also a member of the finance 
committee and who said he wants more equity in the tax 
treatment of individuals and more equity among the provinces.
<P>
	I would like to give two examples: one concerning individuals 
and one which concerns the provinces. Although the hon. 
member must be familiar with these examples, he did not 
mention them at all in his speech. However, it is now time to act.
<P>
	As far as individuals are concerned, during the election 
campaign it was made clear that family trusts were a tax benefit 
that was unacceptable to most Canadians. However, there was 
nothing about this in the last budget. Maybe next fall the finance 
committee will consider the issue. We are still waiting for 
information from the Minister of Finance, and they tell us they 
will have the information but we are still waiting. If the 
committee starts considering the issue of family trusts next fall, 
this means there will be nothing in the next budget.
<P>
	We must not forget that this measure was introduced by a 
Liberal government and extended by the Conservative govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3802"> 3802 </A></B>
<P>
ment at the end of its mandate, and now they are trying to play 
for time instead of dealing with this obvious injustice.
<P>
	As far as provinces are concerned, the last example which 
contradicts what the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre 
just told us, refers to how the federal government treats Quebec 
tax credits for research and development. Quebec has 
introduced a tax system that benefits research and development, 
researchers and universities.
<P>
	The system is simple: companies are allowed a tax credit of 20 
per cent on research expenditures if they do the research alone 
and 40 per cent if they do the research in co-operation with a 
university. This is a very successful program. However, the 
federal government decided that the tax credit allowed by 
Quebec was to be considered as a subsidy, which was contrary to 
common practice. And it still is.
<P>
	This means that the federal government imposes a 39 per cent 
tax on tax credits allowed companies and universities by the 
Government of Quebec. But not a word about this, although for 
years, the Quebec Minister of Finance has been asking for a 
review of this unacceptable tax treatment by the federal 
government.
<P>
	Has anybody heard of any changes in this respect? Not at all, 
Madam Speaker. So if they want to be fair to the people and fair 
to the provinces, I wish the hon. member, who is a member of the 
finance committee, would respond to these two specific issues. 
It is time to act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, I will talk first about the 
family trusts issue. The government announced in the budget 
that this issue would be referrred to the finance committee but, 
at the present time, the committee is very busy with the GST 
issue, the budget issue, Bill C-17 and other bills. I think that, in 
the fall, the committee will start examining the family trusts 
issue. But at this time, it is too busy with the other bills.
<P>
	The second issue is very important for all the nation, because 
research matters and tax matters in the research field are very 
difficult to settle. Within the government, the Departments of 
Industry and Finance are currently examining our research 
policy directions. I hope to see changes before the next budget 
and also, I say to the hon. member that it is possible that changes 
will be made to the family trusts issue if the finance committee 
thinks that might be a major problem for the next budgets.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to make a comment and ask a question of the hon. member 
for Winnipeg North Centre.
<P>
	I am disappointed to hear that he is against the exploration of 
an integrated flat tax system or single tax. I am also challenged 
to see here that he says it is seductive. It is unfortunate that when 
suggestions are made that seem to have a lot of encouraging 
inducements to looking at them they are labelled as too simple.
<P>
	Why do people in politics feel that the problems are so 
complex and that tax reform is a difficult process? I believe the 
parliamentary secretary has already listened to the Department 
of Finance too long. That is an incorrect and false premise. He 
should think for himself. He should look at the problems and try 
to use some common sense and he will see that this is where that 
will lead him. Not that I am that intelligent but that is where my 
nose led me and Lord knows it is long enough.
<P>
	The other comment I have is that we in the Standing 
Committee on Finance are looking at a replacement for the GST, 
but that is a band-aid approach to the real problem. Why not 
cure the entire illness with a surgical overhaul of the entire tax 
system?
<P>
	We have a year and a half to do it; a year and a half to just 
come up with a band-aid and the illness will have grown worse, 
and then our problem will become even greater.
<P>
	The hon. member also took credit for the wonderful 
consultative process that this great Liberal government has now 
introduced to the principles of democracy. Taking credit for 
consultations is nothing new. If that is all the credit it wants to 
take, it can have all of it.
<P>
	What would be new is after we consult with provinces and 
individuals the government actually listens and implements 
their suggestions. I hope this is something that will happen.
<P>
	He also criticizes flat tax. This is where I am leading to my 
question. He states that as the current system is progressive, it 
would eliminate progressivity. It would introduce regressivity 
because it is a flat tax and we are taxing the poor.
<P>
	Lower income earners would be tax exempt. Upper income 
earners would lose their tax loopholes. They would not get these 
wonderful deductions that they are getting now and they would 
pay tax on every dollar earned. For instance, higher income 
people can lower their tax rates from a 50 per cent rate down to a 
30 per cent rate and this I know from personal experience. That 
would be eliminated and they would be paying tax on 
everything.
<P>
	Therefore, collectively from individuals and more 
significantly in terms of corporations this is where we get more 
tax out of corporations. After my comments here and 
specifically to his questions, would the parliamentary secretary 
apply some common sense and would he be willing to request 
the Department of Finance and the department of revenue and 
taxation to crunch some numbers to illustrate or highlight the 
difficulties to this House of a system like this with no 
exemptions?
<P>
	Why not put the Departments of Finance and National 
Revenue to work instead of listening to them saying that it is too 
complex and it will not work? Put them to work and make them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3803"> 3803 </A></B>
<P>
prove to this House that a system like this does not deserve more 
consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, the member for Calgary Centre 
has put me on the horns of a dilemma: do I think for myself or do 
I listen to the department?
<P>
t	That is not necessarily two different issues, but I like to think 
that I can still keep my own counsel when I listen to other 
professionals giving me advice.
<P>
	The last point is a very serious point. In this case I am not 
speaking for the department. I have some doubts about the flat 
tax. It does not mean that I think there should not be an open 
discussion. I have listened to my colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood bring this up several times. I really do 
hope the finance committee takes a look at these ideas in the fall 
as part of the deliberations for the upcoming budget.
<P>
	If it will help the committee to have a presentation on some of 
the data and some of the intricacies, either publicly or with the 
hon. member individually, I would be more than happy to take 
that request to the department and we can arrange something. I 
do not think the resources of the government should be, if you 
will, cornered by the government and I do not have any intention 
of doing that.
<P>
	If I appear to be critical of a different way of approaching 
taxation, it does not mean that I am not willing to open up the 
doors and make sure that is fully explored in the coming months. 
The member has given this a lot of thought. We have our 
disagreements but that does not mean that it should not be 
looked at properly and thoroughly.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
extremely happy to participate in today's debate on a subject 
very close to my heart. When I decided to run for political 
office, I had two major goals in mind: the first, of course, was to 
bring about full sovereignty for Quebec, and the second was to 
create a fairer, more equitable tax system, since it accounts for a 
large part of the social contract between individuals and the 
government and is presently the cause of much of the 
dissatisfaction people feel for their elected representatives.
<P>
	Today's debate is also, in my view, very timely. Yesterday was 
the deadline for filing income tax returns. Many people likely 
spent the weekend working feverishly at the last minute to 
properly complete their tax returns. Just yesterday, I was 
completing a tax return for a friend. I enjoy this task, but I know 
that many people find the process quite difficult and quite 
complex. There must not be many people who are totally 
familiar with the ins and outs of the Income Tax Act, given its 
complexity. Year after year, new amendments are made. The end 
result is an extremely complex piece of legislation.
<P>
	The same could be said of the Goods and Services Tax to 
which some Liberal members made reference a while ago. This 
tax is also extremely difficult to understand and fraught with 
complexities and regulations. The GST legislation is almost as 
voluminous as the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	In moving his motion, the hon. member for Calgary Centre 
touched on one alternative that he would like to discuss. While I 
do not necessarily agree with the aims or technical aspects of his 
proposal for a single tax rate, I do think that all options deserve 
to be weighed. This is a serious proposal, one that should be 
given due consideration.
<P>
	Having said this, I do have some reservations, although I am 
not an expert on this single tax. First, I am not convinced that 
this would really be a more progressive, more equitable tax. Of 
course, a single tax rate that would apply to all incomes may 
seem rather simple, but would it really result in a system that 
was fairer and less regressive than the current one? I somehow 
doubt it, because there are many ways to avoid declaring 
income. This option would have to be carefully considered.
<P>
	On the other hand, it does not leave us any leeway in using 
taxation as a social and economic development tool. I know this 
is one of the arguments of those in favour: taxation must not be a 
social and economic development tool; alternatives must be 
found.
<P>
	Personally, I think it can be a very useful tool. Let me give you 
an example. In 1987, in my region, the economy was going full 
steam. We came very close to full employment, with 6 per cent 
employment rate, and we were doing very well. One of the main 
reasons for this success was mining exploration, an activity 
strongly encouraged by way of deductions for flow-through 
shares.
<P>
	Toward the end of that expansion period, the governments 
attacked this deduction, and you should have seen the 
tremendous impact this had on our region. Today, research does 
not even ensure availability of sufficient reserves any more. 
Trouble lies ahead ten years down the road, maybe less, because 
we are not discovering enough mineral reserves. Problems are 
already starting to show up in our region, and that is a serious 
situation.
<P>
	But we used to have a tax incentive, a tool that allowed and 
encouraged people to make investments. You know how risky it 
is to invest in a mining exploration company. The taxpayer 
would put money into shares, but in recognition of the risk 
factor, the government shared the risk via tax incentives.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, this is not a direct subsidy by which the 
government gives money to people and tells them: ``Go and do 
research''. Instead, the government is supporting investments 
made by individuals in the private sector. So, the risk is shared. I 
think this is the sort of interesting tools afforded by the tax 
system. Let us not be mistaken in thinking that only 
high-income  taxpayers took advantage of this; many 
middle-income 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3804"> 3804 </A></B>
<P>
people in our region were attracted by all the spin-off benefits 
their investments could have. The nice thing was that when you 
picked a company that struck an interesting deposit, then, it was 
almost like winning the lottery.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	How can we encourage these businesses? I would like those 
who support this kind of tax to explain how they will promote 
economic development, especially in higher-risk areas. The 
government has a duty to intervene when investments may be 
insufficient due to various factors. That is what I wanted to say 
regarding this tax.
<P>
	Now, if we look at the current tax system as a whole, I think 
that, to resolve any problem, we must follow a certain 
procedure. First, we must analyze the situation carefully; make 
a diagnosis; identify alternatives and make a choice. But there is 
also a subsequent step that the government often forgets: 
following-up on the choices that were made. The Auditor 
General often talks about it. Many government programs are not 
assessed properly after their implementation. The same goes for 
tax measures. That is why we think it would be interesting to 
look at overall expenditures-not only budget but also tax 
spending-to examine, assess and follow up on them and to 
study their impact in the last few years.
<P>
	Of course, the Liberals were full of good intentions when they 
were in opposition. It led them to write the red book that I will 
not quote because I sent it to recycling when I realized it was 
only wishful thinking. Very little is put forward in this House. I 
would like the Liberal government to be a little more serious. 
They cannot always fall back on the argument that their 
four-year mandate gives them enough time to act. There are 
always things that need to be done. We cannot wait for four 
years. They can rest easy, they will not run out of things to do. 
And we can start right away.
<P>
	Earlier, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance talked about the committee's heavy workload due to the 
GST and Bill C-17. However, when the GST report is tabled on 
June 1, the committee will then be free to deal with family trusts 
in June. Parliamentarians will be available in June as Parliament 
will still be sitting. Yes, there will be other minor bills but given 
how long we worked on the Goods and Services Tax, we could 
examine family trusts.
<P>
	However, the government should give out information and put 
figures on the table. But they prefer to wait until the fall to gain 
time, to stall for another year; other issues will be raised and 
they will find other reasons to prevaricate. Playing for time is 
the best way to avoid dealing with a problem. And that is what 
they are doing. And they ease their conscience by saying that it 
is in the latest budget and that they will start to do something. 
Hold on there-we shall see; I have my doubts.
<P>
	In the past, some people dealt with taxation. There were 
important commissions, the Carter commission, the 
Rowell-Sirois commission; at that time principles were 
expressed that are still current today. We should deal with them 
instead of starting all over. The public feels frustrated and their 
frustration is rather justified. Often, committees and 
commissions of inquiry are set up to analyze problems. They 
identify the problems very well and produce very fine three- or 
four-volume reports; a huge number are printed and copies are 
available everywhere, but often these recommendations remain 
on the shelf. Although the problem must be restated for today's 
conditions, these reports often contain some very worthwhile 
things.
<P>
	As I said in my introduction, the tax system is an important 
part of the social contract; it is how revenue is collected from 
taxpayers to pay for the government's expenses. Individuals 
now have a terrible feeling of unfairness which puts a very 
strong pressure on them to somehow right the balance. What do 
they do? They encourage the underground economy because 
they feel that it is the right thing to do for themselves. And you 
must understand where they are coming from, given some data 
from the 1980s.
<P>
	For example, look at the wealthiest 1 per cent of the 
population. I have some reservations about the figures that I will 
give, but I heard them from the member for Gatineau-La 
Lièvre. Even if they are not totally accurate, they certainly are 
indicative of the trend.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	In 1980, the highest percentile, the richest 1 per cent, owned 
16 per cent of Canada's total wealth. Ten years later, with the 
recession in the early 1980s and the economic slowdown in the 
late 1980s, this top percentile held 26 per cent of the wealth, an 
increase of 10 per cent in the 1980s.
<P>
	It is not surprising to hear middle-class people say that they 
feel they were strangled in the last decade, that they felt a lot of 
pressure. People live with it every day and resent it and that is 
what spurs on our underground economy.
<P>
	Let me give some other figures, Madam Speaker. Let us look 
at government revenue, starting with 1981, so that we can better 
see what happened. In 1981, federal and provincial governments 
together collected $34 billion in personal income taxes. In 1991, 
that amount had reached $100 billion.
<P>
	Let us now take a look at corporate income taxes. In 1981, 
$11.7 billion were collected in such taxes, compared to $18.3 
billion in 1991. Obviously, the progression is far from being the 
same, which explains why a small percentage of Canadians were 
able to get richer. If you look at the breakdown for each province 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3805"> 3805 </A></B>
<P>
and the federal government, you can see that the pattern is the 
same everywhere.
<P>
	I want to say a word on personal income tax, because last 
Friday we learned something which nearly went unnoticed and 
which is almost outrageous. Revenue Canada employees 
complain about political interference when auditing 
corporations. Last Friday, I raised this issue in the House. The 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Revenue said that 
there was no concrete evidence justifying an inquiry. I am sorry, 
but 300 persons filled out a questionnaire.
<P>
	As you know, when a survey is conducted by sending out a 
questionnaire, there is always a space for comments at the end. 
People usually do not fill out that part. They just quickly answer 
the multiple-choice questions. However, in that case, 300 
people out of 4,000 filled out that part of the questionnaire. 
Three hundred people bothered to make comments. More than 
that in fact, but 300 complained about political interference 
when auditing some company files. This is really serious.
<P>
	Of course, you may think this was the case only under the 
previous Conservative government. But how do you know it is 
not also occurring under the government opposite? After all, 
once the Liberals and the Conservatives find themselves on the 
other side of the House, their policies are pretty similar. In fact, 
they are quite similar, and that is a real concern.
<P>
	We also referred to the GST. I was not going to discuss this 
tax, but I have to do it. I am not sure that Canadians and 
Quebecers fully understand the commitment made by the 
Liberal Party during the election campaign. The Liberals said 
they would eliminate the GST, but they also whispered that they 
would replace it with something else. That was mentioned in the 
following paragraph. I am not sure how people reacted. 
However, I can honestly tell you that residents in my riding did 
not believe the Liberal Party. They felt that the Liberals would 
somehow take the same amount of money from their pockets. 
Whether the Liberals were going to change the name or the 
structure of that tax, people were reluctant to trust them.
<P>
	I will not get in to what is being done in committee. I am a 
member of the committee, so I know perfectly well what is 
happening there, but I must say I am concerned. We get the 
impression that the expanding underground economy is 
connected only with the coming into effect of the GST, but it is 
far more complicated than that, and just reforming the tax is not 
going to restore confidence, especially since the objective is 
quite clear. The instructions of the Minister of Finance are to 
find an alternative that will produce as much revenue: $15 
billion. The rates may be different on certain products but on the 
whole, the objective is still to take another $15 billion out of 
taxpayers' pockets. How do you expect the consumer to 
perceive this as a major and effective reform? I agree that in the 
case of businesses, there are a lot of things that can be done to 
simplify the system, which would bring costs down, and 
consumers would benefit to some extent.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	However, they are certainly not going to reduce operating 
costs by $15 billion. That does not make sense. The cost of 
administering the tax, which is very high, is around $600 
million.
<P>
	A number of Liberal members tend to confuse the issue when 
they talk about GST administration costs. Now, I do not 
necessarily want to defend this tax, but I would like to explain 
what we are talking about here. The total revenue is around $29 
billion, but businesses are entitled to claim an input tax credit, 
which is quite common in the case of a value-added tax. If we 
take away the cost of input tax credits for businesses, not a tax 
that must be paid but a refund, and we subtract as well the tax 
credits for low income individuals, we have $15 billion left.
<P>
	It is simple mathematics. A number of government members 
are saying it costs 50 per cent to run the system and to get a 
dollar you have to spend 50 cents, but that is just not true. It 
costs $600 million to run the system, and their calculations are 
all wrong.
<P>
	It is still too much, of course. However, with this political 
rhetoric, they are just spreading rumours. This is irresponsible, 
and they should take the trouble to check their facts.
<P>
	So what is the answer? I see I have only five minutes left, but I 
could talk all day about taxation and tax reform.
<P>
	We must start with a comprehensive evaluation of all tax 
expenditures. Consider what they were used for and what the 
objectives were. Were those objectives met? The department 
publishes information on tax expenditures connected with 
individual and corporate income tax. When we read this 
information, we see that a number of data are not available. In 
the report published this year, the latest year available is 1991, 
and a number of data are still not available. Is it because they 
were not calculated or evaluated? I agree in some cases it is very 
difficult, but in other cases, it is definitely quite feasible.
<P>
	Is it because they don't want to reveal this information? Is that 
what the Liberal government and the Minister of Finance mean 
when they talk about transparency and profess to be very 
staunch advocates of government transparency? I am not 
certain, but I hope not. I hope they plan to produce reports that 
are far more serious. We can give them the benefit of the doubt, 
since they had only recently been elected. Perhaps this reflects a 
tendency on the part of this government, but in any case, we will 
no longer accept publications such as this one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3806"> 3806 </A></B>
<P>
	There are two sides to a balance sheet, the revenue side and 
the expenditure side. Regardless of the measures taken to 
improve the fairness of the tax system and the way in which 
revenues are collected, we cannot forget that there is a serious 
problem on the expenditure side. Revenues are collected to 
cover expenditures, but these expenditures are exorbitant. 
Consumers, who are also voters, view a number of these 
expenditures as wasteful, and rightly so. The first step toward 
significantly reducing government spending is to eliminate this 
waste.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has told us that it is the responsibility of 
committees to review spending item by item. The members on 
this side of the House are not afraid of this task and are ready to 
take a go at it. I am happy to see that Reform members are also 
willing to take on this task. However, when we introduced a 
motion calling on committees to have the responsible ministers 
testify, only two of the fourteen committees agreed to the 
motion. Two out of fourteen! Another shining example of the 
Liberal's brand of transparency!
<P>
	There is the Minister of Finance, although this is not the 
biggest operating budget, and there is also the Minister of 
Human Resources Development who manages a fairly large 
budget. But does he intend to testify? It is almost scandalous.
<P>
	Before concluding, I would like to mention a number of areas 
on which we are prepared to concentrate our efforts. Mention 
was made of family trusts. I know that one of my colleagues will 
be speaking about this issue later and that my colleague from 
Rosemont spoke about it earlier. There is also the matter of a 
minimum corporate tax. We currently have a capital tax which is 
a form of minimum tax. However, since it is possible to reduce 
the tax level to zero, this is not a real minimum tax.
<P>
	The year 1987 is notorious for a figure now making the rounds 
in Canada. That year, a number of corporations earned $27 
billion in profits without paying a penny in taxes. That is a 
shocking statistic. The public is hard-pressed to believe that the 
tax system is fair when it hears statistics like these.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Also scandalous are tax havens, the tax treaties signed with 
other countries that allow people to evade the tax system to 
some extent. These were repeatedly denounced by the Auditor 
General. We will be looking into it shortly at the Finance 
Committee and I hope the minister will give us clear indications 
on what he intends to do.
<P>
	The measures announced in the budget are clearly insufficient 
and will not solve the problem. We have to review all tax treaties 
and put into place a truly operative minimum income tax 
system. One such system was introduced in the United States by 
Ronald Reagan, who is hardly the greatest socialist in the 
history of mankind. Why could we not do the same thing here? 
In terms of corporate tax, the situation is much better in Canada 
than in other countries.
<P>
	So, there is food for serious thought here and I would like to 
draw this parallel with the GST before closing, Madam Speaker. 
When the tax on business inputs was removed, who gained from 
the introduction of the GST? The businesses with inputs on 
which the tax was removed.
<P>
	Since my time has run out, Madam Speaker, I will simply tell 
you that we have been in favour of a tax system reform for a long 
time and are prepared to work at that. The government should 
act responsibly and, in the year to come, the days to come, it will 
have to put something on the table so that we can start real 
discussions and find real solutions to a problem perceived as 
very serious by consumers and voters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to compliment the hon. member for Témiscamingue for a 
very good presentation. I feel he has made some very good 
points, especially his suggestion-the most important of all and 
I implore the government to listen to it-which is to look at all 
the options.
<P>
	On his point of progressivity, he was worried and concerned, 
as previous members have expressed, that a flat tax might enter 
into that territory and make it regressive. As an economist I 
would think he has read about Albert Laffer, an American 
economist, and the Laffer curve-not like a joke. The answer to 
progressivity is that currently within our system we have all 
these loopholes. We have different segments of taxation at the 
high end, different incentives, various rates and the graduated 
taxes. Therefore our tax rates have to be high to get the same 
amount of money.
<P>
	Where lower in the curve, by having no tax loopholes and no 
exemptions, the kind that you need down here-I am not talking 
about personal deductions-you generate the same amount of 
money. As the hon. member for Témiscamingue would like to 
have fairness and equity, that is where the equity would come 
back in. It eliminates a lot of the rules, addressing his specific 
point on flow-through shares and how the lack of deductibility 
or the lack of incentive to invest would impact negatively in his 
riding.
<P>
	An individual currently at the high end who makes these 
investments, who is obviously in the upper middle or upper 
income, is taxed at the 50 per cent rate. If their taxes were 
reduced to 15 per cent of income and they had 85 per cent of 
disposable income they could still make that investment in their 
ridings. The corporation, after it made its profit, could give a 
return on investment to that individual through dividends 
taxable to the individual. With the change you would have to 
make, the corporation would be able to deduct that dividend. 
The key to it all is with the corporation. The high marginal tax 
rate for corporations after they use up the first $200,000 of 
taxable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3807"> 3807 </A></B>
<P>
income which is tax free or taxed at a lower rate is 50 per cent. 
You could lower that tax rate  for a corporation from 50 per cent 
down to 15 per cent as well.
<P>
	The principle of our taxation system is that if you give a 
deduction that somebody has to pay the tax on it is eliminated. It 
takes it out of the Laffer curve and brings you back down and 
now you are treating dollars with more respect. You are treating 
real dollars and governments can then focus on just generating 
the revenue they need to pay for the social and economic 
programs that they have, subsidies, whatever it may be because 
you do need those. You are dealing with true dollars, after tax 
dollars, instead of this complicated, confusing abomination.
<P>
	Basically my intervention here is to make a comment on what 
the hon. member had questioned about this system of a single or 
flat tax.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I understand the point made by 
the hon. member for Calgary Centre on progressivity. Just to 
reassure him, when one studies economics, one cannot help but 
hear about such a well-known economist as Mr. Laffer.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We also study his curve, which looks a lot like decreasing 
performance curves based on the same principle. That being 
said, it is still possible to make the system progressive with 
different tax rates.
<P>
	Certainly, an individual with a 50 per cent tax rate can use a 
number of deductions to bring his actual rate down to 30 per 
cent. Except that if the 20 per cent deduction is a productive 
investment in the economy made jointly by the private sector 
and the government, in my opinion, it would be even more 
efficient than if the government did it directly, because it would 
be a private initiative. I would feel reassured by such a system; it 
would be much better than leaving everything up to the private 
sector.
<P>
	One philosophy is fundamentally different, namely the role of 
government in society. I am one of those who believe that the 
government has a duty to intervene. And the tax system enables 
it to pick its targets. In the system favoured by the hon. member 
for Calgary Centre, all sectors are treated equally. His rationale 
is this: Competition will be very healthy because every type of 
business in every sector will face the same competition, will not 
have the advantage of tax incentives, but will be served by the 
government. Which may sound positive.
<P>
	However, as a society, when we want or would like to help 
certain sectors because they are going through temporary 
difficulties, because we want to promote them, or because we 
think they have potential, the tax system does not give us much 
room to manoeuvre. We would need direct subsidies.
<P>
	I am not sure it would really be more efficient than a 
shared-risk formula. But I must say that the current system has 
become so complex, so bogged down, that even the objective of 
coming up with a shared-risk formula between the government 
and the private sector loses some of its efficiency because of that 
very complexity.
<P>
	So I want to reassure the hon. member that I understand his 
point of view. But we may have different philosophies on the 
role of government in society. Since he quoted an economist, I 
can quote him another who may be recognized one day as a 
major success or failure; there is Mr. Keynes, who was in favour 
of major government intervention, and the Keynesian state. It 
may have been too much, but government intervention also had 
a multiplier effect.
<P>
	So for every economist who says one thing we can find 
another who often says the opposite. It is somewhat unfortunate 
as this often gives economists a bad reputation, but economics is 
not an exact science, it is a human science and it is up to us to 
decide which theory we want to favour.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like 
to thank the hon. member for his comments.
<P>
	We are discussing tax policy today and some of that gets fairly 
dry after a while. I would like to focus on the aspect of what tax 
policy means in a country like Canada. As the member 
suggested, I was preparing my tax return just yesterday as well, 
unfortunately having waited to the last minute.
<P>
	When I was preparing my return, I was focusing on the fact 
that everybody else in this country was doing the same thing, 
that people who have problems with child care expenses and so 
forth were the same people in Newfoundland and in British 
Columbia.
<P>
	It is very important for a country to have a focus. It may not be 
a happy one that we have on filing our tax return but still it is a 
focus on what unites us as a nation.
<P>
	I am interested in some of the comments by the member. One 
thing was on some of his statistics on wealth creation and 
concentration in Canada. I heard those very same figures just 
yesterday and I do not believe them either.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could focus on why he would not 
believe in the figures and then build a whole argument based on 
them.
<P>
	He was concerned about simplification in the system and I 
agree that this is one thing we have to do. I do not necessarily 
believe in a flat rate system but I do think we can make it a little 
simpler.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3808"> 3808 </A></B>
<P>
	I note that yesterday people in the province of Quebec had to 
file two tax returns, not just one. I wonder if he would reflect on 
the fact that it is making things complicated for the people of 
Quebec to have to file two tax returns.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a question on harmonization. I note 
that with the GST the province of Quebec attempted to 
harmonize with the GST but not very effectively. I wonder if he 
could focus on his commitment to harmonize the GST in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I give the floor to the 
hon. member for Témiscamingue, who unfortunately has only 
one minute to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I will answer within one minute. 
First, I did not say that I did not believe the figures on which I 
based my argument on the distribution of wealth. On the 
contrary, I believe that they are indicative of the trend. I am not 
sure that they are accurate, but they are indicative of the trend.
<P>
	Now, as for simplification, he mentioned that in Quebec we 
have to complete two income tax returns and pay two taxes. He 
talked about harmonization. On that, I will simply answer him 
that it is the reason we members of the Bloc are here. The way 
we want to simplify is to have only one tax. We do not want to 
have just a federal tax return; on the contrary, we want to have 
just a Quebec tax return. That is the reason we are here; we want 
Quebec to take over and become sovereign. We want Quebec to 
control all these revenues and all these taxes. It is political 
independence and that is the essential role of the Bloc 
Quebecois. So in that sense I think we are very consistent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. I do not 
interrupt the House too frequently but the member suggests that 
the department is not doing work when in fact it is. I would like 
to bring to the attention of the House that the studies referred to 
have been done, and there are several studies on tax 
expenditures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, thank you 
very much for the opportunity to second the motion of my hon. 
colleague from Calgary Centre. The motion before us is very 
straightforward. It asks for a major tax review under the current 
circumstances that we face as Canadians.
<P>
	As has been mentioned by the hon. member for Durham, all of 
us have just faced the rigorous task of doing and redoing our 
income tax for 1993 so we know the problems that are there. 
They are very fresh in our minds as well as in the minds of all 
Canadians. It is very appropriate that we have this motion before 
us today in which we are looking at better ways of utilizing the 
income tax system, better ways to apply excise tax, a  better way 
to apply consumption taxes. The review today is very 
appropriate.
<P>
	There is no way that all of us in the House are going to agree 
on the fact that there may be only one way to do it. There are a 
variety of ways of approaching tax review and tax revisions.
<P>
	What I want to do today in my few moments is look at it under 
the criteria of whether taxation is fair, whether there is 
simplicity, efficiency and effectiveness. In his earlier remarks 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance 
mentioned that the government accepts those principles in 
evaluating the tax system. I would have to accept him and the 
government at their word that they have a criteria and that if 
there are to be revisions, the revisions or the changes in the tax 
policy would be based on those very basic principles.
<P>
	When we look at the taxation system we have to recognize 
that there is no real consensus as to what the problem is. I do not 
believe we have a consensus in Canada nor will we have in this 
assembly here today as to what the solution is. I think we must 
look first of all at what the problem may be.
<P>
	I believe that the problem stems from the overspending of 
governments. That is the first major problem that we must deal 
with. No matter how we collect the taxes, it is very frustrating 
when Canadians say that we as legislators and leaders waste the 
money that they give to us. We have to deal first with the 
problem of overspending. The major question before this 
assembly is how it should be done.
<P>
	Canadians are certainly overtaxed. They believe they are no 
longer receiving value for their tax dollars, and Canadians are 
certainly correct on that premise. It is very obvious when we 
look at the current circumstances and the finances of this 
country. For every dollar that Canadians send to Ottawa, and this 
is on the downscale rather than the upscale, 65 cents is applied to 
government program spending, programs for Canadians.
<P>
	Why is that happening? We have a $500 billion plus debt 
facing us.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, in the current budget $41 billion is being applied to 
interest payments which do nothing in terms of productivity or 
helping people in Canada with regard to health programs, social 
programs, transportation programs or whatever they may be. 
The interest payment takes away access to the positive use of a 
tax dollar.
<P>
	In terms of the government's plan we also face another $100 
billion of debt in the next two to three fiscal years being added to 
the current $500 billion debt. This means that of the tax dollar, 
the $1 that comes to Ottawa, the amount available for programs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3809"> 3809 </A></B>
<P>
will certainly be less than 65 cents. It will most likely approach a 
60-cent dollar to run our country. That is not good enough.
<P>
	The point I want to make is that there cannot be effective tax 
reform without effective expenditure reform and dealing with 
the debt and the deficit of the country. This is not to say that GST 
and tax reform are not necessary. I only wish to point out the 
futility in trying to fix the tax system without reigning in the 
spending of governments.
<P>
	Let me deal with defining a fair tax system. That will be the 
thrust of my remarks today. How do we put together a fair tax 
system? I will list six points which I feel are relevant.
<P>
	The first is equity. A fair tax system implies equity. Equity 
implies that Canadians feel that all taxpayers are sharing equally 
in the tax burden. Any redesign of a tax system must distribute 
the burden of tax equality among Canadians.
<P>
	The second is punishing success. A fair tax system does not 
punish success. Equity demands that Canadians be allowed to 
keep the rewards for working harder, for working smarter and 
for being successful. This component of tax reform is often 
overlooked. It is often an area wherein those putting together tax 
policy say that a person is earning a lot and let us take it away 
from him or her. It is not fair. By overtaxing the monetary 
rewards of success the incentive for Canadians to invest in a 
future for Canada is removed. We rob ourselves by punishing 
success through the taxation system in this land of ours.
<P>
	The third is dealing with the less fortunate. What should a tax 
policy do there? A fair tax system does not punish the 
unfortunate in our society. A tax system that overtaxes those 
who cannot defend themselves is a double hit on the less 
fortunate in our society.
<P>
	The fourth is a point that is often made. I know it has been 
made many times in this assembly. There is only one taxpayer. 
On that basis I make two points. First, we must recognize that 
taxation of businesses eventually falls on individuals. It does so 
through lower wages, higher prices, reduced dividends and an 
internationally uncompetitive industrial base. While I am not 
advocating the elimination of taxes on all businesses, we should 
recognize that a corporation of any size does not bear the burden 
of these taxes as is often assumed. These taxes are borne by one 
taxpayer or individual Canadians.
<P>
	The second way our tax system must recognize that there is 
only one taxpayer is with respect to provincial and federal 
powers of taxation. The current overlap of consumption taxation 
means that Canadians face 10 different sales taxes. This 
increases the cost of doing business and overly complicates the 
tax system.
<P>
	Last I want to deal with what I call economic choices. A fair 
tax system does not bias the economic choices of taxpayers. 
Through special cases and exceptions the current tax system 
discriminates against certain activities and promotes others. 
Canadians more than ever before are recognizing their activities 
to avoid tax. This is what we mean when we talk about a tax 
revolt.
<P>
	The tax system should not be a mechanism for a large range of 
public policy initiatives. My hon. colleague from Calgary 
Centre covered this point earlier.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	These public policies are often designed with all the best 
intentions. They often result in the reorganization of economic 
activity in a way in which they were not intended in the first 
place. When this is done, the true cost of policy is difficult to 
determine and the reorganization of economic activity creates 
negative and unintended consequences.
<P>
	In the last few moments I have I want to raise the following 
question. How does our current system stack up? Let us look at 
equity first of all. Canadians do not feel that everybody is paying 
their share. Second, in punishing success, our current system 
punishes success. Third, we now have a tax system with a 
marginal tax rate that at many points exceeds 50 per cent, the 
percentage believed to have a disincentive effect to earn more. 
The economic effect of this damaging policy is nearly 
impossible to measure as it must measure what Canadians are 
not doing but could be doing under a better and fairer tax system. 
The fourth point is punishing the less fortunate. Today many 
people are paying taxes with incomes of $7,000. Last I would 
make the point with regard to complication. It is clear that a 
current tax system is complicated with the many forms of tax 
that are before Canadians. What is the solution?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but the hon. 
member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the 
member for his comments. I will comment on possibly two 
aspects.
<P>
	First he talked about punishing success. I note the income tax 
system currently has approximately three rates: for those 
incomes under $25,000, $65,000 and over $65,000. Over 
$65,000 it hits roughly 45 per cent. Depending on what 
provinces do it could get up to 51 per cent.
<P>
	That system has been in existence in Canada for 10 or 15 
years. The rates on higher incomes have been higher in the past 
than they are today. I have not seen a whole outflow of people 
leaving the country because of this policy. Could the member 
comment on that aspect?
<P>
	The second one is the comment about the delivery system. We 
are using the income tax system to deliver social policy or 
whatever. Could the member comment on what is a successful 
system to deliver social benefits? I think of child care expenses, 
GST rebates and so forth. It seems to me that if we want to 
simplify government maybe we should be focusing on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3810"> 3810 </A></B>
<P>
income tax system as a method of delivery. Could the member 
talk about that aspect?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, with regard to 
the first point in terms of what is fair and what does not act as a 
deterrent to persons investing, taking risks, being successful and 
encouraging success, in a sense that is what creates our 
economy, when a tax system does that and does not act as a 
detriment to investment.
<P>
	To stand and say that I could judge what the rates should be 
and whether the three rates we have in place today are fair or not 
would be difficult. The point I wanted to make in my 
presentation was that the cost of government today is too high. 
People, no matter where they are, whether they are in business, 
private individuals, in labour or whatever, are paying a rate of 
taxation up front in many cases of 25 per cent as wage earners. 
They are paying 25 per cent. They are sending it to Ottawa 
through their income tax forms. That is too much. We are taking 
away too much from people that they could use for their own 
personal reasons. That is a deterrent.
<P>
	The only way we are going to deal with that is to bring the cost 
of government down. That is the whole thrust of the objectives 
of the Reform Party. We must bring the cost of government 
down so that there is more money in the hands of the people. 
That is the point I make there.
<P>
	The next point is with regard to using the Income Tax Act or 
other tax policy for social purposes. I have found in my travels 
and in the hearings of the finance committee on the GST that 
every time we tried to use the tax system for social policy it 
created inequities. For example, when we were in Quebec City a 
professional group made a presentation to us and said: ``We are 
not exempt from GST''. Another professional group that 
appeared before the committee prior to that one had said it was 
exempt. Which professional organization should have had the 
exemption and which should not have? We could go down the 
line and find other social organizations. Some are exempt from 
GST and some are not. The tax is applied unfairly.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Social policy initiatives should go through the budget 
process. In this assembly we should determine what types of 
benefits we will pay to which group, make it an expenditure 
program as such and deal with it directly rather than indirectly 
through the tax system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on the need for simplification of the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act was introduced in 1917. As we all 
remember it was to be a temporary tax to pay for the first world 
war. At that point Canadians had an obligation to defend 
democracy and freedom around the world. In order to do so they 
introduced a tax which they called the income tax. It was to help 
pay for the war but it was only to be a temporary situation. After 
the war when things were back to normal the tax would be 
eliminated. That was 77 years ago. The war has been over for 75 
years and we still have the tax.
<P>
	There are basically two things in the world we can count on: 
one is death and the other is taxes. The bad news is that death 
comes but once and taxes every year.
<P>
	Back in 1986 the government at the time suggested that it 
would introduce tax reform because taxes were far too complex. 
Back in those days we had 10 different categories or 10 different 
brackets to reach the maximum marginal rate of income tax. The 
government said that it would reduce those 10 brackets to 3 
brackets and that the taxes would be much simpler because it 
eliminated 7 different categories or brackets of increasing levels 
of taxation.
<P>
	It did not say that it would leave the top bracket where it was 
and take a bit off the people at the bottom or that the middle class 
would get a bit of a break which the government would recoup 
later. It called that tax simplification or tax reform.
<P>
	I have here the 22nd edition of the Income Tax Act published 
in August 1993, all 2,091 pages. I am an accountant. This may 
make sense to a layman, but as an accountant I have a hard time 
dealing with the complexity of the Income Tax Act. There are 
statements and sentences that go on for hundreds of words 
without a period to indicate the end of a sentence. The 
complexity and the meaning of the Income Tax Act test the 
abilities of the wisest, the most intelligent and the most expert in 
the country.
<P>
	I sit on the public accounts committee. We were examining 
people from the Department of National Revenue and the 
Department of Finance regarding a loss to taxpayers of $1.1 
billion that was pointed out by the Auditor General because the 
government that wrote the legislation could not understand the 
meaning of its own words. The resource sector disagreed with 
the interpretation of the words. It ended up in court. The 
government lost. The resource sector won. Taxpayers are out 
$1.1 billion because of the complexity of trying to define the 
true meaning of one simple clause in the Income Tax Act. All 
2,091 pages of the act give some idea of the complexity.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	Capital gains was introduced back in 1971 by the Liberal 
government at that time. It was deemed to be a tax on increasing 
wealth. However at that point in time this country was at the 
threshold of a decade of tremendous inflation. Capital gains in 
essence became a tax on inflation.
<P>
	Capital gains was not a tax on increasing wealth but a tax on 
inflation and the government knew that. It knew people were not 
getting richer. If you bought a house in 1971 for $25,000 and 
sold it for $100,000 in 1981, the actual value of your wealth may 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3811"> 3811 </A></B>
<P>
not have gone up, but in terms of actual dollars it went up 
significantly. The government said: ``You have to pay a large 
part of that in tax''. It was a tax on inflation, not on wealth 
creation.
<P>
	Along came the Tory government which said: ``We would like 
to give our friends a break''. So the Tories brought in the capital 
gains exemption saying it was going to be phased in over a 
number of years. They envisaged that the first half a million 
dollars of capital gains was going to be tax free. Remember that 
the average person on the street really does not get the 
opportunity to have half a million dollars in capital gains. 
However the intent was: ``We are going to give it to the taxpayer 
and we are also going to segregate it into things such as the 
capital gains exemption for farmers''. They were going to be 
different.
<P>
	As time went on the government realized it could not afford 
this measure it was introducing so it capped the capital gains 
exemption at $100,000 but said: ``Wait a minute. We are going 
to add some complexity to this. What about the farmer and his 
half a million capital gains exemption? Is he going to get both?'' 
No, he can only get one, half a million dollars.
<P>
	As one accountant explained it to me, we are going to have 
two buckets. There will be a big bucket for the farmers which 
will hold half a million dollars capital gains exemption. Inside 
that big bucket will be a small bucket which contains the 
$100,000 capital gains exemption. When the small bucket runs 
over then that of course is subtracted from the large bucket.
<P>
	The concepts being put forward belie the comprehension of 
the average person on the street. When someone does not 
understand the tax he is paying, how do we expect him to pay it 
voluntarily and willingly in a democratic society? This is why 
we are finding that coercion and pressure are becoming more 
and more the order of the day. That statement has come right 
from the Minister of National Revenue who has said he will not 
tolerate people who evade taxes and so on. Yet the people on the 
street cannot understand the tax they are being asked to pay.
<P>
	This government has to listen. When people fill in their tax 
returns they write the cheque saying: ``I am mad at the 
government. I don't know why I have to pay all this amount of 
money. My accountant says I have to pay it but I don't 
understand it. I feel I pay far too much and I am being ripped 
off''. We have a problem. This government has to explain to 
taxpayers how the taxes are arrived at. Having 2,091 pages of 
small print is not the way to go about it.
<P>
	We have seen complexity added to the Income Tax Act as a 
kind of smoke and mirrors attitude to collect more taxes. Ten 
years ago the government introduced limitations on the Canada 
savings bond accrual.
<P>
	Canada savings bonds are a Canadian institution. We have 
been buying them since the war to help the government fund its 
debt. Some people bought the compound interest bonds. They 
keep them for seven years, cash them in and get all the interest at 
once. Maybe that was their plan, with the high income they 
would keep them until maturity when they retired. The 
government said: ``No, you cannot do that. You have to report 
the interest at least every three years''.
<P>
	As an accountant filling out income tax returns many times I 
had to tell people who had compound Canada savings bonds that 
they cashed in at maturity: ``Wait a minute, you should have 
reported this three years ago''. They said: ``Well nobody told 
me''. The Bank of Canada knew these people were holding 
compound bonds but it did not tell them they had to pay taxes.
<P>
	When we finally make the adjustment we have to go back 
three years. The government says: ``Fine, thank you very much 
and here is the interest owing because you are three years late in 
reporting''. Is that the way for government to endear itself to the 
taxpayers?
<P>
	I could go on. Time after time after time there is unneeded 
complexity which is useless and is there to basically generate 
more revenue through penalties, interest and other maintenance 
for the government. It feels that the taxpayer can be squeezed 
unceasingly.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	My time is up. I could go on, but I think I have given some 
indication that reform is long overdue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I do 
not have a question. I will begin on debate but I believe there is 
another member who might have a question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his comments. We seem to be talking about 
simplicity, making the system simple. Like him, as an 
accountant preparing tax returns over the years it has been my 
observation that the problem with the system is not that it is 
complex. The real problem is that we keep changing it every 
year. The complexity and the reason people do not understand it 
is that it changes year after year. The reality is we should stop 
fiddling with it.
<P>
	Could the hon. member comment on why he wants to 
continually fiddle with the system and make it more complex so 
that people will not understand it next year either?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, I understand the member's 
point that we should stop fiddling with it. However I say ask the 
taxpayer on the street how we arrive at the amount of taxes due 
by him and he will say he does not know. We add up the income, 
take a percentage, and that is what is due. That was the old way 
of doing income taxes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3812"> 3812 </A></B>
<P>
	Many of my former clients ask me why it has to be this 
complex when 40 years ago it was a dead simple one page form. 
We have added and added complexity. Today we cannot get by 
without our computers. Even as an accountant I have to rely on a 
computer to do the complex forms because I feel it is more 
accurate than trying to figure it out myself.
<P>
	The time people have to spend even trying to get their minds 
around complex issues like the cumulative net investment 
losses. That is where a loss which may have been claimed five 
years ago comes back to hit you with a bill for interest because 
you had forgotten that you claimed for a deduction five years 
ago and it now affects your taxes payable this year.
<P>
	There is no need for that. It used to be that your income this 
year was what you reported and that was it. Now we have RRSPs 
that have a multiyear basis, capital gains for a multiyear basis, 
cumulative net investment losses on a multiyear basis, and on 
and on and on.
<P>
	There seems to be no end to the opportunities the government 
takes to add complexity rather than simplicity to the tax return.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I have been listening with great interest and following the 
direction of the debate. It appears the Reform argument is 
coming from two possible areas. One is that we should have a 
very simple income tax form which I certainly agree with, but 
also that social policy measures should not be part of our income 
tax system.
<P>
	If I were to go back to my constituents they would be appalled 
to learn the Reform Party is advocating banishing registered 
retirement savings plans. So many Canadians find this as the 
only way they can contribute toward their retirement years.
<P>
	If you look at a registered retirement savings plan, as has 
already been noted, there is some complexity with it. If we did 
not have them on our forms it would indeed be a very simple 
form to fill out. It is clearly a direct social policy measure that 
the Canadian government is looking at helping Canadians save 
for their retirement.
<P>
	I am appalled and I think my constituents would be appalled 
that the Reform Party is advocating something like this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Madam Speaker, let me put the matter 
straight. Is anybody in the Reform Party advocating that we 
eliminate RRSPs?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Does the 
hon. parliamentary secretary have the unanimous consent of the 
House to move the motion?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to obtain some information.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I give the 
floor to the hon. member for Roberval.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, normally, 48 
hours must pass between report stage and third reading, since 
amendments are not acceptable less than 48 hours before.
<P>
	I would just like to make sure that if there are only 24 hours 
between report stage and third reading, the opposition's 
amendments would be in order if presented 24 hours in advance. 
It is just to make sure that the time provisions of our Standing 
Orders would of course apply to this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Madam Speaker, of course, when amendments 
are moved by any member in the House on this bill, they are 
considered by the Chair and the Speaker will decide at the 
beginning of the debate at report stage.
<P>
	Regrettably, with this motion, we specified that the debate 
would begin 48 hours after the report, but we will have only 80
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3813"> 3813 </A></B>
<P>
hours. So it will be a little harder for the Chair and also for 
members, but that is the arrangement we made.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The report from the committee will be received on May 25 
and the debate will start on May 26. We have arranged for the 
debate to start on that day.
<P>
	Those days have been designated because they are long days 
in order to give the opposition every opportunity to debate this 
bill on a reasonable basis. We could have the debate on a Friday 
but it is a short day. In order to lengthen the opportunities for the 
opposition, we have agreed to have the debate on the Thursday 
and Monday instead. That is the reason we have shortened the 
notice period for the report stage. However I think it is a 
reasonable compromise and that is the reason for it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
be sure that I understood correctly. It is not to create problems; 
on the contrary, it is to avoid them. I did not quite get what the 
hon. member was trying to convey to me, so I would ask him the 
question again.
<P>
	Since there is only one day between consideration in 
committee and report stage, we would then leave it to the 
Speaker to decide whether or not he accepts the amendments 
presented. Accepting the motion as is without specifying 
whether amendments would be in order would mean that 
throughout the last day of the committee's work-I believe that 
I just said report stage and third reading; sorry, I meant that there 
would only be one day between committee stage and report 
stage. This means that no amendment would be acceptable on 
the last day, which would be basically contrary to the spirit of 
the rules of procedure of parliamentary committees.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The standing orders would require that the 
notice of the amendments be given on the day after the report. So 
the report will be received on May 25 and presented in the House 
during Routine Proceedings that day. Obviously the notice of the 
amendments would have to be given before six o'clock that day 
to be considered the next day. Normally you have an extra day.
<P>
	The Chair will have the amendments by six o'clock and will 
be able to work on its ruling overnight and communicate with 
the parties. If there are a lot of amendments it may mean an 
all-night work session for the Chair.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I am appreciative of having the 
opportunity to participate in this debate because it is an issue 
very near and dear to my heart. It is an issue that is near and dear 
to the heart of every member of Parliament. You cannot be in 
public service today without hearing from your constituents that 
they are frustrated with the current tax act of Canada.
<P>
	When you test a tax system it should stand up to three basic 
criteria. First, is it simple enough that the person on the street 
who basically has to be responsible for participating in the tax 
system can understand it? On simplicity the tax act of Canada 
fails.
<P>
	Second, on fairness we have heard time and time again of 
examples within the tax act where people who are making 
millions of dollars a year are not paying anything and people in 
the lower income spectrum, sometimes under $50,000, paying 
more than multimillionaires. When it comes to the test of 
fairness, it does not pass the test of fairness either.
<P>
	When you talk about the third criteria, efficiency, my 
goodness when it comes to efficiency there is no one in this 
country who would stand up and say that the current tax act is an 
efficient system.
<P>
	I must start off by reminding everyone in this House that the 
Prime Minister during the last election led the debate on tax 
reform. He led the debate. He said it in the red book. He came to 
Toronto on more than one occasion. I can vividly remember in 
the control room of CFRB when they confronted him on the 
issue of tax reform. The Prime Minister, then the Leader of the 
Opposition, said our government will be committed to 
comprehensive tax reform and it will have to meet the tests of 
simplicity, fairness, and of course efficiency.
<P>
	We have been in office for just six months and we have started 
the process of addressing comprehensive tax reform. I believe 
the finance committee has done a terrific job going across the 
country and listening to all the different ideas that were 
presented.
<P>
	The previous government moved arbitrarily on the GST, 
without proper consultation, and it ended up getting us all in a 
mess. It ended up fracturing the confidence of Canadians. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3814"> 3814 </A></B>
<P>
destroyed a good part of our retail industry, not to mention that it 
exacerbated an underground economy beyond our ability to 
calculate  right now. The underground economy it is said could 
be as high as $30 billion to $40 billion.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I say to the members of the Reform Party that they are not 
alone in their quest for comprehensive tax reform. All of us on 
this side of the House are on the same pathway as they. I have to 
caution them, and I say this humbly to the members of the 
Reform Party, that it is not easy to reform the tax act of Canada.
<P>
	I believe that I can say that from a bit of experience. I began 
this journey on tax reform four and a half years ago when the 
Prime Minister of Canada at that time, Prime Minister 
Mulroney, and Michael Wilson would stand up on this side of 
the House and when we would criticize the GST they would say: 
``Come up with an alternative. Don't just criticize it. Come up 
with an alternative''. A group of us got together and said: ``This 
is going to be an interesting exercise''. We came up with this 
idea called the single tax system.
<P>
	I want to spend a couple of minutes explaining why we called 
it the single tax rather than the flat tax. I think it is very 
important to understand this point. I believe it is essential in 
advancing comprehensive tax reform further down the path.
<P>
	For years there has been an attempt to reform the tax system. 
The number one alternative for debate was called the flat tax. 
The problem with the flat tax system was that the proponents 
never took into account the constituencies that needed to be 
addressed when it came to progressivity. In other words, and I 
am not suggesting the Reform Party is doing this because I have 
listened carefully to their speeches, the flat taxers tended to say: 
``No credits for seniors, no credits for families with children, no 
credits for charitable donations, to heck with the RRSPs''. The 
flat tax system developed a very bad name. It was: ``Here is the 
gross revenue. You have one single credit and then after that you 
are 20 per cent, over and out''.
<P>
	The seniors in our community, families with children and 
charitable organizations, the most disadvantaged in our 
community who we should care about the most, started to look at 
the flat tax and said: ``The social side of the equation is being 
ignored in the flat tax system''. Regrettably the flat tax got a 
very bad name. The biggest slam against the flat tax was it was 
not progressive.
<P>
	A group of us who were dealing with this problem and doing 
the research said: ``We can't go with that name because if we are 
going to get acceptance we have to design in the tax form credits 
that will make sure that those people who are most 
disadvantaged in our society are looked after right up front''. We 
came around to this name called the single tax, a single rate of 
tax, corporate and personal.
<P>
	We designed the personal side of the form. I am sure many 
members have seen this form. It is a relic now because it is draft 
two which was done in about April 1989. We are now at draft 19. 
In five years seven or eight of us have been listening to 
thousands and thousands of Canadians, probably about 100,000 
Canadians over five years who gave us advice and input on how 
we could refine it. I only bring this point out that it took five 
years because most of those points that people made were good 
points. It taught me a big lesson.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Even though I wanted to come in in one year or two years and 
reform the tax system, I realized that a package this complex 
could not be done overnight. Believe me, I am not being 
defensive. I still support the idea of a single tax. One cannot just 
do it. It is not like putting something in the microwave and 20 
seconds later, it is there, ready to go.
<P>
	Going back to the personal side of the single tax, we started 
off with the following premise. We must for starters make sure 
families with children are recognized in the single tax. 
Therefore they must have a credit. We then said that the seniors 
need to feel comfortable with this tax act, therefore they need to 
have a line in the tax act and a credit.
<P>
	Another line that we put in the credit was for charitable 
donations. I want to tell members that that 1 per cent line for 
charitable donations is essential. When we did our early 
research on this issue we called Drs. Hall and Rabushka from the 
Hoover Institute at Stanford. They said to us: ``Do not make the 
mistake, Dennis, that we made when we started. We scrubbed 
the charitable donations line. We said no more charitable 
deductions''.
<P>
	They told us that the charitable organizations went to their 
local politicians and went to the press and they were such a force 
that they condemned the system even before it got out of the 
gate.
<P>
	One has to have a line in one's tax act for charitable donations. 
One can cap it, but one must be generous because ultimately one 
is going to need those constituencies supporting the system if 
you are going to pull it off.
<P>
	Then we said that we cannot do away with the RRSP structure. 
The RRSP structure is almost a part of our fiscal framework. We 
put that in the act but we capped it. Of course there was the basic 
deduction.
<P>
	After all, there are those deductions or those progressive 
credits. I want to put the emphasis on progressive because the 
biggest criticism of this project is that it is not progressive 
enough. One can design progressivity into the act or into the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3815"> 3815 </A></B>
<P>
card. At any rate after those progressive features were designed, 
we told them that after their basic income and those deductions 
they could take a single rate of 20 per cent.
<P>
	On the corporate side, because one needed to have a fully 
integrated system, we said that there should be a very 
progressive credit for small business on the first $50,000, no 
tax. After that, it is their basic corporate expenditures and after 
those corporate expenditures and their basic depreciation is put 
in place, there is a single rate there as well.
<P>
	That is the direction that we have been working on. We 
believed that would accomplish a number of goals. The most 
important thing is simplicity. I think very few people would 
argue that this system is not simple. There it is. One can see it. 
One can fill it out. It is very straightforward.
<P>
	The next most important thing is to make it doable and that is 
the challenge that we have in this Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	There are difficulties in moving a tax system that primarily 
ran and to this day runs the economy of Canada and now we are 
saying, those of us who support this type of idea, that we want to 
stop running the economy of Canada through the tax act. We 
basically want to make it a tax collection unit; no more 
preferences, no more loopholes, flush them all out with those 
exceptions that I mentioned for seniors, families with children 
and charities.
<P>
	I have to say to the Reform Party that the transition from the 
current system that we are in to a single tax system is really the 
debate that we have to engage in because that transition period is 
the real challenge.
<P>
	I do not believe the challenge is one of whether or not we are 
going to generate enough revenue because right now the current 
tax system is so flawed that some experts say the underground 
economy is over $40 billion or $50 billion and growing. The 
notion of a simple, fair tax system is reinforced by the 
underground economy right now.
<P>
	There is another factor and it is called having a globally 
competitive tax system and I do not believe we have been 
talking about that issue enough. Our tax system right now is 
driving people not only underground but offshore. In other 
words, our achievers, our entrepreneurs who are creating real 
wealth are starting to leave. Over a million Canadians are in 
California right now and we did a survey and found that many of 
them are there because of our tax act.
<P>
	I believe that one of the reasons we should investigate 
comprehensive tax reform which the Prime Minister and our 
party have supported is that we need to reverse the capital flows. 
We have to design a tax system that causes the capital to flow 
back into our country rather than flow out. The current tax act is 
not doing that very well.
<P>
	People from time to time come to me and ask how I could 
support somebody making $60,000 a year paying 20 per cent and 
someone making $1 million a year paying 20 per cent. Is that not 
unfair, inequitable?
<P>
	For me it is not. There are many others in Canada who believe 
two things. Number one, the harder you work and the more you 
achieve and the more you earn, you should at least be able to 
keep some of it in your pocket. There is another thing. Right now 
there is no guarantee that we are getting anything on the person 
who is making $1 million or $2 million whereas in the single tax 
it is airtight. We are going to get that 20 per cent no matter what, 
including family trusts. 	In other words, under a single tax system all income is in the loop, it is airtight.
<P>
	I suggest that if we had a system like that then those people, 
whether they be scientists or doctors or people who have 
achieved entrepreneurial wealth, rather than being tempted to 
leave would stay. Not only that but we would see other capital 
from around the world coming to our country because we would 
have a competitive tax system, a tax system that respected 
wealth creators, job creators, a tax system that respected people 
who have achieved through their intellect all kinds of scientific 
discoveries.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to say that we on this side of the House support the 
pathway that leads to comprehensive tax reform. However, at 
the same time I want to say as someone who has been engaged in 
this debate for a long time that it is not an easy task. This 
transition period is going to be a very tough period.
<P>
	Let me give an example and let us deal with the energy sector 
right now because many of the Reform members are from 
western Canada and I know that the energy sector is very 
important to their constituents.
<P>
	Right now in the tax act there are billions of dollars of tax 
grants to the energy sector. Under the single tax all of those 
grants or those preferences are gone, eliminated. When a 
company from the province of Alberta that has been used to 
getting these tax deductions, some of which are actually in the 
billions, finds that all of a sudden they are gone, it is a 
tremendous kick to the cash flow of that particular company. It 
is going to come running up to Ottawa or to members in their 
constituency offices saying it is out of business if that tax credit 
is cancelled.
<P>
	Therefore, we are going to have to have a transition period 
because we are going to have to analyse whether that entire tax 
grant should be eliminated.
<P>
	My own view has always been the following. Any grant, 
whether it be a direct grant in a line department or an indirect 
grant through the tax act, should always be linked to the policy 
objective of creating jobs. The problem is that because these tax 
grants are buried in the tax act there is no accountability as to 
whether they are meeting the policy objective.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3816"> 3816 </A></B>
<P>
	I am going to close in 30 seconds. I want to say to the members 
of the Reform Party that we have to make sure when we move 
those grants into the line department we link them to job 
creation. If they do that, where they are transparent and 
accountability, we could have a successful tax act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Madam Speaker, I very 
much enjoyed the speech of the hon. member. In fact, I hope he 
has the ear of the revenue minister and is managing to get some 
of these changes put into effect without too much delay.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will listen to my speech later on today 
about tax saturation because I think that is a point perhaps we 
have reached here in Canada today. Taxes are too high and part 
of the reason is that the spending is far too high.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will admit that is part of the problem. 
I certainly hope that it does not take a debt crisis as it did in New 
Zealand before we can come to grips with this tax situation and 
actually turn it into something fair.
<P>
	I agree with the member regarding the complexity of the 
system. He implied a few times that millionaires do not pay their 
fair share of taxes. I would like to explore that a little. I would 
like to know if the member can give me a list of the reasons or 
ways millionaires do not pay tax other than because of a family 
trust, which he mentioned. I would really be interested to know. 
If millionaires can avoid paying taxes in some way legally then 
those same ways should be available to any average taxpayer in 
this country. If those ways are there I would like to know about 
them because I think I am paying too much tax as well.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could explain the ways 
millionaires escape paying tax.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to begin by saying to the member that in no way, shape or 
form did I mean to cast aspersions on the people who are 
generating great personal wealth in this country. Neither did I 
want to say that they were not paying tax through illegal means.
<P>
	The bottom line is that there are opportunities that exist for 
tax deductions or tax options within the tax act that would allow 
a person with great wealth to reduce that income tax payable.
<P>
	I am not going to get into any specifics today, but I did give an 
example in a recent householder. I will give the one example that 
was actually advertised in a magazine a couple of months ago: 
``Now your income tax dollars can help you invest in a beautiful 
home in the sun''. I am sure members remember that ad: ``This 
investment opportunity is designed to be of maximum tax 
benefit to individuals like you with a total family income of over 
$50,000 per year, Intelevest Group. You can either redirect your 
income tax dollars to help you invest in  luxurious townhouses 
in beautiful Sarasota or you can continue to send all that hard 
earned money to the government in income taxes''.
<P>
	In other words, this is an example of how the tax preferences 
discriminate against those with lower income tax. In other 
words, you would have to be over that amount. It allows a higher 
income earner to use his higher income to participate in this 
luxury townhouse rental income at an after tax cost of zero. That 
is one specific example but there are many others.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to compliment the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood for his statement, his intervention. I 
appreciate very much the way he has laid it out, citing 
simplicity, fairness and efficiency.
<P>
	As I was listening I realized that he talks about the doability of 
it as well. I am pleased to hear the practical thoughts he has. This 
Parliament is not the first Parliament to take a run at tax reform. 
Names like Carter and Macdonald are well known in this 
exercise. As I have read about these other attempts there has 
always been the story of the obstacles that have been placed in 
the way of simplifying the tax system and of reforming it.
<P>
	I was wanting to ask if the hon. member would perhaps outline 
some of the obstacles to tax reform. Who are the vested interests 
that resist reforming the tax system so that it may pass the test of 
simplicity, fairness and efficiency so that it is a doable tax 
system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to deal with the question in two parts.
<P>
	First, naturally there are people who have thought for years, 
on behalf of industry, to put their tax preference or their tax 
loophole or their tax break, whatever you want to call it, into the 
tax act. Those people who have fought for years and worked over 
the Department of Finance for their special privilege are 
defenders of the status quo. They believe in that with the same 
passion as the member would believe in his particular approach.
<P>
	However, I am going to say that the biggest obstacle to tax 
reform in my mind are the people of Canada. The people of 
Canada are not interested in tax reform. They talk about it a lot 
and I know we talk about it. I am somebody who has worked on 
the issue for five years, but when push comes to shove it is not 
the kind of issue that makes people roll up their sleeves and get 
turned on about. I know there are tax groups out there that band 
together and rally from time to time. In relation to the whole, 
Canadians at large, they are a very small number.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	In fairness to the member, my biggest frustration with the 
issue of tax reform in the last five years-and my party has been 
supportive of the issue-is that we cannot seem to get the people 
of Canada charged up and asking for tax reform. They have little 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3817"> 3817 </A></B>
<P>
moments or little flutters when they call about it, but there is no 
real thrust from the people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be 
very brief. I compliment the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood on all the work he has done for the last 
four or five years. We would like that to snowball and not have to 
wait another three or four years before something happens.
<P>
	In defence of his simple, fair and efficient tax system, 
whether we call it a flat tax, a single tax or proportional tax, how 
many more years is he willing to wait before his government 
supports or rejects the proposal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> They are playing 
hardball with me today, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	First let me be very specific. I have always said that the single 
tax is an effort to advance the tax reform debate in a 
constructive, open way. If there are better ideas out there than 
the single tax, I welcome them. In other words if it is 
proportional tax or if the men and women of the finance 
committee come up with some new tax design that is better than 
the single tax, as good as or whatever, I am for it. I do not want to 
be in a position-and the Prime Minister has said he does not 
want to be in that position either-of defending the status quo. 
He said it again yesterday.
<P>
	We must understand that it is most important not to make the 
same mistake the Conservatives made. They came in so quickly 
with this GST that they fractured and tax shocked the people of 
Canada. That set us back 10 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Madam Speaker, my topic 
as it relates to the subject today is that Canada is an exporting 
nation. Our livelihood, our personal incomes depend on exports. 
Our present tax system must be altered to maintain our 
international competitiveness because our national economy 
depends on it.
<P>
	On January 27 I rose and spoke in the House. If I may I would 
like to repeat a small part of what I said then. It was interesting 
that in a recent news article in the <I>Kimberley Bulletin</I> a headline 
read: ``Cominco irked at city tax rate''. The complaint of the 
mining company was that the major industrial tax rate in 
Kimberley was 69 per cent higher than the tax rate in Cranbrook. 
In justifying the position of the city, the mayor of Kimberley 
argued that Cominco taxes were high but said that the tax rate 
was justified. He said that the mining company has had it easy 
on taxes because it did not start paying taxes until 1968 when 
Cominco was incorporated into the city limits. The mayor said: 
``That is when Cominco started shutting down plants and laying 
off people''.
<P>
	I am not criticizing the mayor of Kimberley for his comments. 
I simply cite that quotation as an accurate representation of what 
happens when an industry is taxed. The fact is that when taxes go 
up jobs in an industry decrease.
<P>
	Capital for mining is fleeing Canada. The country of Chile is 
one of the greatest beneficiaries of this flight. It has an effective 
tax rate of 15 per cent. Countries like Mexico and Papua, New 
Guinea have a mining tax rate of 35 per cent. The Philippines 
and even the United States have a tax rate on mining companies 
of 38 per cent, whereas the mining companies in the province of 
British Columbia suffer a mining income tax rate of 50 per cent 
for hard rock mining. In coal mining, although it is hard to 
believe, in four years between 1987 and 1991 the B.C. coal 
industry paid $454 million or almost half a billion in direct taxes 
while net returns to the industry were only $8 million. I say taxes 
kill jobs.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	I am a member of the standing committee on the environment 
of the House of Commons. We are concerned, as we should be, 
about carbon dioxide emissions. The objective is to return CO2 
emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. I support that 
objective. However we must recognize doing that, particularly 
if we do it by taxation, will have a very detrimental effect on the 
electric power industry in Alberta.
<P>
	I represent British Columbia and I have Canada's largest coal 
mine in my constituency. Therefore I am very concerned about 
the informal discussion there has been about green tax and about 
carbon tax. If we use taxation to alter behaviour then we kill our 
ability to be internationally competitive.
<P>
	If we want to change behaviour I suggest we may choose to 
institute penalties. We may choose to institute levies. We may 
choose to institute fines but they should be considered to be as 
revenue neutral as possible. In other words taxation is for the 
purpose of raising revenue. If we manage through green taxes 
and carbon taxes to alter behaviour, having altered the behaviour 
we lose the revenue. It is totally contrary and totally 
counterproductive.
<P>
	Most of my constituents and perhaps a lot of constituents of 
members of the House suffer from the same problem and the 
same concern about the overlapping of all the levies, the 
penalties, the fines and the permits.
<P>
	I have a letter from a business in my constituency which was 
written to the Prime Minister, a company in the business of 
blacktop. In part it reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the past three years, we have kept a record of government permits, 
inspection and controls from different levels of bureaucracy. To everyone's 
astonishment, we were exposed to, hassled or intimidated by 35 different 
government officials all looking for their pound of flesh. Furthermore, if we 
don't take the time from our busy schedule to treat these people as ``all 
important'' we could face costly delays and problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3818"> 3818 </A></B>
<P>
	Being in a smaller constituency businesses have to deal with 
many municipalities. When they do so they come up against city 
engineering which has material specifications, traffic control 
rules and regulations. They also have independent assessments 
with respect to fire department regulations and registration. 
They need a business licence and a municipal licence for 
registration of trucks. That is at the municipal level.
<P>
	At the provincial level these firms have to deal with-and this 
is amazing-the pesticide branch for a permit, pollution control 
branch for a permit, gas inspection for inspection, electrical 
inspection, employment standard branch for an audit, gravel pit 
inspection, safety permit and bond. What is very interesting 
about the gravel pit inspection is that within the provincial 
jurisdiction they have to deal with the mines department and 
with workers' compensation. In certain situations with respect 
to the gravel pit they cannot comply with both sets of 
regulations. Within that single provincial jurisdiction they have 
to work with conflicting regulations: motor carrier inspection, 
dangerous goods inspection, safety inspection, weight 
restriction, over width permits, over height permits, provincial 
sales tax audit and licence, paving branch inspection and 
standards, material inspection branch, workers' compensation 
inspection, workers' compensation audit, pressure vessel 
inspection and permit, fire marshal inspection and regulation, 
and air use permit.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I should mention what struck me as terribly weird was that 
they actually pay for the amount of air they consume. It just goes 
on and on: air use permit, traffic control permit, ICBC licensing 
and regulation, and capital tax.
<P>
	Then there is the overlap of many of these regulations into the 
federal jurisdiction: Canada pension plan rules, regulations and 
audit; UIC rules, regulations and audit; and Revenue Canada 
income tax and corporate tax. Included in that would be 
remission of taxes collected from employees; GST rules, 
regulation and audit; radio licensing and regulations; Public 
Works Canada material supply inspection, electrical inspection, 
mechanical inspection; and finally more inspection and 
regulation under work hazard training.
<P>
	This is indicative of what we are doing to the people of 
Canada. Whether we are talking about individuals or about 
businesses, fundamentally we are regulating these people out of 
existence. We are fining. We are getting permits. We are finding 
all sorts of ways at various government levels to get more and 
more money from people.
<P>
	I suggest as I started that Canada is an exporting nation. Our 
livelihood, our personal incomes depend on exports. Our 
present tax system must be altered to maintain our international 
competitiveness because our national economy depends on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to speak today about reforming the tax 
system. I want to talk today about the tax revolt which has 
started across the country. It has been going on for some years 
but it is becoming more predominant. I am going to cover why 
and how that is.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about why people are angry today about 
taxes, how we got here in the first place, what the government is 
doing about it, and the result which is the tax revolt itself.
<P>
	We often hear people asking: ``How do we own a small 
business in Canada today?'' A lot of people respond by saying: 
``If you want to own a small business in Canada today, buy a 
large one and wait two tax years''. While some find those words 
humorous they are quite discouraging. In fact they are very true 
in most cases.
<P>
	Why are we angry? There are three fundamental reasons. 
First, there is little value in the tax dollar people are getting 
today. They see smaller disposable incomes and increasing 
costs. That is one of the reasons we are angry.
<P>
	Second, people across the country see governments as fat cats 
spending inappropriately, spending well beyond their means. 
Quite frankly that is at all levels of government.
<P>
	The third reason we are angry is that there is only one 
taxpayer. The trouble is that all three levels of government see 
only their perspective in raising taxes. It is like the 
infrastructure program of the federal government. It says it is 
spending only $2 billion, but it is spending $6 billion of 
taxpayers' money. It is $2 billion provincial, $2 billion 
municipal, and $2 billion federal.
<P>
	Taxpayers do not really give two hoots about who is sharing in 
the small packages of dollars. They care about the big package 
and how much it is costing us.
<P>
	How did we get to where we are? This all started with a 
temporary tax measure to support the war spending in 1917.  
Since then all levels of government have the feeling that even 
though there is no war they can get into the pockets of the 
average citizen on virtually everything they can name.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Also, we got here because of incompetence and 
mismanagement. We do not have to go very far to see the 
mismanagement and incompetent spending. I refer to a couple 
of items from ``The Tales of the Tax Trough'' by the National 
Citizens Coalition. It found that we spent $37,363 to study the 
effects of colour in advertising. We also spent $58,000 for an 
examination of what it is like to work for the Dominion grocery 
stores. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3819"> 3819 </A></B>
<P>
spent $21,566 to examine experimental studies of interactive 
gestures.
<P>
	Those kinds of costs go on year after year after year and in the 
same year after year after year governments say they are going 
to make a change. However the taxpayers do not see that; they 
only see more government rhetoric.
<P>
	Another way we got here is because Canadians are passive 
people. We tend to think that governments are going to pull us 
out of this crazy spending, but it never seems to happen.
<P>
	The tax revolt is going to go on. It is going to get larger and 
larger. There are several formal tax revolt structures in place in 
this country. I am going to speak about those in just a second.
<P>
	What has this government done? We have already seen that 
this government has tacked on about $3 billion more in 
expenditures, but it has said that revenues should increase to 
offset that. Governments have played that trick on Canadian 
taxpayers for two generations now.
<P>
	The government promised to spend about $1.5 billion on child 
care, if the economy should rise about 3 per cent. But it says: 
``No, it is not $1.5 billion. It is only $750 million because the 
provinces have to contribute $750 million''. Well, their $750 
million and the federal government's $750 million is $1.5 
billion to the taxpayer. That is what we have to get into our 
minds.
<P>
	The government has closed some bases which was a little 
premature because they are into a one year study. I have said 
before it is like bailing out a sinking ship with a thimble. We owe 
$40 billion. Getting $750 million here and there or $2 million 
and saving a few on perks and so on is not enough. We have to go 
deeper.
<P>
	What is the result? We are into an underground economy the 
size of which nobody can estimate but we know it is big. The last 
election was part of the result. We saw a party virtually 
disappear off the face of the political map.
<P>
	Then we have the revolt. A number of organizations are 
springing up across this country and I have talked to two of 
them. One is the Tax Revolt Network News run by Gerry Rogers 
in Halifax. He prints a monthly document and I will be quoting 
from it. There is also a gentleman by the name of Gebert from 
my home riding of Fraser Valley West who is well aware of Mr. 
Rogers' activities. By no means is this a limited list. There are 
all kinds of people out there.
<P>
	I did get a call from a fellow by the name of George 
MacDonald in Calgary who is on a fixed income. He basically 
said: ``Why not add the museum in the Prime Minister's riding 
to the cost of the inordinate expenditures, or the $100,000 grant 
to study riddles'', and so on and so forth. That just came from 
Mr. MacDonald a few minutes ago. People out there are sick and 
tired of this.
<P>
	Let me quote the Tax Revolt Network News: ``Today nobody 
trusts governments will do what they say they will do, or say 
what they are planning to do without deceit''. Gerry Rogers is a 
small businessman. He is not a politician. He is just ticked right 
off.
<P>
	Other things in the Tax Revolt Network News: ``The system is 
too complicated. A small business should be able to run and be 
accounted for by a person of average intelligence with a basic 
high school education. Please, governments, do not lend us 
money and do not give us grants. We are capable of governing 
ourselves. We need a more participatory form of government for 
the 21st century''.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Another quote: ``Taxes can be lowered without law breaking. 
The secret in the control of politicians and their pathological 
need to tax and spend: Control the money. Take away their 
privilege of taxation and borrowing and they will become more 
reasonable to deal with''. This is all over the place in this 
country.
<P>
	Another fellow has formed a citizens tax coalition. One hon. 
member talked about banding together from time to time. These 
people are not just banding together; this is big stuff in this 
country. I quote: ``The thing Mr. Rogers and I have in common is 
the contempt for the political system that ignores common sense 
in taxation. It is bound to result in chaos in our economy. The 
first casualty will be our system of government followed by the 
politicians who failed to represent the wishes of the people who 
elected them''.
<P>
	I have one more quote which is interesting. It goes back a little 
bit. The quote is this: ``The national budget must be balanced. 
The public debt must be reduced. The arrogance of the 
authorities must be moderated and controlled. Payments to 
foreign governments must be reduced if the nation does not want 
to go bankrupt. People must again learn to work instead of living 
on public assistance''. This is not my quote; it came from a 
senator of ancient Rome, Marcus Tullius Cicero speaking in 55 
B.C. What has changed since 55 B.C. you ask. Not much in this 
country.
<P>
	The Romans misread the mood of the people and the 
civilization went up in flames. We are in danger of that 
happening too and I think this Liberal government should take 
heed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I truly enjoyed the hon. member's remarks, 
particularly the humour. When there is humour and wit in a 
taxation debate it does make it a lot more enjoyable.
<P>
	One comment is in terms of the Rogers report on taxation 
revolt out of Halifax. My riding of Cumberland-Colchester is 
in Nova Scotia, that beautiful province. Just yesterday I 
attended a ribbon cutting and sod turning ceremony at a factory. 
It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3820"> 3820 </A></B>
<P>
is a manufacturing plant of Intertape Polymer Group. This 
factory has been in existence in Truro for close to 20 years. 
About every  five years it has been able to expand with a little bit 
of Atlantic Canada opportunities or ACOA funding.
<P>
	Yesterday we presented it with a grant of $1.5 million. 
Seventy per cent of that was federal funds and 30 per cent was a 
provincial co-operative sharing financial grant. The amount we 
presented as government of $1.5 million was matched with $9.8 
million from the plant. This was to expand into new products 
that would go on the international marketplace. It already 
employs close to 400 people and will take on an additional 45 
people. These are long term sustainable jobs.
<P>
	The point I wish to make is that the manager of this plant had 
to compete with his other plants. One in Florida, one in North 
Carolina, one in Ontario, one in England, and the one in Nova 
Scotia: five manufacturing plants that manufacture a plastic 
tape that goes on the back of carpets, that makes polysacs for 
carrying all kinds of large bulk products. This fibre is made, 
competed with and sold internationally.
<P>
	This plant in Truro was able to get the $9.8 million from the 
conglomerate because we were able to assist a little bit with an 
ACOA grant in the Atlantic region.
<P>
	That is the benefit of cost sharing, stimulating, promoting 
those jobs. As the hon. member will know, in our red book we 
did advocate jobs for this country. If he has read the recent 
reports the economy today is at the highest it has been in the past 
five years. It is growing. It is growing slowly but it is growing 
and he must agree that we have taken some appropriate 
measures by reducing those taxes, the 3 per cent in the UI 
premiums. That was a constructive, positive measure to increase 
jobs and to increase job potential for this country.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	I wanted to point out to the hon. member the fact that when we 
do cost share as a government, if the owner or manufacturer puts 
in a substantial amount and there are long term jobs, long term 
sustainability in manufacturing for the export market, I must 
remind him of the tremendous products, then it is a good 
investment and we are on the right track.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, good 
comments from the hon. member. I assure her it is not easy 
getting a laugh out of a tax revolt or a tax system in this country 
but one has to try once in awhile.
<P>
	There is such a thing as government trying to assist business. I 
guess it is the perspective one has on how it is done. I can name 
time after time where government has put money into business 
and it has just gone out the back door. It has been a waste.
<P>
	I spent some time down in Halifax not too long ago. Many 
people I talked to down there said: ``Get rid of ACOA. It is just 
another tax bonus for those who can get into the trough''.
<P>
	I was in Anglemont up in the Shuswap in British Columbia 
this weekend. A fellow there said: ``A friend of mine is going to 
start a business. He just got a $17,000 grant to start a business''. 
I know the name of the business but I will not say it here.
<P>
	The fact is that perhaps his friend should have borrowed the 
money from a bank or a business somewhere. You cannot just go 
around this country handing out tax dollars from the people of 
British Columbia or Alberta to somebody in the territories who 
wants to start a business. That is what is ticking people off today. 
Their money is being given away to some businesses that are 
totally unproductive.
<P>
	Westray mines in Nova Scotia is a good example. That mine 
kept a lot of people working but it was tax dollars being 
transferred right across this country. What was the end result? 
There never was money earned in that place and many people 
died in a very unfortunate accident.
<P>
	I received a letter not too long ago from the Canadian Kennel 
Club after my criticism of its receiving a $5,000 bilingualism 
grant. The club told me it had an income of $4 million to $5 
million, yet it was getting a $5,000 grant. What for? Let it spend 
its own money.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the hon. 
member's time has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise during this opposition day to debate the 
motion tabled by the hon. member for Calgary Centre which 
reads: ``That this House implore the government to initiate 
immediate consultations with Canadian taxpayers-''
<P>
	I do not know if the hon. member remembers, but before 
tabling his budget, the Minister of Finance consulted Canadian 
taxpayers across the country. Thanks to modern technology, 
those who did not participate in these consultations were able to 
follow this exercise on TV. Consequently, the first point 
mentioned in the motion does not accurately reflect the 
situation.
<P>
	Also, since the motion talks about initiating consultations, I 
thought that, especially in the case of the Reform Party, details 
would have been provided as to the kind of consultations to hold, 
because such a process costs money. What about expected 
results? I have not heard anything concrete on this since the 
debate began this morning.
<P>
	The motion then refers to consultations with ``provincial 
governments on the creation of a fair and integrated reform of 
the entire tax system-'' I believe the hon. member is alluding 
to tax harmonization and I agree with the Reform Party on that. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3821"> 3821 </A></B>
<P>
think that the Minister of Finance has already had meetings with 
his provincial counterparts, and it goes without saying that there 
is work to do. I also believe that, in its efforts to determine how 
to replace the GST, the finance committee is reviewing this 
whole issue.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	This government has taken concrete measures since it took 
office. The hon. member mentioned earlier that we grant 
subsidies to companies or institutions and that this was a bad 
investment. We did say during the election campaign, as well as 
in our red book, that subsidies to companies will be drastically 
reduced, and I believe we are doing that. So we are going in the 
right direction concerning this aspect of public finances.
<P>
	In fact, we have taken several realistic measures to put some 
order in public finances. During the election campaign, we did 
not make unrealistic promises, as did the Conservatives and the 
Reformists who promised to totally eliminate the deficit in three 
or five years.
<P>
	The federal administration also includes the vision of a 
society. This is why it is not as easy as the Reform Party would 
have you believe to make cuts to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	We made a very logical and realistic proposal in our red book. 
We said that we were going to lower the deficit to 3 per cent of 
our gross national product, over a period of three years. And 
when he tabled the budget, the Minister of Finance showed how 
he was going to fulfill that promise.
<P>
	This is what we managed to do in the six months since we took 
office. The results are starting to show.
<P>
	Reform Party members are very critical of the infrastructure 
program, and this from a political party that believes in public 
consultation and local government. I have been a member of 
Parliament for ten years now, and every time I meet mayors of 
municipalities, members of municipal, provincial and regional 
councils and members of the Federation of Canadian 
municipalities, they always demand federal involvement in an 
infrastructure program, because that is our role as a government. 
The Reform Party has no vision. A government must have a 
vision of society. A modern society without a modern and 
adequate infrastructure cannot develop its economy, and our 
economy must be in good shape if we are going to reduce the 
deficit and the debt. And that is what we are doing.
<P>
	We responded initially to a request from the municipalities 
and we put this request before the provinces, which agreed to 
share the cost three ways. We will not only create jobs needed in 
the short term to boost economic recovery but also respond to a 
real need for infrastructures in our regions, our communities, 
our towns and our villages. The infrastructure program will help 
communities and existing entrepreneurs to expand and help new 
entrepreneurs get started.
<P>
	It is not just a matter of dollars and cents. We must have an 
all-encompassing vision, which the Reform Party does not have 
when it insists on talking about a tax revolt.
<P>
	To my knowledge, there have always been protest 
movements, and these are sometimes necessary because they 
make us think. As members we often sit in this House five days a 
week and do not always have time to go and listen to our 
constituents. However, we don't think we can say there is a 
revolt. Of course some people are angry, and a few may have 
good reason to be, but I think that today we should be more 
constructive and try to get together and deal with these problems 
with the government, and I think we should stress the positive 
aspects so that we can suggest how the government should deal 
with these problems. We did.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Speaking of consultations, as part of our parliamentary 
reform at the beginning of this session, our first item was to 
ensure that members of the finance committee would be able to 
prepare the next budget with the Minister of Finance, something 
unheard of in the past. Until now, the contents of the budget were 
announced to members in this House at the same time as they 
were to Canadians watching on television, in other words, when 
the budget was brought down in Parliament.
<P>
	Members of Parliament will be able to contribute. This 
system will enable us to submit proposals, make suggestions 
and express the people's concerns to the Minister of Finance. 
That is what we call real consultation!
<P>
	The motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-implore the government to initiate immediate consultations with Canadian 
taxpayers-</BLOCKQUOTE>
That is what we have been doing since the opening of the 
session. In fact, that was one of the commitments we had taken 
during the election campaign.
<P>
	We, members of Parliament, are here to represent the people 
of Canada. As such, we can let the Minister of Finance know 
what they think and the committee will be able to prepare a 
budget, together with the minister, and to tackle the problems 
facing the Canadian economy. This way, we will be prepared to 
face the problems of the 21st century, have a sound financial 
position and be able to compete in the modern economy.
<P>
	On September 4, ten years ago, I was elected federal member 
of Parliament and I have spent at least six of the past ten years 
examining problems the small and medium-sized businesses are 
grappling with. In the budget speech, I was pleased and proud to 
notice that the Minister of Finance had tried to settle once and 
for all the question of small business deductions. Small business 
need tax deductions, but the Income Tax Act allowed large 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3822"> 3822 </A></B>
<P>
corporations to take advantage of the system, up to $200,000 
worth in income. The Minister of Finance corrected the situation 
and he will certainly address small business.
<P>
	In the budget also, large corporations like financial 
institutions were told that they would have to pay their fair 
share. Of course, complaints were received from the Restaurant 
Association because deductions for entertainment expenses 
were reduced from 80 to 50 per cent. The Minister of Finance's 
budget actually established equity, as requested in the motion 
before us, but this means everybody has to do his share. I must 
admit that the federal government was dragging behind in that 
respect. Measures to that effect had long been in place in 
Quebec, as well as in Ontario and in the United States. I am sure 
that restaurant owners will realize that their businesses will not 
suffer from these measures; the fact that people can only deduct 
50 per cent of their expenses will not stop them from going to the 
restaurant.
<P>
	It is therefore very important to pursue our efforts in that area. 
That is in fact the first thing we will do after receiving the 
finance committee's report on the GST. Consumption tax is a 
major element of our tax system. We are going to provide the 
Canadian people with a fair and equitable tax system. We will 
start by finding an equitable alternative to the GST and I hope 
that this time, the provinces will accept to harmonize their 
programs with ours and that we can have a tax system that every- 
one can understand.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you and I come from Quebec. Today, 
someone who goes to a service station or a garage to get their car 
fixed would have trouble understanding their bill. As an 
accountant myself, I have difficulty understanding my bill.
<P>
	Because there is a 4 per cent tax, a 7 per cent tax, a 9 or 8 per 
cent tax, and every tax kicks in after a certain amount. So the 
small entrepreneur who should be in his garage working as a 
mechanical specialist and serving his customers is busy with all 
this paperwork, and God knows what will happen in two or three 
years, when the auditor from the revenue department drops by 
his garage. Did he figure out the taxes properly?
<P>
	Imagine how our small and medium-sized businesses feel 
who have to live with this GST system. I think this year we 
should make the effort to design a consumption tax system. 
Because with our financial situation, we cannot tell Canadians 
that we will abolish the GST and that there will be no 
consumption taxes.
<P>
	The Right Hon. Prime Minister, whether in opposition or in 
government, has always been very clear: we will replace the 
GST. However, once we have dealt with this important part of 
the tax system, namely consumption taxes, we will move on to 
the other part of the system, income and capital taxes. What 
system should we have? I think with the structure, reforms and 
regulations established in this House by our parliamentary 
committees, especially the finance committee, we will be able at 
this time next year, with the next budget, to really put our fiscal 
house in order and give hope to Canadians that we can have a 
fair, equitable and efficient tax system.
<P>
	But it is only by working together and supporting the Minister 
of Finance-and I am confident that our finance minister will 
see it through to the end. Before becoming involved in politics, 
he was a businessman; he knows the problems, he listens to 
Canadians-and I am sure that together we will succeed.
<P>
	I know that the hon. member for Gatineau-La Lièvre would 
like to participate in this debate so, Madam Speaker, with the 
consent of the House, I will sit down and allow him to speak his 
mind.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> On a point of order, the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, do we not get to ask some 
questions of the hon. member for Saint-Léonard?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The member was asking 
if he finished early whether he could give a chance to the 
member for Gatineau-La Lièvre to make comments or ask 
questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the member for Saint-Léonard for his 
contribution to today's debate. I am a little disappointed that he 
has just focused on the GST as a partial solution to our taxation 
problem. Perhaps he is too busy being the Liberal whip to put 
full concentration on this area of taxation.
<P>
	He brought up a point about the cost of consultation and as a 
Reformer I feel I should address this particular issue. Current 
hearings are always held by most standing committees, 
especially the Standing Committee on Finance.
<P>
	With the replacement tax for the GST provincial governments 
are certainly encouraged to look at the issue of harmonization 
and therefore the government and/or committees will be 
meeting with provincial finance people. When they are doing 
that and for the same cost at the same time the government can 
be bringing up other areas of taxation that provinces, individuals 
or witnesses may want to contribute toward an overhaul of the 
taxation system. In the next year and a half, at no extra cost, this 
extra review can be initiated with Canadians and provincial 
governments.
<P>
	On the order of public finances the member indicates that he 
feels his government is bringing order to the public finances. I 
counter that position as a comment by saying that the 
government has increased overall spending by $3.3 billion and 
is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3823"> 3823 </A></B>
<P>
concentrating on the revenue side to generate more revenue for 
the government.
<P>
	By borrowing $2 billion on the infrastructure all the 
government is going to get back at most is $400 million in taxes 
with the extra jobs it creates if it creates them.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	That will be a net loss on the infrastructure program so it is 
headed the wrong way.
<P>
	I compliment the hon. member for Saint-Léonard as party 
whip for handling the budget of the Board of Internal Economy. 
I do not know whether it is $250 million or $270 million, but he 
and his committee, and I believe it was through his efforts, came 
up with a $5 million saving for this House and the taxpayers of 
Canada.
<P>
	I wish that he would take his insight and his understanding of 
how cuts should really work and apply it to the Department of 
National Revenue. When the deputy minister of National 
Revenue and Taxation was asked to come up with some cuts, he 
came up with an amalgamation of two departments. Out of a 
budget of $2.2 billion all that he could come up with, not that it 
is insignificant, was $36 million.
<P>
	On a proportionate and percentage basis, I would like to know 
if the hon. member would be willing to serve as the cabinet 
minister of National Revenue and Taxation. He knows how to 
cut.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, maybe the member should 
speak to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I thank him for his congratulatory remarks. With the help of 
some of my colleagues, we realized the cuts that the member 
mentioned. The budget of the Internal Board of Economy for 
295 members of Parliament and this House is between $200 
million and $230 million a year. Five million dollars may be 
saved by the end of the year and we hope to save even more. This 
is not a big reduction but we have to start somewhere.
<P>
	We have to start from the top. That was the aim of this 
government. The Prime Minister did it with cabinet. We 
collectively did it here in the House. We are giving a good signal 
to the public administration in all departments. I would not like 
to pick on only one department. The member mentioned national 
revenue. It should be all departments.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is reminding every cabinet minister on a 
daily basis to make sure that they are responsible. We are going 
that way.
<P>
	In terms of consultation, the member and I agree. The rules 
are already in place through the finance committee. The least 
expensive consultation that we can have is through the finance 
committee of this House. We are doing it on the GST. Once the 
GST is finished, I am sure that with the budgetary process that 
we have in place this fall the finance committee will look at all 
the other tax expenditures and we will make progress.
<P>
	Like I said, we all have to participate. I could quote letters. It 
is incredible how such a thing could happen. We are trying to 
serve almost 27 million people. We have a system, but it is a 
complicated system. If all of us sincerely want to help we can do 
our own little thing for which we are responsible as a member of 
Parliament. We can go a long way.
<P>
	I hope that in this 35th Parliament this new spirit of 
co-operation and so on that we have shown in the past four 
months will continue. I am convinced that in the end we can 
achieve a greater result and Canadians will be better off. We run 
for office and get elected so that we can help Canadians feel 
good about this country. We want them to be better off. They can 
compete and look for a bright future.
<P>
	I thank the member for his congratulations. Our difference is 
not that far apart. Sometimes we have to look at more than just 
dollars and cents. The hon. member said that through taxes we 
may get only $100 million back from our $2 billion. I do not 
want to dispute those figures. I did not do the calculation.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	We also have to look at the wealth and the infrastructure that 
we put into our communities that will help to create a better 
business structure, a better lifestyle which in general helps 
people to feel better and feel more secure in our communities 
and therefore be more productive and more active.
<P>
	That is the problem in our society. If we make sure that all 
Canadians are active, I think we will reduce the deficit and the 
debt and we will have a better society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to address the House this afternoon on the subject of the 
government's tax system. Since the Bloc Quebecois was elected 
last October 25, it has tabled a motion calling on the government 
of Canada to strike a committee to review all government 
spending.
<P>
	For many months now, the Bloc Quebecois has been 
demanding an in-depth review of the tax system, the aim being 
the elimination of tax inequities. Having brought down a $164.7 
billion budget providing for a spending increase of $4 billion for 
1994, the Liberal government should review its spending 
practices because it has chosen the easiest course of action, 
which is to raise taxes.
<P>
	Finance minister Paul Martin's recent budget sets a second 
record in this House, what with a deficit of $9.7 billion and $110 
million in interest charges per day. Given the current state of the 
economy and the high levels of unemployment and poverty in 
Quebec and in Canada, the $110 million in interest charges 
which the federal government pays to financial institutions 
could surely have been put to some other use. It could have been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3824"> 3824 </A></B>
<P>
invested in a variety of other areas such as social housing or in 
business recovery programs aimed at job creation.
<P>
	There is an urgent need for the government to review the 
entire tax system. Furthermore, as I stated earlier, it is also very 
important that the government agree to the motion presented in 
this House by the Bloc Quebecois which calls for a committee to 
be established to review government spending item by item and 
to give the government some control mechanisms.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Finance, of which I am a member, I asked him 
whether it was the public servants who were mismanaging 
programs, or the politicians who were spending too much. Of 
course, since the minister wanted to protect some public 
servants and deputy ministers, he had to take full responsibility 
and reply that it was the politicians who were spending too 
much.
<P>
	I believe that politicians should give themselves monitoring 
tools, because they are the ones who must take responsibility 
when the government tables a budget and has a deficit. Every 
four years, political parties have to go before the best judges of 
their actions: Canadians and Quebecers. We cannot afford a 
budget like this one, with a deficit of $39.7 billion. The 
government is trying to eliminate a deficit by creating another 
one.
<P>
	You will remember that when the Conservatives tabled a 
budget with a deficit of $32 billion, the largest ever at the time, 
it caused an uproar. The Liberals just hit the roof. This was 
unprecedented. But this was just rhetoric on their part to get 
elected. Indeed, the Liberals' recent budget is proof that they are 
no better managers than the Conservatives of the time.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	It is important that the government implement all the Auditor 
General's recommendations. His services are costly. In fact, it 
costs the government $60 million over three years for this audit 
of its books, a job which the Auditor General has always done 
well and will continue to do well. We are not asking for cuts 
affecting social programs, low-income and single-parent 
families, or social housing. We are asking the government to 
make cuts in its own fat. It is the Auditor's mandate to find out 
where that fat is, and he does a very good job at that.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is also asking that a committee be set up 
to review all government expenditures. The Reform Party 
agrees with us on this score. This committee would include 
members of all political parties, mainly the government, the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, who, along with the 
Minister of Finance and the Minister of National Revenue, 
would take a look at all expenditures which are not essential to 
the operations of this House.
<P>
	It is important that the government give itself means to 
control each department. And if in its budget, the government 
approves the budget for the Department of Transport, and if the 
Minister of Finance includes in his budget a budget for health 
programs for the Department of National Health and Welfare, 
the officials who run this program must be responsible for its 
administration, and the ministers responsible for their 
respective departments must be accountable for those 
departments.
<P>
	A minister who is there just for the prestige is pretty useless. I 
think ministers should be responsible for their individual 
departments and for the programs in those departments. If the 
minister does not do his job or if the official doesn't do his job, 
in that case, let us get someone else. However, we cannot afford 
to approve a budget with a $39.7 billion deficit, knowing full 
well that in the end, if the economy or employment recovery is 
not up to expectations, we may end up with a deficit of $45 
billion or even $50 billion.
<P>
	Public servants and the ministers in their respective 
departments must be aware of their responsibilities and 
administer the programs and budgets they have been given to 
administer by the government.
<P>
	I have been sitting on the finance committee for about two 
months, and we heard many witnesses for the municipalities, 
Chambers of Commerce, unions of municipalities, restaurant 
owners, and so forth, and everyone is trying to find ways for the 
government to raise revenue without affecting the consumer. I 
think the government should stop worrying about how to raise 
revenue, because workers and consumers are already paying far 
too much.
<P>
	What the government should worry about is how to cut its 
spending, and it doesn't take very long to find out how to do that. 
What it takes is a good committee that looks at departmental 
budgets item by item. Its work would be cut out for it. For a start, 
we should act on all the recommendations made by the Auditor 
General. We pay too many taxes and too much income tax, and 
we should try to eliminate monumental mistakes like the 
contract at Pearson Airport in Toronto. This is the only federal 
airport in Canada that makes a profit, that generates a total of 
$50 million annually, and the previous government decided to 
privatize it.
<P>
	Did the government decide to reward indirectly those who had 
contributed to the election campaign? The Bloc Quebecois is 
asking for a public inquiry to prove that the present government 
did not enjoy certain advantages as result of actions taken by the 
previous government, actions which have penalized taxpayers 
in Quebec and Canada. Quebecers and Canadians pay too much 
tax, and people are wondering whether they are getting their 
money's worth.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="3825"> 3825 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	We pay taxes to the federal government and to Quebec. We 
turn over $28 billion per year in taxes to the federal government, 
in addition to paying provincial taxes, the GST, the TVQ, 
municipal taxes and school taxes.
<P>
	Quebecers are prepared to pay a single harmonized tax, one 
that would give the provincial government control of all tax 
dollars and combine the GST and the TVQ into a single tax for a 
single country. This will come to pass when Quebec achieves 
independence.
<P>
	As I was saying, workers and consumers are the ones left to 
pick up the tab. From the moment he is born, a Canadian child 
owes $20,000 to the federal government. And this same child 
will be paying until the day he dies.
<P>
	Allow me to explain myself, Madam Speaker. As I was 
saying, when a child is born, he inherits a $20,000 share of the 
deficit. From the time they are old enough to attend grade school 
and high school, CEGEP or university, students pay taxes on 
books, goods and services and computers, etc. In short, even 
their education is taxed.
<P>
	For parents who must incur a number of expenses related to 
their children's education, the process can be quite costly. Not 
every municipality or region in Quebec or in Canada has a 
CEGEP or a university. There is a CEGEP in the Charlevoix 
region. However, when students wish to go to university, they 
must travel outside the region and this can be very expensive.
<P>
	A student from Baie-Comeau who decides to further his 
education in Montreal or in Quebec City will probably have to 
pay anywhere from $8,000 to $10,000 per year. Quite often, his 
father or mother, or sometimes both, end up unemployed, or 
even on welfare because a plant was forced to close, jobs were 
cut or a contract terminated.
<P>
	If the student wishes to stay in school, he is forced to rely on 
loans and bursaries. When they graduate from university three 
or four years later, students find themselves $20,000 to $25,000 
in debt and this, without any guarantee of finding work when 
they get out of school.
<P>
	Naturally, these parents cannot afford to pay the required 
$8,000 to $10,000 a year and the child, having taken out loans, 
often must abandon his studies, for lack of funds.
<P>
	There should be a tax deduction form for parents, to help 
children who study away from home. Let me explain. At present, 
when a couple divorces and the father is ordered to pay alimony 
to his ex-wife, the portion of his income which is paid in 
alimony is tax deductible. On the other hand, the same parent, if 
he is a good father and puts one, two and sometimes as many as 
three children through university, incurs very high expenses, but 
the money invested by parents in the education of children 
attending university is not tax  deductible. The government 
should come up with programs to help, through the tax system, 
working taxpayers who pay to send their children away to get an 
education. These young people are our future. I also think that it 
would help prevent dropping out.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	It is also urgent, both at the federal and the provincial level, 
that vocational schools be reopened. There will always be 
intellectuals with the skills and financial means to enter 
university, but there are also young people who do not have the 
skills or the financial means to go to university. There is an 
intermediate level that used to exist in the seventies-I am 
talking about vocational training.
<P>
	You know that these jobs are increasingly occupied by 
women. Equal pay for equal work! These would be much 
sought-after trades because in construction, we will always 
need plumbers, electricians, carpenters, mechanics and the 
likes. There are only two classes: labourers, almost like welfare 
recipients, and professionals. But the construction market will 
always exist and I think governments should re-open vocational 
training centres to help those who lack the skills to go on to 
university.
<P>
	The government tried to compensate for taxes by promising 
``jobs, jobs, jobs'' in its red book. They will have to take action. 
Six months after the Liberal Party was elected, 23,000 more 
people live on social assistance in Quebec. They have exhausted 
their unemployment insurance benefits and are now on welfare. 
As I said last week when the Prime Minister declared that the 
unemployment rate was down 2 per cent in Quebec, it is because 
social assistance has gone up by 2 per cent.
<P>
	The only reasonable thing in the Liberal Party's platform is 
the infrastructure program. Of course, this program will help 
small municipalities and some regional county municipalities. 
But $2 billion for the infrastructure program is not enough. The 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities recommended that the 
government should invest at least $15 billion in the program. 
The infrastructure program will not cure the unemployment 
cancer. Part of the problem in Quebec and Canada can be solved 
by a $2 billion infrastructure program, but not all of it.
<P>
	One does not treat a broken leg with a Band-Aid or a general 
cancer with aspirin. The government must inject more money 
into this program to create jobs and help municipalities; this, in 
my opinion, would turn a good program into an excellent 
program. Again, what ratepayers do not have to borrow, they do 
not have to pay. I will be happy to resume my comments after 
question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre):</B> Madam Speaker, 
after listening to the member for Charlevoix who dealt with 
many subjects, I will come back to the issue of taxation, because 
that is what we were discussing this morning.
<P>

<P>
	He talked about the need to reform the tax system. Of course 
many people have called for that. The hon. member is on the 
finance committee. Last night, I had the opportunity, as a 
member of Parliament, to testify before that committee and talk 
about the need for tax reform. In the brief I presented, I spoke of 
the need to reform the tax system.
<P>
	There is something we can refer to. Twenty-five years ago, 
maybe more, there was a well-known royal commission of 
inquiry on the tax system, the Carter Commission. Twenty-five 
years later, the Carter Commission's recommendations are still 
valid today. The tax system must be improved to make it fairer 
and more equitable. We need consider only a few figures to 
realize that in the past 15 or 20 years, the tax system has worked 
against the welfare and interests of the middle class, which for 
all practical purposes is the backbone of any modern economy.
<P>
	Of course, in a society like ours, when the middle class has 
disposable income, the economy is moving. But as the years go 
by and taxes are so high that incomes go down, we see the 
problems that we have in Canada now. These are only some 
indications of the reform that must be made to our whole tax 
system, including the GST, of course, which was a disastrous 
error for the country.
<P>
	I would like to draw your attention to some figures and show 
you how unbalanced our system is. Back in 1980, the richest 1 
per cent of Canadians at that time held 16 per cent of all the 
wealth and income in the country. That is just to give you an 
idea. Ten years later, only ten years, which is not much in the 
history of a country, in 1990, the same top 1 per cent held 26 per 
cent of all the income and wealth in our country.
<P>
	Did those people invest? Did they make wonderful 
investments in the country? Not at all. They used the tax system 
to their advantage. Please note that everything they did was not 
illegal, far from it; it was legal, they were protecting their own 
interests. They used the tax system; they found loopholes in the 
act to protect as much as possible their wealth and revenue. This 
gives you an idea of the imbalance which prevails.
<P>
	Another figure also shows that problems exist. Everyone 
agrees that the accumulated deficit is enormous, but 44 per cent 
of that deficit is due to compound interest. This means that 44 
per cent of our accumulated deficit is not due to any actual 
spending. That part of the deficit is the result of compound 
interest. As you know, interest rates were very high for a period 
of 12 years. Even our interest rate was one third higher than the 
American average for 12 consecutive years. You can see the 
damage caused by that situation to an economy.
<P>
	Is my time up, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> No, not yet. The hon. member has about six 
minutes left. He can resume after Question Period, that is after 
the vote which will take place this afternoon. I remind the hon. 
member that he must always speak to the Chair.
<P>
	It being two o'clock, pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the 
House will now proceed to Statements by Members, pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
recognition of International Year of the Family my statement is 
prepared in defence of the family.
<P>
	The conventional terms of debate in matters of political, 
economic and legal issues tend to focus on individual rights and 
the rights of state, not the rights of the family.
<P>
	This is unfortunate and must change, for the family is the 
most important reality in our lives. To redefine the family to 
include homosexual and lesbian relationships is immoral, unjust 
and a violation of the rights of the family which are well founded 
in both Canadian and natural law.
<P>
	The family unit is the basic institution of life and the solid 
foundation on which our forefathers built this great nation. The 
protection of families, family life and family values must be a 
priority with this government.

<P>
	The member's statement is a perfect example of the kind of 
disinformation which is being spread around by advocates of a 
Trudeau-like multiculturalism, an archaic concept whose noble

died doing what he did best. He was the acknowledged master of 
his craft and surely he seemed immortal.

Mothers with kids in elementary school are calling me. Their

	Let us beef up our justice system so Canadians feel secure that

matter straight.
<P>

me by sending me to this Chamber to defend their honour and

Moreover, all Quebecers will be able to chip in by purchasing

deeds of violent murderers. I encourage all members of the 
House to support the ban on their production and distribution.
<P>
	Over the past six weeks I have received letters from high 
school students in my riding telling me that they fear growing up 
in a society in which violent murderers are rewarded with the 
production of commemorative trading cards. They tell me they 
fear that peers who collect these cards will come to look at 
violent murders as a quick and easy way to achieve fame rather 
than seeing murder for what it really is: a cruel end to many lives 
beginning with the victim and ending with their family and 
friends.
<P>
	Youth in Brampton are demanding an end to the production 
and distribution of these cards.
<P>
	For the well-being of our children and for the well-being of 
the type of society this generation hands down to them, I again 
ask all parliamentarians to support a ban on the production and

that forests make to my riding and to all of Canada's social, 
environmental and economic well-being. Next to the fishery the 
forestry sector is one of the largest employers in South Shore, 
with 270 companies employing over 5,000 people with exports 
valued at $150 million a year.
<P>
	The designation of Lunenburg county by the Canadian 
Forestry Association as the forestry capital of Canada for 1996 
and the previous designation of Queens county in 1987 indicate 
just how significant this resource sector is. Forests are a part of 
the natural beauty of South Shore and serve to make it a popular 
tourist destination.
<P>
	Most important, forests are a key component of our natural 
environment. They moderate the climate, prevent erosion, 
improve air quality and provide wildlife habitat.

forests provide for us but what we can do to provide for them.

importation of serial killer cards and serial board games into 
Canada.
<P>
	We do not need products that exploit violence and cruelty. It is 
appalling that in the midst of the recent senseless shootings and 
the flare-up of violent crime some would go to any length to 
promote and commercialize serial killer cards and serial board 
games.

principles which will govern the agriculture of tomorrow. The 
challenges of globalization are enormous and Quebec 
committed itself to developing a competitive agricultural sector

wake of the severe cyclone which battered the Bangladesh coast 
and offshore islands yesterday I would like to extend sincere 
condolences to the people of Bangladesh.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has been 
brought to my attention that there are severe problems with the 
recent awarding of the fishery observer contract to Biorex.
<P>
	This year the contract was up for renewal and the government 
went with the lowest bidder, Biorex, to save money. This saving 
is being consumed by the fact that the government has decided 
to train these inexperienced observers from Biorex under 
funding from CEIC. It is clear that by paying for this training the 
government is spending the same if not more by awarding the 
contract to Biorex when the government could have awarded the 
contract to the Scotia Fundy observers who are already trained 
and experienced.
<P>
	How can the government justify spending $1.9 billion on a 
fisheries aid package while at the same time put 50 experienced 
and trained observers from Scotia Fundy out on the street?

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to bring to the attention of the House the plight facing children 
in war torn regions across the world, specifically in Bosnia.
<P>
	Last week I attended an international conference on genocide 
in Bosnia-Hercegovina. One of the impressions from this 
meeting is how much some European nations are doing for the 
children and some women at risk, and how comparatively little 
Canada is doing. The most recent numbers I have been able to 
obtain indicate that Canada is only taking a mere few dozen 
children for temporary safe haven. For a society as generous and 
caring as ours I find it hard to believe that we have not done 
more.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	As well, I want to invite all concerned members of this House 
to speak up on this issue and to consider forming a coalition to 
find ways of bringing together federal and provincial 
governments, private corporations and community groups in a 
joint effort to do what is right.
<P>
	History will judge us harshly if we stand aside and allow an 
entire generation to be sacrificed.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MOHAWKSFROMKANESATAKE">MOHAWKS FROM KANESATAKE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
three human rights organizations jointly condemned the 
intimidation and acts of violence suffered by Mohawks from 
Kanesatake. The Native Women's Association of Quebec, the 
Civil Liberties Union and the Canadian Action Committee on 
the Status of Women ask Quebec and Ottawa to intervene in 
order to guarantee respect for the rights of all those who live on 
this territory. These organizations are joining their efforts to 
those of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3830"> 3830 </A></B>
<P>
local organizations that today met with the minister for the same 
reason.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the 
government intend to act on this request by three human rights 
organizations, especially considering that band leader Jerry 
Peltier did not even bother to consider meeting with these three 
organizations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the reports are disturbing but these particular incidents are a 
matter for provincial jurisdiction. The Kanesatake area is not an 
Indian reserve and, as I said, these incidents are a matter for the 
province and should be brought to the attention of the Sûreté du 
Québec or the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, considering 
that several Mohawks have suffered intimidation, especially 
women whose Indian status had been newly restored, and 
considering the major role played by the federal government in 
maintaining law and order through the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police, does the government intend to intervene and act on this 
distress call?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
as I just said, maintaining law and order comes under the 
provincial government, and the RCMP has no role to play in this 
kind of situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, Michèle 
Rouleau, ex-president of the Native Women's Association of 
Quebec, said according to certain newspapers that if what 
happened in Kanesatake had happened anywhere else, criminal 
charges would have been laid.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister promise to intervene in this matter, 
since he has said repeatedly that the law should apply equally to 
everyone in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the administration of justice is a provincial matter, and 
complaints, if these matters come under the Criminal Code, are 
handled by the Attorney General for the Province of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the hon. member is talking about possible breaches of the 
Criminal Code then this is a matter strictly for the Attorney 
General of the province of Quebec and I would be happy to draw 
his attention to the concerns that have been reported in the press.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, a decision 
handed down by the Federal Court-Appeal Division today 
confirms that the custodial parent should not have to pay tax on 
support payments and that the federal government has 
apparently wrongly collected several millions of dollars in 
taxes.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Revenue tell us whether he will act upon 
this decision or appeal it before the Supreme Court?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, this is a matter of great 
interest to us. As the hon. member must know, in the budget 
tabled on February 22, reference was made to the 
federal-provincial family law committee which is expected to 
report to us on a number of issues relating to children and family 
and indeed more specifically, on the one raised by the court in 
the decision rendered today.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Our biggest concern, I must say, is first and foremost financial 
support for children and second, tax fairness. I can assure you 
that we will take into consideration the court's decision as well 
as the report of the federal-provincial family law committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, more 
specifically, are we to understand that the Minister of Finance 
intends to implement the court's decision or that he will appeal 
it? Furthermore, how substantial are the amounts involved?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has to 
understand that the court just handed down its decision late this 
morning. We have received a copy of the decision, but have only 
had the chance to glance at it. We will now have discussions with 
the Minister of National Revenue, the Minister of Justice and 
certainly officials from our respective departments.
<P>
	After that, we will be in a position to provide you with the 
answer you are looking for, but as I just said, our biggest concern 
is financial support for children and tax fairness.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would remind the hon. minister that the hon. 
members must always address the Chair.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister in response to a question from 
the member for Calgary Centre said that Canadians cannot 
expect any tax relief ``until all Canadians who want to work find 
jobs''. This statement surprises and alarms business people, 
investors and unemployed Canadians who believe that tax relief 
is necessary to create jobs.
<P>
	They feel that the Prime Minister has put the cart before the 
horse. My question to the Prime Minister is this. Does he or does 
he not believe that tax relief is necessary to create jobs and 
reduce unemployment?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have an economic policy that was enunciated in the budget 
and we said that the priority of this government was to create 
jobs.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> It is still the same.
<P>
	We would like to be able to reduce taxes at this moment but it 
would increase the deficit. If the hon. leader of the Reform Party 
is telling us to increase the deficit, fine, we will consider that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
you can reduce taxes without increasing the deficit if you reduce 
spending.
<P>
	What we are trying to get at is the connection between tax 
relief and job creation. Let me put my question another way. 
Yesterday one of Asia's top bankers, Mr. David Li, told a 
conference that Canada was an unattractive place to invest 
Asian capital because of high taxes, public debt and unnecessary 
government regulations.
<P>
	In other words, Mr. Li and his clients are reluctant to invest 
more in job creating activity in Canada because of our high tax 
and spending level.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is this. What does he have 
to say to Mr. Li and thousands of other investors like him who 
refuse to invest more in job creating activity in Canada until 
they see lower taxation and spending levels?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Reform Party is 
absolutely right when he says-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> I do not blame members for 
clapping. They do not have much chance.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker, you 
can clap too. I take it back, Mr. Speaker. I withdraw.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I do not want the hon. minister to withdraw. I 
want him to get on with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Suitably admonished, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	It is for that reason that in the most recent budget we did not 
increase taxes. We recognize the burden that Canadian 
taxpayers face. At the same time it is the reason that one of the 
essences of the unemployment insurance reform being 
undertaken by the Minister of Human Resources Development 
was in fact not only a freeze of the anticipated increase in 
unemployment insurance premiums brought in by the previous 
government but an actual rollback next January 1.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party referred to an intervention by a 
Hong Kong banker. May I just say that the International 
Monetary Fund last week said that Canada was going to lead all 
of the G-7 countries, either be number one or number two, in 
terms of growth and employment and it was going to be leading 
in low inflation. The fact is that the International Monetary Fund 
said that this country is creating jobs at a rate that it has not seen 
in a long, long time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
contrary to what the Prime Minister said yesterday, it was the 
Minister of Finance who said a while back in this House that 
taxes are a cancer on job creation.
<P>
	Millions of hard pressed Canadians are looking for a light at 
the end of the tunnel. They are looking for tax relief before they 
will spend more or invest more in job creating activities.
<P>
	My question for the government is this. The government 
professes to have a target for deficit reduction. Does the 
government have a target for tax relief? Can the Prime Minister 
or the finance minister tell Canadians when they can expect real 
tax relief from this government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the exact quote was that payroll taxes 
are a cancer on job creation and our target is next January 1.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. In a letter sent on December 20, 1993 to owners 
of houses located south of highway 344 in Oka, the minister 
wrote: ``I can assure you that I am paying particular attention to 
this very  complex issue.'' Five months later, these families are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3832"> 3832 </A></B>
<P>
still waiting for concrete action from the government, since the 
evaluation of these houses was completed on December 15, 
1993.
<P>
	My question is this: How can the Minister of Indian Affairs 
explain such a delay in buying the properties located south of 
highway 344, when he has had all the information needed to 
settle the issue since December 15?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had what I thought was a very 
fruitful meeting with the APIK members. I just came from it. I 
have a statement that they have agreed to.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	I promise to meet as soon as possible with Mr. Christos Sirros 
and APIK representatives to solve the problems of the properties 
located south of highway 344 and four enclaves and the security 
of that territory.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I hope that satisfies the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
five months later, still nothing, despite the special attention that 
the minister says he is giving these desperate people.
<P>
	Why does the minister not solve the problem of these 25 
families right now?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member knows 
that the former government purchased approximately 90 pieces 
of property which the Mohawks still have not taken over. 
Notwithstanding that, we allocated money for renovations and 
allocated money for a housing committee.
<P>
	I dropped the precondition to negotiations that we would have 
to solve north of 344 before I would be prepared to bring a 
recommendation to cabinet. The meeting today was along those 
lines. Its progress is moving in the right direction.
<P>
	I am very sympathetic to the problems that people south of 
344 are facing. There is gunfire. I am not talking about a bit of 
gunfire. I am talking about thousands of rounds going off as 
early as last Saturday night. It is not a problem that they created. 
It is a problem that exists and a problem that we are prepared to 
solve.
<P>

to go into Quebec and solve problems.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> This is specifically forbidden in the act. 
The Canada Health Act is unravelling.

provinces but to provide good health care for all Canadians?

<P>
	Yesterday, this minister clearly indicated to this House that 
the Atlantic fishery workers unions had been consulted about 
the individual contracts that workers must sign, thus committing 
themselves to undergo training or do community work in order 
to receive their benefits. We checked and the unions were never 
consulted on this.

said he had never been consulted on the issue of the individual 
contracts?

Speaker, I look forward to the opportunity to answer the 
member's question and in the process to set the record straight. I 
know the member is much interested in having the record set 
straight.
<P>
	The straight facts are that all major unions associated with the 
Harvesters Council of Canada, all provinces of Atlantic Canada 
and the province of Quebec, all stakeholders on the private side, 
and literally everybody who moves, walks, talks, breathes and 
has any interest in the fishery, have been more broadly consulted 
by the Minister of Human Resources Development about this 
policy-and I might add by the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans-than on any other policy heretofore introduced by a 
government anywhere on the planet earth.
<P>
	Yes, this is one of the matters that was discussed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, no 
consultations were ever held on the individual contracts. 
Despite what the minister said yesterday and today, this is an 
extremely important issue as workers must sign contracts 
committing them to do certain things in order to receive 
benefits. This question was never looked at and the unions were 
not consulted on it.
<P>
	Can the minister now promise to meet with them to discuss 
this issue before putting this system in place?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question is a bit late because the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans committed months ago, not only to the dozens of 
meetings we have already held but to the many more meetings 
that are to be held to ensure that the program is properly 
implemented.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	Despite the very difficult and real circumstances, despite the 
impact on people's lives, from which none of us gets any joy or 
seeks any advantage, may I say that one of the reasons this has 
gone superbly well has been the completely open attitude, the

According to this morning's <I>Toronto Star</I> issue a secret memo, 
addressed to all members of the cabinet, told them what strategy 
to use when dealing with Ginn Publishing. They were advised 
not to make any statement on the sale of this company, and also

facts.
<P>
	Unfortunately the facts have not been of great interest to the 
hon. member who has put a number of questions on this file; but 
the facts include the fact that when Investment Canada approved 
the acquisition of Maxwell Macmillan limited by Prentice-Hall, 
it approved the acquisition of a company which was in 
receivership.

jobs in Canada, as well as the acquisition of a series of

who has shown such a consistent interest in this subject and in 
fact has her own bill before the House.
<P>
	As the member knows and as a number of members in the 
House know, prior to the last budget there was extensive 
consultation. It was as a result of suggestions made by members 
in the House, and particularly in this caucus, that in the last 
budget we made reference to the potential disparities that might 
exist and our intention to await the decisions of a 
federal-provincial family law commission dealing with this 
subject among many others.
<P>
	I can assure the member that we will take her advice and the 
advice of other members in the House into account. Our major 
concern is that the financial support for these children be as 
good as it can possibly be and that tax equity be maintained.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	The minister had the opportunity for some tough talk over the 
weekend. He promised to get tough and to close loopholes for 
deportable criminals.
<P>
	Last week the immigration and refugee board gave refugee 
status to a man convicted in Canada of raping an 18-month old 
child.
<P>
	In light of this fact could the minister tell the House exactly 
what concrete measures have been taken during his tenure to 
toughen up and to protect Canadians from criminals his 
department allows to stay in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I said last week and I repeat that in 
the large number of cases of individuals who appeal to the 
immigration appeal division my department is not in favour of 
staying or overturning those deportations.
<P>
	The member ought to use his words very carefully because it 
is not true when he characterizes my department as being against 
the individual's deportation.
<P>
	Second, I think the member owes it to the immigration file not 
to suggest somehow that the entire situation is out of whack. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3835"> 3835 </A></B>
<P>
member should not consider immigration in the way we 
sometimes consider airplanes,  by the ones that do not land, 
because 99 per cent of the airplanes land at our airports seven 
days a week, 24 hours a day.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	It is the same for immigration. Of the 1,100 cases appealed 
last year only 16 in terms of criminality were overturned. I 
admit that some cases ought not to have been overturned and I 
was very honest and candid with one case last week.
<P>
	Before last week I said it is not incompatible to have a fair and 
progressive immigration policy which also means being tough 
in applying the law to those who seek to break or abuse it. We are 
not backtracking on that. We will be bringing those amendments 
to this Chamber so that we can target those individuals who by 
their actions give all immigrants a black mark.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is that 
one plane crash that causes horror and devastation. That is the 
one we are talking about today.
<P>
	Here is a fact. Just two short weeks ago this minister 
disbanded the permanent residents unit which tracks down and 
apprehends the most dangerous deportable criminals in Canada. 
This is the sort of criminal this minister's appeal division and 
refugee board seem to enjoy putting on Canadian streets.
<P>
	My question for the minister-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, order. I am sure the hon. member is 
going to put his question. I encourage the hon. member to not in 
any way impute motive to any other member in the House. It 
makes things that much more difficult. I am sure that if the hon. 
member would want to withdraw any imputation of motive to 
the hon. minister, I would invite him to do that before he 
continues his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I have said something that 
offends this minister, then I withdraw it. However, I am talking 
about his department.
<P>
	My question to the minister is this: How can this minister in 
good conscience continue to preach about getting tough and at 
the very same time disband that unit which provides Canadian 
families the most protection from dangerous deportable 
criminals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I said last week that this member 
does not have a monopoly on virtue or concern and that I do not 
take any pleasure whatsoever in seeing those individuals who do 
not merit our consideration walking our streets. The member 
should do justice to how all members feel about a number of 
cases.
<P>
	In answering the question I am going to ask the member to get 
his facts right and perhaps he could listen. For example, in 
Ontario since 1992 there has been a reduction of general 
immigration staff from 1,560 to 1,040. In the meantime, in 
Ontario, in terms of investigative enforcement officers, the staff 
has increased from 50 to 60. Five of the six individuals who were  
reduced in Toronto at the behest of this minister, those 
individuals have not been reassigned. They are still there.

<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Can the

on the reason why he refuses to put in place measures to protect 
Canadian cultural industries so as to avoid another fiasco like 
the Ginn Publishing disaster?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, to this day, I have not presented the cabinet with an 
overall policy concerning the protection of Canadian cultural 
industries. Therefore, the cabinet has not taken it into 
consideration nor made a decision in this regard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not say 
policy; I said strategy.
<P>
	I have a supplementary. In view of the fact that 80 p. 100 of

<HR>
<B><A NAME="3836"> 3836 </A></B>
<P>
	Next Monday, May 9, there will be a large protest at the 
Osoyoos border crossing in south central British Columbia. The 
protest is being staged by B.C. fruit growers angry at the 
inaction by this government on the issue of dumping of 
Washington apples into Canada.
<P>
	According to figures supplied by the growers, the industry has 
lost $1.6 million after only eight weeks of dumping. By the time 
the Canadian International Trade Tribunal gets around to 
hearing the complaint, the industry estimates that $25 million 
could well be lost before the dumping is halted.
<P>
	Yesterday the minister said he needs proof of damage from the 
industry. Will the minister acknowledge that industry has 
supplied the proof and undertake self-initiated action before the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal now, before any more 
growers are hurt by this inaction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I said yesterday, this problem arose because the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal, a Canadian body, ruled 
against the Canadian apple growers.
<P>
	It is therefore imperative if we are to win in a subsequent 
appeal to that body which would follow a national revenue 
ruling, that we have the clear evidence to make sure that its 
previous decision is overturned.
<P>
	The dilemma the hon. member and I have in this instance is 
that very much the same evidence was provided in the initial 
hearing of potential damage and was rejected. It is therefore 
imperative before we go before the Canadian International 
Trade Tribunal for a second time that we have what I would 
describe as an airtight case in this regard.
<P>
	As I said yesterday and will repeat today, the consequences to 
the Canadian apple industry of a second defeat probably would 
be catastrophic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
indeed I agree with the minister that we need to have good 
factual information. He is quite right in that. I believe the B.C. 
fruit growers are fully aware of the difficulty that is there. They 
believe these numbers are correct.
<P>
	I challenge the minister to recognize that we are dealing with 
perishable fruit that cannot wait five or six months. Will the 
minister act now to speed up the process involved and have the 
complaints heard by the Canadian International Trade Tribunal 
so that others will not suffer in the same way in the future, that 
is, the next crop that is coming up.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly I agree with the hon. member that it is 
particularly important to make sure this damage to the industry 
which I believe is taking place does not continue in the future, 
particularly into the next crop year.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important to note this is a fairly technical area. We have 
to have information on costing. We have to have information on 
import pricing. We have to have information on injury.
<P>
	I will be quite willing on the representations of the hon. 
member and indeed the hon. member who questioned me 
yesterday in this regard to review once again with my officials 
the information made available to us from the apple growers. We 
will check with legal counsel once again to see whether at this 
point we have evidence which can guarantee a win.

question is for the Minister of Justice. It is on a matter that has 
been discussed earlier today.
<P>
	As we heard, a landmark decision was rendered today by the 
Federal Court of Appeal that will fundamentally change the 
approach to child support payments in this country. Justice 
Hugessen ruled that Suzanne Thibodeau was discriminated 
against on the grounds that the inequity, the inequality created 
for separated custodial parents is discriminatory and imposes a 
burden on them not imposed on others.
<P>
	The Federal Court has taken the lead in recognizing the 
importance of stabilizing the family unit, whether you are 
together or apart. Will the minister follow suit and do the same?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I take the hon. 
member's question to relate to the issue of appeal.
<P>
	If the hon. member is asking whether we are going to appeal 
the judgment, may I first of all say that although I have received 
the reasons over the lunch hour, I have not yet had the advantage 
of reading them. I know there is a dissenting judgment. I will be 
reading them with care and interest. It is a very important 
judgment. Once I have had an opportunity to consider the 
judgment I will be speaking with the client ministry to 
determine from a policy perspective what the minister would

my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The tragedy of youth crime is a ticking time bomb in this 
country, yet the minister has said that he does not expect a bill to 
be passed by this Parliament until late this year, possibly next.
<P>
	These delays are simply not acceptable. In light of the urgent 
need for changes to the Young Offenders Act will the minister 
fast-track his agenda and will he give his undertaking to this 
House that a bill will be passed before this House adjourns for 
the summer holidays?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, any such undertaking would 
require a degree of control by a member of Parliament over the 
process of government that I am not sure any of us possess.
<P>
	However, let me respond directly to the hon. member's 
question. I respect and to a large degree share the hon. member's 
sense of urgency in this issue. As I have said in the past, as 
recently as yesterday, I expect that within weeks I am going to 
introduce legislation in this House with respect to changes to the 
Young Offenders Act that we think are in the public interest.
<P>
	Let me also emphasize to the hon. member that while we are 
concerned about crime in this country, it is not the enactment of 
a change to a statute, it is not the introduction of new legislation 
that is going to come to grips with the underlying problem we 
face. Quite apart from the criminal justice system we have to

take a wide ranging, holistic approach to crime in this country if

responses that we must muster to this social issue.

	Since this bill passed in the last Parliament drug prices have 
skyrocketed and Canadian consumers are being gouged with 
high prices for prescription drugs.

will be reviewing Bill C-91 soon. The minister is also aware that 
the Leader of the Opposition supports the wishes of 
multinational drug companies in Quebec.

election to make any changes to this bill or is he going to repeal

consumers?

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
being able to continue after Oral Question Period. Earlier, when 
I rose, I was followed by a parliamentary secretary who made a 
comment. When the time comes to vote on the Bloc Quebecois 
motion for the creation of a committee to review public finance 
management, I hope that the parliamentary secretary, who is a 
Liberal member, will make good on his comments and support 
our motion.
<P>
	I explained that a child is burdened with a $20,000 debt the 
minute he is born. I also talked about students and workers, and I 
would like to follow up by telling you about the elderly. Our 
seniors are overtaxed. These people have paid school, 
municipal, provincial and federal taxes throughout their life. 
Many of these people raised large families but managed to save 
a bit of money in RRSPs to enjoy a more comfortable retirement. 
Unfortunately, the government is still going after these people 
by forcing them to pay tax when they cash in their RRSPs.
<P>
	Indeed, in his recent budget, the Minister of Finance decided 
to tax all seniors with a revenue of $26,500 and up. School and 
municipal taxes still have to be paid by those who keep their 
home. Retired seniors with a low income still pay the provincial 
sales tax as well as the GST. Many people who have reached the 
age of 65 continue to work because they do not have the means to 
enjoy a comfortable retirement. Seniors should benefit from 
major exemptions, so that people can retire no later than when 
they turn 60, or even 55 if possible.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	That would open up new jobs for our young people, for those 
who graduate from university and wait for the government to 
create jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3840"> 3840 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will tax seniors till the very end, that is until 
their funerals. Undertaking and burial services are taxed. The 
GST applies to those services as well as to the cost of a coffin. 
We will have paid all of our lives and until our death.
<P>
	The government is racking its brains to find new sources of 
revenues, but it will choose the easiest solution and increase 
taxes. The government urgently needs to set up a committee to 
review the reduction of government expenditures. In its red 
book, the Liberal government said it wanted to get rid of the 
GST. Of course, the government wants a hidden tax, that would 
increase from 7 to 12 per cent. It also wants to tax food, 
education, books, computers, all basic education needs, 
prescription drugs and health care.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will strongly oppose any effort by the 
government to tax prescription drugs and health care among 
other things, since poverty is rampant in Quebec and in Canada. 
A lot of people cannot even afford bread and butter.
<P>
	I think the most urgent thing is to set up this committee. We 
are going through harsh economic times, and the cost of living is 
still very high for low-income and very poor families. More and 
more, wages are being frozen and people are working at the 
minimum wage. We have to deal with high levels of 
unemployment and welfare, smuggling, the underground 
economy, a rise in criminal activity and the fact that our prisons, 
in Quebec and in Canada, are more and more packed-full. Who 
pays for all of this? It is our society and our workers.
<P>
	Under the Conservative government, we were told that the 
GST was supposed to reduce the deficit, but the deficit has 
grown ever since. Despite GST revenues of $14 billion, the 
deficit has tripled during the last nine years the Conservatives 
were in office.
<P>
	Finally, I hope the government will set up a committee made 
up of course of government members who are responsible for 
running this country. In the latest budget, the Liberal 
government showed its inability to efficiently manage the 
public finances. If that committee is to be increasingly efficient, 
the government should add to its team a group of Bloc 
Quebecois members because they really want the government to 
lower taxes or at least freeze them for years to come.
<P>
	They will have to review all the overlapping and duplication 
occurring in this government. In Quebec, we do not need the 
federal government to manage our health program, nor do we 
need the federal government to manage our education and 
occupational training, our manpower or our social programs.
<P>
	It is urgent to cut on travelling expenses for ministers, 
senators, members of committees and parliamentary 
associations. Last week I attended a on Public Works meeting 
and asked the Minister of Public Works if he was ready to say in 
front of the committee that he would issue a public call for 
tenders in the papers to give those who wanted to bid the chance 
to do so; I also asked him  if he would accept the lowest bid 
coming from a compliant bidder. He answered no, that he could 
not commit himself to that. The government must manage 
public funds; if businesses were managed like the government, 
they would all go bankrupt a few weeks after opening. Not a 
single business is managed like the government.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	As a member of the finance committee, if the Liberal Party 
government invites me to do so, I will be happy to assist and 
work hard to find places where we can cut out the fat from 
government operations, items that could bring the budget down.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois and of the Reform Party who are concerned and 
worried because of the increase in the last budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is to be commended for his tremendous 
understanding of senior citizens. Like me, the hon. member 
represents a rural riding. When we are in a rural area, we realize 
that the problems may not be as obvious to the government as 
the problems of our big cities. I have tried to listen carefully to 
what the hon. member had to say.
<P>
	In our area, there are seniors who worked all their lives to save 
a few dollars, and it certainly was not easy. These people worked 
in factories. They worked in the fisheries. They worked on 
farms, and I am referring to my own constituency. And, the 
government is going to take some of those hard-earned savings 
away from them. When we consider the multinationals which 
pay practically no taxes and family trusts which are not taxed at 
all, I say there is some incredible injustice in this country, and 
especially in rural communities.
<P>
	I have a brief question for the hon. member. He said, and 
perhaps he would like to repeat what he said or rephrase it: Is 
there not another way to let senior citizens take advantage of the 
few years they have left, people who worked from the age of 7 
until 65, at one, two or three jobs, and who worked for as long as 
18 hours a day?
<P>
	I speak on behalf of these people in rural areas and also on 
behalf of people in the cities, because they worked very hard as 
well. Is there no other way to get more taxes from the big 
corporations? He commented on that, and I wish he would 
expand a little on family trusts and duplication.
<P>
	There is also the forestry sector. A lot is being done, both 
provincially and federally. One example is the so-called 
sociétés de la Vallée, which have a staff of engineers and 
technicians. What often happens is that two technicians from 
different associations turn up at the same place, so would it not 
be a good idea to have only one technician visit the landowner 
and be able 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3841"> 3841 </A></B>
<P>
to offer the whole range of services instead of having two 
technicians going separately, each with his own  proposals? I 
would like to ask the hon. member whether he could expand a 
little on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I must admit that the 
hon. member for Matapédia-Matane did listen very carefully 
to my comments about seniors.
<P>
	As I said earlier, seniors pay taxes from the day they are born 
until they retire. Even after they retire, the government still 
finds a way to claw back by taxing any income of $26,500 or 
more they derive from their pension funds, their RRSPs and 
other financial resources they managed to set aside while raising 
their families.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Today's families are a little smaller than they used to be; 
families with 9, 10 or 12 children were not uncommon when I 
was growing up. Today, they are not as common but it was hard 
for the man who was the sole income-earner in his family to 
support his family and save some money for retirement at the 
same time.
<P>
	I also said, and I am sure that in my riding of Charlevoix, from 
Petite-Rivière-Saint-François to Baie-Comeau, some seniors 
have enough money to survive, but many more were farmers, 
worked for minimum wage, or had to leave the region, while the 
mother had to raise the children on her own.
<P>
	Of course, as the hon. member for Matane said, the committee 
we want to set up could look at family trusts, for instance, and 
also look at the additional corporate revenues the government 
does not want to tax, preferring to tax capital.
<P>
	We have our work cut out for us. We have been elected for the 
next four years and I think we in the Bloc Quebecois must not be 
prevented from doing our job. Liberal members opposite often 
accuse us of criticizing government actions. I hope they do not 
want to prevent us from doing our job.
<P>
	I am convinced that the silent majority is not here in this 
House but in people's living rooms; they may be watching us on 
TV and when they see us on the street, in stores or in other 
places, they congratulate us and tell us they agree with our 
comments in this House.
<P>
	I did not complete extensive studies in accounting and I am 
not a tax expert either. I am a construction worker like most 
people in my riding and that of Matane. I am pleased to represent 
them and be able to address them as equals.
<P>
	So, Mr. Speaker, I think I have taken enough time to respond 
to my colleague from Matane-Matapédia and I will let others 
take part in the debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to hon. 
members on a subject that is close if not always dear to the 
hearts of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Taxes mean jobs for the unemployed, hospital beds for the 
sick, better schools for our children. They affect the quality of 
life of our seniors and the protection and support of Canadians in 
need.
<P>
	They affect modern transportation and communication 
systems, investment and competition. They concern workers' 
compensation, pension plans, health and safety, environmental 
and labour standards.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Taxation gives governments the resources needed to provide 
Canadians with the social and economic programs that they need 
and demand. Ultimately, the discussion of taxation is a 
discussion about our prosperity as a society.
<P>
	Taxation has traditionally been a contract between citizens 
and governments to deliver these programs in exchange for the 
moneys that Canadians give as a result of their hard work and 
based on their financial ability.
<P>
	In recent years we have seen the viability of that contract 
renegotiated as reflected in the phenomenon of the underground 
economy and also in smuggling. Faith in that contract and the 
trust that is needed to maintain it will dissolve unless 
governments give Canadians the best possible value for their tax 
dollars.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government is determined to act in such way that 
Canadians again trust their government. Without that trust, we 
will be unable to provide the necessary programs, to reduce the 
deficit and eventually to lower the tax burden of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must let the public know what is going on, what the 
choices are, and why we are making those choices.
<P>
	As revenue minister my commitment is to ensure at all times 
the integrity of our voluntary tax system. I recognize public 
confidence in our tax system is something that we have to earn. I 
and all members of the Department of National Revenue work 
every day to do just that.
<P>
	We are working to reduce the burden of compliance, to ensure 
Canadians get real value from the revenue administration, and to 
guarantee fairness throughout the tax system.
<P>
	Revenue Canada has come a long way in its efforts to improve 
administration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3842"> 3842 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We believe that we must be attentive to the needs of 
individuals and companies. We must adapt to a constantly 
changing society and to the business community.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must be fair and equitable and I believe we are. We must 
be transparent and we are. We must listen to Canadians and we 
do.
<P>
	Specifically we have a problem resolution program to help 
find solutions for taxpayers with difficulties. We have a 
voluntary disclosure policy for those with special problems, 
particularly problems of non-compliance. We have a 
declaration of taxpayers' rights to ensure equity in the system.
<P>
	We listen on an ongoing basis and we consult with the 
provinces, the small business advisory committee, the large 
business advisory committee, the charities consultative 
committee, the seniors advisory committee, and the members of 
Parliament who act quite properly on behalf of their constituents 
in bringing problems or difficulties to my attention.
<P>
	Tomorrow marks six months, the half-year of my time as 
Minister of National Revenue. In that period 1,165 letters have 
come to me from elected officials. Virtually they have been 
exclusively from members of the House and senators, although 
occasionally I get letters from members of provincial 
legislatures, mayors and city councillors.
<P>
	I repeat that it is quite right and proper for representations to 
be made to the Minister of National Revenue by members of 
Parliament. I assure members of the House in all parties, all of 
which have sent me correspondence about concerns of their 
constituents, that all such letters are treated by us as fast as we 
can and as thoroughly as we can. The reviews we give to the 
cases are as fair as possible. I should add that in every case the 
decision ultimately rendered is entirely in accordance with 
taxation laws.
<P>
	We have introduced in Revenue Canada a very successful 
E-file program that processes returns more quickly and gets the 
money owed to Canadians back to them faster than ever before. 
At the present time returns or refund cheques on E-file run about 
11, 12 or 13 days. Of course that is an average. In some cases we 
get cheques out to people within the week.
<P>
	Through the administrative consolidation of customs and 
excise and taxation we have created opportunities for significant 
administrative savings for taxpayers. This one measure alone, 
Bill C-2, the first substantive bill introduced in the House after 
the new government took office, has already resulted in a saving 
of approximately $30 million through improved administration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are working with the provinces to tackle the underground 
economy through co-operation and increased exchange of 
information. I must add that Quebec was the first province to 
conclude an agreement with the federal government on this 
subject.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The solutions of today require co-operation among all 
Canadians, individuals, businesses and governments, because 
the totality of the three levels of government represents the real 
tax burden on Canadians. There may be three levels of 
government, but it is certainly true there is only one level of 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Federal, provincial and local governments must adopt a 
harmonized approach to ensure a fair and integrated tax system 
based on the principles of equity, efficiency and effectiveness, 
words that are in this motion.
<P>
	If all three levels of government work together-and that has 
certainly been the cry of witness after witness before the finance 
committee-we can have in the future the possibility of 
reducing the tax burden on Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The department and I as revenue minister regularly meet with 
representatives of the provinces and we will continue to do so in 
order to obtain tax administration improvements quickly.
<P>
	Canadians want solutions to tax problems when these arise. 
Canadians want reform but not disruption.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is what we are doing. We are implementing reforms on a 
constant, ongoing basis, always with a strong sense that 
Canadians whether as individuals or in their businesses have 
invested a great deal of time and effort in understanding the 
existing tax system.
<P>
	When we reform various elements of the system we need to 
give everyone the time to understand and accommodate the 
changes, the time to build on the knowledge they already have, 
rather than throw everything out and start again.
<P>
	The motion we are debating today seeks equity, efficiency and 
effectiveness in the tax system. The government, the Minister of 
Finance and myself in particular are seeking to give substance to 
those principles with a pragmatic approach in which the benefits 
of change are constantly being weighed against the cost of 
disruption. We are also trying to do so with a high degree of 
sensitivity to the reality that these principles must be balanced.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3843"> 3843 </A></B>
<P>
	Equity sometimes comes at a cost in terms of efficiency, for 
example. It is fine to pursue lofty goals, but when the lofty goals 
conflict one has to recognize there is a need for compromise and 
understanding. That spirit has motivated our approach to reform 
in taxation so far. However I should add we are under no illusion 
that balancing these forces and these reforms certainly does not 
preclude action.
<P>
	Let me just read the titles of some bills which we have had in 
the House since Parliament began in January of this year. The 
first bill, Bill C-2, an act to amend the Department of National 
Revenue. It is the one I mentioned earlier. It is the consolidation 
of the administration of customs, excise and taxation in one 
department.
<P>
	Bill C-5, an act to amend the customs tariff, to which royal 
assent was given on March 24 of this year. This extended the 
general preferential tariff for certain countries to June 30, 2004 
unless an earlier date is fixed by order in council.
<P>
	Bill C-9, an act to amend the Income Tax Act. Bill C-11, an 
act to amend the Excise Act, the Customs Act and the Tobacco 
Sales to Young Persons Act. Bill C-13, an act to amend the 
Excise Tax Act. Bill C-15, an act to amend certain income tax 
law amendments.
<P>
	These are the acts relating to improving revenue 
administration in Canada which have been introduced in the 
House since January. We all know the number of acts that have 
been introduced is not extensive. We are relatively new in this 
Parliament but let us think about how many acts have related to 
the revenue portfolio and to the concept of improving and 
refining the tax system. We have had a veritable torrent of bills 
that all have as their objective improving the tax system.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I believe the record of reform the motion seeks is already 
here. I can promise the House and members who have spoken 
that there will be more. However as we do it, I wish to add, we 
will continue to be very sensitive because in our view there is a 
baby in this particular bath that we need to take care of very 
carefully. The reason I cannot support the motion is that in 
essence it would throw out the baby with the bath water, would 
throw out the bathtub and in essence gut the House as well.
<P>
	The approach of the motion would not achieve the equity, 
efficiency and effectiveness that I believe we all seek. It would 
only serve to create confusion, resentment, fear and costs, all of 
which we in government-and I am sure members of the 
opposition-should seek to avoid in the tax system.
<P>
	Canadians are sensible people. They do not want change just 
for the sake of change. They want improvements with the 
minimum disruption that can be had to achieve those 
improvements. That message is coming through loud and clear 
in the hearings of the finance committee dealing with 
replacement of the goods and services tax.
<P>
	We in government have heard that message. We heard it 
before the election. We heard it from our constituents after the 
election and specifically in the finance committee on the GST, 
again an area of reform of the tax system I did not mention in my 
listing of the bills. We have heard it there time after time after 
time.
<P>
	The government will continue to change the tax system in 
areas where the benefit clearly outweighs the cost. We will 
continue to seek to improve the operation of the tax system and 
the efficiency of the department that administers it, namely the 
Department of National Revenue. We will continue to consult 
and discuss with other governments, with individuals, with 
experts, with academics, and with businesses. We will continue 
to enforce the law as it is written until it is changed by a vote in 
Parliament.
<P>
	Our effectiveness in this regard is essential to securing the 
one true essential of an equitable, efficient and effective tax 
system: the long term confidence Canadians have in the tax 
system and in the value of the services they receive from the 
government. When we act against tax cheaters and smugglers 
we are acting to support that confidence. It is not fair at all that 
jobs are lost because of tax cheating or smuggling. It is not fair 
when revenue is lost because some people are dishonest, when 
the deficit grows and when legitimate business is forced to 
compete unfairly against those who evade their taxes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Because of individuals who do not pay their fair share of tax, 
it is difficult, if not impossible, for governments at any level to 
satisfy Canadians' demands for economic growth, lower deficits 
and meaningful jobs for the unemployed.
<P>
	Canada is a wonderful, successful country, the envy of the 
world. But I ask members of this House and all Canadians the 
following question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Can we afford to have one sick child turned away from a 
hospital because lost revenue has created a lack of beds? Can we 
allow honest and productive Canadians not to enjoy retirement 
in reasonable comfort and happiness because tax cheating has 
destroyed the value of their pensions? Can we tolerate a single 
business to close and lay off hardworking Canadians because we 
cannot guarantee a level playing field with their competitors 
who do not pay their taxes as they should? Clearly the answer is 
no.
<P>
	We seek the objectives of equity, efficiency and effectiveness 
for the tax system. We believe we can achieve that, as I trust I 
have shown in this speech today, by constantly striving to 
improve the system. I support, and I am sure all members of this 
House support, equity, efficiency and effectiveness. But the 
method of completely throwing out the present system, 
completely throwing it out to change, is not in my view in the 
interest of this country or the Canadian taxpayer.

<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member's speech. He touched on a few 
areas. One was the underground economy. There are a few 
questions that I would like to ask the hon. member.
<P>
	He talked of a new tax to take the place of the GST. People are 
a little bit apprehensive about this. Everyone wants to see the 
GST cleaned up, me especially, but people are starting to worry 
that maybe this new tax might include all consumption of food 
and so forth. They worry about the startup costs on this. Are we 
looking at another startup cost along the lines of the GST?
<P>
	There is another thing I would like to ask the hon. member. 
When I started to work I enjoyed working two shifts. It paid me 
to work two shifts. Today workers sit down and they figure out 
right to the hour when it no longer pays them to work because 
taxes now take over. I see this as a lost revenue because the jobs 
do not get done. In many cases they get put over to be done the 
next year. Small outfits that hire people in the bush and so forth 
make up to a certain amount of capital and then when the tax bite 
becomes too big they lay the people off to go on unemployment 
insurance. I wonder if the minister has looked into this area at 
all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
series of questions which he has asked.
<P>
	He talked first of the replacement for the goods and services 
tax, the GST. On that I think we are generally aware in this 
House that the committee, members of the Reform Party, 
members of the Bloc and members of the government party are 
at the present time sequestered writing a report and suggesting 
alternatives to the GST. To suggest whether the tax that they 
might be writing, of which indeed I do not know what they may 
be writing, would affect food or some other product not 
currently taxed is difficult, indeed impossible for me to answer 
directly as I am sure the hon. member recognizes.
<P>
	He talked correctly of the apprehensiveness of people when 
faced with a new tax. I suggest to the hon. member that in fact 
was very much the theme of what I said this afternoon. People 
want to have certainty with the tax system as far as it is possible 
as well as having improvements here and there.
<P>
	This is why I stressed that this incremental approach to 
improving the tax system is probably the best way because it 
reduces apprehension. You are able to deal with one section 
here, another section there. You are not saying: ``Look, we are 
throwing the whole tax system out the window and starting 
afresh''. That would be a point where perhaps the apprehension 
which the hon. member has correctly identified would come 
closer to panic.
<P>
	That is why I believe it is very important in a resolution such 
as this to make sure that we recognize the importance of that 
incremental approach. That is why I listed all those bills that 
have been brought before this House, plus the reference to the 
finance committee of the GST. All that work has been going on 
in the last four months by members of Parliament of all parties 
as they discuss these bills to show Canadians that we are trying 
to improve the tax system, trying to get better results and more 
efficiency.
<P>
	I think his concern over apprehension of it by taxpayers is 
something which I completely share and was indeed very 
fundamental in what I said this afternoon.
<P>
	He also mentioned startup costs, if I may just continue on that. 
Once again that is a very important consideration. A lot of time 
and effort is invested in any tax system. There were many 
millions of person hours spent studying it, working on it, 
preparing it. Tens of hundreds of thousands, probably millions 
of person hours were devoted over the last three or four weeks as 
people in Canada prepared their tax returns.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important for governments not to get carried away by 
bland ideas and great principles and ignore the practicality of 
making changes to the tax system.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his questions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to put my question to the Minister of 
National Revenue who said earlier that Canadians were 
responsible people, and I am sure Quebecers are as well, in 
particular the people of my riding.
<P>
	On the other hand, I wonder if the minister himself is acting 
responsibly because while over $10 billion is devoted to 
unemployment, while funding for the business assistance 
program is frozen, employment centres in my riding are telling 
me they are out of money. Self-employment assistance, the 
SEA, is frozen and enormous amounts are paid in UI benefits, 
but people who want to start up a business cannot get any 
assistance. When the BDC in our ridings cannot manage directly 
the capital stock, then it is not clear; you must become 
profitable. The BDC is almost turning into a credit union or a 
bank.
<P>
	Here is my question to the minister: Is this what he calls being 
reasonable, practical? If he is serious about helping the people 
in my riding, in Quebec and in Canada, should the way to go not 
be these programs that can help the small and medium-sized 
businesses and self-employed workers put their businesses in 
order? All that my constituents and those in other ridings as well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3845"> 3845 </A></B>
<P>
want is to create jobs for themselves. They do not want UI 
benefits. They are proud people, very proud people indeed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree that what we want and 
what Canadians want are jobs. I agree with the hon. 
member-and I congratulate him on his remarks-that the 
problem we are facing today is job shortage combined with 
difficulties starting up new businesses. I agree that this makes 
for a very difficult situation.
<P>
	I must add that it is very difficult for a government with a 
$500 billion plus debt to ignore the national debt, to ignore the 
deficit and to create jobs to help businesses. Not all programs 
are frozen. There is the unemployment insurance program and 
other programs he mentioned. That is why it is very important to 
get a report on this, a report that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and member for Winnipeg-South 
Centre is presently working on. We must try and change the 
system and help the unemployed find work instead of providing 
assistance directly to them in the form of money.
<P>
	I know that there will be differences of opinion in this House 
between parties, between members from either side of this 
House. Differences could even be expressed between members 
from the same party. I must say however that, like the hon. 
member who just spoke, I am convinced there is a need to 
provide jobs for Canadians who are presently out of work.
<P>
	The only thing I can say to finish answering his question is 
that I wish I could come before this House and announce that we 
have money to do this or that or a new program to implement. I 
really wish I could. Unfortunately, there is this debt, this 
absolutely enormous debt we have, and a deficit which is much 
too high. Given this burden we have inherited from the previous 
government, this burden which has become huge, especially 
with this problem, we cannot do all we would want to do. What 
we are trying to do is to plan structural changes such as those the 
Minister of Human Resources Development will submit to this 
House in the coming months and try to spend the money 
available as wisely and efficiently as possible.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I do hope the hon. minister and myself, as well as other hon. 
members and ministers, will have the chance to discuss the best 
way to use what little money we can devote to this task.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. As agreed 
yesterday, the time provided for the consideration of the 
opposition motion will be extended by 20 minutes due to the 
recorded vote taken earlier this day. Therefore, Private 
Members' Business will start at 5.50 p.m.
<P>
	Resuming debate. I wonder if the hon. member for North 
Vancouver could give the Chair some indication as to whether he 
will be taking up the full complement of 20 minutes or if in fact 
he will be sharing his time with a colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, members 
of the Reform will be sharing their time.
<P>
	At election time there are always promises from politicians 
that they will change the tax system to make it fair and 
equitable.
<P>
	Election after election they make these promises. Despite 
these promises being made election after election, it seems that 
a large group of taxpayers have decided in the last couple of 
years to take things into their own hands.
<P>
	What I am talking about here is that most taxpayers have now 
reached the tax saturation point. They have started acting in 
ways both legal and illegal to avoid the amount of tax they have 
been paying. For example, Department of Finance figures list 
tax revenues for September 1992 at $11.07 billion and a year 
later in September 1993 at $10.17 billion. That is down 8.13 per 
cent.
<P>
	Total revenue for April to October 1992 was $64.94 billion 
and a year later April to October 1993 $61.22 billion, a 
reduction of almost 5.75 per cent.
<P>
	While these direct tax revenues were dropping and making it 
impossible for the government to meet its deficit targets the 
major indirect tax, the GST, was also down slightly year over 
year from about $15.2 billion to $15 billion. These drops in 
revenue seems to point toward the possibility that the tax 
saturation point has indeed been reached. It could well be that 
any further attempts by this government to increase the tax 
burden will result in further reductions in revenues.
<P>
	Taxpayers have decided as I mentioned earlier that the system 
is unfair and that they will not pay any more of their earnings 
into the black hole of federal government spending. As I also 
said earlier reductions in the amount of taxes paid is being 
achieved through both legal and illegal means. Legally, by 
leaving a job where taxes are deducted at source and starting a 
little home-based business, a lot of taxpayers are discovering 
that they can deduct many expenses that they could not before.
<P>
	We know also that there is an underground economy that 
avoids the GST by negotiating cash deals for services. This in 
turn leads to lower income declarations by the people providing 
those services. The end result is that income tax revenues are 
lower as well.
<P>
	Of course there is much argument about the size of the 
underground economy. Most people if they were honest would 
say that they do know somebody who has paid cash for the GST 
discount on jobs around their home. People are not afraid to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3846"> 3846 </A></B>
<P>
admit this because they know that it is widespread. The feeling 
in the community  is that the government already gets too much 
money and they are not giving it any more to waste.
<P>
	We often hear in the emotional rhetoric of groups like the 
National Labour Congress that corporations are not paying their 
fair share of the taxes. The proof is in the fact that the percentage 
of total tax revenues being paid by corporations has dropped.
<P>
	Anyone who does even a little bit of research can see that this 
is a silly argument. Corporations on average have been making 
less money. Many of them have had large losses over the last few 
years. Clearly, if they do not make any money or have a loss they 
will not pay any taxes. Of course their percentage of 
contribution to the tax take has dropped. This does not mean that 
corporations are not paying their fair share. In fact the tax rate 
for corporations has increased over the last five years.
<P>
	I have heard from time to time members on the government 
side advocating higher corporate taxes and even implying that if 
we could just get these evil corporations to pay more taxes the 
deficit would be solved.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	To those who would try to increase taxes on corporations, I 
would like to say the following. Corporations are no different to 
people in the way that they react to overtaxation and the reason 
that they are no different to people is that they are people.
<P>
	A corporation no more pays taxes than a tractor pays taxes or a 
lap top computer pays taxes. It is the people who own the shares 
in the company who pay the taxes.
<P>
	I never sat behind a corporation in school or rode on a bus with 
a corporation or spoke on the phone to a corporation. Yet 
corporations are faced with income taxes, payroll taxes, 
property taxes, T-1s, T-4s, T-5s, AMTs, T-778s, TCTBs and in 
fact they are tee'd off, as my colleague from Calgary Centre 
mentioned yesterday.
<P>
	The owners of small corporations are usually a few members 
of the same family or partnership of friends. The ownership of 
large corporations is their shareholders, often the pension funds 
of these very same unions that complain that the corporations 
are not paying enough taxes.
<P>
	The number one cost to business these days is taxes and those 
costs have to be passed on to the consumer just like any other 
cost the business faces. Those same groups who demand that 
property taxes should be higher for those greedy landlords then 
complain when the tax increases are passed on in the form of 
increased rents.
<P>
	I repeat again that anyone who thinks that a corporation is 
going to act any differently to an individual is dreaming. A 
corporation is formed in the first place by an individual or group 
of individuals who get together and use their tax paid money to 
form that corporation.
<P>
	The corporation will then cross-border shop. It will use all the 
available tax deductions and it will even move to another 
country if it perceives that the conditions in Canada are unfair. 
The excessive government taxation levels of today have led to 
corporate tax saturation as well as personal tax saturation. The 
loss of thousands of jobs as companies move to locations where 
the tax burden is lower is a disgrace.
<P>
	I have mentioned in this House before that my New Zealand 
background has made me very familiar with the debt crisis 
experienced in New Zealand in 1984. As a result of that crisis, 
the New Zealand government learned that New Zealanders had 
reached tax saturation point and that the government would have 
to spend less and tax less.
<P>
	Ten years later according to an analysis released by the 
Toronto-Dominion Bank on April 25, 1994, just this last week, 
there are some dramatic comparisons that can be made between 
the Canadian and New Zealand economies. Two years ago, for 
instance, it cost New Zealand 90 basis points more to issue 
10-year money than it did for Canada.
<P>
	Now it costs New Zealand 150 basis points less than it costs 
Canada. In that same time New Zealand's unemployment rate 
has dropped from above 13 per cent down to 9 per cent and the 
real GDP has risen to 5 per cent. There is a budget surplus 
expected this year of almost $1 billion. This massive 
improvement is a direct result of the New Zealand government's 
decision to spend less and tax less. The Canadian government 
could do well to learn from that lesson.
<P>
	The Toronto-Dominion Bank's outlook for the Canadian 
dollar continues to be bearish because of the failure of this 
government to recognize the seriousness of its taxation and 
spending problems.
<P>
	In closing, I would urge the government to recognize that we 
have indeed reached tax saturation point and that it should first 
develop a plan to get control of federal spending and second, to 
work toward a simplified, single tax system in keeping with the 
spirit of the motion before us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the 
motion before the House today. I would like to begin by talking 
about the role of government in a free society.
<P>
	The cornerstone of freedom and justice requires 
acknowledgement of at least one fundamental principle: each 
person owns him or herself. We in Canada accept this principle 
and indeed embrace it because the antithesis of self-ownership 
is of course slavery which western democracies have 
condemned. I do not believe anyone in this country would ever 
knowingly endorse slavery.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3847"> 3847 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	An operational definition of slavery is that a person toils 
while having no ownership rights to the fruits of his toil. They 
are owned and/or controlled by someone else. Therefore, private 
or collective theft is an attack on the principle of 
self-ownership; a person works hard to produce tangible 
benefits, for example a car or a television, a house or money, and 
the theft of this violates the principle of self-ownership. 
Murder, kidnapping, assault and other acts of violence are also 
an attack on the principle of self-ownership and therefore must 
be prohibited.
<P>
	Self-ownership also implies that two or more individuals 
should be free to engage in peaceable voluntary exchange 
without interference by third parties.
<P>
	The protection of these rights, called natural law by 
philosopher John Locke and others, constitutes the proper role 
of a moral government. In other words, the role of government is 
to protect people from domestic aggression, protect the nation 
from foreign attack and, through a judiciary system, resolve 
disputes arising among its citizens.
<P>
	Contrast this ideal with what has happened in Canada over the 
past three decades. There has been a concerted attack on the 
principle of self-ownership through the tax system. The federal 
government has gradually increased taxation levels to a point at 
which today the average Canadian has to work for more than half 
a year just to pay his or her tax bill.
<P>
	We like to consider Canada a free country, but just how free 
are we when we are forced to give up half of everything we 
produce? In my view we have all become, to a large extent, 
slaves to Revenue Canada.
<P>
	I ask the House if this is not in fact the case. Furthermore I ask 
just because our tax system has the force of law behind it, does 
that make it morally right?
<P>
	South Africa had a system of apartheid for many years. That 
was also backed by the force of law, enforced by the state. Did 
the fact that apartheid was state sanctioned make it morally 
right? What about slavery in the United States in the last 
century? Was slavery morally right just because the government 
decreed it was law?-of course not.
<P>
	In fact, apartheid and slavery represent the ultimate abuse of 
the principle of self-ownership. With the rise of the welfare 
state or state socialism all governments, including Canada, have 
in varying degrees made significant departures from moral 
government functions. The welfare state is immoral because it 
violates one of the basic foundations of self-ownership, the 
right to own what one produces.
<P>
	State socialism is a political process whereby property that 
rightfully belongs to one person is confiscated and given to 
another to whom it does not belong.
<P>
	The primary justification for this attack on self-ownership, at 
least that led by otherwise decent people, can be found in 
people's desire to do good things like help the poor, care for the 
elderly, help the sick, or create a fair income distribution.
<P>
	While these may be commendable objectives, the fact of the 
matter is that government does not have any resources of its very 
own. Acknowledgement that government does not have any 
resources of its own forces us to recognize that the only way 
governments can give one citizen a dollar is to first, through 
intimidation, threats and coercion, confiscate that dollar from 
some other citizen.
<P>
	If you do not believe that Revenue Canada uses intimidation, 
threats and coercion, just try not paying your taxes and see what 
happens.
<P>
	In a moral society voluntary exchange should be maximized 
and involuntary exchange minimized. A society which 
maximizes voluntary exchange can be described as embracing 
free enterprise or a market driven economy. The opposite of a 
market economy is, of course, a command economy. There is 
ample empirical evidence as we approach the end of the 20th 
century that command economies do not work. The former 
Soviet Union is a graphic example of this.
<P>
	It is no coincidence that individual freedom and liberty are 
virtually non-existent in a command economy because 
governments which maximize involuntary exchange must rely 
on the force of law and the force of a police state to achieve their 
aims.
<P>
	Command economies by their very nature are immoral and in 
fact evil. The elite political apparatus uses the power of the state 
to coerce citizens to accept their economic dictates.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	What I find disconcerting is the extent to which Canada, 
which prides itself on being a free country, has moved toward 
involuntary exchange.
<P>
	Consider that the average Canadian must work until sometime 
in July to become free of his tax burden. The first six months of 
each year are spent producing wealth which is confiscated 
against his will through taxation. This money is then spent on a 
variety of government initiatives and programs that the taxpayer 
in many cases would not support on a voluntary basis.
<P>
	Walter Williams, the renowned professor of economics at 
George Mason University, characterizes this as economic rape. 
In a free market business cannot get a dollar from me unless I 
voluntarily give it first. If a special interest group wants my 
money it will have to come to me first and convince me that it 
truly does represent my interest before I choose to give it the 
money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3848"> 3848 </A></B>
<P>
	Consider Canada today. Canadian businesses and special 
interest groups can get my money from me whether I choose to 
give it to them or not. They only have to come to Ottawa to get 
permission.
<P>
	For example, when the directors of Massey-Ferguson, 
International Harvester or Bombardier want my money, when 
representatives of the National Action Committee on the Status 
of Women or the arts community needs some dough they could 
come knocking on my door and ask me but they know that I 
would probably tell them to get lost. They know that and so they 
come to Ottawa to secure the assistance of the government to 
force me to give them my money.
<P>
	Thomas Paine warned that government, even in its best state, 
is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one.
<P>
	We are all aware that government needs money to operate, to 
perform its legitimate role. This money has to be obtained 
through taxes which of course constitutes coercion. However, if 
government limits itself to its moral functions coercion is 
minimized.
<P>
	The federal government has strayed from this ideal, far from 
this ideal. When we see billions of dollars shovelled out to 
Canadian business and industry, to special interest groups, to 
subsidize money losing crown corporations and in direct 
transfers to Canadian families that already have incomes of over 
$100,000 a year we know the taxpayer has been had.
<P>
	There is no justification for which this is acceptable. This is a 
perversion of government, a direct assault on the individual 
liberty of our citizens and a serious violation of the principle of 
self-ownership. I would argue that since we work more than half 
of the year to pay our taxes we are more than one-half slaves to 
the dictates of this federal government.
<P>
	The most disturbing news is that with our massive debt and 
ongoing $40 billion deficit Canadians are destined to continue 
as slaves to a greater and greater degree.
<P>
	Until government reduces spending in a meaningful way this 
will not change. Therefore, while changes to income tax could 
surely make the system fairer and more user friendly the 
government must couple this with serious spending reductions, 
with the idea that Canadians have a right to self-ownership and 
will make better economic decisions on a voluntary basis than 
this government ever will through its top down, command 
management.
<P>
	People in countries with larger amounts of economic freedom 
are far richer and have greater human rights protections than 
people who live in countries where state socialism prevails.
<P>
	The free market with its supporting institutions of private 
ownership of property and voluntary exchange not only 
advances the human condition but promotes a more moral 
relationship among people. The most important case for free 
markets is its consistency with  and promotion of fundamental 
moral principles and respect for human rights.
<P>
	Our tax system, more particularly the level of taxation in 
Canada, stands in dark contrast to the ideals of freedom, liberty 
and self-ownership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was astounded to hear the hon. member's speech. I thought I was 
listening to something in 1790. This is 1994, I should remind the 
hon. member. We are in the 1990s. It has been 200 years since 
the people he quoted wrote what they wrote. I think he quoted 
Locke and Paine. Old Tom Paine has been dead about 200 years 
as I recall, the hon. member can correct me. What he wrote was 
relevant in his day, but surely to goodness this is grossly 
antiquated at this point in time. Things have changed.
<P>
	When I was a student of politics I remember reading Tom 
Paine and some of Locke's stuff. It was regarded as dated then 
and that was 25 or 30 years ago. I think the hon. member really 
ought to update his authorities and come up with something of 
the late 20th century in which we now live. To go back and quote 
these people as a basis for saying that we are now half slaves is 
frankly unbelievable and unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	I noted the hon. member in his speech did not mention a thing 
about the benefits we get with the taxes we pay. This is 
something that members of the Reform Party seem to forget with 
monotonous regularity. They harp about government programs 
that are wasteful. He referred to grants to artists and to the 
National Action Committee on the Status of Women as 
examples of grants he thought were wastes of money. However 
he never told us where the cuts were going to come. If we cut 
those grants, whether it be the grants to artists or grants to the 
national action committee, we would not save very much money 
and he knows that.
<P>
	What he really is talking about is cutting off the poorest of the 
poor at the bottom of our social ladder and telling them: ``You 
people will have to make do on your own. We are going back to 
17th century living where the poor get their money from a 
church or some other charitable organization and nothing 
whatever from the government''.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> The deserving poor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The deserving poor, as the hon. member for 
Halifax says. If that is what the hon. member is saying, let him 
and his colleagues stand up and say it. Let them tell the House 
where the cuts are going to come because he knows all the 
government programs alone make up a very small percentage of 
the total federal budget. If the government was eliminated 
tomorrow there would still be a deficit on the books of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3849"> 3849 </A></B>
<P>
Government of Canada. He knows that to administer all the 
other programs there is a cost.
<P>
	I ask him to come clean with Canadians and tell us which 
programs he is going to cut. Is it medicare? Is it old age 
pensions? Is it the Canada pension plan or what? It has to be one 
of those and he knows it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his comments. I would like to say that the first cut we proposed 
was to the MPs' pension plan, for which we did not get any 
support from the other side of the House.
<P>
	I would like to say further that just because the words of 
Aristotle and Plato and Jesus Christ were said 2000 years ago, 
does that make them any less relevant today? Is the truth not the 
truth? Is right not right and wrong not wrong? Does right 
become wrong or wrong become right just because 200 years 
have gone by?
<P>
	I ask the hon. member to consider that the reason these people 
are quoted is because they spoke the truth. They had a 
fundamental understanding of the way society could best 
construct itself to operate in a manner that allowed personal 
freedom and liberty to exist. The hon. member laughs but he is 
not listening to the words.
<P>
	Furthermore, the cuts the Reform Party proposed during the 
election campaign were very detailed. Obviously the hon. 
member has never looked at them but it is there for all to see. It 
is very comprehensive. It is probably a little outdated now 
because the cuts are going to have to be even more severe based 
on the deficits we are running. We made that plan on a deficit 
that has since ballooned significantly.
<P>
	I will close by saying that the information is there. If the hon. 
member would like I will make sure he gets a copy of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was just 
driven to my feet by the riveting speech of the member opposite. 
I too could not quite believe what I heard but it was entertaining. 
It was a bit of comic relief in the Chamber which we do not often 
get.
<P>
	I would just like to follow up on the comments of my 
colleague from Kingston. It is easy enough to sit down and be 
critical. It is easy to tell the Canadian public that you can solve 
all of the ills that afflict government and their personal 
situations. It is easy to say that you can solve the deficit 
situation overnight. It is called cutting, cutting and cutting. But 
when you cut, cut, cut you create another problem. You inflict 
pain on the people who can least afford to have that pain 
inflicted.
<P>
	During the election campaign members of the Reform Party 
were quite good at going around talking about how they were 
going to control the deficit. Each and every time they were asked 
tough questions such as: How would you deal with the national 
defence budget? Would you cut Canada's standing forces by 40 
per cent? ``Oh no,'' they said. ``We do not want to talk about that 
right now. We would just cut''.
<P>
	When you ask them about Canada's health care system and 
whether or not the proposals they were putting forward would 
jeopardize the integrity of the Canadian health care system and 
how those cuts would affect it, they did not want to answer.
<P>
	Therefore, I want to ask the member this question. He 
mentioned during his speech that Canadians are slaves to the 
government and that they do not choose every expenditure that 
the government makes on their behalf. I think that is true. Since 
he is in a condemning mood today about all the programs that 
past governments have spent money on, does he believe the 
taxpayers in Canada were consulted before they started paying 
for his leader's suits and car?
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the 
last comment first. The taxpayers of Canada are not paying for 
that. That is coming from party funds.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Furthermore when we look at the 
spending program-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I think we would all like 
to hear the answer to the question. The hon. member for Skeena.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we look at the 
spending of government over the last couple of decades and we 
look at the billions of dollars that have been shovelled out to 
grants and subsidies to Canadian business and industry, when we 
look at the billions of dollars that have been shovelled out to 
foreign aid through CIDA to countries that do not need it and 
where the rank and file people of those countries do not benefit 
but the governments do, when we look at the Auditor General's 
report when he talks about the massive amounts of government 
waste, those are the things that Canadians are keying in on.
<P>
	If the hon. member on the other side thinks that Canadians are 
in the same mode as he is, that they support the massive 
government spending that is going on right now, he is in for a 
very rude awakening down the road.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say that I 
am delighted to take part in the debate today.
<P>
	While we are having a plethora of quotes from great minds of 
the 18th century, perhaps we could get in a quote from the 20th 
century. I am particularly interested that the hon. member for 
Skeena picked out the National Action Committee on the Status 
of Women to suggest as being unworthy of government funding. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3850"> 3850 </A></B>
<P>
Is it not interesting that the hon. member would pick a women's 
group and I wonder if he would go so far as to extend that to 
other women's groups as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> REAL Women.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Yes, indeed, thank you to the hon. member for 
Winnipeg St. James.
<P>
	I would tell him that there is a very famous quote with regard 
to where women fit in our society. I would quote that well known 
20th century philosopher, Chairman Mao Tse-Tung, who said 
women hold up half the sky. It might be interesting if the hon. 
member looked into that just a bit. The quotations of Chairman 
Mao in his little red book are almost as relevant to the workings 
of this House as the rantings of the 18th century mind of Mr. 
Locke and some others. However that is a mere bagatelle and we 
will continue to the matter at hand.
<P>
	I am particularly delighted to take part in the debate today 
because I think it is terribly important, as it frequently is in this 
Chamber, to put a human face on the work we do here. I am 
always delighted to be in the Chamber to hear my colleague and 
good friend from across Halifax harbour, the member for 
Dartmouth, as well my colleague and good friend, the member 
for Kingston and the Islands because the experiences in their 
own lives frequently puts a human face on the work that we do 
here.
<P>
	We talk about cuts. I say this with the greatest of respect, 
because it is a long tradition in the House that we do not impute 
motive and that each one of us as parliamentarians understands 
that every other one of us as parliamentarians, is here to do the 
best job he or she can do according to his or her lights. We are 
here to represent our constituents and to do the best we can as 
well for all the people of Canada. We represent very different 
views, but the reason for us being here is the highest. 
Consequently I want to talk about some of those groups that 
exist on government largess, those groups that my friend from 
the other side perhaps in his lack of comprehension or just in his 
lack of experience thinks are not worthy of government 
attention.
<P>
	Let me talk about women's groups in particular. Let me talk 
about transition houses. Let me talk about women's centres. Let 
me talk about women's health centres. Let me talk about shelters 
for young people. Let me talk about shelters for women who 
have recently been released from prison. Although coming 
under the specifics of provincial funding, all of these receive 
grants in varying amounts from either the women's program 
under human resources or under Employment Canada or under 
other government programs.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Let me tell members how important these are. I believe that 
the hon. member in his own soul knows that these things are 
important too. He says he does not. Okay, he asked for it. Let me 
tell him about the women who are driven from their homes in the 
middle of the night in fear of violence, in fear of their own lives, 
in fear of the lives of their children.
<P>
	Let me tell him about the women who are attempting to 
reconstruct lives after serving a prison term, after being helped 
through a group, for example, like Stepping Stone in Halifax 
which helps prostitutes get off the street and get back into 
normal society.
<P>
	Let me talk about women who desperately seek to improve 
their level of education so they can break the cycle of welfare. 
Let me talk about people in general, but mostly women because 
the vast majority of those people suffering under the yoke of 
poverty in this country are women.
<P>
	Let me say what would happen to them if the kind of federal 
funding that the hon. member in his pardonable but perhaps 
frightening level of knowledge wants to remove from the federal 
budget. Let me tell the member what would happen to them.
<P>
	Places like Byrony House, a transition House in Halifax 
would be shut down. Places like Phoenix House, a shelter for 
young people would be shut down. Places like the St. Leonard's 
Society which assist people who come out of prison and who are 
trying to make a new start would be shut down.
<P>
	We have already seen what happens when cutbacks meant that 
a great number of people suffering from various kinds of mental 
illnesses have had to be released on to the street. We have seen in 
the last 10 years, the years of the Mulroney government-the 
hon. member should pay attention, he may learn 
something-what has happened when a lack of compassion has 
contributed to an ignorance level and people do not see what is 
happening to the big picture.
<P>
	Go to the streets of any major city in this country. Go to my 
city of Halifax, a small city, and see the number of young people 
who are on the streets. See the number of people with various 
kinds of mental disorders who are on the streets because there is 
no place for them and because the funding is not there.
<P>
	Go to Montreal and Toronto and Vancouver and Winnipeg and 
Calgary and Edmonton and you will see them. Is this what you 
want in your country? Is this what you want to be the legacy of 
your children? Is this what you want the world to say Canada 
stands for and Canada means?
<P>
	If it is, I have to say that it is not what I want and it is not what 
anybody on this side of the House wants from the hon. member 
for Saint-Maurice who is the Prime Minister to the latest elected 
backbencher on the government side.
<P>
	On this side of the House, we have a history and a tradition 
that says that you can do two things. Yes, on that side of the 
House too, as my hon. friend from Ontario reminds me, along 
with the rump as well. We have a history and a tradition in the 
Liberal Party that says the two things that drive the engine of 
government are not incompatible and those two things are 
compassion and fiscal responsibility. People who believe that 
the two do not go hand in hand with the greatest of  respect, just 
do not understand the way government works.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3851"> 3851 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	We on this side of the House have a great tradition of reform in 
the best sense of the word. This is the party of Joseph Howe. 
This is the party of Wilfrid Laurier. This is the party of Lester 
Pearson. And thank God, this is the party of Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau and the party of Jean Chrétien.
<P>
	The question of reform has always been near and dear to the 
hearts of Liberals because it is reform with a compassionate 
face. It is reform to ensure that Canadians have a standard of 
living that is second to none.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Dartmouth asked the learned 
members on the other side where they would cut. I can 
remember, and I know the hon. member from Dartmouth 
remembers this as well, five or six years ago the hon. member 
for Dartmouth, the hon. member for Willowdale, who is 
currently the chair of the finance committee, and I went out for 
supper after a committee meeting. We talked about the jewel in 
the crown of Canadian social programs, and that is medicare.
<P>
	The hon. member for Dartmouth's history is in a small coal 
mining town on Cape Breton Island. I came from not too far 
from there myself, but was brought up in a larger city. The hon. 
member for Willowdale was brought up in the city of London, 
Ontario.
<P>
	We discovered that each one of us had the experience in our 
early childhood of seeing members of our families seriously ill 
and prevented from getting the kind of medical care needed. 
Actually, in my case it was not prevented. My father had an 
illness for three weeks. When he died, my mother was cleaned 
out. There was no money left. Everything was gone because this 
was pre-medicare. The hon. member for Dartmouth's father 
suffered an industrial accident which devastated his family 
financially. The hon. member for Willowdale had a similar 
experience.
<P>
	The three of us talked about this. I remember it so well. It 
impressed me so deeply that the three of us, coming from our 
different experiences were utterly committed to the fact that 
never in this country should Canadians have to worry about 
medical care. Never in this country should Canadians have to 
think that they could not get treatment or medical services that 
are life sustaining without a complete and utter danger of 
bankruptcy within their family.
<P>
	I was seven years old when my father died. I remember the 
devastation of his death, obviously. But I also remember what 
clearly was a fear in my mother's heart because she was left a 
widow with no resources. My father had been a pretty successful 
businessman. But there was no medicare and three weeks in a 
hospital cleaned out everything they had managed to save and 
compile in 10 years.
<P>
	That is unacceptable. That is not even something which 
should be allowed to be contemplated. When hon. members 
from the Reform Party talk about cuts, when they talk about user 
pay which with the greatest respect is absolutely one of the 
dumbest theories I have ever heard of but I leave that for another 
debate, when they talk about these things I wonder if they have 
truly investigated and looked at the situation.
<P>
	I would advise the hon. members to go into the Library of 
Parliament and look at an all-party report, a unanimous report 
done by the health and welfare committee in the first two years 
of the last Parliament.
<P>
	The report talked about the kinds of changes that would deal 
well with medicare. Unfortunately that report has never been 
given the kind of light it needs. It talks about preventive 
medicine. It talks about the kinds of things for example that the 
province of Quebec is particularly good at. I forget the name and 
I do not know if any of my colleagues here can help me, but there 
is a name for medical centres in the province of Quebec-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> CLSC.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I thank the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. Yes, CLSC.
<P>
	There is something similar in my own riding, the North End 
Community clinic in Halifax. A particular form of community 
based medicine can save us a lot of money. This is clearly the 
way we are going to have to go and not to what I call band-aid, 
short sighted remedies like user pay.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	This government and the red book that is the basis of this 
government's policy in this Parliament has a commitment to the 
people of Canada in the creation of jobs, in the creation of 
dignity, and in the absolute commitment to the fact that all 
Canadians are equal in the area of opportunity.
<P>
	You are not somehow a second class citizen because you live 
in one part of the country as opposed to another part, or a second 
class citizen because your family tradition is to go down to the 
sea and fish rather than get a university degree, or rather than go 
to the farm and plough, or whatever. Canadians have an equality 
of opportunity and a right to have those opportunities and the 
services of their government from sea to sea to sea.
<P>
	It is not something you will be more entitled to if you live in 
an urban riding. It is not something you will be more entitled to 
if you live in Ontario. It is not something you will be less 
entitled to if you live in the Northwest Territories.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3852"> 3852 </A></B>
<P>
	It certainly is not something you will be less entitled to if you 
happen to be franco-Canadian-if I can say that, French 
Canadian-or if you happen to be a member of an ethnocultural 
group that did not necessarily get here 400 years ago.
<P>
	The point is that we in this government are committed totally 
to the marriage of compassion and responsibility. As well, the 
point is that in spite of the meanderings I hear from time to time 
from our learned colleagues on the other side-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Diatribes.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> That, too. Diatribes. At any rate, the 
meanderings and diatribes from the other side.
<P>
	There is something I have wanted to talk about for some time 
and this appears to be a good time. One hundred and seventy-six 
ridings in this country sent Liberals to the House of Commons. 
Out of 295 ridings that makes-
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> A majority.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> A majority. Exactly. I am delighted to see that 
the hon. member from Beaver River understands that.
<P>
	The hon. member for Beaver River has been here for a little 
while. Maybe she has a better grasp of it because some of her 
colleagues seem to think that the policy bus is driven by the 
opposition. We are here to say that the policy bus is not driven by 
the opposition; the policy bus is driven by the government. And 
the gas in the policy bus on this side goes back-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> What happens to the people?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> The people are on the policy bus with their 176 
MPs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Then why do you make them push?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> They do not have to push because they know 
where the wheels are.
<P>
	Hon. members on the other side do not seem to realize that all 
they have to do in actual fact is look at the most recent polls. Call 
me naive, but it looks like people are relatively happy with what 
is happening on this side of the House. Not just in Atlantic 
Canada where they are more than happy, but it looks like right 
across the country the approval rating for the Prime Minister and 
for this government is fairly high.
<P>
	Now that cannot last forever and those of us who have a little 
experience in politics understand that. But the point is that you 
do not cut your cloth in policy on the government side of the 
House according to prevailing winds. You cut it according to 
what is best for Canadians, what is a tried and true policy, what 
is something that has been proven to work, and what is done in 
the judgment of a Prime Minister who has 30 years experience in 
this House of Commons and in every major portfolio in the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	That is the kind of policy and the kind of work and the kind of 
government Canadians want, deserve and have asked for. That is 
the kind of thing a number of the hon. members on the other side 
could certainly benefit from listening to. But again-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Regardless of cost.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Somebody is yelling over there. I do wish he 
would keep quiet.
<P>
	At any rate when I conclude my remarks I promise the hon. 
member I will give ear to any comments he wishes to make, at 
least briefly.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	The motion today in somewhat florid language states that this 
House implore the government. The government does not need 
to be implored. I do not think there has been a government in the 
history of Canada that has gone further in consultation with 
Canadians.
<P>
	In case hon. members across the way have forgotten, the 
Minister of Finance met with Canadians from all walks of life in 
five major centres across this country. I happen to remember the 
minister at the meeting in Halifax saying: ``Tell me where to cut. 
Where do you want me to cut?'' I remember him listening and I 
remember him reacting.
<P>
	The hon. member across the way says he did not listen. I trust 
the hon. member got a few letters for example from the doctors 
and a few other people in this country. The hon. minister did 
listen.
<P>
	What this government does best and will continue to do is it 
listens. This government with its majority, put here by the vast 
majority of Canadians, will continue to listen. It will continue to 
remember that the most important thing for government is to 
remember compassion, to remember humanity, to remember 
equality and to remember who put us here.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments of the hon. member. I was amused. I 
appreciated the spelling. That was wonderful, but I think the 
<I>Hansard</I> people do quite well.
<P>
	Let us remember another party that was here recently. It had a 
majority of approximately 170 as well and we know where it 
ended up. Let us remember you can go from great heights to 
great depths here. If we are going to brag about how we have 
done, the increase in this party was not half bad either going 
from one member to 52. Mathematics is not my strongest point 
but our percentage increase was pretty marvellous.
<P>
	Nonetheless, let us get on to more serious things rather than 
spelling particular words and meandering and diatribing, if I can 
make that a verb.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about compassion and responsibility. 
We agree with that on this side of the House. What we need to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3853"> 3853 </A></B>
<P>
realize is the best thing we could do is to show and exercise 
compassion to the people in this country who truly need it.
<P>
	I appreciate the hon. member's comments about women's 
shelters and transition homes. They are necessary. The only way 
we will be able to preserve those and to make sure that medicare 
stays strong and solid in this country is to get a grasp on the 
deficit. That will make sure those programs remain strong. We 
cannot just continue to spend our way into oblivion and then say 
we are committing ourselves 100 per cent to this. The debt will 
destroy it. My friend knows this. The debt will destroy those 
programs faster than anything else.
<P>
	Let me talk about the National Action Committee on the 
Status of Women. As a woman I may have more right or 
responsibility or whatever than my friend from Skeena to say I 
believe that many of these groups which are funded by 
government should be funded by the people who believe they 
exist for a particular reason. They are the ones who should be 
looking after them. Let us make sure we are not always coming 
to government begging for money to perform the tasks we think 
are important. If I believe groups are worthwhile, I will fund 
them.
<P>
	The most responsible and compassionate thing government 
could do would be to eliminate and lower tax loads and 
frustration levels for people in this country who are feeling 
totally overburdened. As a citizen I should be able to see the 
light at the end of the tunnel. I should be able to relieve my tax 
burden so that I can turn around and exercise compassion 
humanly, individually to fund some of those groups I think are 
important.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to prove to us that raising debt 
loads, raising deficits and raising taxation levels in this country 
are compassionate.
<P>
	How is the government ever going to be able to exercise true 
compassion by spending the legacy of the children she talks 
about? What about the legacy to our children? To whom are we 
leaving this exorbitant debt? You cannot go on one side and then 
the other. The hon. member talks about the legacy of children. 
What about the legacy this government is leaving to children, 
which is the enormous debt that it will never pay off?
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Beaver 
River for her comments. I must have missed something which I 
suppose is possible but unlikely. However I have just a couple of 
points in case the hon. member has missed something.
<P>
	The government has not raised taxes and the government has 
not raised the debt. Indeed the government is lowering both. 
Perhaps if the member paid attention to the comments of the 
Minister of Finance she would realize that.
<P>
	I listened, I listened hard, and the member for Brant said to me 
as she went across to her seat: ``Have they said where they are 
going to cut?'' I did not hear them say where they were going to 
cut. They said they were going to cut the National Action 
Committee on the Status of Women, a favour whipping post, I 
might add. May I say that on occasion the national action 
committee and I have not always seen eye to eye on process 
although our goals are very similar. It may come as a raving 
shock to members on the other side that according to most 
statistics and most polls over 90 per cent of Canadian women, 
whether they call themselves feminists or not, happen to hold 
the same goals as the national action committee.
<P>
	Probably what the hon. member does not know is that some 
groups belonging to the National Action Committee on the 
Status of Women such as women's institutes, the United Church 
Women of Canada and the YWCA of Canada, mainstream 
women's groups, hold very strong views and are part and parcel 
of the group. I do not want to cut the funding to them.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member, not having a whole lot of 
experience in the area of feminism and gender equality, would 
not know that women making 60 cents for every dollar that men 
make have to do fairly basic things like pay the rent, feed their 
children and a few other important things. They do not have a lot 
of money to give away. Governments are important in this 
regard. We are not going to cut off our noses to spite our faces 
which appears to be the kind of thing the hon. member is 
advocating.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to make 
the observation that while I chose to quote Paine and Locke, the 
hon. member chose to quote Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, 
aside from having a very small mind, was responsible for one of 
the most atrocious, unspeakable genocides committed under his 
leadership in China. If she chooses to hold him up as a model, I 
guess that is for Canadians to see.
<P>
	The hon. member imputed that my party was against 
supporting people in Canada who genuinely require support. 
That is totally false. I made that very clear in my points. I do not 
know how the hon. member can equate the National Action 
Committee on the Status of Women to people out on the streets 
or in Canada who really need assistance from the government.
<P>
	Third, she is quite right. They are driving the policy bus. I am 
glad I am not on it because that policy bus is careening down the 
street right now at the rate of $100 million a day. There is a dead 
end coming up pretty shortly. They are the ones who will be 
responsible because they are in the driver's seat.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member for 
Skeena got up because I wanted to make a comment. I am not 
particularly going to deal with the meanderings of the hon. 
member in his last comment, but he did talk earlier about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3854"> 3854 </A></B>
<P>
something very dear to my heart. I happen  to know it is dear to 
the heart of the member for Rosedale sitting over there as well, 
not to mention a few other members in the House, and that is the 
whole question of arts funding.
<P>
	Along with the compassionate face of government and the 
kind of funding that we in the Liberal Party with our 150-year 
history in the country will continue, may I say the country that 
does not funds its artists, the country that does not make 
representation on behalf of its own culture, is the country that 
has no soul. The country that has no soul will wither on the vine. 
If the hon. member would like to see the country wither on the 
vine, I am sure one the fastest ways to do it is to say that we as a 
federal government should not be funding the arts.
<P>
	I can also say I would be very interested to see how many hon. 
members on the other side would be prepared within their own 
communities to stand and deny the kind of general small group 
funding they were probably working on. I saw a number of 
reports in the newspaper about how they worked on their SEED 
grants. Did they cut in their ridings all those SEED grants to all 
the groups they mentioned? I doubt it. If they did, I think that 
getting off the plane when they get home, even after flying 
economy class, would be a bit more difficult than they 
heretofore encountered.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is only a very brief 
period of time left for questions or comments so we will keep it 
short.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise because I am shocked and dismayed. I listened to two 
colleagues on my side deliver their speeches. I was awaiting a 
rebuttal from the other side because my colleague suggested 
there was no tax relief in sight for Canadian companies. I was 
awaiting the plan that I know exists on the other side but we 
never got it.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Halifax stood I thought we are 
going to get it. This is not a sharp shooter. This is a Gatling gun. I 
thought she would mow down that false notion but she did not do 
so either. I feel compelled now to inform the House what the 
Liberal plan is.
<P>
	The Liberal plan is to raise the taxes of Canadian companies. 
If the Liberals raise those taxes a notch higher, those companies 
will then qualify for tax exemptions as non-profit 
organizations. That is the Liberal plan. I am surprised they did 
not share it with us.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> A closing comment from 
the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to say on the advice of 
the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell very slowly 
that we did not raise taxes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Mercier-Social programs; the hon. member for 
Richelieu-Hibernia project; the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Transcona-VIA Rail; the hon. member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies-Hibernia project; the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup-Unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to switch gears a bit and talk in a non-partisan way 
about some matters which I think are extremely important for 
the country.
<P>
	The debate I just witnessed, the shouting, the unpleasantness 
that took place here and the emptiness of the political rhetoric 
are the kinds of things that have turned so many people against 
politics. It is a sad thing to observe, sitting in the Chamber.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the fact that the underground 
economy is widely discussed in Canada these days. In these 
discussions the need for lower taxes and the reform of the 
taxation system are regularly linked. In my remarks I will 
expand on these subjects drawing heavily on information which 
I have obtained as a member of the Standing Committee on 
Finance on possible changes to the GST and during a recent 
Fraser Institute conference on the growth of the underground 
economy in Vancouver.
<P>
	During the recent hearings of the finance committee many 
witnesses noted their concern that the GST had been a major 
cause of the growth of the underground economy, the loss of 
government revenue, and the precarious state of the 
government's fiscal condition. These witnesses reflected their 
own experiences as well as those shared by researchers and the 
general public. There is widespread agreement that the 
underground economy was encouraged by the introduction of 
the GST. This tax induced evasion because it is visible and 
imposed on every consumer purchase.
<P>
	Evasion is encouraged additionally by the fact that consumers 
do not face any penalties for non-payment of the tax. Evasion is 
particularly high among small firms that supply services with a 
high labour content. In these industries honest owners are forced 
by competition from just a few bad apples into operating outside 
the law.
<P>
	The GST is not the only determinant of the underground 
economy. High marginal tax rates on personal income provide 
incentives that often reinforce the reward of evading the GST. If 
you are hanged you might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a 
lamb. Onerous regulations of business and large surcharges on 
labour costs mandated by the government also encourage firms 
and workers to operate outside the regular economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3855"> 3855 </A></B>
<P>
	There are strong incentives for persons receiving 
unemployment insurance or welfare benefits to work in their 
own households as well as in the underground economy without 
reporting their incomes. These social security systems penalize 
beneficiaries with 100 per cent tax rate on reported income 
above only a very small amount.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Many people are particularly concerned about the growth of 
the underground economy because it appears to be accompanied 
by a change in public attitude about the morality of tax evasion. 
In a recent survey 71 per cent of Canadians indicated that ``most 
people would cheat on their taxes if they knew they could get 
away with it''. Seventy-nine per cent agreed that people who 
pay all the taxes they should are fools. Can we believe that? 
Thirty-two per cent considered acceptable the evasion of the 
GST by other people.
<P>
	Some analysts believe that social capital in the form of 
honesty, which in the past has made Canadians among the most 
compliant in the world in the voluntary filing of their income 
taxes, may have been lost irretrievably.
<P>
	However it is important that the government at least try to get 
Canadians to return to their traditional honesty by tax reforms 
that simplify compliance and reduce incentives to cheat by the 
lowering of both marginal and average tax rates. Unfortunately 
the lowering of tax rates under any taxation system cannot take 
place until spending is cut and increased revenue due to 
economic growth has eliminated the deficit.
<P>
	Government success in this challenging task is likely to 
increase further the public's incentive to evade taxes because 
the level of real government services per dollar of taxes 
collected will be falling and ultimately reach a rather low level. 
This phenomenon is due to the fact that in the absence of debt 
payment a balanced budget provides the people of Canada with a 
dollar's worth of government services. However in a few years 
the debt payments of the federal government are likely to be 
about $50 billion annually.
<P>
	If by that time program spending remains at its present level 
of $125 billion and economic growth under the present tax 
structure yields $175 billion the budget will be balanced. At that 
time each dollar of taxes will provide for less than 70 cents of 
traditional government services. Taxpayers will have little 
trouble rationalizing evasion on the grounds that taxes are not 
providing value for their money.
<P>
	During the finance committee hearings and in the public 
media it is often suggested that the government's financial crisis 
could be eliminated if only somehow it were possible to tax the 
underground economy. The validity of this proposition depends 
decisively on the size of the underground economy and the 
possibility of forcing it into the open.
<P>
	The Fraser Institute conference saw some academics present 
estimates of the underground economy as high as 15 per cent of 
national income. On the other hand government statisticians and 
economists suggested that it represent 5 per cent of national 
income at the most and that it is probably more like 3 per cent. 
The difference between these two estimates is due to the use of 
different methods for the estimation of a phenomenon that by its 
very nature is not known and attempts to remain hidden.
<P>
	The academics use strong assumptions about the demand for 
money by the public to finance regular and underground 
economic business. Some have found the demand for cash is 
higher, the higher our tax rate. In fact the amount of cash used by 
the public is much larger than can legitimately be used in the 
regular economy. The excess amount is believed to be used to 
finance underground activities.
<P>
	Analysts in the employ of the government use sophisticated 
accounting data to check for the growth of discrepancies in 
balances which if measured completely and accurately should 
be zero. They also engage in sensitivity analyses of data which 
show the academic estimates imply phenomena that simply are 
not observed in the real world by any standard of measurement.
<P>
	Some part of the observed differences in the estimates are due 
to definitions of the underground economy. Government 
estimates focus on the amount of income that goes unreported to 
the tax collectors on the one hand and is unrecorded by Statistics 
Canada on the other. The academic estimates include illegal 
activities which may be as much as 1 per cent to 2 per cent of the 
national income.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Some academics know of the professional bias of government 
analysts who prefer not to be reporting that they have done their 
job poorly and that they tend to make continuous adjustments to 
their data to avoid the development of the kind of large errors the 
academics claim to have discovered.
<P>
	While this criticism is probably unfair, there was the 
astounding revelation that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has 
doubled its official estimate of the amount of tax evasion after a 
new head had been appointed. He is alleged to have decided that 
the estimate of 5 per cent evasion, twice that given by his 
predecessor, would strengthen with congress his case for more 
tax collectors. The IRS is now investigating its own internal 
auditors. Some academics noted that official positions on the 
issue now imply that Canadians are 10 times as honest as 
Americans in filing their income tax returns.
<P>
	Dr. Don Drummond, deputy minister of finance for fiscal 
affairs, put much credence in the maximum of 5 per cent figure 
for the underground economy. Importantly, he noted that this 
figure represents a serious problem. It equals about $35 billion 
and, at $17 of federal revenue per $100 of national income, it 
amounts to about $6 billion of foregone taxes. This is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3856"> 3856 </A></B>
<P>
enough  to eliminate last year's regular deficit of $42 billion but 
enough to help significantly the fight for a balanced budget.
<P>
	However, it is unlikely that the full 5 per cent of the more or 
less officially admitted maximum underground economy can 
ever be brought into the open and made taxable. Yet I would 
argue that the lowering of taxes might make for more tax 
revenue than the $6 billion suggested by the government 
representatives.
<P>
	For one, returns from after tax legal income would rise 
relative to the returns from illegal activities. More important, 
there would be reduced incentives to produce in the informal 
unmeasured household sector. This effect will be enlarged 
considerably when the economy recovers and the number of 
persons on welfare and UIC is reduced.
<P>
	It is believed that persons on social assistance use much of 
their free time to work in this unmeasured sector which is not 
included in the official estimates of the underground economy. 
They would do less of this kind of work, hire others to do it and 
pay with income from their own formal work. Many economists 
believe that this tendency would be strengthened even more if 
the pending redesign of social programs makes it more difficult 
and less rewarding to remain on social and UIC assistance.
<P>
	Let me conclude by summarizing my argument. The 
underground economy in Canada is large and policies that result 
in shrinking it would result in significant increases in tax 
revenue. The federal government has the opportunity to achieve 
this outcome by the lowering of average and marginal tax rates, 
the elimination and simplification of regulations and the reform 
of the social programs.
<P>
	The issues and opportunities are clear. It is time to act on 
them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
I want to thank the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound for 
his representation. I thought you spoke very well. It was 
anything but an inflammatory speech, quite unlike some of the 
speeches made earlier by your colleagues from the Reform 
Party. You began your speech by complaining-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I remind all 
members to direct their statements, questions and comments 
through the Chair, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to follow your 
admonition.
<P>
	I wanted to remind the hon. member from Capilano-Howe 
Sound that he should not have to look any further than his own 
colleagues to find the source for the partisan debate that has 
taken place in the last hour. The members of the Reform Party 
have done very well painting supporters of this government as 
the terrible oppressors of the taxpayers.
<P>
	There is naturally a very legitimate debate over what is right 
and proper about taxes.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	I suspect that there is not a Canadian anywhere who does not 
have at least some partial legitimate complaint about taxes. I 
find that acceptable. Too many of the speeches from the Reform 
Party members this afternoon have been monuments to greed 
and selfishness.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary made the comment this 
afternoon that the Reform Party members do not know anything 
about the way government works. I suspect that she is wrong on 
that point. I think they know very well how government works, 
and very often government gets in the way of their greed and 
their selfishness. All I hear from them is: ``I don't want to share. 
I want to pay less. How can I get out of my responsibilities?''
<P>
	They talk over and over about their rights, but never once do 
they talk about their responsibilities. We do have 
responsibilities to each other. The member from Skeena even 
invoked the name of Jesus Christ. I think he has nerve to use that 
name in this particular debate because his entire intervention 
was about greed and selfishness: ``How can I get out of my 
responsibilities? Give me more as an individual but allow me to 
pay less. Allow me to contribute less to Canadian society.''
<P>
	These speakers contribute to this victimization syndrome that 
besets this country. We hear it from these people all the time: 
Politicians are rotten, leaders are rotten, Parliament is rotten, 
every governmental institution is rotten, you are the victim and 
you must cry out because those people in Ottawa and other 
capitals around the country are the oppressors. You do not have 
any responsibilities whatsoever. You are supposed to be on the 
take. You take everything for yourself. You do not contribute 
anything to your community. I think that is very irresponsible.
<P>
	I have a question for the most recent Reform speaker. Tell me 
about your responsibilities. Where do your rights end and your 
responsibilities begin?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity after 
this almost ranting and raving question to respond to challenges 
about my motives and the motives of my colleagues.
<P>
	I know my friends here now very closely. They are as 
compassionate and concerned about the future of Canada and the 
welfare of individuals at least I would argue as some of the 
members on the other side. Obviously there is no merit in us 
having a dispute, an argument, over who is more compassionate. 
What a rational debate in government and in society should be 
about is how do we carry it out, how do we do it?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3857"> 3857 </A></B>
<P>
	The reason why I have left a comfortable life as a professor, 
short of retirement, is because I am so worried that the future of 
our social programs is in jeopardy. We are very, very close to 
losing it all. This would not be the first industrial country of the 
world where this has happened.
<P>
	I am more compassionate, I assert strongly to the member 
opposite. Let us have an argument on who is more 
compassionate. I am more compassionate. On top of that, I have 
a brain, a brain which says to me that it is not just a heart or a 
stomach with which I have to make policy. I have to look at the 
world around me. As I look around at the world I see this 
government predicting an extra $100 billion deficit in the next 
three years.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	At a 6 per cent average that means $6 billion more spending 
just to serve the interest on the part of the debt they have created 
in six years. Do you know how much we can spend on social 
welfare with $6 billion? That does not count all the higher 
interest we owe on the already existing $500 billion. We are on a 
treadmill with the spending cuts we are making. The increases in 
revenue-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I regret the 
hon. member's time has lapsed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising today to speak to this motion by the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre on reforming, simplifying and making more 
equitable our income tax and other tax systems in Canada.
<P>
	I originally had planned today to speak primarily on the issues 
of fiscal federalism in the few minutes that I have. In this 
country right now we are undergoing a series of studies and 
serious examinations of a number of policy areas that include 
social policy, not just transfers to individuals but transfers to 
provinces, and we have a budget that is impacting on a number 
of transfer programs to provinces, both this year and in future 
years.
<P>
	All of those things are really proceeding in a number of 
different ways. There are intergovernmental negotiations going 
on. We do not have any details about that but we know it is 
happening. We have a social policy review. Of course we have 
budgetary policy and a review of the GST.
<P>
	There is a wide number of studies into issues of fiscal 
federalism but there is no overall integrated approach to making 
the tax system fairer and more efficient between levels of 
government. That is the primary point I want to address today, 
some of the things that some organizations are putting out that 
could be done, some of the things that our various academics 
have proposed.
<P>
	I have been sidetracked somewhat by an issue that I got into 
last week. It came up on the floor of the House yesterday. I want 
to digress and spend most of my time on that because it seemed 
after what was said yesterday in the House that it was a perfect 
opportunity to address  this particular issue because it is really 
so relevant to the way taxes and the tax system are functioning in 
our country today.
<P>
	I am referring to the mini controversy we have over the 
federal overseas tax credit. This is a tax credit that is available to 
Canadian workers who are working overseas for six months or 
more of the year, enduring hardship and separation from their 
families and work related expenses in that capacity. There have 
been recent stories, one in particular in <I>Alberta Report</I>, that 
draws attention to the fact that the federal revenue department is 
basically considering retroactively disallowing the use of the 
overseas tax credit by certain Canadian workers, much to their 
detriment.
<P>
	This story appeared and has been on the scene. I know 
members of Parliament, not just myself but other members have 
been making inquiries into this particular matter for some time 
because this has been on the public record now for a couple of 
months. They are not getting very far with Revenue Canada I 
understand.
<P>
	I am not a tax expert and I am not a lawyer. I would never 
claim to be for obvious political reasons. By implication neither 
am I a tax lawyer. But I did find this story quite interesting. 
Given the government's current unwillingness to address the 
issue I decided to raise it in the Commons in statements.
<P>
	Yesterday in response to one of these gratuitous set up 
questions we have periodically, the Minister of National 
Revenue said I had erred in my statement and provided the 
House with some incorrect information and that there were in 
fact no legislative changes involved in this area.
<P>
	What is wrong with that statement is that it has nothing to do 
with what I in fact said to the House or what the problem is here. 
Mr. Speaker, you may have seen the movie last year, <I>The Firm</I>. It 
was one of my favourite movies last year.  In one particular 
scene-it is about tax lawyers-Gene Hackman plays Avery 
Tolar speaking to Tom Cruise who is playing Mitchell McDeer. 
He is teasing him about his upcoming tax law exam. He has a 
multiple choice question for the young upstart. He says: ``What 
is the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion? Is it: 
(a) what the IRS says it is? (b) A good tax lawyer? (c) Five years 
in jail? (d) All of the above?''.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Just to Canadianize that we will substitute Revenue Canada 
for the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service in the United States, 
and I think the same applies here. The point I am making is that 
whether there have been legislative changes is too often 
irrelevant. Tax law in this country rarely has much to do with 
legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3858"> 3858 </A></B>
<P>
	We recently have been passing in this House tax changes that 
were brought in by the previous government, well over a year 
before its defeat in some cases. We have been passing those 
things. We have been agreeing to them on this side. We have no 
choice. They have been implemented for some period of time. 
Legislation has little to do with it and little to do with the 
question I raised.
<P>
	The question I was raising was not a question of legal 
technicality or of the latest version of Revenue Canada tax rules. 
It has to do with the administration of the tax system in the 
country and the application of tax law which often leads to the 
second point I was raising, the far more important point, the 
whole issue of tax fairness and in particular issues of scope and 
timing.
<P>
	Timing in this case is the whole issue of retroactivity of 
administrative and application changes in terms of the 
administration of the law. Scope is in terms of the application of 
this particular provision to some workers and not others, in 
particular this one provision that depending on how interpreted 
or how applied affects workers of foreign parented companies 
differently than workers of Canadian parented companies 
whether or not those workers are Canadian.
<P>
	These are very important questions and I do not profess, nor 
did I in my statement, to know the right answer or what the 
correct policy should be. I do not know and I can understand that 
there are certainly legitimate costs involved in these kinds of 
working arrangements.
<P>
	My point is that if we are going to administer a sensible, fair 
and improved tax system in this country it is important that we 
take these kinds of issues seriously and listen carefully. Neither 
of those things was reflected in the kind of answer that the 
minister gave in the House to this dilemma yesterday.
<P>
	Specifically, whether or not one agrees with the overseas tax 
credit it is not difficult to understand the concept that fairness 
and retroactivity of application are two entirely different things. 
We should be very careful in retroactivity of either legislation or 
application especially when it involves substantive tax penalties 
for some people.
<P>
	Second, it is also not hard to understand in terms of fairness 
that all Canadian workers should be treated as equally and as 
equitably as possible. I happen to believe that in the kind of new 
economy we are moving into capital, with the porous 
international borders we have and with the technical evolution 
we have and with many of the well run countries in the world, 
will do a pretty good job in the long haul of taking care of itself. I 
do not think it needs protectionist measures such as this.
<P>
	I noticed that the revenue minister rationalized this measure 
as effectively a protectionist support for Canadian based 
companies. However, Canadian labour in the future is going to 
need not necessarily our help in the old sense of giving handouts 
but help in the sense of  ensuring its full participation in this 
dynamic, capital driven economy. This kind of tax measure is a 
perfect example of one that is driven by needs, old kinds of 
protectionist, nationalist needs that are not consistent with the 
needs of Canadian workers.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Whether this particular tax credit is essential or well 
structured or not, I do not know. I do know that if a Canadian 
worker is participating in his economy, whether here or abroad, 
surely the application of that should not be based on the status of 
his employer. Canadian workers and Canadian labour should be 
the focus of those kinds of measures.
<P>
	I see, Mr. Speaker, you are asking me to wind up. I did want to 
spend my time on that. I hope the government is listening and I 
hope it takes not just the big concerns that we have about the tax 
system but some of these smaller day to day tax problems that 
Canadians have much more seriously in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, I note that the 
motion was moved by the member for Calgary Centre and the 
speaker who just spoke is from Calgary West. Somehow I find it 
to be a more reasonable combination from the members of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	I have two questions for the member. Earlier in the debate the 
member for Dartmouth posed a question to the member for 
Skeena on the issue of the expenditures by the leader of the 
Reform Party in terms of cars, suits, money that was supplied by 
the Reform Party coffers. The member for Dartmouth said that 
was funded by taxpayers' money. The member for Skeena 
jumped up and said that was not the case.
<P>
	Could the member for Calgary West tell us how Reform Party 
funds are subsidized by the taxpayers through the tax credit 
system.
<P>
	The next question is I am sure most members of this House 
and members of the Reform Party would agree that part of the 
problem is that economics is trying to do a balancing of demands 
and we have demands coming from various sides. Obviously we 
ended up with a deficit that was greater than was predicted 
beforehand, so the government does not have the option. We 
have to deal with the reality as it is handed to us.
<P>
	The Reform Party keeps referring to our program, that we are 
going to increase the size of the debt which I guess we are and 
that is well known. We also are committed to bringing down the 
deficit. The Reform Party even in its budget would have 
increased the debt. In light of the new expenditures I am sure it 
would have increased even more.
<P>
	I wonder if the Reform Party does not believe that by forever 
trying to say that there is a fiscal crisis in the country it is hurting 
the situation in the financial markets just as the Bloc is hurting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3859"> 3859 </A></B>
<P>
the financial situation in the markets when it says that the 
country is going to break up.
<P>
	I would like to have answers to those questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I 
have enough time to answer both of those, but let me try.
<P>
	The hon. member raised a couple of issues in terms of the 
recent expenditures of the Reform Party executive. It is a well 
known fact that I had indicated I was not happy with the 
structure of those particular expenditures and I had 
recommended to the council that it go about receipting any 
legitimate expenditures that our leader incurs. The executive 
council of the party I understand has in fact endorsed that kind of 
a policy.
<P>
	The reason I said that was that we are here in the House of 
Commons, the Reform caucus, trying to get our current 
non-taxable, non-receiptable expense allowance that we all 
enjoy of $21,300 a year receipted. This is one particular 
expenditure. This type of expenditure should not occur. It 
should not occur in the Reform Party and it should not occur in 
this House of Commons where in addition to being 
non-receiptable it is also non-taxable.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	I would hope that having gone though that particular 
controversy and kept our policy consistent as we did that we now 
have the support for the hon. member for the scrapping of that 
particular kind of non-tax allowance that we as members of 
Parliament all enjoy. I would expect to get that support.
<P>
	The member also asked me more specifically whether Reform 
Party funds have a subsidy component. The answer in my view is 
that they do because of course they are funnelled through a tax 
credit system that all political parties enjoy.
<P>
	We have urged that this government bring forward legislation 
to end that kind of special tax credit status for political parties in 
a number of areas. We have urged that we do this for all political 
parties. If the members of the government feel so strongly on 
that particular issue I would urge them to take action on it as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about 
important issues relating to this motion, two issues that are 
currently eroding the very fabric of Canadian society. The issues 
are the underground economy and smuggling.
<P>
	They are issues that are eroding fairness and equity in this 
country. The underground economy and smuggling are national 
problems. They are complex problems without simple answers 
or simple solutions and they are wearing away the respect that 
Canadians have for law and for the fairness of our tax system.
<P>
	There are some in our society who feel that evading taxes and 
smuggling goods are acceptable activities. These people believe 
that no one is hurt. The fact is people do get hurt.
<P>
	Underground activity and smuggling are not victimless 
crimes. They hurt the law-abiding majority of Canadians who 
obey the law. They are putting honest business men and women 
out of business. Legitimate business is forced to operate against 
competition that is not contributing its fair share to the 
economy.
<P>
	Honest companies have trouble being competitive both at 
home and abroad and are forced to charge higher prices to 
compensate for their own honesty. Jobs are lost. The deficit 
grows and honest taxpayers carry an unfair load. The playing 
field is not level.
<P>
	The greater the illegal activity, the less tax revenue available 
to governments for essential services and social economic 
programs. Governments have less revenue to maintain the 
current high quality of our health care system and our social 
safety net.
<P>
	As a result all government programs, including pensions, 
education, development of the infrastructure, will in due course 
be at risk.
<P>
	In 1993 smuggling cost the federal treasury over $1 billion in 
lost revenue. It cost provincial treasuries another $1 billion. 
Depending on the estimate, the underground economy ranges 
from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent of GDP to over 20 per cent. This 
means that $20 billion to $140 billion is going untaxed each 
year. That is billions of tax dollars that the federal and 
provincial governments do not have to reduce the deficit and 
finance health, employment and social services.
<P>
	Because of underground activity it becomes difficult if not 
almost impossible for governments to meet Canadians' 
demands for economic growth, deficit reduction and meaningful 
jobs.
<P>
	It is clear to me that those who enjoy society's benefits while 
refusing to contribute to its maintenance are taking advantage of 
others. They are taking advantage of their honest friends and 
neighbours. These people whether they realize it or not are 
expecting others to pay their way. They are expecting their 
friends and neighbours to pay for the general services they 
enjoy, including roads, hospitals, schools, fire and police 
services, while they improve their own personal financial 
situations. To be extremely blunt, they are freeloaders.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	We cannot allow this kind of selfishness to continue. The 
integrity and the future of our tax system depends on bringing 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3860"> 3860 </A></B>
<P>
these people back into the legitimate economy. Canadians have 
to know that everyone is paying his or her fair share. Canadians 
need to have confidence and trust in government and in the way 
their governments handle their money.
<P>
	As the Minister of National Revenue has publicly stated, tax 
evasion is not a game. It is a serious issue with serious 
consequences. It burdens honest taxpayers and hurts businesses 
throughout the country through unfair competition. While 
everyone wants the benefit of lower taxes, it must be achieved in 
line with the law and not by breaking it.
<P>
	We want tax evaders to voluntarily rejoin the legitimate 
economy. However we must also continue to send the message 
that if they continue to deliberately evade taxes we will do all we 
can to identify and convict them.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity the parties opposite have 
provided to send this message again today. Tax evaders and 
smugglers should know that we intend to put a halt to what they 
are doing. I also appreciate the opportunity to send a strong and 
clear message to honest Canadians. The law-abiding majority of 
Canadians need to know that we recognize the fact that they are 
carrying an unfair share of the burden because of tax evaders and 
that we are taking action to lift it.
<P>
	The opposition asked that we sit down with the provinces and 
with ordinary Canadians to consult on these issues. That is 
something we do all the time, every single day.
<P>
	For example, the government recently joined forces with the 
province of Quebec to combat the underground economy, tax 
evasion and smuggling, and to improve the way we are using the 
resources allocated to addressing these issues. Under the new 
arrangement Revenue Canada and Revenue Quebec have 
strengthened their relationship in all areas of enforcement with 
the goal of identifying cases of fraud, non-filers, 
non-registrants, to sharing access to electronic audit selection 
systems, co-ordinating audit investigation and collection 
activities, sharing the results of enforcement measures, sharing 
the results of research into the causes and symptoms of tax 
evasion and non-compliance with tax law.
<P>
	Additional measures under this arrangement include 
developing complementary audit strategies, putting together 
joint audit teams to conduct joint audits and investigations, and 
exchanging the results of these activities.
<P>
	Furthermore, the government is working closely with the 
other provinces on these issues as well. Together these measures 
will allow us to better target our audit activities and improve the 
ability of both levels of government to co-ordinate their 
investigation and collection programs. It will also further 
strengthen the initiatives to combat non-compliance that the 
Minister of National Revenue announced on November 24, 
1993.
<P>
	Under these latter initiatives Revenue Canada set up special 
audit teams to focus on business sectors that demonstrate high 
levels of non-compliance. Targeted sectors include the 
construction, jewellery, hospitality, home renovations, car 
repairs and other service sectors.
<P>
	Revenue Canada also reassigned more resources to auditing, 
increased the number of joint GST-income tax audits that it 
conducts and began cross referencing the GST and income tax 
data bases in order to improve the identification of those not 
reporting income.
<P>
	Between 1991-92 and 1992-93 the department added 245 
income tax auditors to its field operations, increased the number 
of income tax audits by 10,000 and raised $200 million in 
additional taxes. In addition, the amount of corporate income 
tax collected per auditor rose approximately 280 per cent 
between 1985-86 and 1993-94.
<P>
	In short, we have and we are continuing to take action to 
ensure that the majority of Canadians do not suffer because of 
those who purposely evade and cheat. We simply cannot allow a 
minority of individuals to avoid the law.
<P>
	Everyone must pay their fair share, no more, no less. We owe 
it to the law-abiding majority of our citizens to ensure that they 
no longer have to shoulder an unfair burden. It is unacceptable 
that others who refused to meet their tax obligations can still 
take advantage of the same services and benefits.
<P>
	We must continue to enforce the law to its fullest extent to 
ensure fairness to honest taxpayers. We must be prepared to take 
all necessary steps to weed out those participating in smuggling 
and tax evasion. If we are going to maintain the integrity and 
fairness of our tax system we must send a strong message that 
participating in the underground economy and engaging in 
smuggling activity will be a very risky and costly decision.

	The House resumed from March 25, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-207, An Act to amend the Auditor General 
Act (reports), be now read a second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Mr. Speaker, if Bill 
C-207, which is a private member's bill tabled by the hon. 
member for Ottawa-Vanier, is passed, it will allow the Auditor 
General to report to the House as often as he deems necessary.
<P>
	Moreover, the Auditor General will be able to table a report to 
the House as soon as that report is completed. This procedure is 
already in effect in the British Parliament in London, where the 
Auditor General routinely tables some 40 reports every year.
<P>
	In early 1993, the Association des diplômés de l'École des 
Hautes Études Commerciales de Montréal presented a brief to 
the Committee on the Budget and Administration, which had 
been asked by Quebec's National Assembly to review public 
services financing. In its brief, the Association recommended 
that government programs be automatically reviewed at regular 
intervals, and that effectiveness studies of government 
initiatives be released as soon as they are available.
<P>
	If the federal government allowed the Auditor General to 
report to the House as often as he deems necessary and table any 
report as soon as it is completed, it would comply with these two 
recommendations of the Association des diplômés de l'École 
des Hautes Études Commerciales de Montréal.
<P>
	Right now, the Auditor General publishes a report once a year, 
in which he mentions cases of mismanagement, inadequate 
financial commitments and tax losses. In the two weeks 
following the report's release, the media draw public attention 
to the Auditor General's findings. Some cases described as real 
horror stories are then forgotten until the next report is 
published, a year later.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The tabling of reports throughout the year would help 
maintain taxpayers' interest regarding the way their country is 
managed. Government management would become more 
transparent. After all, transparency is what the Prime Minister 
promised us during the election campaign.
<P>
	In its twelfth report, tabled in the House on May 28, 1986, the 
public accounts committee said that, sometimes, 
comprehensive audits are completed several months before the 
tabling of the report. The committee added that since these 
audits can take up to two years, some of the findings may no 
longer apply once the report is sent to the committee.
<P>
	The benefits of tabling several periodic reports have already 
been demonstrated in a number of parliamentary regimes, 
including England, Holland, Germany, Sweden, Australia and 
New Zealand. Canada should be quick to follow the example of 
these countries. The public accounts committee would be better 
able to fulfill its role as Parliament's auditing committee 
responsible for the sound management of public funds. The 
federal government would save hundreds of millions, even 
billions, if reports were tabled sooner. The Public Accounts 
committee would be able to look at the Auditor General's 
recommendations in a timely fashion, and ask that appropriate 
remedial action be taken as soon as possible after an audit.
<P>
	Several periodic reports would also help the Auditor General 
to plan his office's work for the year more astutely. The resulting 
savings in resources could lead to a greater number of audits 
conducted with identical resources at a time when the Auditor 
General's budget is being cut, like those of several other 
departments.
<P>
	Given the government's annual budget of over $160 billion, is 
this not reason enough to give the Auditor General more latitude 
in his auditing operations? The public accounts committee 
would have more recent reports available and would be able to 
expedite its work while the officials being evaluated were still in 
office. As Chairman of the public accounts committee, I have 
too often heard deputy ministers and heads of agencies, when 
plied with questions by members, give one of the following 
answers: ``I was not there at the time'' or ``That happened under 
the previous administration''.
<P>
	This bill, the purpose of which is to allow the Auditor General 
more latitude and room to manoeuvre, has been introduced in 
the House on several occasions in the past, but without any 
success. I will come back to that a little later.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois supports this bill, as does the Reform 
Party. When in opposition during the previous administration, 
the Liberals also supported this bill. Why then, now that they are 
in power, are the Liberals reluctant to support the efforts of their 
colleague from Ottawa-Vanier to ensure greater transparency 
and to allow the machinery of government a faster response time 
by allowing the Auditor General to report as often as he deems 
necessary and to report studies to the House immediately upon 
their completion?
<P>
	I wish to congratulate the member who sponsored this bill and 
assure him that I will vote in favour of Bill C-207. What I find 
deplorable, Mr. Speaker, is the lack of strong support for this bill 
from the government and the  Liberal caucus. If the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3862"> 3862 </A></B>
<P>
supported the member for Ottawa-Vanier, we would be dealing 
with a government bill. We have been told that the Liberal 
caucus is divided on this issue and that the government is being 
pressured by senior officials.
<P>
	This is an example of a double standard. Now that it is in 
power, the government is keeping mum and letting a member 
take the initiative, hoping that the bill will die on the <I>Order 
Paper</I>, as was the case with Bill C-262 given second reading on 
October 19, 1987 and Bill C-288 given second reading on July 
18, 1988.
<P>
	Inaction has become this government's trademark. Let us 
leave things as they are for fear that in two or three years' time, 
too high a profile on the part of the Auditor General or his too 
frequent reports on very specific or timely issues will alert 
taxpayers to the mismanagement on the part of this Liberal 
government, or worse, to its inability to take the required action 
to contain the debt.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I support Bill C-207 introduced by the hon. 
member for Ottawa-Vanier and I also agree with his statement 
to the effect that, and I quote: ``Let us not have the bureaucracy 
tell us what we should be doing in this House''.
<P>
	Bill C-207 which was introduced on January 20, 1994 was the 
sixteenth initiative presented to Parliament since July 18, 1980 
calling for the Auditor General Act to be amended.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	We had the first and fifth reports of the public accounts 
committee tabled in the 32nd Parliament. There was also a 
question to the House from the chairwoman of the committee 
during that same Parliament. In 1985, we had Bill C-250 and in 
1987, Bill C-262; then the report of the Senate Committee on 
National Finances; Bill C-288, introduced in this House in 
1988; Bill C-228 in 1989 and finally Bill C-344 introduced in 
1992 by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier, as well as Bill 
C-207 we are debating today.
<P>
	What has happened since July 18, 1980? Liberals lost power 
in 1984 and came back in 1993 and today, the sixteenth try for 
such a bill, it is still in the making. It is high time to act. If there 
was not so much resistance from the government machine, this 
bill would have been passed a long time ago.
<P>
	The present mandate of the Auditor General and the 
procedures he uses, including the mandatory tabling of an 
annual report, go back to 1977, the year the Auditor General Act 
was passed by this House.
<P>
	Since then, the flow of information has been multiplied by 
ten, information systems have evolved, public finances have 
deteriorated, managers have been made accountable to 
Parliament, and the Auditor General's office must be able to 
keep up with new procedures in the area of public account 
auditing. The Auditor General himself, in his note of March 22, 
1994, to the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier, was saying and I  
quote: ``- it seems fairly safe to say that periodic reporting is 
becoming the norm around the world. In our view, this would be 
a good time for Canada to join the trend''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of Bill C-207. I contribute to this 
debate from my own experience with an effective relationship 
between elected persons and an auditor general.
<P>
	The city of Edmonton was one of the first municipalities to 
appoint an independent auditor general. The experience has 
been beneficial to both the council and local taxpayers. The 
focus of the auditor general's work has gradually shifted from 
financial accounting to evaluating value received for tax dollars 
spent.
<P>
	Independent audits play an important role in finding the most 
cost effective way to deliver public services. That is what we 
need in Canada today to help restore public confidence in public 
services. In keeping with the shift to value for money auditing, 
the auditor general provides information to elected 
representatives in a timely fashion so elected people can prevent 
waste, not just point fingers after the damage is done.
<P>
	Each year city council and the auditor general develop a work 
plan including a timeframe for the completion and discussion of 
specific audits. Special audits are considered when they are 
completed. The auditor also tables an annual report with general 
recommendations and progress reports on individual 
departments. In this way the audit function and the 
corresponding focus on value for money in public service is a 
continuing focus and not a once a year bad news report.
<P>
	A problem solving approach by the auditor has helped build 
good working relationships with both department officials and 
elected representatives.
<P>
	Based on this experience I support the direction of Bill C-207 
to provide more timely information to Parliament and prevent 
waste through the consideration of individual audits once they 
are completed. I believe it will assist in meeting public 
expectation and ensure that taxpayers receive good value for 
every tax dollar in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak 
on Bill C-207 which is the act to amend the Auditor General 
Act. The bill has been introduced by the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier. It is noteworthy that the member is a former 
chairman of the public accounts committee and now sits on the 
government side and is introducing this particular bill.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3863"> 3863 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	The first thing we should note is that this bill is not a partisan 
bill but is what I call a good government bill. It is long overdue 
and therefore my sincere thanks to the member for 
Ottawa-Vanier for introducing the bill.
<P>
	The bill basically has two major provisions. One of course is 
to allow the Auditor General to report to this House more often 
than once a year. We all know that once a year there is a feeding 
frenzy by the media to read through that voluminous report 
which is 600 to 700 pages of all the problems, mismanagement 
and waste of taxpayers' dollars he has found.
<P>
	Since he is basically restricted to reporting only once a year, 
quite often the information we receive is a year old by the time 
the Auditor General is finished with it. He may have conducted 
his audit some months before but it sits on his desk for a whole 
year until such time as he produces his annual report.
<P>
	The report is then referred to the public accounts committee 
which may take another six months or so before it gets around to 
dealing with the points the Auditor General has raised. It is not 
inconceivable, in fact it is more than likely the information 
being discussed and acted upon in the public accounts 
committee could be 18 months old, if not closer to two years old 
before it is dealt with effectively and responses and remedial 
action taken. Quite often the civil servants involved may have 
moved on to new positions.
<P>
	It therefore becomes quite difficult for the public accounts 
committee to act as effectively as it perhaps could if the Auditor 
General were allowed to report more frequently.
<P>
	I would hope if the Auditor General is given the authority that 
he would report to this House on a frequent basis, after every 
audit upon the completion of the audit. In that way the 
information can be referred to the public accounts committee 
and it can act swiftly and timely on the information provided.
<P>
	For example, right now the public accounts committee is 
dealing with an issue where $1.1 billion of revenue was lost 
through a problem in finance, justice and national revenue. That 
is $1.1 billion of taxpayers' money. We are now going back to 
find out what has caused the problem. The Auditor General 
knew about this a long time ago but because of the current 
restrictions on his ability to report, he was unable to do so until 
January of this particular year. The information is old.
<P>
	Let us make sure that we as the people responsible to the 
constituents of this country can make a serious and real 
difference.
<P>
	We also have the opportunity of the Auditor General being 
more responsive to directions from this House. For example, the 
standing committees may require information from the Auditor 
General. They would ask him to conduct certain audits if it 
comes to their  attention there is mismanagement, waste, or 
something going on in any particular department, crown agency, 
and so on.
<P>
	These things have to be looked at seriously in light of today's 
situation where we are $500 billion to $550 billion in debt and 
that amount is growing every day. Anything that can be done in 
the light of good government to ensure the taxpayers' money is 
spent honestly and responsibly can only be good for this 
country.
<P>
	I have talked to the Reform caucus. The bill is endorsed by the 
Reform Party as a whole. I certainly wish the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier success in shepherding this bill through its 
various stages to ensure it becomes law in this land.
<P>
	As a member of the public accounts committee I think it is 
going to be beneficial to the public accounts committee, to the 
Government of Canada and to the taxpayers. I can support the 
bill wholeheartedly.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak in favour of the act to amend the 
Auditor General Act with regard to reporting.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it. Canadians are going to hold this 
House responsible for every red cent the government spends. 
They see it as a duty of Parliament to ensure the highest standard 
of responsibility in government. It is the duty of this House to 
ensure that tax dollars entrusted to us are used prudently and for 
the purpose which Parliament allocated them.
<P>
	I have concerns for the ability of the members in this place to 
fulfil their duty without sufficient information provided in a 
timely fashion. We have at our disposal an excellent instrument 
to ensure sound management, the Office of the Auditor General 
of Canada.
<P>
	Annually, the Auditor General submits a report to this House 
in which he reviews the manner in which the nation's business is 
carried out by the various departments, agencies and crown 
corporations. He takes into consideration not only purely fiscal 
concerns but also the performance and mandate of the 
organizations he is reviewing.
<P>
	The Auditor General also makes recommendations for 
improving operations from time to time. Indeed the Auditor 
General's reports are thorough. The latest ran to some 700 
pages. They are deserving of the fullest consideration by 
members of this House. Over the years a massive amount of 
waste and poor administration spending in government has been 
brought to light by the Auditor General.
<P>
	Earlier this year he reported on the National Arts Centre, a 
crown corporation. He found serious deficiencies in the manner 
in which the corporation was managing its finances. With an 
annual budget of $40 million a year and a staff of about 300, the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3864"> 3864 </A></B>
<P>
Auditor  General found serious deficiencies. This is a cause for 
serious concern to all Canadians.
<P>
	Surely good stewardship of public money is not too much to 
ask. In fact, the Auditor General's annual report has been almost 
bursting with recommendations for improved management, for 
better performance of mandates as well as dire warnings 
regarding the practices of the federal government at times.
<P>
	Indeed this report is probably the taxpayers' greatest friend. It 
is unfortunate then that more time is not available for members 
to give every topic in the report their fullest attention when the 
report is presented. Time however does not permit such a full 
debate. Unfortunately by the time the estimates find their way 
through committee much of the good work has been forgotten.
<P>
	Government needs to spend a little more time discovering 
whether all those tax dollars we squeezed from our constituents 
are being spent to good effect.
<P>
	At one point, being a brand new member in this House full of 
ideas and questions, I decided I would take on the task of trying 
to discover how effective various government job creation 
programs had been over the years. I discovered that no one had 
taken the time to follow up on these programs in any scientific 
way over a long period of time. Just think of all the billions of 
dollars that have been poured in this direction and we cannot 
even prove it even created one real long term job.
<P>
	The work of the Auditor General is monitoring the activities 
of government in a very real, very necessary way indeed.
<P>
	The private sector I would submit has its own controls on 
efficiency and productivity. It is called competition. 
Government has no such control. The best control the taxpayers 
have is full disclosure of the fiscal management of the 
government and accountability for it.
<P>
	I will use a word that I hear often on the other side of the 
House, transparency. It is a word that we hear often. The Auditor 
General's office provides such transparency, that window into 
the workings of the government operations.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	This transparency will be enhanced by the provisions of this 
bill that we are considering here today, allowing the Auditor 
General to report when he considers the matter to be timely. This 
will make his recommendations that much more effective. 
Rather than allowing the problems to run unchecked until the 
annual report is tabled, urgent concerns can be dealt with when 
they are uncovered and should be dealt with that way.
<P>
	Over the years several auditors general have called repeatedly 
for parliamentarians to be supplied with adequate information in 
a timely fashion related to the management of government 
agencies and crown corporations to ensure the achievement of 
those organizations' objectives. In the task force report on 
crown corporations' accountability prepared by the Canadian 
Council of Public Accounts Committee in July 1992 it was 
stated: ``Legislators are generally not supplied with adequate 
information related to the achievement of crown corporation 
objectives''.
<P>
	What is troubling about these observations is they have been 
noted time and time again. The litany of waste continues 
unabated no matter how often we talk about it in this House.
<P>
	It seems to me that part of the problem lies in the House 
getting its information in one large, somewhat indigestible 
serving at the start of the year. Maybe if we took it in bite sized 
portions we would be able to deal with these matters easier.
<P>
	The massive document tabled in this place contains a wealth 
of information, but little time is allowed to analyse, discuss, 
debate or act on it. In some cases the problems revealed are very 
old problems and rarely ever come back to this House to be dealt 
with.
<P>
	On page 23 of the current report the Auditor General states: 
``Parliament is not being provided with the information that 
would enable us to assess the desirability and affordability of 
sustaining programs at their current levels within the context of 
their commitments''. He goes on to call for cyclical reviews of 
all statutory spending programs such as unemployment 
insurance, international aid and income support. This would be 
more possible within the framework of the bill under discussion 
here today.
<P>
	Further in the report he comments on the current program 
evaluation. He says: ``Based on the office's government wide 
findings, I am forced to report that the evaluation regime is not 
working as intended''. He also underlines the necessity for 
objective reporting. ``Evaluations for example of crown 
corporations which originate from within the organizations 
themselves are unlikely to treat objectivity with the problems 
encountered''.
<P>
	There are in fact several concerns here which I share with the 
Auditor General and which I suspect are shared by many 
members of this House. The issue comes back again to 
accountability.
<P>
	In the bill before us we see measures which permit the Auditor 
General to do his work more effectively and thus permit this 
House to do its work more efficiently. It is also my belief that no 
crown corporation should fall outside the mandate of the Audi-
<P>

<B><A NAME="3865"> 3865 </A></B>
<P>
tor General's scrutiny and thus the scrutiny of these members to 
ensure the performance of their mandates and good fiscal 
management.
<P>
	It seems to me that in this Parliament we have a dedication to 
accountability which has been endorsed by all sides of the 
House. The government on page 12 of its red book states: 
``Whether it is in health care or regional development we think 
that it is important to measure the long term outcomes and 
consequences of our policies and programs and that is why we 
have placed so much emphasis on evaluation, innovation and 
finding the best practices''.
<P>
	Similarly the Bloc Quebecois has had its calls repeatedly for 
accountability in government. So we are all in accord on this. In 
fact if we examine the record going back over many years, we 
have the recommendations of the public accounts committee, 
the auditors general committee and many members of this 
House, including the member for Ottawa-Vanier, supporting 
the changes included in this bill.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	I call on all the members of this House to support Bill C-207. 
It is time to make these changes, changes which will strengthen 
the ability of Parliament to manage the nation's business with 
the care with which Canadians demand that we do it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The question is on the 
motion of Mr. Gauthier. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt 
the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to seek unanimous consent 
of the House to suspend until 6.50 p.m. for the Adjournment 
Debate or at the call of the Chair, whichever comes first, for the 
benefit of hon. members. If we have succeeded in recognizing 
that all members present for the Adjournment Debate have 
returned to the Chamber earlier than 6.50, we could perhaps 
proceed earlier. That is why I chose to make the request for 6.50 
which is the scheduled time for the adjournment today or at the 
call of the Chair whichever comes first.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for his intervention.
<P>
	The House has heard the suggestion of the hon. member. Is it 
agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House will stand 
suspended to the call of the Chair or 6.50 p.m.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Maybe I can help the House. I believe that the government 
deputy whip's intention was to give members who must answer 
for the government the chance to arrive in the House.
<P>
	That was the reason for his intervention. The House will now 
stand adjourned to the call of the Chair or 6.50 p.m.
<P>
	The member for Richelieu on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is 
there consent from the members opposite for the members who 
are present to make their four-minute statements now; they 
could get their answer from the parliamentary secretaries later 
on, in order, when they get here? We could start right away.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, events are overtaking us. One 
parliamentary secretary arrived in the interval and we are ready 
to proceed with at least two of the adjournment debates now. I 
understand another one is in the lobby. That is three out of the 
total number. Therefore we could start.
<P>
	The only thing is that the Chair may need to redo the order of 
them in order to accommodate the members that are present. 
That being said, yes, perhaps we could proceed now if the House 
is agreeable. If that is the case then we could call it immediately 
as 6.50 p.m.
