<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADA-UNITEDSTATESTWINNINGPROGRAM">CANADA-UNITED STATES TWINNING PROGRAM</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to familiarize the House with my idea to twin 
Canadian ridings with United States congressional districts.
<P>
	Twinning Canadian ridings with United States congressional 
districts would encourage the exchange of ideas and build channels 
of communication between Canadian and U.S. legislators. The 
twinning program would provide opportunities for politicians on 
both sides to gain a better understanding of the problems facing 
both nations.
<P>
	One critical aspect of the twinning program is the initial 
twinning process. I hope to elicit the support of my fellow 
members of Parliament in determining the possible twinnings. I 
would greatly appreciate their assistance with this process.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BANKS">BANKS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canadian 
banks are reporting enormous profits. Great. Shareholders are 
happy. Banks pay taxes and so do their shareholders. The 
government has also imposed a 12.5 per cent surtax on the banks. 
So far, so good.
<P>
	What I, however, find indecent, prohibitive, shocking, even 
outrageous, are the interest rates charged by the banks on 
consumers' credit card balances as well as their service charges on 
banking transactions.
<P>
	The government's role is to protect users from this kind of 
shameless exploitation. Bankers should be called to order. This 
calls for some serious reflection on the part of these powerful 
bankers and the government.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTHSERVICESRESEARCHFUND">HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH FUND</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to challenge the government on its decision to 
unconditionally spend $65 million on a health services research 
fund.
<P>
	I have heard from Canadians from coast to coast who are 
incensed to learn of the existing Health Canada research funding 
priorities or lack thereof. For instance in 1994-95 the federal 
government spent some $43.4 million on the AIDS strategy, yet in 
the same year it spent a mere $4 million for breast cancer.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is the last 
day of National Farm Safety Week.
<P>
	Farming can be a hazardous occupation. The farm is not only a 
home but an industrial work site. It has been estimated that 200 
people die every year in farm related accidents. Children are 
especially at risk, with reports indicating that approximately 20 per 
cent of farm fatalities are youth under the age of 14.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	There is no other occupation in Canada where children live on an 
industrial work site. This makes farm safety a very important issue 
and something every farm family must work to improve. Farm 
safety is an important issue that warrants more attention.
<P>
	I applaud the efforts of the Canadian Coalition for Agricultural 
Safety and Rural Health, which includes organizations such as 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, to educate the public and to address the serious 
problems of accidental death and injuries suffered by farmers and 
their families.
<P>
	I encourage our farming sector to make a determined effort to 
eradicate dangerous environments on their lands. Let us all work 
together to eliminate farm tragedies in 1996 and into the future.

Speaker, Farm Safety Week is being observed Canada wide from 
March 7 to 13. The 1996 theme is child safety.
<P>
	The Farm Safety Association has announced that farm related 
fatalities were down by 21 per cent in 1995. Still, 19 people were 
killed on Ontario farms during the course of farm work. Of the 19 
individuals killed, two were children under the age of 15.
<P>
	A safety project last year promoted safety among rural children 
and their families. Parents were reminded that agriculture is the 
only industry where the home is also an industrial work site, thus 
placing farm children at an increased risk of injury. I have always 
lived on a farm and as the member representing the largely 
agricultural riding of Lambton-Middlesex I know how vitally 
important farm safety is.
<P>
	My congratulations to the Farm Safety Association and the 100 
agricultural commodity groups and others who have become 
partners in this very successful project.

thereby set off an avalanche of democratic and fiscal reform which 
cannot be stopped.

these unacceptable measures the government wishes to implement.

Minister of Human Resources Development has nothing more to 
say here in this House than he has to say to Canada's unemployed.
<P>
	The minister wants people to have confidence in him, because it 
appears a consultation process is going to be starting up on the 
planned unemployment insurance reform. What can the public 
expect from a consultation which starts off with confrontations 
between the minister and the key witnesses who will be called 
before the commission?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources

problematical matter seriously. I can assure the Leader of the 
Opposition that, in the consultations to be held with the 
parliamentary committee, we will be consulting many more 
people, taking care to listen, to evaluate what they have to say.
<P>
	There will be a greater number of people consulted on bill C-12 
than there were involved in selecting the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is talking about something he knows nothing about, since 
obviously he will never be selected leader of his party. Instead of 
being concerned about the Leader of the Opposition, he ought to be 
concerned about the unemployed, for whom he is responsible.
<P>
	The minister is announcing major amendments to his bill. It 
would appear that his mind is already made up, yet he is talking 
about consultations. Will he finally admit that his intention to cut 
benefits to all Canadian unemployed persons is indeed already 
finalized and his decisions have already been secretly included in 
the Minister of Finance's calculations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it would be to the Leader of the 
Opposition's advantage to allow the critic, who handles these 
issues so ably, to continue to work toward the improvements we 
wish to see made to Bill C-12. That hon. member knows what she is

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> The Minister of Human Resources Development 
has up to now shown no intention of withdrawing his bill on

I even hear what the parliamentary delegation on the committee 
has to say. In the coming days, when we have heard the witnesses 
who are to appear before the committee, I hope that we will hear

to meet the needs of people with legitimate concerns.

exactly what amendments he plans to make to his bill?

supposed to appear before the committee. Dozens, if not hundreds 
of individuals and groups have asked to come and testify before the 
parliamentary committee.
<P>
	I hope, with time, the committee will invite me too to come and 
do it a bit of a favour by explaining the implications of certain 
proposals by organizations or members of Parliament.
<P>
	I do not think we should just leave the impression that it is going 
to take two, three or four months before we get to solutions, 
because I am sure the committee, given that its work has already 
begun, will submit suggestions for the government's consideration, 
and we will come up with final proposals. I hope this will happen

Speaker, after making inflated promises of jobs, jobs, jobs in the 
last election, the Liberal government has finally realized that it is 
the private sector that is going to create the majority of those jobs.
<P>
	The unemployed need more than words. The only practical way 
to unleash the job creating power of the private sector on the scale 
that is required is through genuine tax relief. Yesterday the 
Minister of Finance ruled out all hope of that happening.
<P>
	What is the hope for long term private sector job creation when 
the government has ruled out tax relief until the next millennium?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
should look at the most recent statistics. They indicate that in the 
last three months over 140,000 jobs have been created. Those are in 
the private sector almost entirely and almost entirely full time jobs.
<P>
	The hon. member would do well to look at the numbers before he 
asks his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> The 
numbers that we are looking at, Mr. Speaker, are 1.4 million 
unemployed and 2.5 million under employed. That is the statistic 
he ought to look at.
<P>
	Perhaps it is just as well that the minister did not answer my 
question about tax relief because who would believe anything the 
government said on that subject. Why would Canadians believe 
that the Liberals had any intention of leaving more money in the 
hands of taxpayers when they deliberately broke their promise to 
scrap, abolish and kill the GST?
<P>
	The government has lost its believability on the subject of tax 
reform and that diminishes the stimulative effect that promised tax 
reform could have.
<P>
	What is the hope for tax relief that will stimulate consumer and 
business confidence when the government has broken its one and 
only major promise on tax reform?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

disappointed if I had not been asked about the GST today. The hon.

minutes in the House.
<P>
	Let me deal with the question of the GST and the supposed 
questions that he raises. I would like to suggest to the hon. member 
that our commitment is clearly to harmonize. I realize harmony is 
not something that the Reform Party has.
<P>
	I suggest that he read his own party's addendum to the finance 
committee report on the GST, in which the Reform Party said: ``We 
commend the government on its attempt to harmonize the tax with 
the provinces. As the Reform Party concurs with the majority of 
those who said that a substantial simplification would result from a 
wide ranging broadening of the tax base, we support the lowest 
possible rate on the broadest possible base until major tax reform 
takes place''.
<P>
	That was the Reform Party's position.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if there is boredom in question period it is because of the 
quality of the answers, not the quality of the questions.
<P>
	The government promises hope. Where is the hope for 
consumers and families when the finance minister has  ruled out 
any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="641"> 641 </A></B>
<P>
prospect of tax relief until the next millennium? In the last seven 
years Canadians have seen the disposable incomes of families go 
down but the revenues of the federal government go up by over $20 
billion.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead,

<P>
	A number of organizations defending the rights of the disabled 
have for months been receiving so many complaints regarding 
Revenue Canada that they have recently decided to sound the 
alarm. Revenue Canada seems to have an increasingly narrow 
definition of what constitutes a disability, thus managing to limit 
access to the disability tax credit.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm for us that the directives issued by her 
government regarding the disability tax credit have resulted in a 
tightening of the eligibility criteria?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I draw to the attention of the House the very good work 
that the advocates on behalf of disabled Canadians did in 
responding to the prebudget work of the finance committee. 
Because of this work, the Minister of Finance included in this 
year's budget a paragraph that stated the government would look at 
the support systems and programs to ensure they responded to the 
modern needs of disabled Canadians.
<P>
	Specifically in response to the disability tax credit, not only has 
this member drawn it to my attention but many of my caucus 
members have as well. I have asked my department to do four 
specific things. First, to ensure that Canadians have the 
understanding and education they need to understand this credit. 
Second, to ensure that we review it in a very effective way.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order, order.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead,

directives have been issued that are in effect at odds with the report 
by the Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities, a report tabled in this House and signed by all Liberal 
members, I would like to remind the minister that in this report she 
is asked to reconsider this restrictive interpretation for the years up 
to and including 1995.
<P>
	Will the minister abandon this restrictive interpretation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the definition of persons with disabilities has been 
expanded for the sake of this credit. We know there are those who 
have been audited. We have asked every tax centre across the 
country to look at individual cases and to treat them with fairness 
and understanding should difficulties of hardship arise in 
individual cases.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
October 18, 1993 the Prime Minister stated: ``The Liberal Party is 
committed to maintaining old age security''.
<P>
	Last week in the budget the finance minister killed OAS. The 
Prime Minister made a campaign promise to seniors in 1993 that he 
knew he would break by attacking their pensions as he has.
<P>
	Why did the Prime Minister falsely raise the hopes of seniors 
that he would protect them when he was shamelessly planning to 
kill OAS as quickly as possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member would agree 
that prior to the budget and prior to statements by the Prime 
Minister, a lot of senior citizens in the country were extremely 
concerned because a number of comments and studies indicated 
that the entire program was in great difficulty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="642"> 642 </A></B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister's undertaking was to ensure that no one who 
was presently benefiting from OAS-GIS would be affected by the 
changes. He made that commitment in this place and elsewhere.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will agree that when the Minister of 
Finance brought in his budget, not only did he honour the 
commitment made by the Prime Minister, but he extended that 
commitment by making sure that no one who was 60 on January 1 
of this year was going to be affected by any changes.
<P>
	I am sure that most senior citizens appreciate the hon. member 
joining them and applauding the fact that the government has now 
predictability and sustainability in what was formerly the OAS-GIS 
which is now the combined seniors benefit.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us 
look a little more closely at this issue. The Liberal government 
does not appear to care about the retirement security of seniors 
despite the response of the hon. member.
<P>
	Not only did it kill OAS but it also attacked seniors by dropping 
the age limit for RRSPs from 71 to 69. Finance officials have 
confirmed that this attack on our seniors' pensions will generate 
billions of dollars in tax revenue for the Liberals.
<P>
	This Liberal government is playing petty politics with the 
retirement security of our seniors. Our seniors fought in wars to 
make our country great.
<P>
	Why will the finance minister not keep is money grubbing, neck 
throttling, tax grabbing hands off our RRSPs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that the hon. 
member feels very strongly about this.
<P>
	She has to come to grips with the real choices that face 
Canadians every day and also face the government and that is to 
make a choice between trying to maintain programs and systems in 
place to assist those who are most vulnerable in our society and 
recognize that people who are somewhat better off often recognize 
their obligations of having to make significant contributions.
<P>
	The true test of the changes that were announced by the Minister 
of Finance in his budget comes when you look at the reaction of 
senior citizens around the country. No one could possibly 
contemplate continuing a system where there was uncertainty, 
where people actually could not prepare to plan for their futures.
<P>
	The results of testing show the reaction from senior citizen's 
groups around the country. People do have confidence that when 
they retire there will be a program in place. Those who are already 
retired and those who are within five years of being 65 years of age 
also have certainty.

before.
<P>

taxpayers still owe the government more than $6 billion in unpaid 
taxes?
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr.

record when it comes to collecting receivables.
<P>
	We as a department have worked extremely hard, as I mentioned 
yesterday, on the underground economy. We are focusing on 
Canadians who are taxpayers. We need to have those moneys in our

<P>

<P>
	The government campaigned on the promise that it would create

of job creation? Sixty-five thousand jobs over the last year for 1.4 
million unemployed Canadians is disgraceful. Why has it not met 
its promises?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
should look at the statistics again.
<P>
	Since the government came to power over 500,000 new jobs 
have been created. They are permanent jobs and they are in the 
private sector.
<P>
	There was a problem last year. The world economy did slow and 
there was less job creation than we wanted. However, as I 
mentioned earlier to the leader of the Reform Party, in the last three 
months we have seen a strong growth in job creation, and the 
budget will ensure that continues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, those 
words mean nothing to people concerned about their future. People 
are very concerned about the lack of job growth and the slowness of 
the economy.
<P>
	The government ran on the promise that it would create jobs. 
They do not exist. Will the minister admit the real cause of 
unemployment is that we do not have lower taxes and therefore we 
do not have the type of job creation we need to give people some 
hope that we will get out of this malaise?
<P>
	The government ran on the promise of jobs, jobs, jobs. All the 
government has given people is despair, despair, despair. When 
will it meet its promise of creating jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

that the Reform Party is suggesting tax cuts. That would only raise 
the deficit. In the last two years all I have heard from the Reform 
Party is that the deficit should be reduced. Now it is suggesting tax 
cuts which would raise the deficit.
<P>
	We have instituted a policy of rolling two-years targets and the

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Acting Prime Minister. The federal government 
recently announced its intention to establish a Canadian securities 
commission. Meanwhile, provincial securities commissions are 
currently putting in place a co-ordinating system, known as 
electronic document analysis and retrieval, or SEDAR, to ensure a 
true  integration of financial markets. In that context, the Canadian 
commission will very clearly be another useless and costly 
example of overlap.
<P>
	Given that the provinces' co-ordination work is already well 
under way, will the minister finally recognize that this initiative is 
totally unnecessary and that the federal government is more 
interested in asserting its authority in an area that comes under 
provincial jurisdiction than in promoting financial market 
effectiveness?
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, on 
the contrary, I personally had discussions with a number of 
provincial officials who asked for the establishment of a unified 
securities commission. The reason for this is simple: businessmen 
who need to raise funds across the country do not want to have to 
deal with 10 different securities commissions. They want to be able 
to get the funds they need under a set of harmonized rules for the 
whole country, since it is cheaper that way.
<P>
	This is why it was proposed to create a Canadian securities 
commission. If a province does not want to join up with the federal 
securities commission, it is absolutely free to do so. This is only a 
proposal to create a partnership to serve Canadians better.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I want 
to point out to the minister that while there are businessmen there 
are also businesswomen.
<P>
	Second, I asked a question to the minister concerning SEDAR. 
Obviously, the minister is not aware of the existence of that system, 
which is a co-ordination instrument being set up by the various 
provincial securities commissions. This comes as no surprise, 
considering that effectiveness and harmonization are not 
synonymous with federalism and centralization.
<P>
	Since the provinces have clearly taken the initiative to meet a 
real need, will the minister stop once and for all trying to take 
control of everything and accusing the provinces of being 
ineffective?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
nobody is accusing anyone of being ineffeffective as regards the 
securities sector. However, there are businesspeople who clearly 
asked the federal government and their provincial government, in 
order to promote job creation and more profitable investments, to 
create a securities commission with a single set of rules for the 
whole country.
<P>
	Once again, the idea is not to impose anything, but to offer 
Canadians the best possible service. Bloc members who put 
Quebec's interests first should know when it is in their best 
interests to have national standards that help Quebecers within 
Canada to have better investments and to create jobs. Now is not

<P>
	Due to recent changes in the Canada-U.S. tax treaty over 81,000 
Canadians who receive U.S. social security have witnessed 
one-quarter of their benefits disappear at the hands of the IRS. 
Many of these are low income seniors. Americans who receive 
similar payments from Canada are allowed to seek a refund, but 
this is denied Canadians.
<P>
	What is the Minister of Finance doing to redress this inequity in 
tax treatments of low income seniors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is of interest to a 
large number of Canadians. It is an issue that has been brought to 
the attention of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The background is that we updated our treaty with the U.S. 
specifically to get rid of double taxation and also to let us recover 
OAS going to high income seniors just as we do in Canada.
<P>
	We have these taxation provisions in place with other countries 
such as Germany, France and Austria. The large number of 
Canadians receiving U.S. benefits makes this a very special case. 
This is a concern to us and we have raised the issue with Canadian

Mr. Speaker, a growing number of prairie grain farmers want the 
Canadian Wheat Board to be made more accountable and

books.
<P>
	It is amazing that the Canadian Wheat Board remains exempt 
from the scrutiny of the auditor general and so is closed to 
Canadian farmers and the public.
<P>
	When will the minister of agriculture open the books of the 
Canadian Wheat Board and make it financially accountable to 
farmers by having the auditor general do an audit of the board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. gentleman knows, the 
Canadian Wheat Board is already subject to an annual audit, 
conducted by a very well known national accounting firm in 
Canada, according to all national and international accounting 
standards. On the issue of an annual audit, it is already 
accomplished.
<P>
	In terms of the general argument about opening the books, there 
is a process under way right now in western Canada under the 
jurisdiction of the western grain marketing panel that is looking at 
a variety of complaints about our marketing system. A number of 
arguments are being made before that panel with respect to 
transparency and accountability. I hope we will receive some very 
useful advice from the panel on how to improve accountability and 
transparency through the operations of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member the Canadian Wheat Board operates in 
an intensely competitive international environment. I hope he 
would apply the same standards to international grain companies 
like Cargill, Continental and others that he would presume to apply 
to the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the minister mentions the audit. 
Deloitte &amp; Touche does the audit. Deloitte &amp; Touche has done an 
independent review of the Canadian Wheat Board. I managed to get 
hold of a copy.
<P>
	It states there are deficiencies in the operations, management 
structure and accountability to grain farmers of the Canadian 
Wheat Board. It said its annual operational plans generally do not 
exist and budgeting or forecasting of expenses does not exist. 
These are a few of the problems mentioned in the report.
<P>
	If the minister is so open and wants to co-operate in the process, 
why has he kept the report a secret from the public? Can the 
minister tell concerned grain farmers what the wheat board has 
done to address the serious deficiencies stated in the Deloitte &amp; 
Touche study?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the kinds of concerns referred to 
by the hon. gentleman in his question are among the very reasons 
the western grain marketing panel is conducting work at present 
across western Canada. As we speak, the panel is conducting a 
series of public hearings in Winnipeg and it will go on to hold 
hearings in Edmonton and in Regina. The process is entirely open, 
entirely transparent.
<P>

improve the marketing of western Canadian grain, I invite him to 
put those ideas before the western grain marketing panel so that 
they can be aired and reviewed in the proper forum.

me the opportunity to remind the House that the bill of the hon.

	I want to assure him and the House there are no provisions of the 
NAFTA agreement which will impact in terms of Canada's

working co-operatively with one another to assure every Canadian 
there will not be an attack by Americans or Mexicans as it relates to

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on a question of privilege. During question period, the 
Minister of Human Resources used the expression ``baveux'' to 
describe the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. We know one of 
them at least, one of them is the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I contend that the expression is not parliamentary. 
The word ``arrogant'' is considered unparliamentary. The use of 
such words threatens the atmosphere in this House. With all due 
respect, I contend that, in future, you should intervene immediately 
and ask the member in question to withdraw the words to avoid 
poisoning the situation.
<P>
	If the expression were considered parliamentary, we would have 
to conclude that it should be used in this House and that each side 
of the House could use terms that are an affront to the intelligence 
of remarks made here and tarnish people's image of 
parliamentarians, even those who behave properly, unlike the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, who has not, 
unfortunately, behaved properly for far too long.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, it is true the word ``baveux'' 
was used in question period. In my opinion, as the Speaker, it was 
not applied to a specific member.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This is why I intervened. The word, I believe, is 
unacceptable in circumstances such as these.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. members on both sides of the House to stop 
using such words, because, in my opinion, they are too strong for 
the House of Commons. This is why I intervened. I hope a word 
like this will not again be used in the House.
<P>
	This is not a question of privilege, but perhaps a point of order. 
However, since the minister was named, and he is here, perhaps he 
could clarify the situation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true these words were 
spoken in the House and I willingly admit that I used the 
expression. However, I would also point out that I heard others use 
it today, this afternoon, even. I agree entirely with the description 
of the situation made by the House leader of the official opposition.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I continue to agree with you that these words are 
not appropriate in this House, particularly when they might be 
claimed to have been applied to more than one person. That would 
be disastrous.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="647"> 647 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I think the word ``baveux'' will never again be 
used in the House, and I will leave the situation as it stands. It 
is over. Please do not use this word again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like things to be clear. Did 
the minister withdraw his words? Let him say so clearly, and the 
whole matter will be clarified. Could he say so while you are here?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat, I agree totally with the whip 
of the official opposition in the House and with the Speaker of the 
House that the word ``baveux'' is unacceptable and must not be 
used in this House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> So, he withdrew it. That is the end of it.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
reference to Beauchesne's, as I understand it a question of privilege 
takes precedence in the House over other matters on the Order 
Paper. We did allow question period to proceed because there was 
an understanding that it would proceed. However, in terms of 
proceeding with the other orders such as the ones we are dealing 
with now, it would be out of order in that the question of privilege 
does have precedence. I would appreciate your ruling on that, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is correct in what his belief is. 
Questions of privilege do take precedence. The reason I am going 
through the routine business of the day now is that not only is it a 
question of privilege, but it is the first item on the orders of the day.
<P>
	It is for that reason I have decided to proceed in this manner. The 
House will be seized with the matter not only as a point of privilege 
but also as the first order of the day. That is why I decided to do this 
first.

	Lesbian, gay and bisexual citizens pay taxes, make contributions 
to employee benefit plans and are entitled to the same rights and

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the

matter that has been raised in this motion is very serious and you 
have ruled that it is sufficiently serious and it should be taken up 
with priority over the other business of the House.
<P>
	I believe this is an indication to the House by its Speaker that this 
matter warrants a full investigation by the committee of the House 
that normally considers such matters, the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, which I have the honour to chair.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="649"> 649 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	I want to assure hon. members that if this matter is referred to the 
committee it will be taken very seriously. It will be given a high 
priority and it will be dealt with in an orderly and equitable manner.
<P>
	The House has on occasion dealt with matters of contempt in a 
summary fashion, for instance, when the offence in question was 
self-evident and without doubt, as in the case of a few years ago 
when the incident occurred in full view of the entire House. The 
usual practice, however, has been to ask a committee of the House, 
without prejudice, to look into the matter, to report its findings to 
the House and, if necessary, to recommend a course of action.
<P>
	This motion does not follow the usual course. The essence of the 
motion is to ask the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs to investigate the matter in question. This can be 
accomplished only if the terms of reference that the House gives to 
the committee are framed in a fair and equitable manner.
<P>
	As I indicated in my brief remarks yesterday, the motion of 
reference now before the House does not seem to meet those 
criteria. In effect the motion sets out a series of conclusions and 
then asks the committee to investigate the actions in question. Any 
committee proceedings pursuant to such an order of reference 
would be clearly prejudiced. A fair and equitable order of reference 
would not dictate the conclusions of an investigation of a 
committee, it would merely set out the issue that the House wishes 
the committee to investigate.
<P>
	To draw an analogy from the justice system, an individual is not 
convicted first and given a trial later. Every individual is entitled to 
a full and fair trial before any conclusions are reached.
<P>
	If the motion restricted itself to that there would be no problem. 
There would be no prejudice implied. Unfortunately, the motion 
contains a great many prejudicial phrases which makes it 
impossible for the committee to conduct fair hearings. Without any 
investigation of the events surrounding the issue or of the law 
concerning either sedition or contempt, the motion seeks to declare 
individuals guilty of serious offences.
<P>
	The motion does not charge these individuals with offences. It 
declares them guilty without the benefit of deliberation. This, as all 
hon. members know, is contrary to every principle of justice within 
the Canadian system. Every citizen is entitled to a fair trial in 
which the alleged offence is clearly defined and in which the 
allegations are proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
<P>
	The motion, as it is worded, makes a number of assertions that 
may or may not be correct. It asks the House of Commons to accept 
those assertions as fact without the benefit of investigation. The 
motion declares that the alleged facts constitute serious breaches of 
law. It asks the House of Commons to come to conclusions on  
these laws without having the opportunity to consider the nature of 
these laws and the jurisprudence surrounding them.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	I would suggest the proper course would be for the matter to be 
referred to committee for examination without prejudice. The 
committee could then proceed to a thorough examination of the law 
and the jurisprudence surrounding sedition and contempt and 
perhaps, more important, adduce the accurate and complete 
evidence concerning the actual events in question. It could then 
come to conclusions and report these to the House, along with any 
appropriate actions.
<P>
	It is at that time, and only at that time, that the House should then 
be asked to make a definitive statement on the actions in question. 
As I said, it is contrary to every principle of justice that is basic to 
the system in Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, your ruling is a strong indication to the House that 
it ought to order an investigation of the matter. I believe that the 
House is prepared to concur in your opinion. We do not, however, 
believe that we can risk any committee of the House being 
converted to some sort of kangaroo court. Any and all committee 
proceedings on such matters ought to be fair and equitable.
<P>
	In order to accomplish this, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting before the word ``that'' and deleting

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the action 
taken by the Reform Party is extremely serious. I intend to prove 
how serious this action is, especially as, in consideration of some 
minor changes, it has gained the support of government members, 
of Liberal members.
<P>
	To make sure that everybody knows what we are talking about, I 
believe we should read again part of the main motion before us.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, this action by the Honourable Member for 
Charlesbourg, and the then Leader of the Official Opposition should be viewed 
as seditious and offensive to this House and constitutes a contempt of 
Parliament; and consequently, the House refer the matter to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for examination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To understand fully what is at stake, I took the trouble to check 
how two of the most commonly used dictionaries defined the word 
``sedition''. According to Webster's it is ``the stirring up of 
discontent, resistance, or rebellion against the government in 
power.''
<P>
	This concept of sedition refers also to sections of the Criminal 
Code because it is something extremely serious. Sections 59 to 62 
of the Criminal Code give a more precise definition of what 
sedition is, and I quote: ``Every one shall be presumed to have a 
seditious intention who teaches or advocates, or publishes or 
circulates any writing that advocates, the use, without the authority 
of law, of force as a means of accomplishing a governmental 
change within Canada.''
<P>
	It remains to be seen whether the charge laid by the Reform 
Party can be taken into consideration by this House in view of the 
fact that not only it is obviously grossly overstated, but also it does 
not refer to the action taken by my colleague, the member for 
Charlesbourg.
<P>
	As proof, we only need to go back to the communiqué which is 
the object of the Reform Party's wrath. The fourth line of that text 
reads as follows, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-MP for Charlesbourg, Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob, put forward his position today 
concerning the national defence policy of a sovereign Québec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is no deception whatsoever in that press release issued by 
the MP for Charlesbourg. It states the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois, a political party which is fully recognized, was 
democratically elected to this House with the support of 50 per cent 
of the Quebec population, and has some ideas on the eventual 
organization of the department of defence and of the defence 
system if sovereignty as it proposes it is ever accepted.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	In publishing that press release, the MP for Charlesbourg never 
had any seditious, as the term says, intent of any kind. He did not 
try to propose the use of  force against established order, with a 
view to overthrowing the government.
<P>
	Someone deciding to commit a seditious action, to foment 
rebellion, would not do so openly and publicly and would not send 
a press release to all the journalists in the press gallery to explain 
what a sovereign Quebec would do.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, this would be like signing his own 
death warrant.
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen of the press and of the television, I 
hereby announce that our party intends to start a rebellion in 
Canada''. It makes no sense. This is a public action taken by a 
member of Parliament who, within the context of his duties, 
explains the structure of the department of defence in a sovereign 
Quebec.
<P>
	Now everybody, all the members in this House, all the 
journalists on Parliament Hill, everyone except maybe the reform 
party members who have not yet understood it, everybody knows 
that the main reason why Bloc Quebecois members were elected to 
this House, their main political goal, is for Quebec to become a real 
country as soon as possible.
<P>
	Some people could say: ``Yes, but if we read a little further on in 
the communiqué, the member for Charlesbourg wrote that Quebec 
will need all the Quebecers who are currently in the military; he 
added that Quebec will be part of NATO, that we share concerns for 
democracy and for the respect of civil and human rights''. What 
offence did the member for Charlesbourg commit? He announced 
that we intended to respect our international responsibilities in the 
defence area, and that in Quebec we respect human rights. Is he 
guilty of sedition because he said that we would respect human 
rights?
<P>
	``The day after a yes win,'' he says, ``Quebec should 
immediately create a Department of Defence, the embryo of a 
major state, and offer Quebecers serving in the Canadian Forces the 
chance to integrate into the Quebec Forces ``while keeping their 
rank, seniority-'', etc.
<P>
	It is also public knowledge-and the communiqué must be 
interpreted in that light-that Quebec's plan to achieve sovereignty 
will become a reality-it was announced throughout the 
referendum campaign-after a yes win and a one-year period of 
negotiations during which we will offer the rest of Canada a 
partnership in an appropriate, responsible and honest way. And it is 
only at the end of this process that Quebec's sovereignty will be 
proclaimed and that Quebec will put in place its defence system, its 
army and the whole structure of a real country. I repeat, after.
<P>
	Is it reasonable to think that the hon. member for Charlesbourg is 
guilty of high treason for announcing to  all newspapers in Canada 
that, after a yes vote in the referendum and a year of negotiations, 
Quebec will give itself a defence policy? Is it treason to tell those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="651"> 651 </A></B>
<P>
citizens who were asked to support our goal what the future will be 
like in our new country? That, Mr. Speaker, is sheer nonsense.
<P>
	The reality behind this motion is that, for Reform members in 
this House, being a sovereignist is a crime. According to Reform 
members, 50 per cent of Quebecers should be charged with treason, 
since, as sovereignists, they want their own country.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I must point out that the reality behind this motion 
is that, for over two years, the Reform Party has wanted to form the 
official opposition but has been unable to earn this position. That is 
its problem.
<P>
	Reform members will have an opportunity, during the coming 
by-elections, to become the official opposition if they wish. They 
should behave like democrats. It is only by running in the ridings in 
question and defeating the Bloc and Liberal candidates that they 
can be taken seriously and have any hope of becoming the official 
opposition. Not before.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, your ruling, which I deeply respect, calls for the 
House to consider and vote on this motion. We in the official 
opposition had felt and hoped that Liberal members, acting a little 
more sensibly, logically and responsibly than third party members, 
would fight this motion which does not make any sense and is 
totally unfounded, which goes way beyond what the hon. member 
for Charlesbourg has done and even infringes on the official 
opposition's right of free speech.
<P>
	Instead, they disguise the main proposal. It is hypocritical to try 
to disguise a proposal like this one on the pretext that talking about 
sedition is not quite politically correct, that it does not look good in 
the Quebec ridings where those people have representatives. They 
know very well what the people of Quebec would think of their 
colleagues in every riding, because no one in Quebec, not even non 
sovereignists, will ever tolerate that sovereignists be called traitors 
and accused of sedition for making our goal known, a goal in which 
we believe.
<P>
	They know very well that they would be judged harshly in their 
ridings. That is why they resorted to a totally, and I would say 
obviously, artificial artifice. An unspeakable artifice. That is the 
word I was looking for. They tried to do some window dressing by 
saying: ``Let us refer the matter to the House committee. It will 
examine the matter involving the member for Charlesbourg. We 
will look at the press release like good children. We will assess the 
situation. We will determine whether or not the member for 
Charlesbourg is a traitor for speaking of sovereignty''. That is what 
we are hearing from the across the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Shame. You should be ashamed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Did you think for a moment that we would let the 
parliamentary system deteriorate to the point where a colleague of
<P>
ours can be named in a parliamentary release without any 
restriction, without any sort of protection? Did you think that we 
would let our colleague stand trial without being afforded the 
protection normally afforded to anyone who has dealings with the 
law? Do you think that we will let a puppet court decide the case of 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg, who is guilty of having made 
our political vision known? Never.
<P>
	I shall remind you, Mr. Speaker, and the hon. members opposite 
that further thought needs to be given to this. To vote for the new 
motion we have before us, which makes a few changes to the 
motion put forward by the Reform Party, is to enter into a 
dangerous partnership with the third party. Politically, the Liberal 
Party of Canada will never recover from such act of infamy. In 
Quebec, the people, including federalist Quebecers, will never 
forget what federal Liberal members will have done. It is plain 
unthinkable that we would go along with this kind of game.
<P>
	The hon. member for Charlesbourg did his job as a member of 
Parliament. The official opposition is doing its job in this 
Parliament. We are looking after the interests of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	We are publicizing our sovereignty plan, as we have been asked 
to do by the other side of the House. The Prime Minister regularly 
says to us: ``Tell the public about your plan''. Yes, we are telling 
Quebecers about it. No, we have not finished publicizing it because 
our presence here is designed to do precisely that. This plan that is 
so dear to us and that we will soon, furthermore, succeed in 
bringing about is our reason for existing.
<P>
	There is not one member of the official opposition in this House 
that would stand for it, if one of our colleagues were dragged 
before a committee, without rules, with no protection whatsoever, 
handed over to the Reformers, who would like nothing better than 
to occupy our seats, handed over to the members of the Liberal 
Party who could blindly take positions that are absolutely 
unacceptable in the democratic system in which we operate.
<P>
	Referring to committee the case of the member for Charlesbourg 
and the press release in question would be to brand him guilty, in 
advance, of sedition, without actually using that term, because it 
would not fly in Quebec. It would allow the member for 
Charlesbourg to fall victim to the ire of certain people who cannot 
accept that a political plan such as ours is allowed to be expressed 
freely in this country and in this Parliament.
<P>
	It would be as if 50 per cent of Quebecers were dragged before 
this committee without rules to defend  themselves simply because 
they have committed the crime of being sovereignists. Sixty per 
cent of francophones in Quebec are represented by the member for 
Charlesbourg, they think like he does and they want him to explain 
to the members opposite that our political project makes sense.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="652"> 652 </A></B>
<P>
	Never will we accept that our colleague, the member for 
Charlesbourg, be attacked by fellow parliamentarians before a 
puppet committee, a puppet tribunal, simply because he took the 
time to honestly explain our political project with the 
parliamentary means at his disposal. Never will we accept that 50 
per cent of Quebecers be dragged before this committee without 
rules. Never will we accept that a fundamental right that 
parliamentarians in this country have always enjoyed, namely the 
right to express themselves and present their ideas even if the 
government does not agree, be taken away from us.
<P>
	To vote for this motion as amended by the government is 
unacceptable because it is a direct infringement upon our right to 
represent our constituents and to present our option with all the 
implications it would have if Quebecers decided to have their own 
country. We will never be able to vote for this motion because after 
that, in this House, Liberals and Reformers alike will ask 
sovereignists ``O.K., who is next?''. We do not accept that, and 
Quebec does not accept it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, since the time allotted to the 
Leader of the Opposition is unlimited, it is not followed by a 
question and comment period. Resuming debate. The government 
whip has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to take a few minutes to indicate to the House 
that some of the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition 
are-to say the least-far removed from the facts before the 
House.
<P>
	Of course, we just heard him vent his feelings and his distress 
and say some things which are far removed from the truth-and I 
am being polite here. He argued, for instance-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Side with the Reform Party!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Maybe if the member opposite were to listen, he 
would finally learn something after all these years.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	It is the Speaker of the House, and not the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, nor the government whip, nor the 
parliamentary secretary, who has ruled that this is a prima facie 
case of privilege. The issue was certainly not raised by the 
government. As it turned out, it was raised by someone else, but the 
fact remains that the House of Commons, through the Speaker, has 
decided that this was a prima facie case of privilege.
<P>
	So, this is where we are at, right now. It is up to all the members 
of Parliament to ensure that the committee can do its job. And we 
are not talking here about a puppet committee, or a committee 
without rules, as the Leader of the Opposition put it. The leader of 
the opposition said that we have no rules to guide us. There are the 
Standing Orders of the House, Beauchesne, Bourinot, Erskine May, 
I could go on and on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon: </B>Not forgetting the red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>There are library shelves chock full of books on 
procedure to guide our deliberations in the House and in 
committees.
<P>
	The leader of the opposition's splitting himself in two in the 
House to claim it is otherwise does not make it so. The inaccuracy 
still remains. The members across the way are talking of voting 
nay. There has not been a vote in this House as of this moment.
<P>
	We are faced with a situation in which the Speaker has deemed 
there was a <I>prima facie</I> question of privilege. This was followed by 
a Speaker's decision to entertain a motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Vote nay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>The motion before this House is unacceptable as it 
is improperly put.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>Vote nay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> You vote nay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The hon. members across the way may continue 
with their catcalls, but the facts remain the same. If the motion is 
improperly drafted, it is the duty of this House to do things 
properly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Vote against it, do not amend it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> What we have done in this House is to propose, 
following on the ruling issued in this House by its Speaker, that it is 
totally in order for a committee to consider the matter. My 
colleague, seconded by myself, has therefore moved that the matter 
of the hon. member for Charlesbourg be referred to the 
parliamentary committee.
<P>
	If the Reform members think-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. My dear colleagues, this is one of 
the most serious debates we have had here in this House. We shall 
all have the chance to speak here in the House. We are Canadians, 
we are democratic, and you will all have an opportunity to speak.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I ask you to have the courtesy to hear out all members of 
Parliament. This is a very important issue for all of us. As your 
Speaker I ask you to respect one another in this debate and listen to 
what is being said. Then you will make up your minds as 
parliamentarians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="653"> 653 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just like to take a few 
minutes to conclude. We all have a duty to ensure that this 
Parliament works well. There are no puppet committees. The 
decision of the House to strike the Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs was a unanimous one.
<P>
	This committee, which deals with procedure, privileges and 
elections, was established by unanimous consent of the House. 
Every member of this House knows that it is the role of this 
committee to deal with such issues. It is wrong to now claim that 
this is a puppet committee with no rules. It is absolutely wrong. To 
make such a claim is also to insult this House. That is what it is. 
This is not a puppet committee, and it will do its job. Too bad for 
those who chose to make gratuitous accusations in their motion.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	We, on this side of the House, and certainly myself as a long time 
parliamentarian, only want the committee to do its job, as it has 
done on several occasions. Contrary to the claim made, this is not 
unprecedented. I remember the Mackasey case. I remember other 
cases that were referred to the same committee and a decision was 
made. I even remember parliamentarians who chose to put their 
case before the committee, in order to prove their innocence. How 
can anyone say that this is a puppet committee? These are false 
allegations. Members opposite know that. It is wrong for them to 
now criticize in that fashion the existence of House committees 
and, in doing so, that of our parliamentary institution, and they 
know that.
<P>
	Why did those across the floor who chose to make such 
gratuitous accusations not draft the motion in proper form? Surely, 
they must know how to do it. And if they do not, there are enough 
lawyers and procedural experts in this place to help them, and they 
surely could have consulted them. The same rule applies to them. 
All we have to do is refer the case to the committee, without 
making accusations, where it will be heard in an honest and 
legitimate manner.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is all we have to do. All the people across the way and those 
making those kinds of gratuitous affirmations are no better. All we 
have to do as Parliamentarians is do our jobs honestly in the House 
and in the parliamentary committee. Then the issue will be clear 
and hopefully the House will be stronger when it comes out of this. 
However, it will not happen unless we all want to do the right thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to add a calm voice to this discussion. I would 
like to add it to those voices of hon. members who have been 
urging the motion of privilege put by the member for  
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt be accepted as it is, not as 
amended, and that the matter contained in the original motion be 
referred to the standing committee.
<P>
	It has been well established that the member for Charlesbourg, a 
member of the defence committee of the House, released a 
communiqué on letterhead of the office of the leader of the official 
opposition of the House on October 26, 1995 before the referendum 
in Quebec. It invited Quebec francophone members of the 
Canadian Armed Forces to join the Quebec military in the event of 
a yes vote in support of separation from Canada.
<P>
	The original motion calls for recognition that in the opinion of 
the House this action should be viewed as seditious, offensive and 
in contempt of Parliament. I will argue in favour of retaining the 
original wording. The government wants to water it down.
<P>
	The issue is not whether the action by the member was foolish 
and ill considered; obviously it was foolish and ill considered. If 
the commission of foolish and ill considered actions from time to 
time were to constitute contempt of Parliament very few of us 
would escape its censure.
<P>
	The issue is not whether the action by the member was offensive 
to the public, although it undoubtedly is offensive to many 
members of the public judging from the letters we have received, 
including letters from my constituents. The issue is not even 
whether the action of the member was seditious or traitorous in the 
sense of sections 53, 59 or 62 of the Criminal Code, a subject on 
which at least one Ontario court has partially ruled.
<P>
	Rather, the issue is whether in the opinion of the House, a court 
in its own right with respect to its own privileges, the action of the 
member should be viewed as seditious and offensive.
<P>
	I remind the government House leader these words were 
carefully chosen. They have not been carefully read but they were 
carefully chosen in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	As early as June 1994 I urged the Prime Minister publicly and 
privately to spell out the terms and conditions which in the opinion 
of the federal government ought to govern any attempt at 
secession. I asked him to spell out the terms and conditions which 
ought to govern any public order issues, such as those envisioned 
by part II of the Criminal Code and the Emergencies Act. My fear 
was that in the absence of such guidelines it would be left to the 
sovereignists, those advocating the break-up of Canada, to define 
what constituted acceptable and unacceptable behaviour in those 
circumstances. That is exactly what happened.
<P>
	The principal reason for allowing this motion to proceed in its 
original form is not simply to determine whether a particular 
member should be disciplined for  actions offensive to this House 
and to many Canadians. It is to permit this House to consider 
through an examination by the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs. It is for the future guidance of all members in 
terms of what constitutes acceptable or unacceptable conduct with 
respect to urging members of the Canadian Armed Forces to pursue 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="654"> 654 </A></B>
<P>
a particular course of action in the event of an attempted secession 
by a province or a part thereof.
<P>
	Part II of our Criminal Code tends to define sedition using an old 
wartime definition of sedition. It defines it narrowly as advocating 
governmental change within Canada by the use of force or 
violence. The Leader of the Opposition misses the entire point of 
our motion by harping on that particular definition.
<P>
	Proceeding with this motion will require the standing committee 
to determine what should and should not be viewed as seditious in 
the present opinion of this House in the context of a secession 
attempt, something that the Criminal Code never envisioned, nor 
did the court cases dealing with sedition in the past consider. For 
example, it may well be that in the opinion of this House, under 
present circumstances, advocating a change of government in 
Canada by any unlawful means should be considered some form of 
sedition and that the Criminal Code should be changed to reflect 
that opinion. That could very well be one of the conclusions of the 
standing committee.
<P>
	The government by amending the motion seeks to avoid coming 
to grips with the real issues raised by a secession attempt and the 
participation of members of this House in that attempt. It seeks 
again to avoid the realities of secession. That is precisely what it 
did prior to the referendum and it was a profound mistake. It was a 
strategic mistake. It allowed separatists to define what was 
acceptable and unacceptable in the event of a yes vote. It created a 
vacuum into which members like the member for Charlesbourg 
wandered and were allowed to do whatever they pleased. That 
same type of conduct will occur in the future if that vacuum is 
allowed to remain.
<P>
	Many Liberal backbenchers, to their credit, saw that mistake 
more clearly than the advisers in the Prime Minister's office. Now 
by supporting this motion they have a chance to correct it. The 
House has a chance to correct it at least in relation to one small 
dimension of the separation issue.
<P>
	Supporting this motion in its original form would make a major 
contribution to clarifying for all members what constitutes 
acceptable or unacceptable conduct with respect to attempting to 
influence the armed forces in the unusual constitutional 
circumstances in which this country finds itself. Supporting the 
motion in its original form contributes to the rule of law by 
defining the rule of law in an area where it is unclear or does not 
exist at all and contributes to peace, order and good government, 
two purposes for which this House exists.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to have a clarification from the hon. member as to 
whether or not he appreciates the importance of having this matter 
referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs. I would like to get his view on the prejudicial aspects of the 
preamble to the hon. member's motion.
<P>
	We are really talking about the fundamental issues of Canadian 
justice. Certainly as members of Parliament, which is from where 
all our country's laws should come, we should be setting the first 
example on justice. It strikes me that when we have a motion that 
colours the rights of any member of the House prior to its going to 
committee, we would be putting in jeopardy the deliberations of 
the committee. It was for that reason the amendment was offered.
<P>
	I would like to get a specific reply to my question on whether or 
not there is a prejudice occurring.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, if this matter is to be investigated, 
the charge has to be made in some way, shape or form so that the 
committee knows what it is investigating, what it is endeavouring 
to determine, what is true and what is not true. That is the reason 
for that thrust.
<P>
	A second thing should be said in response to the member's 
intervention. His committee is not acting just like a court. This 
Parliament not only interprets laws and can interpret laws in 
committee, it also makes laws. In fact that is its primary function 
and that is why the motion is worded the way it is.
<P>
	If someone does what is alleged and it is established that they did 
it or whatever the case is established, should that be viewed as 
seditious? That is not a question a court can answer but it is a 
question which Parliament and a committee can answer. If it should 
be viewed as seditious, then this body has the capacity to change 
the law and the definition of sedition. That is why the words 
``should be viewed'' are included in the motion. To strike them 
changes the whole nature of what we are endeavouring to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am dismayed when I hear the member of the Reform 
Party talk of sedition and of such a serious matter, as you said Mr. 
Speaker, with practically no grounds. I think that the leader of the 
Reform Party is a smart man and knows how to read communiqués. 
I think he understands the news. I wonder why he is putting so 
much time and energie into bringing this matter up in the House 
today.
<P>
	I think that, if one follows the news, one realizes-maybe this is 
something people do not  know-that this matter has already been 
considered by a justice of the peace. A lawyer from Montreal was, 
like the Reform Party, of the opinion that the member for 
Charlesbourg had committed a crime of lese majesty and decided 
to lay a complaint. A justice of the peace, a law professional, a 
person who knows the law, who knows the Criminal Code, who 
knows what he is talking about, has studied the communiqué, has 
considered the facts at issue, and has rejected the complaint made 
by the Montreal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="655"> 655 </A></B>
<P>
lawyer. Furthermore, the same thing occurred in Ontario, and the 
complaint was again rejected.
<P>
	The member must be aware of that. Canadian legal experts, not 
only from Montreal or Quebec, but also from Toronto, in Ontario, 
determined that there was nothing wrong there. The communiqué 
was even been described as a job offer.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	Today, some people feel the need to waste the time of the House, 
to make members of Parliament waste their time on something as 
ridiculous as this. There is no sedition. That is clear. I challenge the 
member to find in the communiqué issued by the member for 
Charlesbourg a call to violence or to threat to public order. Where 
can he find, in the communiqué, an invitation or an incitement to 
engage in some prohibited action? Where? Nowhere.
<P>
	I challenge the member to find exactly where such things are to 
be found in the communiqué. He will draw the same conclusion as 
the justices of the peace and the legal experts: it is a job offer. The 
member for Charlesbourg said that after a yes vote, those who are 
in the army will be allowed to join the forces, or the Quebec army, 
since Quebec will have an army, as any other self-respecting 
country.
<P>
	It is not a call to sedition or revolt to welcome people with open 
arms while telling them: ``French and English speaking Quebecers, 
join us''. Nowhere in the communiqué can such a distinction 
between French and English speaking people be found. The 
Reform Party members are the ones who are making that 
distinction. They are the ones acting in this way.
<P>
	Where, in the communiqué, is there a distinction between French 
and English speaking people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry: </B>Nowhere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> These are other questions for which the 
Reform Party member, who is, moreover, the leader of the third 
party, will not be able to provide an answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
intervention. It gives us a chance to explain exactly what is going 
on here. If the member had listened to my remarks he would have 
heard what I said. I will repeat it slowly.
<P>
	The issue here is not whether the action of the member was 
seditious or traitorous in the sense of sections 53, 59 or 62 of the 
Criminal Code, the sections cited in the two court cases the 
member refers to, both of which I have read and a subject on which 
two courts have partially ruled. That is not the question. We are not 
answering the question as to whether the member urged sedition in 
the sense of the Criminal Code with respect to the use of force or 
violence to overthrow the government.
<P>
	The actual motion is whether in the opinion of this House the 
action of the member ``should be viewed'' as seditious and 
offensive. If the committee were to determine that it should be 
viewed as seditious that would require us to change the definition 
of sedition. That is where Parliament is different from a court. A 
court could come to the conclusion that this type of activity should 
be regarded as some sort of sedition but the court could do nothing 
about it. This Parliament can. That is why the words ``should be 
viewed'' are essential to the motion and should be left there rather 
than struck.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc will not believe this but it is important to 
get it on the record. Getting these guidelines clear as to what is 
acceptable and unacceptable is as much for their protection and for 
the protection of their province as it is for anyone else. I am afraid 
that if these things are not answered then that is when accidents 
will happen. People will do ad hoc things that will be destructive to 
the interests of Quebec and Canada, things we have not even 
envisioned. We all have a vested interest, whether or not we agree 
in exactly what is acceptable or unacceptable in this circumstance, 
in spelling it out in law if that is at all possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
what the leader of the third party had to say. He has just confirmed 
that the judgment we are about to pass on the member for 
Charlesbourg is a question of political opportunism. It boils down 
to this: Was what the member said in this House or outside 
acceptable to the leader of the third party or did it offend him?
<P>
	Does this means that from now on, whenever we ask an 
embarrassing question of the Prime Minister, a question that might 
be considered politically embarrassing by Canadians at large, or 
embarrassing for the government or whatever, the leader of the 
third party will rise and say: ``Hand this guy over to a House 
committee''. This is tantamount to throwing a lamb to the wolves.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	And yet, this is what he is asking you to do. This is what is 
happening. We can no longer ask legitimate questions, questions 
our constituents are asking, and rightly so. This is all about 
political opportunism. We are  told: ``If we do not like what you are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="656"> 656 </A></B>
<P>
saying, we are going to parade you in front of this wolf committee; 
you are the lamb and you are going to be torn apart''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would answer that intervention 
with another question. The Bloc member cannot answer it today, 
but it will help the House.
<P>
	Let us say that Quebec got its sovereignty. If someone advocated 
a change in the sovereign government of Quebec by unlawful 
means should that be prevented or prohibited in Quebec law? If 
your answer to that is yes, then you should be supporting the 
motion rather than opposing it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This ends the question and answer period for this 
speaker. Once again, I ask all members to please address the Chair. 
Do not address one another. Address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have all been following the remarks of colleagues very 
closely on this important issue. As much as we would like to 
conclude debate and have the matter dealt with, I would hope that 
most of us would want to see the matter go to committee, rather 
than taking up the time of the House.
<P>
	Certain things have to be said and certain things have to be 
clarified and I would like to focus on two or three of them now.
<P>
	The process which I support is one that would cause the motion 
to be amended, as has been moved, and referred to a committee. 
The importance of amending the motion before it is referred to a 
committee lies in two or three reasons.
<P>
	The first reason is that all of us in the House, I am sure, wish to 
accord to each other over the period of our service here the utmost 
in procedural fairness and respect.
<P>
	The manner in which this motion was originally framed, 
although perhaps it was not intended, alleges that the action of the 
hon. member who was cited was seditious. His action may or may 
not constitute sedition. It may or may not constitute something else 
in the Criminal Code. It may or may not constitute something else 
again, simply involving the appropriate activities of a member of 
the House of Commons. Clearly there are some questions on which 
we are not clear and the precedents do not teach us well.
<P>
	The motion should be reframed and the matter should be sent to 
a committee in a manner which will not prejudge precisely what 
the error was, if any, that occurred by the action which was taken 
by the hon. member.
<P>
	Every one of us has an interest in ensuring procedural fairness. 
Today I have heard suggestions from the leader of the official 
opposition about this being a kangaroo  court. I could be critical of 
that. In saying that he does a disservice to himself, to his colleagues 
and to all of us in the House by prejudging that something which 
we will put in place, something which we will do, will constitute a 
kangaroo court. I know that all members of the House will not let 
that happen.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I want to see the motion amended. I have concerns about the way 
the matter is being framed here in the House with constant 
references to sedition. There is no need to frame this as sedition.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition and other speakers have attempted 
to define what sedition is. In each case they failed to take note of 
the very clear words in the Criminal Code that define sedition as 
more that just the presumptive words referring to use of force or 
violence.
<P>
	I will read them. Just in case anyone wants to refer to it, it is 
section 59 and it states: ``Without limiting the generality of the 
expression, seditious intention, everyone shall be presumed to have 
a sedition intention who does (a), (b) and (c). But the definition 
clearly says ``without limiting the generality of the meaning of the 
expression, seditious intention''. Where do we find out what 
seditious intention is? It is more than just the presumptive words.
<P>
	The last case that dealt with this was Boucher <I>v</I> the King in the 
1950s. The court was divided but it spoke. In my reading of that 
case, sedition does not just involve words or encouragement of the 
use of force in promoting public disorder. There are other elements 
to it. We should not refer this to the procedure and House affairs 
committee without acknowledging the fact that we are not just 
talking narrow words of sedition that have been described here. 
Sedition is more than that.
<P>
	Even beyond that, the action by this member should not be seen 
as potential sedition. There is another section in the Criminal Code 
that has nothing to do with sedition. Section 62 makes no reference 
to sedition, but it does say: ``everyone who willfully publishes, 
edits, issues, circulates or distributes a writing that advises, 
counsels or urges insubordination or disloyalty by a member of a 
force''-meaning the armed forces-``is guilty of an indictable 
offence''. It says nothing about sedition.
<P>
	The original motion in the House clearly referred to sedition. In 
my view that is too narrow. We must look at other aspects of the 
action by the member. It is possible he may not have been wilful. 
We do not know. The committee will probably look at that. 
However, we must determine whether he did what has been alleged 
here because we all have a concern about this.
<P>
	I take another step and urge the acceptance of the amendment to 
the motion. We are not directly concerned here as a public 
prosecutor would be about whether there might have been sedition 
or that there might have been a counselling to disloyalty of a 
member of the  armed forces. We are looking at whether a member 
of the House misused his office, resources, his taxpayer provided 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="657"> 657 </A></B>
<P>
resources, all the privileges he has in the House, for an act that 
would bring contempt on the House.
<P>
	The original motion does not reflect that aspect. That is another 
reason why the motion should be amended.
<P>
	I also heard the word treason mentioned. The word treason 
should not have come up. I think we have free speech here within 
the limits of the Criminal Code. Treason has not come up. It is a 
non-issue. No one has alleged, as the leader of the official 
opposition has alleged, that there was some type of treason. There 
is no connection between what has happened here and the political 
viewpoint of a person in the province of Quebec who may or may 
not wish to see his or her government take certain actions in the 
future. This is not an issue that involves sovereignty or separatism 
or secession.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	We are dealing with the actions of a member of Parliament in 
using his resources to do something that may have been a breach of 
our law or a breach of the rules of the House. I have every 
expectation that we can fairly accommodate that in the procedures 
we have in this House. In my short career here I have seen three or 
four procedures involving the bar and motions for contempt.
<P>
	We have difficulty from time to time when some of us-we are 
political animals-politicize these incidents. I would encourage 
members on both sides to please try in this case to avoid 
politicizing it to the degree to which we are all capable, especially 
because the raison d'être of the Bloc Quebecois is arguably related 
to the actions of that member. I would not want us to be blind to the 
fact that we all could politicize this past the point where we have 
the ability to act fairly: fairly in relation to the member, fairly in 
relation to ourselves and the precedent we may or may not set for 
dealing with these kinds of actions in the future.
<P>
	I want to see the motion amended. I want to see the matter dealt 
with. I have confidence in the abilities of members on both sides of 
the House who will sit on the procedure and House affairs 
committee to dispose of this matter fairly.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not 
take the floor for a few weeks. I am participating in today's debate 
with a lot of sadness. I have been in this House for 12 years, and 
during those 12 years I have seen debates where the differences of 
opinion between the parties were enormous, and I have seen very 
fiery debates.
<P>
	I remember for example the great debate on the death penalty, 
where positions were deeply entrenched. However, members were 
always respectful of the rights  of their colleagues, whether they 
were for or against the death penalty, for or against abortion, for or 
against an institutional reform, they were always respectful of each 
other. Today's debate in this House is a shame for Canadian 
democracy. What we are doing in this House is impugning motives. 
Worse, what we are putting on trial is the right to write, speak or 
express an opinion on a subject in this country still called Canada. 
This is the real debate launched by the Reform Party, and the 
Liberal Party is a party to this shameful behaviour.
<P>
	Today, we are witnessing the sovietization of debates in Canada. 
That is what it means. We are creating a censure board, here, in this 
country that calls itself democratic. That is what we are doing 
today. We are impugning the motives of a political party on the 
basis of one communiqué from one of its members. I, too, want to 
be implicated, because in my own riding I dared talk to Canadian 
athletes who were going to the Olympic Games and told them: ``I 
cannot wait for you to serve Quebec in the Olympic Games, when 
Quebec becomes a country''.
<P>
	I talked to the postmaster and told him: ``I cannot wait until, as a 
postmaster, you serve Quebec''. I spoke with health research 
officers in my riding. I told them: ``I look forward to having you as 
health research officers for Quebec after Quebec has become 
sovereign''. I spoke with Canada customs officials. I told them: ``I 
look forward to having you as employees of Quebec customs''.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Does this mean that I am guilty as well? Am I guilty? What kind 
of trial are we inflicting upon a Bloc member for saying something 
as simple as: ``Dear brothers and sisters who are serving in the 
army, you will be welcome in a sovereign Quebec; we will need our 
own armed forces in Quebec to participate, alongside the Canadian 
Armed Forces, in peacekeeping missions with U.S and European 
forces. We would be together and we would only be too pleased to 
have you serve under the Quebec flag instead of under the 
Canadian flag, since you would no longer be Canadians, but 
full-fledged Quebecers''. Where is the sedition in that? What 
sedition? Never in the 12 years I have been serving in this 
Parliament have I witnessed a case being made against someone 
based solely on assumptions like this; never have I seen people try 
to censure in this way what is said or what political views the 
members of this House may have. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	I am one disappointed onlooker and I would like to tell my hon. 
friends the following. You belong to a great party. I disagree with 
the ideas put forth by the Liberal Party, but the Liberal Party always 
boasted about being the party of major reforms. Just think about the 
reforms in the field of health.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Do not forget the War Measures Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="658"> 658 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> There have been a few disappointments, like 
the War Measures Act, but on the whole, the Liberal Party has 
put forth major reforms. And today, the Liberals would be party 
to instituting this kind of censorship. This goes against their 
traditions. And one of your leaders, the Hon. Lester B. Pearson, 
a human rights advocate, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his 
nobility of soul, his vision and his respect for human rights, must 
be spinning in his grave today. He must not be able to believe that 
his own party could be party to such a motion.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member has used up half the allotted 
time. We will now have a chance to hear what the other hon. 
member has to say.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. He focused quite appropriately on our privileges as 
members of Parliament. I cannot do anything but support him in 
that because his privileges as a member are mine. We all share and 
have a very great interest in those privileges.
<P>
	I want to point out that although the facts of this case have been 
presented to persons and authorities outside this House, it is my 
understanding that a public prosecutor in the province of Quebec 
declined to proceed in relation to these facts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> In Ontario also.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Also in Ontario, as my friend reminds me quite 
appropriately.
<P>
	However, none of us have been made privy to the legal opinions 
on which those decisions were based. It may well be that the major 
reason no one would proceed was precisely because the member 
involved had privileges as a member of Parliament and those 
privileges, which my friend has just made reference to, protect us 
all in our speech and in our activities in this House of Commons.
<P>
	It may be that the committee which will deal with this will rate 
our privileges so high that it will accord to the member enough 
freedom so that he could do again what he did then. That might or 
might not happen. However, I just wanted to concur that the 
privileges, which we all have here and which we all share, are very 
important to us all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River is right about the 
privileges of Parliament. That is precisely what we are about here. 
We can potentially talk about sedition in the armed forces. We are 
not talking about that. We can talk potentially about sedition 
among members of the public. We are not talking about that. We 
are talking about what happens in this Chamber. Is there a 
possibility of sedition in the case in front of us?
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I ask the hon. member: How is the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs going to be able to examine this 
question of privilege and procedure in this Parliament with the 
modified amended motion brought forth by the Liberals? All it 
states is that the matter of the communiqué, released October 1995 
by the hon. member for Charlesbourg, with reference to members 
of the Canadian Armed Forces, be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. Referred for what? 
Let us be precise here. Give the committee a chance to address the 
issue by putting some meat in it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a good question. The hon. member 
opposite will take note that the Speaker has already found that the 
issue, as framed by the hon. member who originally rose, is prima 
facie a matter of privilege and therefore the matter has already been 
framed.
<P>
	Second, the body of debate that accompanies this motion in its 
eventual passage or non-passage as the case may be will be part of 
the record that goes to the committee. There will be no doubt in the 
minds of committee members what the Speaker has ruled, what the 
member originally moved and what members of this House have 
put forward in relation to these facts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are dealing with an important matter and we have 
heard all sorts of things for about an hour. I am a little surprised by 
what we heard. I think we must go back to the definition of 
sedition, because it is what the Reform Party is talking about in its 
motion.
<P>
	As you can see, Reform members have somewhat altered the 
meaning of sedition. We must go back to section 59, which 
provides that ``every one shall be presumed to have a seditious 
intention who teaches or advocates, or publishes or circulates any 
writing that advocates, the use, without the authority of law, of 
force as a means of accomplishing a governmental change within 
Canada''.
<P>
	Well, the communiqué makes no mention of this. It is very clear. 
I thought I would be arguing with Reform members on the basis 
that the communiqué does not refer to this or contravene section 
62, which relates to any member of the military who is guilty of 
disloyalty, insubordination, mutiny or refusal, or section 59, which 
concerns anyone who publishes or circulates any writing that 
advocates the use of force as a means of accomplishing a 
governmental change.
<P>
	I thought our debate would revolve around this and I was 
somewhat surprised at first, because this matter was raised by a 
Montreal lawyer, Mr. Tyler, in the Quebec courts, and in an Ontario 
court, before it was dismissed. One judge even called the 
communiqué a job offer. In  other words, this is as far as he could 
go in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="659"> 659 </A></B>
<P>
ridiculing the claims of this lawyer, a supporter of the partition of 
Quebec, we must remember.
<P>
	The ministers of Defence and of Justice have told us, either in 
the House or in press releases, that they would be consulting their 
legal advisers in order to see whether there are grounds for laying 
charges. According to Diane Francis of the <I>Financial Post</I>, one of 
the Reform's gurus, the legal advisors of both ministers, Defence 
and Justice, have indicated that there was nothing to be done.
<P>
	There was therefore no basis for accusations of sedition. What is 
surprising this afternoon is that there are admissions that there is no 
sedition, but they want another definition of sedition: crimes of 
opinion. The leader of the Reform Party, a person of some 
consequence, is speaking now of crimes of opinion, saying that in 
Canada there could be criminals of opinion. That is new, totally 
new. CSIS may have been investigating the Reform Party, but I 
have a feeling that next year it will be Amnesty International.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It is not very democratic to talk in terms of a crime of opinion. 
This is a new definition of what sedition is. In a way, it does not 
surprise me that a few Reform members would think of leaving that 
party, finding it to be too far to the right and seeing that, thank God, 
the majority of Canadians, no matter whether Quebec remains a 
part of the federation or not, would never follow that party in its 
undemocratic attitudes.
<P>
	What is going a bit far, as was pointed out by the Leader of the 
Opposition, is speaking of sedition and ending up giving out a fax 
number. This is like storming the Bastille. One thing is clear: there 
will surely not be any exercise in camouflaged terrorism led by the 
defence minister to storm the Bloc headquarters. We indicate 
where we stand.
<P>
	It is completely ridiculous to speak of sedition. Mr. Tyler has 
been told so. There have been three previous cases of sedition.
<P>
	The first case, I think, was that of Louis Riel. It goes back a long 
way, and I find it very disturbing that one could refer to Louis Riel, 
because it was recognized later on that it was a mistake. Even 
though this Parliament refused to apologize, some even consider 
him a Father of Confederation. But he had been found guilty, which 
is not the case with the hon. member for Charlesbourg, far from it. 
A few years later, it was realized that Louis Riel was not guilty.
<P>
	The second case is the case of Fred Rose, in 1946. This was when 
the Cold War was at its worst. It may be more accurate to talk of an 
open conflict, since McCarthyism was about to take hold of the 
United States. He was convicted, and there was a certain 
foundation in fact for his conviction. But today, his guilt is being 
questioned.
<P>
	It is very dangerous to exploit the concept of guilt in matters of 
opinion the way the Reform Party is trying to do.
<P>
	I will deal later on with the Liberals or at least with the Liberal 
member who raised that same point. I am not talking about the 
mover of the motion, but about the member who spoke after him. 
The name of his riding escapes me. I am happy to see my colleague 
across the way is relieved.
<P>
	The third case is that of Mr. McGreevy, in the 1880s. That 
member was actually guilty, and he resigned before the committee 
hearings took place. That case and that of the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg have absolutely nothing in common. I repeat, 
absolutely nothing.
<P>
	A Reform member, the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands 
made a statement the day after the press release or a few days later. 
That was the first reaction of the Reform Party to the press release. 
Here is what he said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I do not think this can be considered inciting mutiny. We have 
to accept that in the Canadian forces right now are some people 
who are in favour of separation''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What have we here? A member of the Reform Party who seems 
to understand something about the situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> We do not see that very often.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Some say that we do not see that very often, and I 
tend to agree with them.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yet, he seconded the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> However, I want to talk about our colleagues 
opposite, because they were not of that opinion at the very 
beginning. They raised some issues similar to what the Reform is 
saying today. I would like to remind the House that in the days 
following this press release, in early November, the federal 
Liberals were talking about their plan B, in which they seemed to 
promote the partition of Quebec. They were also questioning the 
percentage needed for a Yes vote to carry and asking to review the 
question the government of Quebec would eventually come up 
with.
<P>
	So, the defence minister said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``I am shocked by the communiqué-''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He may well be shocked, but then he seems to be shocked most 
of the time.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="660"> 660 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-``and I am seeking an opinion on the propriety of this release''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is what he did, but he did not get any answer, as we saw 
later.
<P>
	I refer to the chief government whip, who said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``This is dangerously close to inciting mutiny in the forces''.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	I think the Liberals were the first to raise this issue. They 
contributed, I would say, to the feeling of paranoia created in the 
media in English Canada. A bit like Diane Francis, whom the 
Reform members seem to find inspiring nowadays. However, the 
Reform members woke up and realized the Liberals were about to 
overtake them on the right. When you can pass the Reformers on 
the right, you are way out to the right.
<P>
	Today, the Liberals are proposing an amendment. I think they are 
trying in a roundabout way to do something they do not have the 
fortitude to do outright. One cannot talk about sedition without 
being held up to ridicule, since the legal advisers of certain 
ministers are saying there is no sedition. It is not possible any more 
to say to Quebec-They can say something to Canada and 
something else to Quebec, but there are limits to what can be said 
because the English term ``sedition'' and the French term 
``sédition'' are very close. They should not speak of sedition to 
Quebec, especially since their legal advisers are of a different 
opinion, not to mention that there will soon be by-elections and the 
Leader of the Opposition in Quebec, federalist Daniel Johnson, is 
telling them to go easy and revert from plan B to plan A.
<P>
	Now they know they cannot play that game as they did at the 
very beginning, on November 4, when the Reform Party was still 
asleep.
<P>
	So today they try to withdraw anything that would make the 
member for Charlesbourg look guilty before being judged, but they 
still refer this matter to the Committee on Procedure rather than 
defeating it here and concluding this whole debate in order to go on 
to more pressing matters. They cannot do it because there are, in 
the Liberal caucus, members who are still talking of plan B. 
Besides, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Mr. 
Dion-who can be named, since he is not a member of 
Parliament-always speaks of plan B.
<P>
	The other side backs all the horses. They do in a roundabout 
what they do not dare to do outright. But I notice that there is a 
member who goes a little further by raising an issue of conscience 
when he asks: ``Can the  letterhead of the House be used to promote 
political opinions?''
<P>
	If there are Liberal members who do not use the letterhead of the 
House to promote their political opinions, I think we should 
question the way public funds are used. It is meant to be used that 
way. If they spend the money for other purposes, then it is 
questionable, very questionable.
<P>
	This means that we are still talking about a crime of opinion. 
Some could say: ``Long live Canada and long live the Canadian 
armed forces, and there is the risk that soldiers from Quebec will 
no longer be allowed to serve in the Canadian army if Quebec 
becomes sovereign'', which would be correct. On the other hand, 
we could not say: ``This is what will happen if Quebec becomes a 
sovereign country''. That is a crime of opinion. That is a double 
standard, and it is dangerous, but definitely not for the Bloc 
Quebecois. I must say that we are thick-skinned. We are used to 
fighting in the House, and the fight is not over. Some day, we will 
win. I am telling you that this is much more dangerous for 
democracy in Canada. It is dangerous because this country does not 
deserve to fall under the boot of some dictatorship, because that is 
what this will lead to ultimately. When you start condemning 
people because of what they think, where does that lead you? That 
is where such regimes lead. Everybody knows that.
<P>
	Canada sends military personnel to other countries to make sure 
such regimes disappear from the surface of the earth. I believe 
there is a Criminal Code, a Civil Code. There are the workings of 
the internal economy committee. Some would like to circumvent 
these procedures and start judging people according to what they 
think and not according to the rights which should be the same for 
everybody. If we change our way of doing things, the people do not 
have the same rights anymore. I believe this must have precedence 
over any political allegiance.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to make a few other remarks. In its motion, 
the Reform Party talks about francophones. But I looked at the text, 
and it does not say francophones, it says Quebecers. For us, 
Quebecers are not only francophones. There are anglophones in 
Quebec, aboriginal people, people who come from other countries 
and integrate into Quebec society. They never talked about 
Quebecers.
<P>
	When people make ethnic divisions like you do, we know where 
that leads. Crimes of opinion, ethnic divisions, these are words that 
I have seldom heard in this House. And coming from the Liberals, I 
have to say that it surprises me. I know that, in the past, the 
Liberals have passed good legislation. There were great measures; 
we just have to think of Lester B. Pearson. But there was also the 
War Measures Act. That was a bit less democratic. There is a little 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="661"> 661 </A></B>
<P>
dark side to our red friends,  but it is an exception in the way the 
Liberal Party operates. Plan B is a dangerous departure from 
liberalism in the noble sense of the word.
<P>
	As for the Reformers, it does not surprise me that much since I 
remember a debate we had for two or three hours on the 
reinstatement of corporal punishment for children. I did not think I 
would see that in the 1990s. I know that one Reform member is 
going to Singapore to see if you can get results by flogging children 
or by striking the soles of their feet with a bamboo rod. When a 
member wonders about and puts time, money and research into 
investigating the merits of whacking people on the feet, there is 
definitely something out of whack.
<P>
	There have been some strange things from the beginning, but it 
has still been quite some time, since the Bloc's very first days here, 
since there has been anything like this. Members will recall the 
$500 billion lawsuit when we first arrived. To be precise, some saw 
the Bloc's arrival as the end of Canada's debt. They probably 
thought we had $500 billion. Ignorance is bliss.
<P>
	On a more serious note, I think that what we are talking about 
here is democracy, the right of sovereignists to express themselves, 
just as in Quebec there is a concern about the right of federalists to 
express themselves in the Parliament of Quebec. I suppose we 
would not dare ask them to check the papers they send to their 
voters or their press releases on the pretext that we do not agree 
with their content. This has not been done here either, and I expect 
and hope it will not be done.
<P>
	Most importantly, I hope that the voice of reason will prevail in 
English Canada. I must tell you frankly that I do not count on the 
Reform Party for that. That is definitely out of the question. I 
believe that in the Liberal Party there are people for whom 
democracy must prevail over petty party politics and I hope they 
will put aside plan B and will, at the end of the day, vote against 
this motion. I hope they will dissociate themselves from what could 
pave the way to McCarthyism. You know what that led to in the 
United States.
<P>
	Canada kept away from that. Some were tempted to go that route 
in Canada and Quebec, and this is not a racial issue. We had people 
who thought along those lines. Duplessis was not very far from that 
sort of thinking. But we have progressed. I hope you will not back 
track. I believe it is important. Someone just mentioned the 
amendment, but that amendment will not change anything. It is a 
compromise solution within the Liberal Party.
<P>
	<B>An hon member:</B> It is a mascarade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>In English Canada, they say: ``As you saw, we 
supported the Reform Party on that issue''. In Quebec, they say: 
``As you saw, we stood up to the Reform Party''. This is the way the 
Liberals act. Canadian diversity at its best; oh, sure. We have seen 
this in the past: two languages, two messages.
<P>
	In conclusion, I must tell you that what counts for us is not the 
future of the Bloc but the future of Quebec. What counts for us is 
sovereignty. This is why the Bloc does not have much future in the 
long term. The future of democracy is much more important for us.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	At issue here is whether democracy is going to be questioned for 
political ends when, in political and parliamentary terms, the 
position of official opposition is out of reach, when playing one's 
role in committees is parliamentarily impossible and when winning 
a by-election is politically impossible. Every possible means is 
being used to talk about every speech, except the heart of the 
matter, at the moment.
<P>
	For a party that wanted to discuss public finances-the 
opportunity is there-, for a party that wanted to talk of 
unemployment insurance-although their idea of unemployment 
insurance is worse than the Liberals', believe it or not-not a word 
is heard. This party has the opportunity in the days following the 
budget to debate both it and the throne speech. What does it do? 
The debate is no longer about sedition, as the leader of the Reform 
Party said, but about a crime of opinion. This is what is before us.
<P>
	I hope, less for the Bloc than for Canadian democracy, that the 
entire House, except of course the Reform members, but the other 
parties will give thought to this and rise and vote against it. We will 
continue to debate federalism and sovereignty, but we will comply 
with the standards and remain true to democracy, without hearing 
the sound of boots in the distance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to 
inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time 
of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Lambton-Middlesex, softwood lumber industry.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was loath to 
rise and comment on this matter but a number of things require 
some clarification.
<P>
	As you frequently remind us, Mr. Speaker, this is a Chamber in 
which passionate debate and passionate partisanship exist. I would 
be the last to deny that I relish both passionate debate and 
passionate partisanship. I want to say something that needs to be 
said. Every member of Parliament in the Chamber is here because 
he or she believes very deeply and passionately in the form of 
public service he or she has chosen.
<P>
	There are certain things that perhaps get lost in debates of this 
nature. With regard to what I presume are the intentions of the 
member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, I do not disagree 
with those. I have difficulty, however, with the wording of the 
motion. I agree wholeheartedly with my colleague, the  member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River, and with other members, including 
the chief government whip. The difficulty is while this place is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="662"> 662 </A></B>
<P>
highest court in the land, it is not a court of law in the context of the 
courts in all of our ridings.
<P>
	It would ill behove us as members of Parliament to usurp the 
actions of those courts even as in this particular case prosecutors 
have refused for whatever reasons to make a charge. It would be 
unparliamentary of us to use the words that we on the government 
side feel should be deleted. However, we will let that pass.
<P>
	I do every much want to see the question of privilege go to the 
committee for its proper disposition. With regard to all members of 
Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition who have spoken on this matter, I 
am very proud that these matters can be debated in the Chamber.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Why do you not say something serious?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Perhaps the hon. member would let me finish. This 
is very serious. I have already said that I believe very much in 
partisanship. God knows I can out-heckle him any day of the week 
but that is not the point. The point is, let us get on with this. Let us 
get the motion in its proper framework to the proper committee so 
that it can be disposed of.
<P>
	I would like to finish my comments with respect to Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition by saying that all of us on this side of 
the House are proud that issues such as this one and issues that 
relate to the unity of Canada, the sovereignty of Canada and our 
Constitution are being debated here and in committee under 
democratic rules and procedures, not in the street with bombs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we all agree that this should not be 
settled in the streets with bombs. Everybody agrees. But how can 
one be proud to say that national unity and Canadian sovereignty 
cannot be debated, the two examples the member gave? This is not 
what it is about. What we are talking about is a press release 
providing information.
<P>
	How can one be proud to want to censor a member of 
Parliament, or even to take punitive measures against him? How 
can one be proud of prosecuting someone for his beliefs? This is 
what it is all about.
<P>
	This might sound good in their ridings, but it is not good for 
democracy. This is nothing to be proud about. This kind of action 
brings shame to Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on several occasions the 
hon. member used the phrase ``avoir un avis'', to have an opinion. I 
wonder what sort of silly sophistry this is. Nobody is talking about 
the right or the  ability to have opinions in this House or anywhere 
else. We are talking about actions.
<P>
	If someone writes a letter encouraging members of the Canadian 
Armed Forces to abandon their oath of allegiance, that is not 
having an opinion, that is an action. If someone delivers that letter 
to military bases, that is not having an opinion, that is an action. We 
are talking about deeds in this place, bad deeds.
<P>
	I would like to raise a second point because the hon. member for 
Calgary Northeast is not here and he was slandered by the member. 
He did not make a trip to Singapore specifically and precisely to 
study the question of whipping. And he did not, in the true 
Bloc-Liberal tradition, take a taxpayer paid junket to Singapore. He 
paid his own way. I think the hon. member knows that. I think he 
owes the hon. member for Calgary Northeast an apology.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, ridicule never killed anyone, we all 
know that. We are being told: ``You may have an opinion, but you 
may not express it, you cannot voice it''. This is what the member 
just said. What a beautiful country.
<P>
	It makes for quite a dialogue. It is as if I said: ``I have an opinion. 
What is it? I am not saying''. Then someone else said: ``Can we 
talk?'' Then, I replied: ``Yes, I have ideas, opinions, we can talk''. 
And the other said: ``Oh no, we cannot talk about that''.
<P>
	What an impressive, what a remarkable dialogue. It is all fine 
and well for you to come to Quebec a few days before referendum, 
to jump on junkets trips to Quebec. We know all about junkets. One 
hundred dollars from Vancouver to Montreal, but not work in the 
opposite direction. Tell me about junkets.
<P>
	It is totally ludicrous to have an opinion and not be able to voice 
it. This is what freedom of opinion means, it seems. Without such 
freedom, what kind of country will this be? We have the right to 
have opinions, but not to voice them. Oh, really.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Secondly, concerning the Reform member who made a trip to 
Singapore, I stand by what I said, I will not apologize. He paid his 
own way, no problem. I would point out that, when there is a trip 
for a parliamentary association, some Reformers do go on the trip, 
but not too often, I must admit.
<P>
	Paranoia can exist in politics. Reform members want to have 
very few contacts with their colleagues abroad. This kind of 
isolationism is a integral part of their political doctrine, but not of 
ours. We are not uncomfortable about being members of Canadian 
delegations and sharing Quebec's point of view in a very courteous 
manner with our Liberal friends.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="663"> 663 </A></B>
<P>
	As far as Reformers are concerned, when they have opinions, 
they cannot set them out in their political doctrine, so why would 
they need to meet others? I can understand that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. During his 
presentation the member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie said that the 
member for Calgary Northeast had been to Singapore at the 
taxpayers' expense. He has not even been to Singapore. I would 
like to make that clear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not say that he made the trip at 
taxpayers' expense. One colleague says he did not go, and the other 
tells me he that he did but paid his own way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in this debate with a sense of great concern 
because I feel, as you do, that the issue is very important. Future 
generations will be looking at this debate. I want to take this 
opportunity to put on the record what I think is the very core of the 
debate.
<P>
	The member for Scarborough-Rouge River mentioned that the 
reference to sedition in the original motion may be in error. There 
is another category in <I>Martin's Annual Criminal Code</I> which may 
be appropriate. Mr. Speaker, with your indulgence I would like to 
read that passage in its entirety into the record and when people 
refer to this debate they will see it before them.
<P>
	This is from section 63 of <I>Martin's Annual Criminal Code</I>, 
concerning offences in relation to military forces. Military forces 
refers to the Canadian forces:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Every one who wilfully</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) interferes with, impairs or influences the loyalty or discipline of a member 
of a force,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) publishes, edits, issues, circulates or distributes a writing that advises, 
counsels or urges insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty by a 
member of a force, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) advises, counsels, urges or in any manner causes insubordination, 
disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty by a member of a force,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a period of 
five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am not a lawyer, I admit that. This is the section in <I>Martin's 
Annual Criminal Code</I> that seems to be more relevant than this 
arcane debate we are having about the definition of sedition. It 
would appear to me from the communiqué I read that this section 
of <I>Martin's Annual Criminal Code</I> is the most important portion.
<P>
	The member for Berthier-Montcalm spoke earlier and made 
the observation that there is nothing in the  communiqué that 
should cause us concern or alarm in the context of sedition. Also, I 
should say in passing that there was nothing in the communiqué 
that specified francophones as opposed to anglophones. There was 
a suggestion that the communiqué may have been directed at some 
people because of their French language ability.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	I point out that the <I>Martin's Annual Criminal Code</I> passage I 
cited involves all the Canadian forces; it does not make distinction 
by language. It does not make any distinction in that way at all. If a 
person is in contravention of that passage, it regardless of the 
linguistic origin of the member of the Canadian forces talked 
about.
<P>
	In that context I would like to read into the record a couple of 
passages from the communiqué which my Bloc colleagues seemed 
to have overlooked in the course of the debate. I will read them in 
French. One relevant passage is on the second page of the 
communiqué:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The day after a yes win,'' he says, ``Quebec should immediately create a 
Department of Defence, an embryo of a major state-''</BLOCKQUOTE>
-that ought to read ``of a military staff''-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and offer all Quebecers serving in the Canadian Forces the chance to 
integrate into the Quebec Forces ``while keeping their rank, seniority, pay and 
retirement funds as a means to ensure a better transition-''</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The other relevant passage is at the very end of the communiqué. 
It is a quote from the hon. member for Charlesbourg:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``All this expertise will not disappear with Quebec's accession to sovereignty 
and personally, I think that soldiers of Quebec will respect the people's decision 
and will transfer their loyalty to the new country whose security they will 
ensure'', Mr. Jacob concluded.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We must take note of the last words:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-whose security they will ensure-</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have to go to the beginning of the paragraph:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The day after a yes win-</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am not a lawyer, I am just an ordinary Canadian and an 
ordinary MP. It is not my position and not my responsibility to 
interpret the law. I can say however that as an ordinary person I did 
find the words in that press release, which I read for the first time 
today, very troubling in the context of the passage I quoted from 
<I>Martin's Annual Criminal Code</I>. Very troubling indeed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="664"> 664 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not prepared to support the Reform Party motion as 
presented because that motion has two flaws. It has the flaw the 
hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River mentioned that it 
stresses sedition. We have reason to believe that it might not be 
sedition.
<P>
	On the other hand it also prejudges the situation with the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg. As a member of Parliament and an 
ordinary Canadian I am not willing to prejudge anyone and I do not 
think it is proper to do that. I support the amendment which would 
send the motion to a committee of the House for a deliberation on 
the issue, whether something was done improperly here or not.
<P>
	I was very disturbed that the Leader of the Official Opposition 
disagreed with the motion on the grounds that there would be some 
danger the committee would not judge the situation in the motion 
that would come to it without any kind of prejudice or prior 
conclusion. He seemed to think that members of Parliament would 
not be able to judge and analyse a situation dispassionately in the 
very sense of justice and fair play that we in this Parliament should 
all believe in.
<P>
	That is one of the things that disturbed me because the Bloc 
Quebecois, with the greatest respect, have always argued 
absolutely that the debate with respect to sovereignty or separatism 
or call it what you will has to be conducted in a democratic fashion. 
It has to respect all levels of our parliamentary institutions.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	I have been disturbed to hear several members suggest that by 
referring this issue to a parliamentary committee, having changed 
the original motion so that there is no prejudice in it-we just want 
to examine the issue-that the Bloc Quebecois finds that this is not 
something it can support. Having heard its members so many times 
say that we should conduct ourselves in a parliamentary fashion 
and that this is a democracy, this is something that they should get 
behind in every way.
<P>
	I support the motion. It does a great service it has for you, my 
fellow colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is permitted to face the 
members, but he can at least address his remarks as if he were 
speaking to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not like to say I am on the wrong 
side of the House but it is very difficult to speak to hon. members 
while they are behind me. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
remark.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois misses a wonderful opportunity here 
because if the words used by the member of Charlesbourg which 
caused me so much concern and caused Canadians concern were 
debated by the committee, we are not looking to attribute blame or 
to assign une mauvaise entente. We are looking to define  the 
parameters of our debates in and outside this House on the question 
of sovereignty.
<P>
	I believe that in all probability the member for Charlesbourg 
acted foolishly, acted impetuously but did not act wilfully. 
However he has acted in a way that we should all be concerned 
about. It is a way that some may consider dangerous, a way that 
some may consider inciting high emotions and certainly in a way 
which when we compare the <I>Martin's Criminal Code</I> passage I 
cited and the actual words from the communiqué we have every 
reason to be concerned.
<P>
	I urge the Bloc Quebecois to support the motion to send this to 
committee so that we can all get an impartial assessment of 
whether or not the member for Charlesbourg went too far. It does 
not matter whether or not there is criminality. I am sure that no 
member of any committee would ever suggest such a thing. It 
would define the debate. It is in the interest of democracy, the very 
democracy that the members of the Bloc Quebecois are so fond of 
citing and indicating that they have great respect for.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think it very much is a matter of the current 
situation with sovereignty and a question of democracy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
something profoundly unhealthy in today's exercise.
<P>
	As I listen to government members, I realize that they have all 
made up their mind. The member who just spoke has already made 
up his mind. This is unhealthy. Maybe the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg should not have done that; personally, I would not 
have done it. An hon. member said earlier that this is not a real 
court. However, the consequences are worse than in the case of a 
real court, since a legitimately elected member of this House may 
be prevented from sitting in this place.
<P>
	After listening to all those who spoke here on behalf of the 
government and the Reform Party-and I have no doubt that they 
are unanimous in this case-how can you expect the committee to 
disregard their comments and make an enlightened, impartial, fair 
and honest decision? This is hogwash.
<P>
	I have a question for the member who just spoke. Last week, in 
the riding next to mine, in Saint-Hyacinthe, about 100 people held 
a protest against the UI reform. My friend and colleague, the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, and myself, went to that 
demonstration.
<P>
	Do the Liberal Party and the hon. member who just spoke view 
our action as seditious, since we told these people to not get taken 
in, to assert themselves, that they had a right to protest and not be 
pleased with that reform? This is seditious stuff.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Are we also going to accuse the 30 or so policemen who were 
there of complicity, since they did not step in and beat the heck out 
of us? They, too, are guilty of something. I would appreciate an 
answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member's question is not at all 
relevant. We are talking about members of the Canadian forces 
who took an loyalty oath to the crown. We are not talking about a 
labour situation. I am very disappointed with the member.
<P>
	I suspect no member in the Bloc Quebecois can answer my 
question about democracy. Why do they not want this to go to a 
committee of their fellow MPs who would simply assess whether 
or not the member for Charlesbourg went a little too far? That is all 
we are looking for.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
would like to correct to record. All communiqués released by the 
Office of the Leader of the Opposition for the records are always in 
both official languages. So this communiqué was written in both 
French and English. That is my first comment.
<P>
	Second, I wish to set the record straight before putting a question 
to the hon. member. The communiqué in question was released on 
October 26, a few days before the referendum. The polls were then 
saying that the yes side would win, which aroused some fears in 
certain sectors, including perhaps people working for the Canadian 
Forces. There were some fears.
<P>
	As you can imagine, one hears all sorts of things on military 
bases. ``If you vote yes, you will lose your job'' may have been said 
here and there on some military bases. The defence critic, the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg, therefore released a communiqué 
designed to reassure people. Does the hon. member believe that, in 
the event of a yes vote in the referendum, Canada would have been 
able to afford to keep all those soldiers? That is my question to him.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will go back to the communiqué, but 
I will make a little abridgement to it. The relevant passage that we 
are talking about and which is at the centre of the problem is:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The day after a yes vote-I think that members of the military from Quebec 
will respect the people's decision and shift their loyalty to the new country for 
whose security they will be responsible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It states that the day after the yes vote, members of the military 
forces, regardless of whether they speak English  or French, which 
is the racist comment raised by the Bloc Quebecois members, are 
being asked to take action to separate their loyalty to Canada. That 
is a bad thing to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would have a question for my hon. colleague, who is 
no doubt a democrat. I know him personally. I would like to react to 
a statement made by the hon. member just a moment ago, and by 
the Speaker before him, to the effect that this House is living 
through its most important moments.
<P>
	There is a fundamental reason for the Speaker to tell us that; it is 
because we are dealing with the very foundation of democracy 
here. We are, of course, elected members of this House, and the 
only thing that legitimizes our discussing this matter here today is 
the fact that we were elected.
<P>
	We are elected members, and the majority of us were elected on 
a very clear platform of jobs, jobs, jobs, elimination of the GST, 
renewal of federalism or of the system under which we live, while 
our platform, a remarkably clear platform, was to look after the 
interests of Quebec and promote the sovereignty of Quebec.
<P>
	You will recall that we were elected in an election in which Bloc 
candidates ran against Liberal and Conservative candidates. The 
people of Quebec voted to send 54 members to Ottawa to promote 
this option. I am a 100 per cent behind my hon. colleague for 
Richelieu, who described events that took place in his riding as 
well.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask a question to the hon. member who spoke 
before me. He claimed to understand what is going on here, and he 
is still willing to refer the issue to a committee and have my 
colleague from Charlesbourg be judged by that committee.
<P>
	Does the hon. member understand what that means? Does he 
understand that a committee will pass judgement on an elected 
member because he stood for what he was elected on? By doing 
that, Quebec as a whole would be sent to be judged by a committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, the committee is not going to make a 
decision with respect to this, it is going to assess the words. It is not 
a member who is being sent to committee, it is the words that are 
going to be evaluated.
<P>
	I would ask Bloc Quebecois members if they believe in the 
parliamentary system. If they believe in democracy then they 
should support this motion so we can get it into committee and 
evaluate the situation without prejudice and in the manner that is 
appropriate for MPs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member why his government  has not dealt with 
this issue in over four months. Canadians have been asking for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="666"> 666 </A></B>
<P>
some action to be taken against the member for Charlesbourg for 
four months. Reform has been pushing for action for four months. 
Why has his government refused to deal with this issue until now, 
when the Reform Party has forced the issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the crux of the problem. We are 
not seeking action against any particular member of Parliament. 
We are seeking clarification of words that were said that caused 
great concern both in the nation and within Parliament. It is the 
words we have to examine. This is not a kangaroo court, this is 
Parliament that is operating here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
been reminded that this is a place of passionate debate and 
partisanship. My comments today are going to be very partisan. I 
wish to make it very clear for the readers of Hansard that I am 
going to attempt to do this in a totally dispassionate way. I think it 
is important that I do it in a dispassionate way because this is a very 
passionate issue.
<P>
	I would like to refocus this debate in the direction that my 
colleague from Vegreville was just pointing. We are presently 
debating the Liberal amendment to the Reform motion. The 
Liberal's first excuse for gutting our motion is that voting for the 
motion decides before examination that the member is guilty.
<P>
	These are the facts. Voting for the motion means what the motion 
says, that the House view the action as seditious and a contempt, 
and it should be examined by a committee. Just like any other court 
you are charged before the trial. Without that charge we would not 
be debating the motion. It would not have been given privilege.
<P>
	The Speaker said ``the House today is being faced with one of 
the more serious matters we have been faced with in this 35th 
Parliament. I believe that the charges are so grave against one of 
our own members that the House should deal with this accusation 
forthwith''.
<P>
	I also quote Beauchesne's citation 50 which says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In any case where the propriety of a Member's actions is brought into 
question, a specific charge must be made.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is very clear. The wording we have in the initial motion is 
the correct wording. It was thought out wording. It was wording 
that as put forward by the leader of the Reform Party in a very clear 
call to action by this House of Commons. I charge that the Liberals 
are attempting to gut our motion.
<P>
	They have an old excuse. The old excuse for inaction is that 
sedition is something for the courts to decide. That was the very 
weak-kneed answer to my colleague from Vegreville. They say let 
somebody else do it, they do not want to rock the boat. Here are the 
facts. If the courts want to deal with a charge, they do what courts 
do. Parliament does whatever it wants in the context of a  contempt 
of Parliament. Citation 28 of Beauchesne's sixth edition states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliament is a court with respect to its own privileges and dignity and the 
privileges of its Members.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Citation 49:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is not necessary for the courts to come to a decision before the House acts. 
In 1891 charges were laid in the House against Thomas McGreevy relating to 
scandals in the Public Works Department. The Committee on Privileges and 
Elections examined the evidence and concluded that the charges were amply 
proven.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I parenthesize and point out that the House judged Mr. 
McGreevy to be guilty of a contempt of the House as well as 
certain of the charges and ordered his expulsion.
<P>

member with whatever it wants to charge a member with are in

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbot:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely outrageous. I said at 
the start of my discussion that I was-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you explain to the House 
what the minister has moved? We did not hear him.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, the minister just gave 
notice that he will move closure under Standing Order 57. Such a 
motion is in order and it is in proper form.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I say with the greatest sorrow that 
when I came to the House of Commons I really thought I was 
coming to a House of democracy. I did not think I was coming to a 
House in which the Liberals, absolutely sick with power, would 
bring closure on a motion like this. They are absolutely disgraceful; 
totally disgraceful.
<P>
	It does not come as any surprise to me that when the Reform 
Party wanted to sing the Canadian anthem in the House of 
Commons these people, these Liberals, these  individuals, chose to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="667"> 667 </A></B>
<P>
block the ability of even being able to sing the Canadian national 
anthem in the House of Commons.
<P>
	It therefore comes as absolutely no surprise that they would 
bring closure to this debate. I find it absolutely disgusting and 
appalling.
<P>
	We have been through the process of an election and many 
people after that election said: ``It does not make any sense that we 
have a debate in which we have five leaders sitting in front of the 
television cameras debating and one leader is out to take Quebec 
out of Canada''. They told me: ``That does not make any sense, but 
I suppose that is the Canadian way''.
<P>
	We went through the whole process and when we got to the 
House of commons, notwithstanding that we are a national party 
with members of Parliament in five provinces, those people on that 
side of the House sided with the Bloc Quebecois and said it would 
be Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. What a joke. It is a joke.
<P>
	I find it absolutely unspeakably stupid that the Liberals would 
invoke closure on this motion.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	I suggest there is a reason. They knew that when the next Reform 
speaker got up, namely me, I would end up pointing the finger at 
the people who are responsible for not setting the Canadian agenda. 
They do not have any idea of how to put together Canadian unity. 
They think that by giving an ``800-call-for-flags'' telephone 
number people will wave flags and we will have Canadian unity.
<P>
	It is unimaginable when we have gone through a situation in 
which the people of Canada have bent over backwards to the point 
at which they have asked who will draw a line in the sand.
<P>
	If the Liberals will not do it, Reformers will. We are drawing a 
line in the sand right now. This seditious activity of the member of 
the Bloc Quebecois cannot stand. This is the line in the sand. We go 
no further.
<P>
	The people of Canada deserve leadership. What are they getting? 
They are getting waffling. What about the members on the other 
side?
<P>
	The people of Canada need to know that every time there is an 
election in committee these members are lined up and follow along 
like good little ducks behind the party whip and vote in favour of 
the Bloc Quebecois for the vice-chair position.
<P>
	Canadians need to know, notwithstanding the motion by my 
colleague from Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, that the 
members of the Liberal Party voted in favour of a Bloc Quebecois 
vice-chair for the defence committee. It is absolutely shameful and 
disgusting. I cannot believe that a so-called national party would be 
in bed with these people who are out to destroy our country.
<P>
	I spoke to the Minister of National Defence. I asked him what he 
will do about this issue. The minister said: ``There is no problem. 
We will refer it to the judge advocate general''. What happened? 
Nothing. No activity. Nothing was done by the Liberals. It was 
taken to court. I am told that under the definitions of the court, 
although we do not have the official rulings yet, it is not applicable.
<P>
	Who will draw a line in the sand? The Reform Party will draw a 
line in the sand against the people who want to break up Canada, 
even if the Liberal government will not do it.
<P>
	It has been suggested by the Bloc, and surely it must be a joke, 
that this is a simple matter of talking about employment; in other 
words, the people in the armed forces are in it for the money. The 
people in the armed forces are wonderful, dedicated, loyal 
Canadians who are prepared to put their lives on the line for their 
country.
<P>
	How serious can Bloc members be when they suggest people in 
the armed forces are concerned only about their employment and 
their next paycheque? I can think of a lot of ways which are easier 
to make money than putting my head above a turret and getting it 
shot off. It is absolutely crazy.
<P>
	The official opposition defence critic who, along with the then 
leader of the opposition, Bouchard, came into the Chamber went 
into the Speaker's chamber and pledged an oath of allegiance to the 
Queen. Those two people, with the collusion of the members of the 
Bloc caucus, said: ``Why do we not suggest that people give up on 
the Canadian army and come over to the Quebec army?''
<P>
	People in the army are not civil servants in the sense of a civil 
servant. People in the army are the people who protect us in 
Canada. They are the ultimate end. They are the ultimate line. They 
are the ultimate protection for what we call civilization in Canada. 
We cannot toy with the army. That is exactly what Bloc members 
are doing.
<P>
	The people of Canada want to know there is someone, some 
party, some power somewhere prepared to draw a line in the sand. 
The Reform Party will do it in the absence of leadership from the 
Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	With that in mind, notwithstanding the efforts of these people 
who are duplicitous in their joining of forces with the Bloc 
Quebecois by trying to gut our bill, by bringing in closure so their 
deeds will not be seen, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding before the word ``communiqué'' 
and after the word ``the'' the words ``seditious nature of the''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment is acceptable in terms of

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the cat is 
finally out of the bag. The real problem is that we are sovereignists. 
That is the problem. Since we are sovereignists, the Reform 
members see us as enemies. That is the real problem. The worst is 
that we are democratic sovereignists, and this is very serious.
<P>
	It is serious, because it leads them to very inconsistent 
arguments they should be ashamed of. They keep saying that the 
situation is terrible, seditious, and that no punishment would be too 
harsh for the hon. member for Charlesbourg in view of what he did. 
If our colleague had sent a press release asking Quebec soldiers 
everywhere in Canada to remain with the Canadian Armed Forces 
in the event of a Yes vote, what would they have said?
<P>
	This is inconsistent. Are you aware that a lot of Quebec soldiers 
are sovereignists? One member of the Reform Party acknowledged 
it in a press release. Quebec soldiers are first class citizens. 
Pursuant to the partnership agreement we would sign with 
Canadian citizens who will choose to be reasonable, Quebec 
soldiers would have the right, in the event of a Yes vote, to transfer 
their loyalty. The hon. member is not here anymore, but the press 
release did not say that Quebec soldiers have to transfer their 
loyalty right now. It did specify that, in the event the Yes wins in a 
democratic process, these soldiers will be asked to join a Quebec 
army to defend together a partnership, as we put it, and to take part 
in operations pursuant to the agreements dealing with NATO, 
NORAD, etc.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	So, I want to ask my colleague if he thinks it is worth making 
such a fuss over a quite normal and democratic position. I also want 
to know if he thinks Canadians will put their trust in such 
incoherent and unreasonable people, in people who complain 
because we asked soldiers from the province of Quebec to join a 
Quebec army in the event the Yes wins. I have nothing more to add, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are people in Canada who see 
those who would take Quebec out of Canada as being the enemies 
of Canada. Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that I am one of them and I 
am speaking for those people.
<P>
	It is incoherent in my judgment to speak of Quebec soldiers 
when in fact we only have Canadian soldiers who have pledged 
allegiance to Canada.
<P>
	The point of my speech was not directed at these people because 
the separatists are clearly defined. They are proud to be separatists. 
They are proud to be attempting to break up Canada. They are 
proud to be trying to take Quebec out of Canada.
<P>
	I was looking at the Liberal members, who with their duplicity 
have entered into a pact with the devil. They have turned around 
and not taken any action to do anything about this. They have never 
drawn any lines in the sand. They have completely mangled and 
mismanaged the referendum and then have turned around and 
blamed everybody from the CBC down through all other areas.
<P>
	I suggest, although not by intent, I do not question the loyalty of 
one single solitary member of the Liberal Party, but by their 
actions, they are in bed with the separatists.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will return to the official opposition, but 
first the hon. member for Mississauga South has the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to ask for the member's comment on something that was said by 
the prior speaker about the issue of timing.
<P>
	The letter regarding the day after was issued just prior to the 
referendum. Yet the question in the referendum referred to an offer 
to be made to the federal government if there was a vote. This 
means that the timing to negotiate and consider an offer clearly 
allowed more than enough time to consider the necessity to discuss 
matters with the military.
<P>
	This is a total contradiction in terms of the time line. It is why 
this matter should be discussed in committee, so that the details 
and the facts can get out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is good. I found a Liberal member 
I can agree with. He is absolutely right.
<P>
	The timing of this and the duplicity of the separatists during the 
referendum was absolutely monumental. On one side of the coin, 
we had a letter going out to the Canadian Armed Forces. On the 
other side of the coin, we had the deputy premier of Quebec 
sending out letters to the embassies around Ottawa. On the third 
side of the coin, if there is such a thing, we now have the text of a 
speech given by the former premier of Quebec which clearly states: 
``Today you have made a decision. We are out of here. We are gone. 
We are toast. We are history''. The duplicity was absolutely 
profound.
<P>
	With the greatest respect, in spite of the fact that I do agree with 
the point made by the Liberal member, I also point out that if the 
Liberals had handled this thing correctly and had put proper rules 
in place before ever going into this referendum, we would not have 
ended up with the very, very tight vote we had in the first place. 
More people in Quebec would have understood the real issue. 
There would have been a greater opportunity of exposing the 
duplicity that was happening behind the scenes.

	Again, I say with sadness to my friend on the Liberal side, I am 
sorry it is his party that is the Government of Canada, it is his party 
that is in charge of this issue and it is his party that is blowing the 
drill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before making my comment, I would like to bring to the 
attention of the Chair that what the Liberals have just done to gag 
us, is intolerable, considering that the Speaker told us right at the 
beginning of the debate to be quiet, to listen calmly, that everyone 
would have the right to speak, that everyone could speak on the 
matter. Today, what does the government do? On the same day, it 
wants to gag us on a most vital matter. If it is that important, it must 
be discussed.
<P>
	Second, in response to the last speaker, who says there is at least 
one Liberal he agrees with. So far, dialogue has meant, for the 
Liberals as well as for the Reformers, a sort of Siamese twin 
dialogue between two bodies that share one head. They agree on 
everything, and do you know why, because they are making 
political capital at the expense of Quebecers, one member in 
particular; they are judging the entire sovereignist movement. They 
have never been able to stand the fact that we have been here since 
October defending the interests of Quebecers. They have never 
been able to stand our coming here to defend the sovereignist 
movement, to defend what we Quebecers have wanted for a long 
time. That is where the problem lies.
<P>
	Now, to get to my question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague: </B>The question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>Hold on, I am getting to it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague: </B>What is the question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>I must say what I have to say, despite your 
gag. Gagging us is what you are doing with your motions.
<P>
	Now, getting to my question. I invite the hon. member to quote 
one place in hon. member for Charlesbourg's communiqué where 
there is a call for violence, for public disorder, where there is any 
encouragement, recommendation, advising of members of the 
Armed Forces to carry out any prohibited activity. Let him respond 
to this question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is really a kind of star spangled 
night. Not only can I agree with the Liberal member, I can agree 
with the member from the Bloc, if in fact he is correct which my 
colleagues tell me he is, that the Speaker has said that we were 
going to have the opportunity to have freedom of speech in this 
House of Commons for a change, unlike what the Liberals usually  
do to us and have actually gone back on their word. So it is really 
no surprise to be able to have that agreement.
<P>
	I will quote from the communiqué. The Quebec military will 
``respect the people's decision and will transfer their loyalty to the 
new country whose security they will ensure''. I repeat, transfer 
their loyalty. Those are the words from the communiqué. Loyalty is 
defined as allegiance, faithfulness, devotion, fidelity, attachment 
and patriotism. On the other hand, sedition is defined as revolt, 
rebellion, revolution, insurrection, mutiny, unrest, riot, uprising, 
defiance and disobedience. I suggest that on the words of defiance 
and disobedience we have a case made for mutiny and sedition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as important as this 
debate is, I find it deteriorating to some extent. We are deviating 
totally from the motion. We in this House seem to be already 
prejudging an act that one of our colleagues made.
<P>
	The member for Kootenay East has asked several times why this 
government has not acted before. As I only have a few seconds, I 
would like to ask the member for Kootenay East a question his 
colleague from Vegreville tried asking. I refer to page 29, citation 
115 of Beauchesne. Since this question and debate has emanated 
from a question of privilege, citation 115 clearly states: ``A 
question of privilege must be brought to the attention of the House 
at the first possible opportunity. Even a gap of a few days may 
invalidate the claim for precedence in the House''.
<P>
	As much respect as I have for the Chair for having ruled on that, 
why is-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member for Kootenay 
East.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer lies in the hon. member's 
question. The Speaker of the House said that this is such a serious 
issue that the delay is a moot point. That is a ruling of the Speaker 
and as such it becomes a precedent in this House. I suggest the 
member be careful that he not question the rulings of the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in intervening in this 
debate I must record that I at times felt I was attending one of 
Verdi's latter day operas, high opera. Marked sometimes with 
opera bouffe I find to some extent the levity that was introduced in 
the matter concerning the potential loss of privileges of a member 
of Parliament rather disquieting. I take it that it relates to the 
intensity and the passion of the debate.
<P>
	I will focus on the roles and missions of Parliament today, which 
I believe is the issue we should be debating. This includes what the 
House is competent to do and what it is not competent to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="670"> 670 </A></B>
<P>
	The alleged remarks of the hon. member were not made in 
Parliament, nor were they made by legal definition within the 
rayon of Parliament which by extension has been known to include 
government departments and the like. They would probably not 
be covered by an argument of parliamentary privilege. To express 
my own opinion, they would not be covered by parliamentary 
privilege if the member was prosecuted in the ordinary courts.
<P>
	One of the issues here concerns whether this is a matter for the 
ordinary courts. In the case of a member of Parliament it would be 
the civil courts. In the case of members of the armed forces, with 
whom it is alleged there was some species of collusion, it would be 
the military courts. I will return to that in a moment.
<P>
	There has been a great deal of misunderstanding based perhaps 
on a too rigid and unimaginative reading of old precedents 
concerning the role of Parliament today. The phrase high court of 
Parliament has been used but without an understanding of its 
historical origins or the need to interpret it in the light of 
contemporary developments in Parliament and in other institutions 
that borrowed from the same British parliamentary model we 
borrowed from.
<P>
	There was an extensive review of Parliament's criminal powers 
at the time of the impeachment issue in the United States, the 
so-called Watergate scandal. I was consulted in a pre-parliamentary 
capacity by the Senate Committee on Campaign Activities, the 
Watergate committee. I gave opinions which were published at the 
time. The great advantage of the Watergate scandal for our 
purposes is the opportunity for discussion of the inherited criminal 
powers of Parliament which the United States received as part of its 
general reception of British law.
<P>
	The basic point revolves around this issue of the impeachment 
power which was written into the United States' constitution. There 
is no doubt that in medieval times these were opportunities for 
political fishing expeditions. There was no real pretence of a 
criminal offence or anything else involved. It was a judgment 
exercised by Parliament on the king's ministers in which the 
subjective evaluation of their motives in exercising their powers 
was at the core of the decision.
<P>
	I mention this simply to say that the vestigial powers of 
Parliament as the high court of Parliament are essentially limited 
today by the evolution of the precedents and also by Parliament's 
own deliberate legislative act of passing legislation it is limited to 
the cluster of offences grouped around impeachment. There is a 
reason for this. It is the tyranny of the majority that caused 
successive Parliaments deliberately to limit by law the power to 
expel members of Parliament.
<P>
	There is legislation. It sets it out. It sets out the necessity for 
convictions before the ordinary civil courts for specified offences,
<P>
but limited offences, what in  contemporary terms we could still 
call the felonies as they were understood under the common law.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	The correct procedure for a legislative body today would see the 
power of expulsion being limited to acting on a conviction made by 
the regular civil courts for a specified offence meeting the test of a 
felony as it existed under the old common law. This has been done 
simply to discipline the otherwise unregulated use of a majority's 
power to expel people it did not like. We saw examples of this in 
continental Europe between the two wars in the last days of the 
Weimar Republic when it was used disgracefully.
<P>
	Impeachment as such is not available in the case of a member 
not being a government minister. Even if we go back to that, it is 
limited to officers of the crown. I was asked by a senator the other 
day, I presume not frivolously, whether it still availed. The answer 
is yes but it is limited to government ministers. In the British 
Parliament it has not been used since 1840 but is still there.
<P>
	As to other matters, they are matters for the ordinary courts, but 
Parliament can act and properly will act if so inclined on the 
decisions of the civil courts. If a verdict of guilty were to be 
returned in such a process, Parliament could be seized and exercise 
its powers, including the powers to expel.
<P>
	The problem that one sees in the present case is simply that one 
understands the matters were taken up with crown counsel. It 
would surprise me if they have not been because I received letters 
from constituents asking me if there was a prima facie case. I 
simply said consult or refer to crown counsel. They were referred 
to crown counsel and apparently crown counsel have decided not to 
pursue the matter.
<P>
	If that is so, and it is beyond correction by senior crown counsel, 
then it seems to me Parliament cannot retry the matter. It is not 
simply a matter of the limits of competence of members of 
Parliament to decide difficult issues of the law of evidence and the 
like. It is a matter that the executive power has been used and 
exercised to the full, and that is the end of the matter.
<P>
	I support the reference of this issue to the committee on 
procedure and House affairs mainly because I believe it will avoid 
further debates of this sort, which sometimes seem to be without 
any clear direction. A restatement by the committee of 
Parliament's power to discipline its own members stated clearly 
and concisely would be a help to this House.
<P>
	I hope the committee will not assume it is its function to act as a 
court of law. I do not think it would do the job very effectively. If 
there are still remedies before the civil courts then it would be 
possible for opposition members to utilize those remedies and take 
the steps themselves. As far as Parliament is concerned, it is my  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="671"> 671 </A></B>
<P>
own opinion that we should obtain legal opinion at defining the 
constitutional role of Parliament today.
<P>
	My personal opinion, as expressed in the past, is that 
Parliament's criminal law powers are limited to impeachment, 
narrowly construed. In the case of the attempted Nixon 
impeachment I came to the conclusion that judgment on political 
acts was no longer part of the impeachment power. These things 
became moot with the decision of the president to resign and the 
matter never proceeded.
<P>
	There are advantages in going to the committee on procedure 
and House affairs. It may be that the committee, in spite of the 
opinions I have expressed, will decide that Parliament should 
resume criminal law powers, in effect control of members that have 
lapsed effectively with the transfer of erstwhile powers of 
Parliament to the ordinary courts.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	In that case, I would be prepared to read the report and discuss it 
on its merits. But under the present circumstances I think it has 
been beyond Parliament's competence to discuss the merits of the 
alleged act. I think it is not a proper use of our functions. I therefore 
would welcome constitutional advice, a ruling from the committee 
on procedure and House affairs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to our honourable colleague, who gave us an 
interesting and very different viewpoint. I think, in the present 
matter, we have to ask ourselves what rights members have. A 
member should be entitled to speak and to act. Time is also a 
consideration.
<P>
	I think what is happening is that the rest of Canada did not 
understand what was going on in Quebec at the time: the members 
of the Bloc Quebecois elected to this House are getting ready for 
the big day. The big day is the day Quebec becomes sovereign, 
fully sovereign. We are getting ready. We are involved in 
committees of the House of Commons of Canada. We are learning 
about defence, a federal jurisdiction at the moment. We are 
learning.
<P>
	I remember, when I was on the joint committee on national 
defence, going to Edmonton when we were touring Canada to hear 
witnesses. I asked three eminent professors, experts in the field of 
defence, Canadian anglophones: ``Do you think a sovereign 
Quebec should have its own army?'' Two of the three agreed that 
Quebec should have its own army. The other said it depended. 
According to him, there could be agreements between Canada and 
Quebec and perhaps there could be a shared army.
<P>
	I would like to ask my eminent colleague whether he thought 
that the member for Charlesbourg said things in his communiqué 
that were contrary to what one ought to expect?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will limit my answer to 
Parliament's jurisdiction. I said that the statements made in the 
member's communiqué had been made outside of the House, and 
therefore were not covered by parliamentary privilege. He can be 
prosecuted in civil court.
<P>
	I only said that it had nothing to do with Parliament. In other 
words, we are limited to the old impeachment process, which is 
interpreted in a very restrictive manner nowadays.
<P>
	The merits of his conversation, of his discourse, have nothing to 
do with this House today. He is subject to civil court. It is up to him 
to invoke his parliamentary privilege. I for one believe that his 
parliamentary privilege does not apply when he is outside of the 
House or of the parliamentary precinct. This is why I said that this 
debate, by emphasizing what he said, is going beyond the mandate 
and powers of Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am listening very carefully to the debate and I 
appreciate very much the hon. member's intervention this 
afternoon.
<P>
	On the question of whether or not it is in the purview of 
Parliament to deal with this, I would point out that the communiqué 
was written on the letterhead of the official opposition. That makes 
it very much an issue that this Parliament should deal with.
<P>
	The Speaker of the House ruled yesterday that it, in fact, does. I 
would like to point out a couple of citations that may help the 
member. I would like to say first that Parliament does whatever it 
wants in the context of contempt of Parliament.

	This House ordered his expulsion.
<P>
	There are other references to support the right of Parliament to 
charge a member with whatever it wants. I  would refer the House 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="672"> 672 </A></B>
<P>
to Joseph Maingot's ``Parliamentary Privilege in Canada'' at page 
192, which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While privilege may be codified, contempt may not-there is no closed list of 
classes of offences punishable as a contempt of Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would refer the House to the Speaker's ruling of October 29, 
1980, which stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The dimensions of contempt of Parliament is such that the House will not be 
constrained in finding a breach of privilege of its Members or of the House. This 
is precisely the reason that, while our privileges are defined, contempt of the 
House has no limits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I hope that helps the hon. member in his deliberations this 
afternoon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question and also for the dispassionate way in which he presented it 
in a debate which has become too heated on all sides of the House. I 
will try to respond in the same spirit.
<P>
	I agree, if the facts which the hon. member cites are correct, that 
if letterhead was used for a non-parliamentary purpose, that there is 
a breach of the privileges of the House. However, it probably would 
come within the nature of trivial abuse; no more serious than 
perhaps the way in which many members misuse parliamentary 
letterhead. It would not bring in the gravamen of the offence being 
alleged against the hon. member.
<P>
	I have noted the precedent of 1891. I would tell the House that it 
would meet the classic test of something committed within the 
rayon of Parliament in the capacity of the minister in the public 
works department. It simply brings back the issue that in dealing 
with old precedents they have to be re-interpreted creatively in the 
light of changed circumstances and the evolution of the concepts of 
what Parliament can and should do to its members, including 
opposition members. The precedents have to be interpreted in the 
light of their creative growth. The trend is clearly to restrict 
parliamentary powers, not to extend them.
<P>
	The hon. member said, and I hope he will not mind my 
correcting him, that Parliament can do whatever it wants. I think 
the best answer to that is the answer which Chief Justice Coke gave 
to King James I, that one is under God and the law. One is bound by 
the constitutional law of Parliament. That is what we are trying to 
decide today. That is what this debate is all about.
<P>
	Frankly, the committee on procedure and House affairs would do 
us a service if it set out coolly, clearly and without passion the 
limits of parliamentary power today. If it thinks those powers 
should be restated, let it indicate, on the basis of expert opinion, 
how it thinks that should be done. However, it would commit a 
grave error  if it attempted to set itself up as a court of law hearing 
the substance of the alleged offence. That would be beyond the 
precedents as they now exist, properly interpreted.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like my hon. colleague across the way to comment on what I am 
going to say. I think that the problem we are facing because of the 
third party has to do with our freedom of speech.
<P>
	I will come right out and tell you that what my colleague from 
Charlesbourg did in writing, many of us in the Bloc Quebecois 
have done verbally. Some of those soldiers questioned me on the 
draft bill introduced by Mr. Parizeau's government and I told them 
something similar to what the hon. member for Charlesbourg wrote 
in his communiqué.
<P>
	Preventing me from doing that would amount to depriving me of 
my freedom of speech. Can this freedom of speech be tested before 
a committee of the House or does it go beyond the powers of this 
House right up to the constitutional level? I would like to hear what 
our hon. colleague has to say about this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that focusing on freedom 
of speech is leading the debate away from the issue of Parliament's 
constitutional law. For example, I have very often said things that 
my audience was not too pleased to hear, but I understand that I 
must comply with civil law when I make remarks or comments.
<P>
	Outside this House, members become subject to civil law and 
they become accountable. Up until now, no attempt had been made 
to sue this member for what he said outside the House. That is what 
we are dealing with here. As far as Parliament is concerned, except 
in circumstances which are so rare now, given how the 
constitutional law of Parliament has evolved, there is no substantial 
issue for Parliament to decide. In my opinion, we are limited to the 
scope of our privileges, as it stands today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have many 
questions but I will restrict myself to one, which the member is 
eminently qualified to answer since he is a constitutional expert.
<P>
	I believe the role of Parliament is to make laws which the courts 
subsequently enforce.
<P>
	Our original motion stated we should include the kind of actions 
that were undertaken by the member as being under the definition 
of seditious. Members on the other side as well as the members of 
the official opposition missed that point. What we want to do is 
clearly define sedition and counselling sedition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="673"> 673 </A></B>
<P>
	Talk about losing your freedom of speech, it was taken away 
from us by the Liberal amendment which deleted every word 
before the word ``that'' and every word after the word ``that''. I 
think that is the essence. Can we in Parliament pass such a law?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member can be assured 
that Parliament has the competence to enact whatever law it wishes 
subject only to the limits imposed by the Constitution and the 
charter of rights.
<P>
	We were discussing the roles and missions of Parliament. The 
correct arena for the honourable member would be to take up with 
the House justice committee the question of possible amendments 
to the Criminal Code in terms of the offence of sedition. That 
would be a correct route to take and to present reasoned 
amendments.
<P>
	It is not for Parliament itself to go backwards to the 17th century 
and try to set up a parallel system of criminal law covering matters 
that are properly within the ambit of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The member should go to the justice committee if he has views 
on this and present a project for amendment and see what happens. 
This is not the correct arena.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during my 35 year career at university, I have always been 
able to recognize intelligence.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Did it often happen?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> It is very rare, but I would like to commend the 
member for Vancouver Quadra for his remarkable performance in 
this House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> The member for Vancouver Quadra 
understands the real problem and its significance. He first said that, 
given the fact that our colleague issued a communiqué on October 
26 outside Parliament, outside the House, he was no longer entitled 
to his privileges, and that this matter must therefore settled in 
court.
<P>
	For the information of the member for Vancouver Quadra, who 
may not have followed all the news-and I am not criticizing him 
for that-the matter was brought before the courts twice, once in 
Quebec and once in Ontario, in proceedings against our colleague 
from Charlesbourg. In both cases, the action was dismissed. In one 
case, the judge even said that he considered our colleague's 
communiqué as a job offer. The issue, therefore, is clear. Taking 
this to a civil court of law would not be very successful.
<P>
	If civil proceedings do not work, and if the House is not 
concerned-since he said in his last answer to our Reform Party 
colleague whose riding I forgot that the  House of Commons is the 
wrong place to debate the question, having even told him to go to 
the justice committee or introduce a bill-I hope the member for 
Vancouver Quadra will not disappoint me tomorrow-since the 
government has announced that it would gag the House-and will 
in fact oppose the Reform Party's motion and, consequently, of 
course, also oppose his party's amendment, which was cooked up 
on the sly with the Reform Party's complicity. It is not something 
to brag about, but I knew he was intelligent enough to avoid voting 
on this amendment.
<P>
	Now, I think it is also important to realize that the Reform 
Party's motion is flawed. We were just told that the real intent of 
the motion was to give a new definition of the word ``sedition''. As 
I had some time this afternoon in the House, listening to all the 
high flown rhetoric, I checked in the dictionaries we have here.
<P>
	First, I discovered there were two meanings to the word 
``sedition''. There is plain sedition and military sedition. Those are 
two very different things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> And that of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> And that of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> And it seems there is also the Reform Party 
definition of sedition.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is surely not in the dictionary.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Their influence has not been strong enough yet 
for that type of sedition to be entered in the dictionary.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> So, sedition means ``a rebellion against the 
government in power''. I do not think it applies to our colleague. 
The little communiqué was quite innocuous, and did not incite to 
very much-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ha, ha.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> No, no, innocuous in the good sense of the 
term.
<P>
	There are also synonyms. I always said to my students at the 
university-male or female, but I always spoke in the feminine 
because in my opinion the majority should prevail in grammar as 
well-that when you really wanted to define the meaning of the 
word you had to look at all the synonyms to be sure to properly 
define the concept. It is important to define concepts, especially 
when you are trying to change a definition and include it in the 
dictionary. It takes time.
<P>
	The word sedition in its larger sense has three synonyms. The 
first one is tumult. Sometimes, seeing the comments of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, you wonder whether 
there is not a bit of sedition in his comments which certainly give 
rise to tumultuous reactions.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="674"> 674 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	Another synonym is insurrection. Mr. Trudeau was really afraid 
of that. He talked about apprehended insurrection, and we know the 
result in Quebec in 1970: revolt.
<P>
	Fortunately, on October 27-the day after the famous 
communiqué-the people of Quebec behaved with dignity, because 
the action of that Canada that loved us was a huge provocation that 
could have led to revolt. So, this government could have been 
accused of sedition.
<P>
	Now, the military sedition. This is the one which we must deal 
with, because my colleague was vice-chairman of the standing 
committee on defence and official opposition critic for defence.
<P>
	Military sedition is very interesting because, according to the 
dictionary, we ought to refer to two words to better understand the 
concept, the first being ``pronunciamento''. This is a Spanish word 
which is found in the French dictionary. It is defined as an act by 
which a military leader-you are accused of many defects, my dear 
friend-or a group of military officers declares its refusal to obey 
the government, or as any coup organized or favoured by the army. 
Oh boy! It was not the right word, it does not make any sense.
<P>
	The other synonym was putsch. You know, we are not very used 
to this kind of thing, we are so distinct from the anglophone 
community that we do not have a French word for ``military 
sedition''. There is no such thing in our past, so we have to use a 
Spanish word or an English word, putsch.
<P>
	Under putsch, we find ``uprising'', ``<I>coup de main</I> by an armed 
political group''. We are a political group, but we are not armed 
with a view to taking power. You know that we have absolutely no 
intention of assuming power here. So, there you are.
<P>
	This little demonstration had to be made in the House to clearly 
show that the Reform Party is very poorly organized, and there is 
more to come.
<P>
	Now, there is one thing that is very surprising. English Canada 
woke up-as we know-on October 31, and has been having 
terrible nightmares ever since. English Canadians have not read, 
among other measures, Bill 1 tabled by Mr. Parizeau. There was a 
great deal of discussions here on ``the question'', but they did not 
bother to read the bill, including clause 17 which provided that the 
government would take necessary measures for Quebec to continue 
to participate in defence alliances of which Canada is a member. 
The fact is that we would need soldiers to participate in these 
alliances. We already had soldiers in Quebec. It would have been 
silly to train more. I now go on: ``Such participation must, 
however, be compatible with Québec's desire to give priority to the 
maintenance of world peace under the leadership of the United 
Nations Organization''.
<P>
	In our meetings with soldiers, we explained that. We had a nice 
little document with questions and answers. We had to give them
<P>
some information, as was pointed out by the hon. members for 
Richelieu and Portneuf, among others. ``What will Quebec do, 
about defence?'' Here is what we will do: ``We will have a small 
army whose mandate will be to protect our territory, to give 
assistance in natural disasters and to participate in the UN 
peacekeeping missions. A sovereign Quebec will assume its 
responsibility in collective security and defence through existing 
international treaties like North Atlantic Treaty Organization and 
North American Aerospace Defence Command''.
<P>
	For that, we needed soldiers. We needed officers. We needed all 
kinds of people. So, my colleague had the idea, the brilliant idea I 
must say, to tell the members of the armed forces-like the 
government had the idea to reassure our seniors by telling them that 
it would cut their pensions-that if a majority of Quebecers were to 
say yes, we would offer them a job. We never went further than 
that. Finally, we had very interesting arguments that maybe we 
should table in this House.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOFTWOODLUMBERINDUSTRY">SOFTWOOD LUMBER INDUSTRY</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 29 I asked the Minister for International 
Trade why Canada chose to conclude an agreement in principle 
with the United States on matters relating to softwood lumber 
rather than take this dispute to a NAFTA dispute resolution panel.
<P>
	This is the process we chose in 1994 after the U.S. imposed a 
duty on imported Canadian lumber. The duty was overturned by a 
bilateral panel which ruled that Canada stumpage fees do not 
constitute an unfair subsidy as was claimed by a U.S. lumber lobby. 
The U.S. appealed the decision to an extraordinary challenge 
committee which again ruled in Canada's favour.
<P>
	According to the minister, the U.S. congress looked on these 
defeats and simply changed the laws. Rather than go through the 
uncertainty involved in another NAFTA panel process, the 
Government of Canada, several provinces and the lumber industry 
chose to make a deal with the Americans.
<P>
	The crux of the matter is that NAFTA does not prevent United 
States' industries from using protectionist countervailing duties to 
harass Canadian exporters. It only provides that a binational panel 
can review U.S. governmental determinations to see if U.S. law has 
been applied correctly.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	Obviously this is a serious flaw within the NAFTA. There are no 
clear cut rules on subsidies, nor are there any real definitions of 
what constitutes a subsidy. These are shortcomings that must be 
remedied as soon as possible.
<P>
	In the meantime in appears we are engaged in a war of attrition 
with American protectionist forces, which is only intensified 
during an election year in the United States. The minister knows 
the Americans have applied to set up a NAFTA panel to rule on the 
legality of Canada's set of tariffs on supply managed commodities, 
which were negotiated during the last round of GATT. The United 
States is also signatory to this agreement. According to its reading 
of events Washington now claims that NAFTA takes precedence 
over the GATT agreement and that Canada's tariffs must be 
eliminated.
<P>
	I am confident that Canada will emerge victorious from this 
most recent NAFTA panel decision. The fact remains there is 
nothing to stop the United States from launching an extraordinary 
challenge or from changing its laws again. What does Canada do 
then? Do we  continue to stand by the principles of NAFTA, flawed 
as they may be, or do we simply throw in the towel on our dairy, 
egg and poultry producers? I am sure the Minister for International 
Trade will agree with me that this case is shaping up as the largest 
trade dispute ever between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	However, even if Canada wins the case, and I am sure we will, 
under the current atmosphere of rising American protectionism this 
battle could drag on for several more years for the reasons I have 
just alluded to.
<P>
	Let us be clear what is at stake here. According to a study 
conducted by economic forecasters, if the United States succeeds 
in knocking down the tariff wall that covers Canada's dairy, egg 
and poultry producers, by the year 2000 the opening border will 
wipe out 28,000 Canadian farms, farming and food processing 
jobs. This would result in $3.4 billion in lost sales and would cost 
the government $2.7 billion in lost taxes.
<P>
	Obviously if the upcoming NAFTA panel decision on the 
legality of Canada's tariff levels were to go against Canada we 
would have a very serious problem on our hands. What I would like 
to know, and perhaps the Minister for International Trade can tell 
me, is in the event of a Canadian victory what steps will he take to 
ensure these GATT negotiated tariffs are not simply bargained 
away through a special deal with the protectionist minded 
Americans? Will the minister go to the wall for Canada's dairy, egg 
and poultry producers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Lambton-Middlesex has been quite vigilant in bringing the 
interests of Canadian agricultural producers to the forefront each 
time she speaks in the House of Commons. The minister and the 
government listened very carefully to the concerns she raised.
<P>
	In answer to the specific question, it is the hope of the 
government that actions to reach an agreement with the United 
States were done to put an end to almost 15 years of litigation 
between Canada and U.S. softwood lumber producers. I know the 
member is fully aware that although we have remedies under the 
NAFTA, many times our counterparts in the U.S. seem to become 
engaged with frivolous disputes which tie up the system for an 
undue length of time.
<P>
	This was one of the considerations the Canadian government had 
to look at when the latest dispute arose. The Canadian industry and 
provincial governments decided negotiating an acceptable 
agreement to guarantee security of access to the U.S. market was 
preferable to the uncertainties and costs of fighting a countervail 
duty case.
<P>
	I remind the House that in order to take the softwood lumber 
dispute to a NAFTA chapter 19 panel the United States would have 
to first launch a countervailing duty investigation and determine 
that Canadian lumber  exports to the U.S. were being subsidized 
and conclude that U.S. producers were being injured. Furthermore, 
if it had so decided, the United States would have imposed the duty 
on Canadian softwood lumber exports. Such a duty would have had 
significant negative impacts on the Canadian lumber industry and 
its employees.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="678"> 678 </A></B>
<P>
	This industry is extremely important to Canada. It employs 
about 60,000 people across the country. Canadian exporters of 
softwood lumber to the U.S. reached record levels in 1995 of over 
$8 billion. This represents approximately 60 per cent of Canadian 
softwood lumber production. The value of these exports has grown 
substantially since 1990.
<P>
	Therefore in striking a deal with the U.S. the agreement is 
designed to avoid another long, protracted and costly trade battle. 
The agreement which comes into effect on April 1, 1996 will give 
Canadian softwood lumber exporters security of market access to 
the U.S. market for five years.
<P>
	I also assure the member that this deal should not looked at as a 
precedent. I do not think it is. The hon. member would find that the 
Minister for International Trade and the government will, as she 
said, go to the wall to protect the interests of Canadian supply side 
manufacturers, as we have the right to do under the GATT 
agreement.
<P>
	Softwood lumber was a very special case. I assure the member 
her concerns and those of the people she represents will be taken 
into consideration in any future plans that the Government of 
Canada has with respect to supporting our producers.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.20 p.m.)
