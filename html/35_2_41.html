	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, in my absence 
yesterday, this being the first opportunity to address this issue, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs attributed comments to me which were 
factually inaccurate and totally untrue.
<P>
	The Reform Party has a very clear statement and undertakings on 
our belief in human rights in Canada. I support the Reform Party on 
those-

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two petitions today. The first one is from Sarnia, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
chronically ill, the aged and the disabled.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition comes from Brantford, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners bring to the attention of the House that 
consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or 
impair one's ability, and specifically that fetal alcohol syndrome 
and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable 
by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of alcoholic beverages.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am being inundated with petitions sent by all methods short of 
horse and buggy. The petitioners are concerned about the method 
by which the government is pushing through in such rapid fashion 
the addition of sexual orientation to the Canadian Human Rights 
Act.
<P>
	These petitioners call on Parliament to oppose this. They have 
taken a number of different ways to express that but are very 
concerned with both the method and the message the government is 
sending.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 18</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-33, in Clause 2, be amended by adding after line 8, on page 2, the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``3.(2) For greater certainty, nothing in Sections 2 or 3 of this Act shall be 
construed by any court or tribunal in such a way as to add, read in, or include the 
words sexual orientation in Section 16 of this Act.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak to Motion No. 1, which also pertains to 
Motion No. 8.
<P>
	This would change the amendment proposed by Bill C-33 so that 
the only difference in wording in the purpose section of the 
Canadian Human Rights Act would be the addition of the words 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	These motions would go a long way toward addressing the fear 
of many Canadians that Bill C-33 as it now stands would lead to 
court interpretations such that gay couples could claim marriage 
and family benefits as a matter of right, that the legal privileges the 
state confers on conjugal couples of the opposite sex would be 
equally guaranteed by right to couples of the same sex.
<P>
	The justice minister has explicitly said this is not the intention of 
Bill C-33. He said it is workplace legislation  and nothing more. He 
has assured us it has nothing to do with the definition of family, of 
same sex benefits or of same sex couples.
<P>
	If the vast majority of Canadians can be convinced of that, they 
will support Bill C-33. If Canadians could be sure it will be limited 
in effect to the workplace, at least 90 per cent would support it.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	By and large we are a tolerant society. Canadians do not like 
discrimination. They deplore it, whether it is because of sexual 
orientation, race, language or religion. It does not matter. 
Discrimination is discrimination.
<P>
	If Canadians could be certain that the impact of Bill C-33 would 
be confined in interpretation to protecting gays from harassment 
and unfair treatment in the workplace, then I suggest the bill would 
enjoy overwhelming support.
<P>
	However, many MPs in the House, including myself, in 
representing our constituents were unable to vote for Bill C-33 
during second reading. They felt, as I do, that there is good reason 
to believe that as it stands it could trigger interpretations by the 
courts that would enlarge the legal definition of family to include 
same sex couples.
<P>
	In my instance, I am concerned that this will open the door in 
turn to an interpretation of section 1 of the charter of rights and 
freedoms, such as under provincial law, where discretion to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2397"> 2397 </A></B>
<P>
consider the pros and cons of sexual orientation in child custody 
cases would cease to exist.
<P>
	In other words, the sexuality of gay parents could no longer be 
considered in an application to adopt. I am afraid that this might be 
an infringement on the rights of a child who, when all other factors 
are equal, might better be raised by heterosexual parents rather than 
homosexual parents.
<P>
	I am not saying that gay couples should never be able to adopt. 
Only that children should have a right to have the sexual 
orientation of parents taken into consideration when the authorities 
are placing them for adoption.
<P>
	That is my primary concern about Bill C-33 as it now stands. 
Other MPs have other concerns but most of them stem from the 
implications of Bill C-33 in terms of the legal definition of marital 
status and the family.
<P>
	We have some good reason to be worried. Bill C-33 does more 
than add the words sexual orientation to the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. It also changes its purpose from being applicable to 
every individual to being applicable to all individuals. The change 
to all individuals in Bill C-33 is not trivial. The term every 
individual is exclusionary in meaning. The term all individuals is 
inclusive. The former connotes individuals in isolation, the latter 
individuals in groups.
<P>
	I have talked to lawyers who are of the opinion that judges could 
interpret the phrase ``all individuals'' as  including same sex 
couples for the purposes of the act. This is all the more certain in 
that Bill C-33 also changes the words ``himself'' or ``herself'' and 
``he'' or ``she'' to ``themselves'' and ``they''.
<P>
	My Motions No. 1 and 8 would restore the original wording of 
the purpose section of the Canadian Human Rights Act so that the 
only words added by Bill C-33 are the words sexual orientation and 
nothing more.
<P>
	It is my understanding from the drafters of this legislation that 
the change from ``every'' to ``all individuals'' was done for no 
particular reason. Indeed, I could not get an adequate explanation. I 
suppose the syntax was tidier.
<P>
	However, by changing the wording as proposed for the purpose 
section back to ``every individual'' from ``all individuals'' and to 
``himself'' and ``herself'' from ``themselves'' we members of the 
House of Commons can send a strong message to the courts that it 
is our intent to limit this legislation to individuals in isolation, not 
to individuals in groups.
<P>
	By passing this motion we say to the courts that it is absolutely 
not our intention that the inclusion of sexual orientation in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act is to be interpreted in terms of any 
form of same sex partnership, implicit or explicit.
<P>
	By voting for the motion, my colleagues are saying that Bill 
C-33 exists outside the issue of same sex marriage, outside the 
issue of same sex parents, outside the issue of same sex benefits. 
This bill is to do with individuals only, not relationships between 
individuals.
<P>
	We cannot make the will of Parliament clearer. Having done so 
by enacting this amendment into law, the way becomes open, the 
road smooth, to support Bill C-33. Then it becomes with as much 
guarantee as we can hope, a law to do exactly that envisaged by the 
justice minister, a law that will fight harassment and discrimination 
against individuals in the workplace. It will then become a law of 
which all Canadians can be proud.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the mover of the motion. He made some 
very good points, one of which I believe is absolutely critical. He 
enunciated the concerns of Canadians, that is, the potential 
ramifications which are not stated in the bill and for which there are 
all kinds of assurances outside of the bill.
<P>
	The hon. member discussed discrimination. Clearly Canadians 
do not support discrimination. Clearly Canadians want to ensure 
that no one is discriminated against. The point is the potential 
ramifications outlined by the hon. member.
<P>
	What disturbs me follows from the attempts which were made 
by the hon. member to find out why the words were changed. This 
statute has been in place for  many years. It has been interpreted by 
the courts, based on the language in the act. All of a sudden, at the 
same time that those two contentious words are being added, we 
are being asked to change other wording in section 2.
<P>
	The hon. member tells us that he attempted to find out the legal 
rationalization for making those changes. He tells us that the 
justice department was unable to give him any legal 
rationalization. Indeed, I would suggest that there is no 
rationalization for making those changes, unless it is to do 
precisely what the hon. member suggests, to address groups instead 
of individuals.
<P>
	The problem is that we have not yet heard anyone from the 
justice department express a clear reason why these words are 
being changed. In the absence of a clear reason to change a statute 
which is already in place and which has been judicially interpreted, 
I believe there is no clear reason to change the words. Therefore, I 
am in complete support of the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Hamilton-Wentworth. I await a justification, from 
either the parliamentary secretary or the Minister of Justice, for 
this change in words and a convincing argument why we should 
accept these words as opposed to leaving section 2 as it now stands, 
with the exception of the addition of the words sexual orientation.
<P>
	I repeat, if there is no reason to make the change, there is no 
reason to vote for the change. I support the amendment of the hon. 
member.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this week members of Parliament will speed through the 
intersection of values and politics. Not even a skid mark will trace 
the collision between a radical agenda and the foundations of our 
society. Fleeing from the scene is any hope of full and open debate. 
No legislation is more consequential than laws which affect the 
core values, the building blocks of our civilization, the cornerstone 
of our culture.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2398"> 2398 </A></B>
<P>
	In this respect, Bill C-33 will be the most significant legislation 
since the charter of rights. We have shifted our aims from a just 
society to a frontier society, a society lacking structure, without 
guiding values, with no blueprint for the next generation.
<P>
	Family is the bridge between our roots and the foundation of our 
future. Its demise, the dilution of its purpose, will reduce children 
to little more than a commodity, the guinea pigs of a brave new 
world.
<P>
	To compare my objections to Bill C-33 to those of the member 
from Nanaimo would be as wrong as to connect the support of the 
Minister of Justice to the North American Man Boy Love 
Association, which also backs his bill.
<P>
	In June 1995 I voted for Bill C-41. Its only direct consequence 
was longer prison terms for violent criminals who targeted 
homosexuals or other identifiable groups. Three years ago I was 
ready to support Bill C-108 which had wording almost identical to 
Bill C-33. I was  persuaded at the time that its additional definition 
of marital status would limit its scope and prevent any consequence 
on the irreplaceable and central role of the traditional family in our 
society.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Today's Bill C-33 is a Trojan horse, its payload filled with legal 
reinforcements for the war against values currently being waged in 
our courts, the constitutional war against core values. Just one 
more tool is needed to rid our social infrastructure of traditional 
family values. This bill is that tool.
<P>
	Bill C-33 was introduced boasting lofty words and lofty intent. I 
listened to the Minister of Justice tell us how this bill would help 
persons who may suffer discrimination in the workplace. On that 
intent I absolutely agree. No Canadian should be fired or demoted 
for any reason other than the quality of his or her work. That is 
fundamental and it is a principle that the government must enforce.
<P>
	We all agree with the platitudes motherhood, apple pie and 
justice for all, but platitudes in legislation are an abdication of 
Parliament's responsibility to make tough, controversial and 
political decisions. One man, one vote has been replaced by one 
judge, one vote. Sadly the concept of justice is drowning in the 
courts.
<P>
	Today the public has been largely removed from debate about 
how their society should evolve, about how their children should be 
raised. Those decisions too often rest with unelected judges 
responding to complaints from special interest groups. Typically 
the only role left for the public is to read the results in the 
newspaper and react with helpless outrage.
<P>
	Some lawyers, appointed by politicians to sit on the bench in 
judgment, have abused the highest law of the land, the charter, to 
legitimize everything from child pornography to the sodomy of a 
14-year-old by a fugitive sex offender. Timely barely permits a 
single example.
<P>
	Vernon Logan was charged with and pleaded guilty to possession 
of child pornography. Then, despite the guilty plea, Judge Brian 
Saunderson gave Logan an absolute discharge. Why? Because in 
the judge's view child pornography law violates the charter of 
rights.
<P>
	I do not recall child pornography being protected in the charter 
but judges have nearly unlimited licence to read their own personal 
views between the lines of the law. Of course no consideration is 
given to the rights of children victimized by the pornographer. 
They have no standing in court.
<P>
	The values of society should determine the law. The law should 
not determine the values of society. Clearly the courts are not 
guardians of our values. We cannot afford to give them any more 
legislative blank cheques. No more bills like Bill C-33. I looked to 
the Library of Parliament, our legislative counsel and even outside  
resources to predict the consequences of Bill C-33. Is it radical to 
ask to be informed of the consequences of a law before you vote for 
it? I was told and I quote from the Library of Parliament:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-it is not feasible to draw up an exhaustive listing of entitlements that might, 
in theory, give rise to the lodging of complaints based on sexual orientation 
under the Canadian Human Rights Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	You should not have to be Nostradamas to predict the 
consequences of law. Is this not unlimited scope, a blank cheque, 
no legal guarantees, no collateral, no fail safe, no debate? Mr. 
Speaker, no signature.
<P>
	My mentor in drafting the two amendments I propose was of 
course the Minister of Justice whose booklet on the bill declares 
that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The proposed amendment will have no bearing on definitions of ``marriage'', 
``family'' or ``spouse''. It will simply guarantee individual rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have also been told that this bill will have no bearing on 
criminal offences. The best way to make these guarantees is in the 
body of the bill and that is what my amendments seek to do.
<P>
	I have added a definition of marital status. Marital status means 
``the status of being married, single, separated, divorced, widowed 
or cohabiting with an individual of the opposite sex in a conjugal 
relationship for at least one year''.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	Kim Campbell referred to this definition as simply confirming 
the existing law. Is it any different from how almost all Canadians 
view marital status? Would it diminish human rights in this country 
to state a central value in our society? Is it too much to ask that 
more than lip service be given to the notion of the traditional 
family?
<P>
	Bill C-33 is intended to have no impact on the definition of 
marital status, so says the Minister of Justice. If this is the case, 
then this amendment is perfectly consistent with the position of the 
Minister of Justice.
<P>
	My second amendment restates the minister's position that Bill 
C-33 should have no impact on criminal offences. It reads: 
``Nothing in sections 2 or 3 shall be construed so as to render any 
provision of the Criminal Code inoperative or of no force or 
effect''. In other words, Bill C-33 cannot be used to thwart justice.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2399"> 2399 </A></B>
<P>
	To support these amendments will allow Parliament to achieve 
its goal of a non-discriminatory workplace. It would also signal to 
the courts Parliament's intent that this bill should not contribute to 
any redefinition of marital status or weakening of the Criminal 
Code. Support for these amendments would address legitimate 
concerns. Opposition to them makes the case that our concerns are 
well founded.
<P>
	Bill C-33 in raw form is unacceptable to me. It is unacceptable to 
my church and I believe it is unacceptable to the majority of my 
constituents. The amendments I propose define my main concerns. 
They preserve the central thrust of government policy without 
harmful side effects for the Canadian family and children. The 
amendments would confine the bill to the rhetoric that is being 
used to sell it.
<P>
	No debate about values will ever be solved with platitudes. We 
cannot forever deflect the challenges facing our society with glib 
truisms, but what we can do is make responsible changes necessary 
to maintain fairness in society without demolishing other key 
principles at the same time.
<P>
	At the intersection of politics and values, conscience must 
always have the right of way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in speaking to Motion No. 10 I will take the opportunity to 
speak to Motions Nos. 19 and 20 which are interrelated.
<P>
	I listened intently to previous-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Motion No. 20 is not on the floor at the 
moment. That will come up later. Please do not speak to Motion 
No. 20, but speak to the other ones as indicated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will confine my comments to 
Motion No. 10 which is on the floor at this time.
<P>
	Previous speakers have very eloquently stated the unease that 
many Canadians, including myself, feel about this bill. It really 
strikes to the basic honesty of the position taken by the government 
in this bill.
<P>
	If we are going to be debating, and if the debate is to be framed 
on putting same sex relationships on an equal footing as 
heterosexual relationships, then we should have the honesty to say 
so. That is how this debate should be framed.
<P>
	To frame the debate around discrimination and say not just to 
members here but to all Canadians who feel uneasy and are against 
this that somehow they are discriminating against human beings 
who are gay is wrong. Not only is it wrong, it is insulting. Then to 
push this debate through the House with such unseemly haste when 
there are wise and considered arguments on both sides that should 
be heard by all Canadians so that all Canadians can consider these 
very important issues of relevance to the kind of society that we 
are, in my opinion is deceitful, dishonest and beneath the dignity of 
this House. I am embarrassed and I am ashamed.
<P>
	I am embarrassed and I am ashamed by the way many witnesses 
were treated at the committee meetings. People came and as 
Canadians expected to have their voices heard with passion, with 
dignity, with some sense of solemnity for the occasion and the 
moment. This is their  House of Commons. These are their 
committee meetings where people on both sides of the issue expect 
to be heard with dignity. To treat fellow Canadians like cattle in the 
rush to get this legislation through the House is beneath the dignity 
of all of us. At least I would hope it is beneath the dignity of all of 
us.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	My specific amendments are based upon the amendments that 
were brought forward by the Canadian Conference of Catholic 
Bishops. Their amendments and the amendments I have brought 
forward would have one purpose which is to limit the scope of this 
bill to that which the justice minister has said this bill relates. There 
are two aspects: the human rights considerations and the justice 
considerations.
<P>
	Canadians are virtually unanimous in saying they support the 
human rights aspects of the bill. They support the notion of 
prevention of discrimination. No Canadian should be discriminated 
against for any reason, including their sexual orientation.
<P>
	On the other side of the coin are the people who say that the 
terms marriage, family, tradition have a place and a foundation in 
our society and we should not tread lightly upon these foundations, 
the building blocks of our society. If we are going to change the 
way we relate to each other, one to another, then for goodness sake 
let us do so honestly.
<P>
	There are ways the issues of fairness and equity for our fellow 
citizens who are homosexual can be addressed. Those of us who are 
not homosexual but feel just as strongly that these issues need to be 
addressed for the sake of fairness feel they may be addressed 
through other measures such as a registered domestic partnership 
which need not threaten the traditional sanctity of family and 
marriage.
<P>
	Thank you for allowing me these few introductory remarks. I 
would just caution this House that we and all Canadians not take 
lightly those with whom we do not agree. Even if we do not agree 
with them, their views do have merit and worth and should be 
treated with dignity and respect. If their views are unheard they 
will build tremendous resentment in the land.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING">SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would like to make a 
preliminary statement before proceeding with the full ruling on the 
matter of the motions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2400"> 2400 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Central Nova has proposed to table two 
motions which would have removed the words ``sexual 
orientation'' from each clause of the bill. The hon. member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam has proposed identical motions. Those 
motions were returned to the hon. members and not printed on the 
Notice Paper by error.
<P>
	Consequently, the Chair has decided to allow the motions to 
proceed. Since the hon. member for Central Nova tabled her 
motions first, the motions will be in her name. They will be 
numbered as Motions Nos. 8A and 16A.
<P>
	Accordingly, there are 23 motions in amendment for the report 
stage of Bill C-33, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights 
Act. They will be grouped for debate as follows:
<P>
	Group No. 1: Motions Nos. 1, 9 to 15 and 18. Group No. 2: 
Motions Nos. 2, 3, 17, 19, 20 and 21. A revised version of this 
ruling will be distributed as it is easier for members to follow than 
hearing it read quickly. Group No. 3: Motions Nos. 4 to 8, 8A, 16 
and 16A. The voting patterns for the motions within each group 
will be available at the table very shortly. The Chair will remind the 
House of each pattern at the time of voting.
<P>
	Resuming debate on Group No. 1.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REPORTSTAGEDEBATERESUMED">REPORT STAGE DEBATE RESUMED</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was quite prepared to wait my turn since mine is the last motion in 
the group and there are four other motions, but I will take the 
opportunity to stand.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will be aware that he 
can only speak once on a group. If the member has misunderstood 
or if something has not been made clear, perhaps he would seek 
unanimous consent to speak to his motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for the clarification. I was 
under the impression that one could speak to the motions so I 
would ask for unanimous consent to address my Motion No. 18.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is obviously not unanimous 
consent over yonder. The member will not be able to speak to his 
amendment.
<P>
	Does anyone else who has not already spoken wish to speak to 
Group No. 1? The hon. member for Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it 
somewhat tragic that members of Parliament, even within their 
own party are sometimes not able to express themselves on matters 
and amendments they bring before this House of Commons which 
are not only represented by their own conscience but I am sure by 
the wishes and intentions of constituents. I found it unfortunate that 
the member for Winnipeg St. James did not permit the member for 
Scarborough West to do that. However, under the circumstances I 
fully understand.
<P>
	I was elected to this House of Commons after some 20 years as a 
member of the Liberal Party. I have worked very hard to help the 
likes of the Hon. Paul Cosgrove, as well as my colleague the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River, and provincially 
individuals like Alvin Curling. I believed the Liberal Party 
represented the most important aspect of Canadian life, the 
freedom of speech.
<P>
	Regrettably, this bill does more to divide members and certainly 
confuse constituents because it was not clearly articulated in the 
last election. Speaking to the motions by the member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth, I find it important that members of 
Parliament have an opportunity to articulate matters which are a 
fundamental concern to all Canadians. The reason for this is very 
simple.
<P>
	In the last election we did not campaign on Bill C-33. Nowhere 
in the red book will be found any discussion about the desire by the 
government to move to in some way uphold, protect or remove a 
certain discrimination which probably exists but exists right across 
the political spectrum and is not exclusive simply to gays and 
lesbians. Bill C-33 was not mentioned in the throne speech 
although there are some who are concerned and seem to make the 
argument that it was.
<P>
	As we speak many people in Canada are waking up this morning 
only to find to their shock and dismay that we have undertaken a 
bill which if not checked, if not amended, will radically transform 
the definition of family as we understand it. Those are not my 
words. Those are the words of Supreme Court Chief Justice 
Antonio Lamer. I am quoting what he said in the Mossop case, it is 
not obiter dictum: ``If Parliament had decided to include sexual 
orientation in a list of prohibited grounds of discrimination, my 
interpretation of the phrase family status might have been entirely 
different''.
<P>
	It is very clear what the court is prepared to do once this House 
gives in a very limited way its approval to end discrimination based 
on sexual orientation, at least in the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	Unlike what we have seen in the provinces, such as the province 
of Ontario where I come from and which my riding is named after, 
in 1986 the government amended its Ontario human rights 
provision. Nine years later there was a motion before that same 
legislature to deal with the question of same sex benefits which 
radically altered the definition of family for the purposes of 
Ontario's laws.
<P>
	That step from 1986 to 1994 was not coincidental. Even though 
the House at the time rejected it on a free vote, it is interesting to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2401"> 2401 </A></B>
<P>
note that certain justices in the court of Ontario had taken great 
liberties with what took place in 1986.
<P>
	Last year many Ontarians were somewhat shocked to find out 
that a justice had decided that in certain  instances adoptions are 
acceptable. Whether or not that constitutes in rem a question of 
discrimination is one thing. Clearly Parliament has an obligation to 
raise this in the eyes of the public. If we are not prepared to do that, 
I think we fail in our responsibility as representatives.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	That the bill is going through the House at record speed is of 
grave concern not simply for this member of Parliament but for the 
230,000 constituents I represent.
<P>
	Although Group No. 1 talks to many substantive and important 
motions, my concern as a member remains let us not use the bill as 
a Trojan Horse to implement same sex benefits or to in some way 
assail, undermine or redefine or socially reinvent the term family.
<P>
	There are some things which are based on political correctness, 
but 10,000 years of tradition cannot be defied. I therefore ask that 
these motions be duly considered for support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the House today with 
regard to the issue of adding the term sexual orientation to the list 
already found in the Canadian Human Rights Act. During the 
course of my speech I will make an effort to express the concerns 
of my constituents of Wild Rose.
<P>
	One evening at a public meeting a constituent stated an old 
proverb to me, that there is a way that seems right to man, but in the 
end it leads to trouble. She was addressing her concerns to the 
addition of sexual orientation to a list which already exists and that 
this would only extend the list and not answer the problems of 
discrimination. She believed the best way to fight discrimination 
was to continually promote equality and forget about a list, as there 
would surely be a number of individuals omitted.
<P>
	Everyone present agreed with the statement that every individual 
is equal before and under the law and has the right to equal 
protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination. 
They felt that was sufficient, as it does promote equality, and 
therefore should be enforced.
<P>
	This legislation is a way of expressing distrust in Canadians' 
value of tolerance. One of the most important values my wife and I 
picked up on when we arrived in Canada from the United States in 
the 1960s was that Canadians were a tolerant people, something we 
found lacking in the United States
<P>
	During my past 30 years of working in Canada, particularly in 
the province of Alberta, I found the tolerance of Canadians to 
remain constant. However, some things that are happening due to 
government intervention have made some individuals feel more 
and more as if they are being discriminated against simply because 
they are not on the list.
<P>
	Many white young males are suddenly being made aware that 
they do not fit the criteria to join police departments, fire 
departments, EMT squads or the military simply because of their 
physical make-up. Making a list has resulted in affirmative action 
and as a result the future hopes and dreams of many of these young 
men are diminished. Merit, which used to be a primary factor, has 
quickly disappeared.
<P>
	The constituents of Wild Rose have told me this is wrong. 
According to a booklet prepared by the Department of Justice this 
amendment is made to specifically apply to the protection of gays 
and lesbians as this lifestyle is referred to on page 14 of this 25 
page document.
<P>
	Therefore it is safe to assume the government defines, although 
not specifically, homosexuality as sexual orientation. 
Homosexuality is considered by the majority of Wild Rose 
constituents as an immoral, unacceptable lifestyle in Canadian 
society. They ask questions regarding their personal values such as 
whether it will become illegal to preach from a pulpit against 
homosexuality. They ask other questions:``Will my children be 
taught in schools that homosexuality is an acceptable lifestyle in 
society. As taxpayers will I be required to financially support this 
lifestyle in any way? As a landlord will I be required to rent my 
apartment to a homosexual couple? As an employer will I be 
required to hire a homosexual over a heterosexual applicant, or will 
merit be allowed? Will this legislation lead to legal marriages of 
homosexuals? Will this legislation lead to homosexuals being 
allowed to adopt children?''
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	All these questions raised are not answered in this piece of 
legislation. The problem that will arise in the future is that it will be 
up to the courts to decide answers to these questions. Ultimately 
the courts will not be accountable to the people.
<P>
	Many people believe this legislation opens the door to a slippery 
slope that will lead to the very things people object to.
<P>
	No one in my riding accepts discrimination of any form. The 
minister's saying ``no longer will you have to sit at the back of the 
bus'', is a statement which clearly says ``we do not trust you, we 
have no faith in you, therefore we will legislate for you''.
<P>
	Canadians are generally a tolerant people. However, intolerance 
will show its ugly head if the government continues to legislate for 
the people. Laws such as this clearly indicate our distrust as 
politicians in the people of Canada. Sometimes people believe 
governments should butt out of societal values. My constituents 
can be included in that group.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2402"> 2402 </A></B>
<P>
	I support all the motions in Group No. 1, particularly the motion 
put forward by my colleague, the hon. member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam, which will protect the definition of family, 
marriage and spouse.
<P>
	I find it sad for democracy when members are not allowed the 
opportunity to speak to their own motions or the legislation as a 
whole.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the movers of the first group of motions, the hon. 
members for Edmonton Southwest, Hamilton-Wentworth, 
Mississauga East, and Scarborough West. I also congratulate other 
members who have moved amendments in the other groups.
<P>
	That there are so many amendments demonstrates the dilemma 
many in the House are having with the bill. I must confess that 
when the bill was first discussed and introduced I was not only 
opposed, I was violently opposed. Why? Not because of the 
protection for Canadians who have a different sexual orientation 
from mine. That part I support wholeheartedly. The difficulty I 
have is what will be the consequences of this piece of legislation. 
Will it destroy the definition of family? Will it destroy what this 
country was built on, strong family values?
<P>
	That is what these amendments are trying to portray. Once the 
family unit starts falling apart, society is weakened. When society 
is weakened, the country is weakened. We will no longer be 
identified by the United Nations as the best country in the world if 
we destroy the basic unit, the family.
<P>
	Why did I make a flip-flop? Sometimes politicians are afraid to 
admit when they make a flip-flop. I made a flip-flop after searching 
my soul, after searching my conscience. I changed my position 
because of what the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice 
promised. I and other members were after some preamble which 
would protect the traditional family.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	I am pleased the Minister of Justice built into Bill C-33 the 
preamble:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>AND WHEREAS the Government recognizes and affirms the importance of 
family as the foundation of Canadian society and that nothing in this Act alters 
its fundamental role in society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If future courts would honour and respect that, we have a 
win-win situation. We have a win situation for gays and lesbians, as 
they hopefully will not be discriminated against as far as getting a 
job with agencies and companies regulated by the federal 
government, and a win situation for protecting the family. I do not 
think we have seen many pieces of legislation where protecting the 
traditional family is built right into the legislation.
<P>
	I have had more faxes, calls, letters, individual representations 
on this issue than I have had on any other issue in my 12 years as a 
member of Parliament. The  representations are running probably 
80 per cent to 90 per cent for me to vote against this legislation.
<P>
	What do I do? Do I listen to these representations? When it 
comes to human rights issues, if I listen to the majority 
representations then no minority group would ever be protected. I 
am not lobbied by the Prime Minister. I have received no pressure 
from the Prime Minister on how I should vote. I have had no 
pressure from the Minister of Justice. I have a lot of pressure from 
the community. However, I have to stand up in the House and say 
what is best for the future of the country, short term and long term.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the minister have answered many of the 
concerns I had, the same concerns the member for Wild Rose 
mentioned in this speech. The first concern was will this 
amendment not lead to benefits for same sex partners. I am assured 
this amendment will not extend same sex benefits to partners of 
gays and lesbians.
<P>
	Another concern is will this legislation not give special rights or 
benefits to gays and lesbians. Again I am assured that no one could 
credibly argue that federal and provincial human rights legislation 
now confers special rights on Catholics, on husbands or on those 
with disabilities. Although each of those characteristics is now 
expressly covered by the existing statute, it is obvious no such 
special rights are conferred. It would be no different for sexual 
orientation. The amendment will prohibit discrimination in areas of 
federal jurisdiction, including employment and access to goods and 
services.
<P>
	Many of my friends sitting in the House on all sides were 
concerned that this will change the definition of marriage, family 
and spouse. That is why I welcome these amendments. I think that 
is the protection these people want. Again, I am told that no 
changes to the definition of marriage, family or spouse are planned 
or necessary as a result of this amendment.
<P>
	Another concern I had is will this legislation lead to adoption by 
same sex couples. My family has been blessed with an adopted 
daughter, and so this one is very dear to my heart. Again, I am 
assured that matters such as adoption are primarily under 
provincial jurisdiction. This amendment deals with discrimination 
in employment, accommodation and provision of services, and 
nothing else. I hope future courts will read the debates the House 
has held on this topic.
<P>
	Another concern is will this legalize pedophilia. My community 
has been shattered because a pedophile from B.C. was too 
dangerous to be housed in British Columbia. So where is he 
dumped? In Parkdale-High Park in a federal correctional 
institution that has 50 beds for hard core criminals, including sex 
offenders and pedophiles.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	In the greater Toronto area there are 118 such dangerous 
offenders who are being rehabilitated back  into the community. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2403"> 2403 </A></B>
<P>
That is what we have to do but it is unfair for Parkdale-High Park 
to have to take 40 per cent of these dangerous offenders. However, 
that is another issue which I will be pushing in another forum.
<P>
	Will this legislation mean that the government will have to 
amend 40 or 50 other federal statutes? I am told this bill does not 
deal with benefits for same sex partners. No other changes to 
federal legislation are planned or necessary as a result of this 
amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act. My concern is that 
these same sex benefits have already crept in but not through this 
legislation. They have crept in through collective bargaining 
agreements. I would recommend to all the churches and individuals 
who are lobbying members that it is time that they started lobbying 
the labour unions who are signing these collective agreements. 
Once it is in the collective agreement even the courts cannot 
overrule it.
<P>
	A dangerous precedent has already been made when the public 
servants signed an agreement with Treasury Board. Anyone 
working in the foreign service, if a partner of same sex passes 
away, that partner gets all moving expenses covered to return to 
Canada. It is not this legislation that brought that in. Same sex 
benefits are already creeping in and from where? Through the 
collective agreements.
<P>
	To all the churches, to all the individuals who have been 
lobbying me and others, maybe it is time to start lobbying the 
labour unions.
<P>
	Will this amendment mean the churches and religious schools 
will now be forced to hire gays and lesbians as teachers even if that 
is contrary to their-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired. Is 
there unanimous consent for him to continue?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> I have been given assurance that churches, religious 
schools and other religious organizations are not within federal 
jurisdiction so this bill does not affect them.
<P>
	This has been one of the toughest decisions I have had to make in 
my political career. I want everyone to respect why I made that 
decision because I respect everyone else's decision here. I was 
disgusted that as soon as this legislation passed, gays and lesbians 
lobbied on the Hill because the Prime Minister gave Liberal 
members a free vote. That was disgusting. They want me to respect 
their rights, but they will not respect my rights of a free vote. I 
found that very disgusting.
<P>
	I am sorry to end on that note but sometimes these minority 
groups push a little too far and if they do there is going to be a 
public backlash.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on the Group No. 1 motions.
<P>
	Since the bill was presented, debated and voted on at second 
reading, all members of Parliament have had an opportunity to 
reflect on what was in the bill and what has been said. I would like 
to try to put some focus on the fundamental issue in play here.
<P>
	Unjust discrimination in all its forms is abhorrent to the House 
and I know to all Canadians. Unjust discrimination such as 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or any other 
characteristic is not in question here. The courts have ruled time 
and time again that although those words are not in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act at this point, they are interpreted to be there.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to speak to a senior 
crown counsel. I asked whether any Canadian, regardless of their 
working for an organization or crown corporation under federal 
jurisdiction and falling through the cracks, would be covered by the 
laws of Canada and the courts. He said absolutely not.
<P>
	The justice minister clearly pointed out to the House that 
Canadians are covered. The courts have ruled that sexual 
orientation already is interpreted to be there. The change, simply to 
add those two little words, should have absolutely no impact on 
what is happening today with regard to protection from 
discrimination.
<P>
	Already, in the present laws of Canada, there is protection. 
Theoretically, this is a benign bill. It has no implications 
whatsoever other than simply to add two words. That is exactly the 
way it should be. No one in this House would disagree with that. 
We are equal under the law. There should be no discrimination 
dealing with labour relations, accommodation, services, 
membership in groups. For any of those things, all are equal under 
the law.
<P>
	In discussing this bill at the human rights committee, the issue 
came up that if it only addresses the discrimination issue, the 
fundamental question troubling this House is why is there a 
preamble to somehow deal with the concept of family. There is 
something I need to know. Why is it, if the bill is to deal with the 
issue of discrimination, that the preamble tries to address the 
problem associated with family?
<P>
	The little booklet distributed with the legislation referred to the 
traditional family. The preamble refers to family. It does not say 
the family. It says family.
<P>
	There are different definitions. I am not a lawyer. I asked where I 
could look in the laws of Canada for the definition of family. I was 
surprised to learn that the definition of family cannot be found in a 
book anywhere. It is something that moves over time based on 
court decisions, based on social norms and values. Family is a very 
loose term at best. Very good arguments can be made on all sides 
about what constitutes family.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2404"> 2404 </A></B>
<P>
	In the committee hearings at the vote on the preamble, the 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway interrupted the proceedings and 
asked the chair if the officials could please tell us whether the word 
family in the preamble excludes homosexuals? It was a very 
specific question.
<P>
	The justice officials said the bill does not deal with family, it just 
deals with discrimination. The preamble is not relevant here. We 
will not confirm or deny whether homosexuals are included in 
family. It is not an issue here, yet we continue.
<P>
	The debate between the justice officials and the questioner 
carried on. The chair of the committee interrupted to say that it 
includes heterosexuals, bisexuals and homosexuals. Moments later 
in fairness and to be absolutely correct, the chair corrected herself 
and asked whether she could withdraw that remark.
<P>
	She is a former cabinet minister, someone who travels the world 
speaking on behalf of Canada on human rights issues. In the 
discussion on this very fundamental matter, she indicated that her 
emotional response was that family includes homosexuals, 
heterosexuals and bisexuals.
<P>
	It is clear to me that ordinary Canadians and even the courts may, 
as a result of a fuzzy term, interpret family as something other than 
the traditional heterosexual family.
<P>
	My understanding of the preamble is that it is trying to reach out 
to members of Parliament who are having difficulty with the 
concept of family. It is trying to reach out to suggest to them subtly 
that we are referring to the traditional heterosexual family. 
However, they are not prepared at this point to add that language.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	My dilemma is that I agree 100 per cent on the discrimination 
issue. I know that the vast majority of members would say that 
discrimination is wrong and unjust. However, there is another 
aspect. If the bill only deals with discrimination, why is there a 
preamble? Why is it necessary to explain something that has no 
relevance to the bill? This is a contradiction.
<P>
	Suggestions have been made that things like marriage and 
adoption are provincial issues so they cannot be talked about here. 
The decision about who can get married is a federal issue. The 
provinces have the responsibility to issue licences, but they do not 
determine who gets married. That is a relevant issue here.
<P>
	It has been stated many times that adoptions are a provincial 
issue, so they cannot be talked about here. However, there is a 
separate classification for adoption of foreign children coming into 
Canada which is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, adoption is a 
matter for this place to discuss.
<P>
	In my work as a member of Parliament I have talked often about 
the family. I have presented over 100 petitions dealing with 
discrimination of the family. I have  dealt with issues of taxation of 
the family. I have debated issues of immigration, the family 
reunification provisions. I have talked about the employment 
insurance bill which refers to family income credentials. I have 
referred in some speeches to OAS and the family income criteria. 
In this place we talk about family all the time. It is throughout all 
legislation.
<P>
	When I was at a convention a couple of weekends ago a 
resolution passed which said: ``We want to eliminate 
discrimination from Canadian legislation''. The fundamental point 
is that all legislation, all policy, is by its very nature discriminatory. 
Discrimination is not all bad. We all agree that there is unjust 
discrimination. It is the positive discrimination, or in American 
terms, affirmative action, where we discriminate in favour of the 
family because of its special status. We discriminate in favour of 
disabled people, aboriginal people, seniors just to name a few. 
Discrimination is not all unjust. It reflects societal norms and 
values.
<P>
	If this whole bill had only to do with discrimination the preamble 
should not be there. But in the wisdom of the drafters of the 
legislation it is there to try to appease a concern.
<P>
	It has gone so far, but it has not gone far enough. An attempt has 
been made in these motions once and for all to answer the question, 
which I have not heard answered yet, but to which I would like to 
hear an answer: Does family include homosexual couples? If the 
answer to that question is yes, it includes heterosexual, bisexual 
and homosexual families, then the issue is very clear.
<P>
	The member for Parkdale-High Park addressed the concern 
about whether other pieces of legislation will be affected. They will 
be because the definition of family must have been changed. 
Therefore, all legislation in Canada where there are references or 
inferences to family they must by definition be subject to court 
challenge. These are the issues.
<P>
	No one in this place will support anyone who discriminates 
against another person on any basis. We must be respectful of each 
other's positions. However, these other questions have crept in. 
They are very important issues and important questions.
<P>
	When I spoke at second reading, I said that I had questions and I 
still do. I mentioned that I still had concerns and I still do. I also 
mentioned that I had reasonable doubt about the consequences. I 
still continue to have reasonable doubt because of those issues.

	I hope members will carefully consider the ramifications. How 
do we separate this bill between unjust discrimination and the other 
issues that have been raised in this place?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will begin by 
stating plainly to everyone in the House and across the country my 
own personal position on discrimination.
<P>
	Discrimination on the basis of any personal characteristic is 
absolutely wrong. My party's position is exactly the same. We 
believe that every single individual in Canada should be treated 
equally. Those policies go through our native position, our position 
on Quebec and our position on the issue before us today, that of 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	Anticipating that this question would come up in the House, I 
was able to poll my constituents on the issue. I polled them in as 
plain and straightforward a manner as I could. I found that the 
constituents of Macleod, my region in southern Alberta, were 79 
per cent against including the undefined phrase of sexual 
orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	Reformers party wide have done polls and have found that 
whether or not the phrase was dignified by a specific definition, 
between 91 per cent and 93 per cent of our party members were 
against that inclusion.
<P>
	I must say, since this issue has come on the table, I have had a 
significant outpouring of letters. I will go over the few that came to 
me this morning on this issue.
<P>
	Steve from Okotoks is against Bill C-33. Sheila is absolutely 
against Bill C-33 and asked me to vote against it. Al wants me to 
know that homosexuals should not have any special status above 
anyone else and wants me to vote against Bill C-33. Greg is against 
Bill C-33 and asks me to keep up the good work. That is a little bit 
of a partisan comment, pardon me. Rod is against the bill and hopes 
that I am voting against it. Finally there is Lorne whose family is 
against the bill and hopes that I will vote against it.
<P>
	I will say publicly in this House that I will follow the wishes of 
my constituency, the more than 79 per cent who took the time to 
write to me and those who continue to write to me and ask why. 
They ask me why an enthusiastic opponent of discrimination, a 
physician and surgeon, somebody who has operated on, counselled 
with and has been closely associated with the homosexual 
community in my area would vote against this bill which is being 
purported as being nothing more than a bill against discrimination.
<P>
	I will say publicly that my association is also with family 
members who are homosexual. I have talked this over specifically 
with them. These were very personal discussions and they 
understand my position. My specific problem with this bill is that it 
will produce and allow a promotion of an unhealthy lifestyle, a 
behaviour that is unhealthy. I am speaking now as a physician with 
a physician's specific knowledge and experience.
<P>
	The specific problems promoting this lifestyle relate to HIV, gay 
bowel syndrome, increasing parasitic  infections, lowered life 
expectancy and finally, the one I have chosen to highlight today, an 
increase in hepatitis in Canada.
<P>
	The U.S. Centres for Disease Control in the first six months of 
1991 studied hepatitis in large urban centres in the U.S. They found 
in Denver 29 per cent of hepatitis A occurred in the gay 
community. Each figure I am giving to this House will be a specific 
percentage in the gay community in these large urban centres. In 
New York, 60 per cent of hepatitis A occurred in the gay 
community. In San Francisco, 50 per cent. In Toronto, 42 per cent. 
In Melbourne, Australia, 26 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	This occurs in a segment of the population in those urban 
communities where it is enhanced. The overall percentage in 
society is about 3 per cent and those communities can be as high as 
15 per cent. It is generally around 10 per cent. Look at the 
percentages in comparison to the numbers of individuals.
<P>
	I am very concerned that this bill will start a process whereby the 
gay lifestyle will be promoted in our schools. I have gone to a 
specific now. This specific comes from the Toronto board of 
education sexual orientation manual for teachers. In this document 
there is a statement to encourage teachers to speak openly and 
frankly about homosexuality, which is fine. That is excellent. It 
should be done. However, I am concerned about a specific process 
here.
<P>
	Teachers are given an example as to what they should say to the 
youth of our country. According to the manual this should be done 
by someone who is lesbian or gay. It should be someone with 
personal experience. It reads: ``I feel fine about being gay. I am in a 
long term committed relationship with my partner. This is the best 
thing for me. I think this would be great for anyone''. The 
suggestion that the gay lifestyle would be great for anyone 
promotes the gay lifestyle. I am quite concerned as a medical 
doctor that the promotion of an unhealthy lifestyle is not good for 
Canada.
<P>
	What about promotion in our educational system in a broader 
sense? I have a form from the University of Ottawa-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> I have a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I think this 
will be a very long day, but would it possible to remind Reform 
members to stick to the substance of the bill?
<P>
	Unless there was an interpretation problem, I understand that the 
hon. member who just spoke portrayed homosexual behaviour as 
unhealthy. He gave an example from his little book, but he was in 
fact making a value judgment.
<P>
	I wish to remind the House that the purpose of this bill is to stop 
people from discriminating against those with  a different sexual 
orientation. I feel that the comments made by the hon. member 
amount to a value judgment. I would like him to get back to the bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2406"> 2406 </A></B>
<P>
under consideration so we can talk about it. But we should not 
make value judgments.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member. As Speaker, I 
must tell the House that members very often digress from the bill 
under consideration. However, in this case, the comments made by 
the hon. member for Macleod deal rather directly, in my opinion, 
with the subject matter of this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have an application form 
from the University of Ottawa's law school. The application form 
has a section which states: ``I wish to self-identify as: a cultural, 
racial or linguistic minority person; a person with a physical or 
learning disability; a lesbian, gay man or bisexual''. It then goes on 
to say that the admission practices of the law school depend upon a 
quota system for those groups. That is another issue which I believe 
promotes an unhealthy lifestyle.
<P>
	There will be those who say I have stood in the House of 
Commons and have branded the homosexual community. I say 
simply that I wish to have my medical knowledge plainly displayed 
in the House of Commons. Doing otherwise is a great disservice to 
this country.
<P>
	There will be those who say that by my words I myself am 
discriminating. I wish only to have those people in Canada know 
that discrimination is wrong. There should be no discrimination 
whatever. However, to allow a quota system and to allow 
something to be promoted in our teaching system which is 
unhealthy is wrong, just as it is wrong to allow someone into our 
country who has a serious illness.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Gaspé wants to 
raise a point of order, but I hope it is not the same, because if it is-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé): </B>Mr. Speaker, to talk about ``promoting 
something which is unhealthy'', as the member just did, is making 
a discriminatory statement and it is precisely what the bill seeks to 
avoid. So we must-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Macleod has the 
floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, might I then finish my 
discourse today by saying that discrimination in Canada in any way 
shape or form is wrong. There should be no discrimination in this 
House of Commons toward those who are of a different lifestyle or 
different behaviour. To hide behind the term homophobic, to  allow 
a promotion that is unhealthy is far more wrong. In this House of 
Commons I believe in telling the truth. I believe in saying openly 
that the opening of this issue with the phrase in the bill is going to 
take us down a road we should not travel upon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I deal with the real issue, I wish to draw the 
attention of the Chair to the fact that expressions such as 
``unhealthy lifestyle'', which are used somewhat lightly by very 
light-headed Reformers, have no place in a debate like this one.
<P>
	I can accept that people say they do not understand 
homosexuality, or that they have not been in contact with 
homosexuals. However, I believe that Reformers should be a little 
more polite and certainly more careful in their comments. I do 
realize that this is asking a lot from people who have been very 
biased since they set foot here, this according to their own leader.
<P>
	Let us now turn our attention to the object of this debate. We are 
discussing a bill which seeks to prohibit any form of discrimination 
based on sexual orientation. All the amendments before us will 
only create confusion. They are intended by their authors, who 
have made a career of exploiting bias, to create an unhealthy, 
conservative and reactionary confusion. As we know, it is easy for 
certain parts of the country to exploit bias.
<P>
	First, the amendments moved in this House create confusion 
between the notions of couple and family. As an individual and a 
homosexual, I am certainly aware that two people, whether they are 
from the same sex or not, do not form a family. No one claimed that 
two people who do not have children form a family. Why is it that 
today we are seeing this nonsense, I would even say dishonesty, 
this attempt to confuse Canadians with two distinctly different 
concepts? Again, who wins in this House by continuing to exploit 
this confusion?
<P>
	For once and for all, let us try to be clear. What does the Minister 
of Justice say? He says: ``We know that there exists, in some work 
places, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation''. Who can 
forget that the reason the Minister of Justice is in the process of 
amending the Canadian Human Rights Act is because in 1990 an 
individual named Mr. Haig was kicked out of the Canadian Armed 
Forces because he admitted to his superior that he was a 
homosexual.
<P>
	This is discrimination and it is unnecessary to know whether Mr. 
Haig had a family, whether he had children, or from what sort of 
family he came. What we should be looking at right now is the 
discrimination that is still rampant in the work place, or any other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2407"> 2407 </A></B>
<P>
form of discrimination to which people receiving services from the 
federal government could be subjected.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	When I see, for example, the Reform member, who shall remain 
nameless, I believe she represents the riding of Port 
Moody-Coquitlam, when I see people who take their 
responsibilities as parliamentarians so lightly and set out to make 
amendments on marriage, the family, spouses, I repeat, I find that 
dishonest. I do not believe that serves the cause of human rights.
<P>
	As parliamentarians, we must be able to make distinctions 
between types and sexes. We have before us a bill, the purpose of 
which is to end discrimination. Of course, when they form a 
couple, and are refused certain benefits, income supplement, paid 
bereavement leave, and the like, certain courts of common law and 
certain administrative tribunals throughout the country have 
required employers to pay those benefits. Not because the people in 
question formed a family, but because they formed a couple.
<P>
	When will we in the House have the capacity, the open 
mindedness, to understand that there is no place for discrimination, 
whether a couple is homosexual or heterosexual. I trust that the 
hon. members in this House will grasp that.
<P>
	I want to ask the Reform members something. As you know, 
when it comes to human rights, they are way back in the horse and 
buggy days. What I would like to ask is this: Do they seriously 
believe that, for a homosexual, being in love is different from what 
it is for a heterosexual? Do these people believe that, as a citizen 
who pays taxes and is entitled to benefits, a person deserves to be 
deprived of those benefits because he is homosexual? Could there 
be two different tax systems in this country? Is there anyone among 
them who can stand up and state that an income tax return is 
different depending on whether it is filed by a homosexual or a 
heterosexual taxpayer? No one can.
<P>
	Just look at the insubstantial arguments being used. Those who 
are opposed, those who are presenting the amendments we are 
addressing at this time, have nothing more to say than to rehash the 
old traditionalist line, incapable of making a decision on legal 
merit, incapable of the slightest legal logic. These people know 
very well that their legal arguments do not hold up.
<P>
	When people are unable, like most of the people presenting 
amendments today, to rise in this House and argue on legal 
grounds, they haul out their prejudices. I repeat, they haul out 
prejudices which have only one aim and that is to sow confusion in 
the minds of Canadians and of Quebecers.
<P>
	I repeat, and mine I think is a respected voice in this House, no 
one among us is claiming that a man and a woman, or a woman and 
woman or a man and a man constitute a family if there are no 
children.
<P>
	I do not see the relevance at this point of members of the Reform 
Party or the ``Flintstone'' wing of the  Liberal Party making 
amendments that could, once again-you know how good they are 
at developing prejudices and using their particular talent of saying 
one thing and thinking another, creating confusion, whenever they 
have the opportunity. We would have hoped such a talent was on 
the way out.
<P>
	Correct me if I am wrong, but the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission is not headed by the Bloc Quebecois. It is an 
independent commission, comprising people with a public mandate 
accorded them by this House. They have executive power. How is it 
these people overlook the fact that, since 1979, the Commissioner 
of Human Rights has, report after report, year after year, in words 
that can leave no doubt, recommended an end be put to 
discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Discrimination has a very clear legal definition. It means 
treating someone differently because of a specific characteristic, a 
distinction that is not justified because, may I remind you, 
homosexuals also fill out their tax returns and send them to 
Revenue Canada. There are not two kinds of taxation, two kinds of 
money, two kinds of tax returns in this country.
<P>
	There are some concerns that discrimination may prevent us 
from treating people differently at the fiscal level. These people 
cannot understand. Both their minds and their hearts are closed. 
They would rather shut themselves off in their mean, cheap, narrow 
little worlds and try to make fun of us because we are different.
<P>
	That time is over. The majority of people throughout Canada and 
Quebec, whatever their religion, their profession and their vision of 
family, share our view that, as parliamentarians, we must do all we 
can to end discrimination. One day, those who continue to 
discriminate will have to account to Canadians and Quebecers. 
They will have to explain their actions. And I know that the 
Canadian people will judge them quite harshly because most of 
them understand that discrimination is unacceptable.
<P>
	Again, this is what this bill is all about. The Minister of Justice 
was very clear in committee; he was very clear when he made a 
statement at second reading here in this House. The purpose of this 
bill is to end discriminatory practices. True, ending discriminatory 
practices means accepting differences.
<P>
	What will we, as parliamentarians, have to do? What will the 
Canadian people have to do to make this hard-core group 
understand they are not doing anyone any favours by continuing to 
convey a message that is no longer necessary, that borders on 
hatred, that suggests we must be guilty just because we are 
different? That is what the amendments moved by the Reformers 
and some-thankfully not all-members of the government 
majority are all about. What is it that bothers them about  adding in 
a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2408"> 2408 </A></B>
<P>
statutory provision that no discrimination shall be made on the 
basis of sexual orientation?
<P>
	Are there members in this House or among the motions' 
sponsors who are not comfortable with their sexuality? Are there 
members who are unable to imagine that someone could be 
attracted to someone of the same sex? People who are at peace with 
themselves, happy to be who they are, well adjusted and generous 
do not mind that others are different.
<P>
	Let us try to understand why members are unable to accept that 
others can be different in that way. Why are they feeling threatened 
to the point of having to band together, forming some kind of a 
watch guard? They band together, get together, make statements, 
present petitions, then develop an action plan, a plan whose sole 
objective is to undermine the right that individuals have in this 
society to be different.
<P>
	Let me tell you what one witness told us in committee when we 
studied Bill C-33 at report stage.
<P>
	We have been told that, in Canada-not just in Quebec, Prince 
Edward Island or Western Canada, but across Canada-two million 
people commit suicide every year. In the 15 to 24 age group, 
suicide is the second leading cause of death, second only to traffic 
accidents. Sixty per cent of the young people between the ages of 
15 and 24 who commit suicide kill themselves because they are 
having problems coming to terms with their sexual orientation. 
This is what we were told by a University of Calgary paediatrician, 
who is represented in this House by a Reform member, which only 
adds insult to injury.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Will these people finally realize that this bill before us is 
designed to ensure that discrimination will stop, thus making 
people realize that, while being different, they have their place in 
society-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, about 
three days ago my office received a fax from a young man from 
New Brunswick who said please support Bill C-33. He is a declared 
heterosexual who spent a summer with a group of people, the 
majority of whom are homosexual. He said in his fax that he was 
discriminated against by that group.
<P>
	The bill talks about sexual orientation, not about homosexual 
orientation or heterosexual orientation. It simply states sexual 
orientation. It seems anything we put the word sex into these days 
perks up everybody's ears for some reason.
<P>
	There has been a lot of debate about the threat to the family from 
the bill. Do we think for one minute the family will ever be 
threatened by anything done in this Parliament or in any legislature 
around the world? The family is a natural occurrence. It has come 
together for thousands and thousands of years for obvious reasons,  
for mutual support, comfort and procreation. The word family 
simply does not have to be defined; it assumes a heterosexual 
family.
<P>
	We can call two people of the same sex living together a family, 
pretend it is a family for those purposes. Think back to the historic 
family and why it exists. The family is not in jeopardy from 
anything that can be legislated or argued in the House. We should 
make that clear. My family will continue for generations to come, I 
hope, as it has for generations past. It has survived religious 
persecution to the Spanish Inquisition and everything in between, 
including Oliver Cromwell, and it still exists and it is still strong.
<P>
	I ask those people who feel their families are threatened to look 
at themselves, at their own values and deal with them personally.
<P>
	This country was founded by people who came here from 
Europe, by the Judaeo Christian ethic. The values of that Judaeo 
Christian ethic, found in most of the great religions of the world, 
were the foundation. In that ethic is taught tolerance, understanding 
and forgiveness. While some of the pronouncements of the Bible 
do not approve of certain things, if we read the whole thing it states 
very clearly that the judgment of those things belongs not to us at 
all; we are admonished not to stand in judgment.
<P>
	My late father grew up in cabbagetown in Toronto and became a 
member of the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews during the 
years when it was not a very popular thing to do. How ludicrous it 
seems that there was the same kind of fear at that time as has been 
expressed by some members of this House today. On Sunnyside 
Beach in Toronto there were signs which read: No dogs or Jews 
allowed. He became part of that movement which brought society a 
little further forward and brought to an end that open 
discrimination against Jews in Toronto.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	This bill, this particular amendment to the human rights act 
simply adds one more step in the progress of a country that is 
looked upon as being generous, tolerant and appreciative of the 
other person. It is right and fitting that we should support this and 
not succumb to the fear that is being generated sometimes in the 
name of religion or particularly in the name of religion.
<P>
	I respect everyone's point of view on this. I happen to have one 
point of view and my friends, some in my own caucus and some 
across the way, have another point of view. For me, this is not a 
moral issue. It is simply an issue of human rights. It is simply an 
issue of the gradual progress of our society toward something a 
little better than it was yesterday. There is nothing we can do in this 
House that is going to be threatening to any one of our families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2409"> 2409 </A></B>
<P>
	If we talk about sexual orientation, and refer to homosexuals 
which some members have done specifically although the bill 
works both ways, I would simply like to ask my friends: Who are 
homosexuals anyway? Who are they? They can be your brother, 
your sister, your second cousin, a friend, or a relative of the family 
down the street.
<P>
	The argument is always made that homosexuality is a chosen 
lifestyle. If those who believe that would talk to some homosexuals 
for a while, they would find that it is not the case. To choose that 
lifestyle is not necessarily the popular way to go. Homosexuals do 
not represent a majority of the population. As a matter of fact they 
represent a very small minority.
<P>
	Indeed the quality of our civilization will be judged in years and 
generations to come as to how we treat our minorities. A few 
hundred years ago the attitude toward someone who had mental 
problems or who was born with disabilities was very different from 
what it is today. There were places called insane asylums. I think 
every one of us would find it offensive today to consider that those 
were proper things to maintain.
<P>
	We changed our thinking through the accumulation of 
knowledge and through understanding to try to-

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to point out an obvious contradiction in what 
the last speaker said.
<P>
	He began his speech by saying that the family will not change no 
matter what we do in this House. He went on to conclude that 
society is changing, that it is making progress and that we should 
support those changes.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the remarks he made. If his arguments are 
valid, it means he would logically support all of the amendments. 
He would have no problem with the protection of the family and 
making sure that this does not have an effect on the family.
<P>
	The events of the last week remind me a lot of a little lizard in 
the South Pacific when I was there in 1988-89. It was called a 
gecko. The gecko had a very unusual escape mechanism. When a 
person went to catch it, if they were not quick enough, the gecko 
had the amazing capacity to detach its tail. The person would be 
left with a wildly wriggling tail in their hand and the gecko would 
escape. The person's attention was diverted from the main stage, 
just as many Liberals are managing to divert attention from the 
main issue before Parliament. With their wildly wriggling tongues 
accusing Reform of being anti-gay and discriminatory, they are 
diverting attention away from what they are really doing in the 
House.
<P>
	Canadians will eventually realize that their attention is being 
diverted from what is happening here by some of  the other issues 
that have been raised such as name calling and other tactics the 
Liberals are using. Canadians will eventually see through that. Just 
as a person realizes after a while when they look at the wildly 
wriggling tail that the gecko has escaped, Canadians will realize 
that the Liberals are trying to escape detection on what they are 
doing here.
<P>
	The main issue before Parliament is the inclusion of sexual 
orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the 
undemocratic nature in which it is being foisted upon an 
unsuspecting Canadian population. Debate is being stifled by 
invoking time allocation at every stage. I submit that is probably 
being done so that Canadians will not become too excited about 
this and become aware of what is happening. It is hurriedly being 
shoved through Parliament before people can realize what is 
happening.
<P>
	By the way, this is not a Liberal election commitment. It is 
simply a pledge the Prime Minister made to the gay community in 
Vancouver. I wonder why it carries more weight than his GST 
promise.
<P>
	Let me put this discussion into the context it should be in. 
Canada may recover in time from the huge financial mess it is in, 
but the damage that will be caused to Canadian society by changes 
made this week to the Canadian Human Rights Act will haunt us 
for many generations to come. Why? The unethical downloading of 
debt on to our children may be corrected in a generation or two, I 
hope. However, the irreparable harm caused by creating virtually 
equal status for gay and lesbian marriages with others will take a 
lot longer to heal.
<P>
	We will destroy the very fabric of society by allowing the courts 
to redefine marriage. Gays and lesbians will be able to adopt 
children. If we do not believe that to be true, we ought to approve 
all of the amendments that are being put forward. If we are so sure 
that is not going to happen, we should approve these amendments.
<P>
	All the studies I have seen indicate that children develop best 
when they live with their father and mother. The social crisis we are 
presently in will be compounded if we approve this legislation. We 
must encourage parents to make lifelong commitments to the care 
and raising of children. Society's acceptance of impermanent 
relationships has caused a great many problems. Many of the 
problems experienced in education and justice stem from this.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	While the public and media look at Sheila Copps and the 
comments of some Reform MPs, the Liberals are creating changes 
to society that will cause future generations to ask who was asleep 
at the wheel when we hit this rock. While the tongues are wildly 
wriggling, the Liberals will escape the close scrutiny of what has 
happened in Parliament this month.
<P>
	Remember that including sexual orientation in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act will cause the value of  traditional marriage to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2410"> 2410 </A></B>
<P>
erode even further. It is not just me saying that; I am reflecting the 
views of very many Canadians.
<P>
	The main point that needs to be made in this whole debate on 
including sexual orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act is 
that it will lead to the redefinition of the family in Canada. Just as 
in algebra where <I>a</I> leads to <I>b</I>, or as in geometry with the logical 
progression of arguments, one can make the argument that this will 
lead to the redefinition of the family. Even the highest court in the 
land has stated that it will have a very negative effect on the basic 
structural unit of society.
<P>
	We as parliamentarians are responsible to look at the big picture, 
the overall effect legislation will have on society. The Liberal 
government assures us that it does not intend to have these negative 
consequences, but good intentions do not ensure good results. The 
court or judge looking at the law reads the letter of the law. They 
look at what it actually says. They do not read the Liberals' 
speaking notes.
<P>
	One of my colleagues across the way said that he was assured 
this would not happen. Those assurances are not written into the 
legislation. These amendments would have to be approved in order 
for those assurances to be genuine. Therefore, I urge all members 
to approve these amendments.
<P>
	The speeches being made by the Liberals are no more credible 
than the promises they made on the GST and NAFTA. We have no 
hold on those assurances that this will not affect the family. I have 
grave concerns about the effect this legislation will have if it 
remains unamended. The amendments Reform proposes try to limit 
some of the negative effects the legislation will have. Homosexual 
couples should not be given marriage-like status.
<P>
	The Most Reverend Adam Exner of the Archdiocese of 
Vancouver makes this point which I believe reflects the views of 
many Canadians: ``Canadians that are morally opposed to 
homosexual behaviour must have their rights protected''. We as 
Reformers have tried to make that point in the big kerfuffle of the 
past week. We should not divide society into groups. We should not 
have any groups in the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Most 
Reverend Adam Exner goes on to say that homosexual couples 
should not be given marital or marriage-like status.
<P>
	Now let me quote from Reform's interim party policy which has 
been approved by our caucus and the democratically elected 
council of the Reform Party:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party affirms the equality of every individual before and under the 
law and the right of every individual to live freely within the limits of the law and 
with the full protection of the law. Under the charter of rights and freedoms, 
homosexuals have the same rights and privileges as all other persons in Canada. 
The Reform caucus supports the continued protection of these rights based on the 
position of each human being, not on his or her sexual orientation. For these 
reasons, the Reform  caucus opposes as unnecessary and inadvisable the 
government's announced intention to include sexual orientation as a prohibited 
ground of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act and in other 
legislation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The real question is: What will be the long term effect of 
including sexual orientation as a prohibited category in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act?
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Many other speakers have already made excellent points, but the 
one which concerns me most is the one concerning the status or the 
structure of the basic unit in society. That is the point I would like 
to make and I hope I have an opportunity at a later time to make it 
further.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to join in this debate on amendments to Bill C-33 and Bill C-33 
itself.
<P>
	I want to make it categorically clear that I support amendments 
to the Canadian Human Rights Act which will provide for the 
inclusion of sexual orientation in the list of those grounds on which 
discrimination must not take place.
<P>
	I believe we can all agree in the House that in an ideal world and 
in an ideal country we would not need a human rights code because 
everybody would be treated equally. There would be no worry in 
the courts or elsewhere that minorities would be discriminated 
against.
<P>
	In spite of the reality that Canada is the best country in the world 
by many measures, we still have discrimination. Therefore we 
must have a code. If some of the comments by some members of 
the House in the last week are any evidence, it is sadly a fact that 
we must have a code. I believe it is time we included in that code 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	This is an issue of human rights. I respect my colleagues who see 
this as a moral issue. They have come to that decision and that 
place for their own very good reasons, and I do not dispute that. We 
can disagree but that does not change my mind that this is 
fundamentally a human rights issue.
<P>
	I will include in my remarks excerpts from an editorial in a 
community newspaper in my riding of Algoma. I will not read the 
whole text into the record. I invite any of my colleagues who have 
not seen this full editorial to contact me and I will be pleased to 
share it with them.
<P>
	From the Manitoulin <I>Expositor</I>, Wednesday, March 27, an 
editorial entitled ``Discrimination Irrational'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Those who would argue against adding such a right to the human rights act 
(where it will join bans against discrimination on the basis of age, gender and 
race) will cite, for example, the contentious issue the Ontario New Democratic 
Party raised when, as Ontario's governing party, it introduced legislation that 
would have recognized in law same gender relationships and, in particular, 
would have opened the doors to same gender family adoptions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2411"> 2411 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It was this point-adoptions-that divided MPPs in Ontario from both the 
Liberal and New Democratic Party benches. The Ontario Progressive 
Conservatives were universally allied against the legislation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Prime Minister can look forward to the same thing because those 
opposed to the new legislation will raise the same sorts of issues-like 
adoptions-to argue in favour of some a-wink-and-a-nod type of 
discrimination: it isn't official, but it's there anyway.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It must be pointed out that most of the objections will be red herrings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We will hear arguments that the official sanctioning of the right of a 
homosexual person not to be discriminated against (quite a concept, when one 
thinks about it) will somehow be undermining Canadian society and moral 
values; that this will, in some fashion and by implication, lead to more 
homosexual relationships.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is hard to imagine, in view of the extremely negative feelings mainstream 
society holds toward homosexuals, that people of this persuasion or orientation 
would actively choose their lifestyle.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And while it is a sensitive issue to suggest that homosexuality can't possibly 
be a matter of choice, but innate, it seems to most-that this must be the case; 
Darwin and biology teach us that, for any species, the most basic instinct is to 
preserve itself through reproduction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is clearly not a priority for those people who choose same sex partners, 
perhaps through free will but surely most probably through their own particular 
chemistry, the point is: they're a part of our society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>They are a minority, to be sure. But they're with us and, just as the United 
Church of Canada bravely determined that being a homosexual person was in 
and of itself not a good reason to be denied ordination, so discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation is simply not a good idea in the Canadian society that 
we think is special in the world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most of us will continue to be put off by the idea of same sex relationships. 
That, like homosexuality itself, is very probably some sort of instinctive 
response. That's the way we are probably made.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But we also have the advantage of being sensible beings, capable of rising 
above our irrational fears and responses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Prime Minister's support for changes to the human rights act will not do 
the heterosexual majority any harm, and will do the homosexual minority much 
good.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	I applaud the editor of the Manitoulin <I>Expositor</I> for what I think 
are very insightful remarks.
<P>
	In the few opportunities I have had to travel abroad in my life, 
like members of the House, I have travelled in other countries with 
great pride. We know Canadians are tolerant, understanding and 
caring. We have opened our country to people from around the 
world. I am much more proud as a Canadian to say we tolerate 
minorities in our society, including homosexuals, than to say to 
those outside our country that we are intolerant of homosexuals.
<P>
	That many of my colleagues and some Canadians will raise 
issues such as marriage, adoption and same sex benefits as part of 
this discussion really is simply part of fair debate from that side of 
the argument. However, I simply do not buy the argument that 
marriage, adoption and same sex benefits are relevant to the 
amendment. They are essentially private sector or provincial 
matters.
<P>
	What we are doing by this amendment is ensuring that in the 
federal workplace and in those industries regulated by the federal 
government discrimination will not be allowed on the basis of 
sexual orientation in employment and in the provision of goods and 
services.
<P>
	Eight of the provinces and territories have already dealt with this 
issue in their provincial or territorial codes. It is a matter of the 
federal government's actually catching up with other jurisdictions 
in the country. I am quite proud that the government is showing 
leadership and is moving forward on a commitment that has been a 
commitment of this party for nearly 20 years. It is about time we 
get on with it.
<P>
	I fully respect those of my colleagues who see this as a moral 
issue. I do not. To me this is nothing more or less than a human 
rights issue. We are not changing the Criminal Code. Illegal 
behaviour before this amendment will be illegal behaviour after 
this amendment.
<P>
	We can speculate ad infinitum or ad nauseam on what the 
consequences might be. That we can do with any piece of 
legislation that comes before the House. We can speculate. That is 
fair. However, it is for those of us in the House to judge whether the 
speculation is reasonable. In my view that speculation is not 
reasonable, but I respect those who would use that in fair debate.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	I do not feel in any way haunted by what will happen as a result 
of this amendment. If anything bad were to happen, why did we not 
see that as a consequence of the changes made in the provincial 
legislatures when they made changes to their codes? I do not recall 
hearing any terrible things that happened when those codes were 
changed over the last 10, 15 and 20 years. I feel strongly that no 
such consequence will be realized in this case.
<P>
	I caution my colleagues to measure their words carefully when 
they argue against this, not to suggest the sky will fall because of 
this amendment, and to remember this is not about creating a 
special status for any group of people; this is about protecting the 
fundamental human rights of a minority in our society.
<P>
	We have seen evidence of it in the last week already in the 
message the courts and Canadians get through the human rights 
code that intolerance of any minority is not acceptable in society. 
We are a modern society which is the envy of the world.
<P>
	I encourage my colleagues, even those who think this is the 
wrong way to go, to reconsider their point of view and do the right 
thing.
<P>

<B><A NAME="2412"> 2412 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a privilege to speak to Bill C-33 and oppose it.
<P>
	Countless tens of thousands of petitions in opposition to this 
have come through my office and through many offices in the 
country and yet the government still pursues the road of its intent. I 
compliment those members opposite who are opposing this bill and 
have the courage to oppose this bill in the face of what seems to be 
a strong arm of a governing majority party.
<P>
	I will address a concern of what is wrong with our country, the 
concerns I have as an individual, the concerns of people I grew up 
with and the people I live with. Where is Canada heading?
<P>
	We see employment equity programs brought on by the 
government, multiculturalism programs, the official languages bill, 
gay rights bills and other such socially engineered bills. I have 
difficulty with the fact that if we oppose any aspects of any one of 
these bills we are immediately identified as a bigot, a racist and 
homophobic. Not only that, but if one or two or three people among 
us say something that happens to be a bit untoward in meaning, the 
whole works of us today are considered to be the same.
<P>
	I find the problem most concerning. For instance, it can be a boy 
scout group, a church group or any group. All we need is one or two 
members to say something wrong and the whole group is identified 
as such. That is a sad commentary on where Canada is headed.
<P>
	When I headed the posse in the Reform Party I observed a 
number of blatantly poor grant payments made to organizations. 
One was a $30,000 grant to study the Tzu Tzu dynasty, an ancient 
Chinese dynasty.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	A comment was made when we observed this which at the time 
seemingly was humourous. The Vancouver <I>Province</I>, which is at 
best a Liberal rag, said that because I issued this news release I am 
a racist. It has since two or three times said I am a racist because I 
made these comments.
<P>
	In this country if something is said, even if it is minor, even if it 
is not considered by many thousands of people to be in any way 
slander, it only takes one group, and the media is just as bad as the 
rest, to say racist and everybody in this country ducks, goes into 
hiding.
<P>
	Now we enter into the gay rights debate. If you disagree with gay 
rights, you are homophobic. You dare not say anything about gay 
rights in this country, otherwise you are homophobic. I feel sorry 
for some of the stronger people opposite who stuck up for what 
they believed and are categorized as such.
<P>
	Let me just give members an idea of where I come from. I guess 
I can explain it best by reading from a 1993 Supreme Court ruling 
which stated that a gay man did not have his charter rights violated 
when he was denied bereavement leave in the wake of his partner's 
death. Okay, decision made by the judge.
<P>
	The chief justice at the time wrote that the refusal of the benefit 
could not be condemned on the basis of family status without 
introducing into the Canadian Human Rights Act the prohibition 
which Parliament specifically decided not to include in the act, 
namely the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	Indeed, the judge goes on to say that if Parliament had decided to 
include sexual orientation in the list of prohibited grounds of 
discrimination, his interpretation of the phrase family status might 
have been entirely different. Here a judge is saying that when the 
Liberal government puts in sexual orientation as a form of 
discrimination, he will judge otherwise.
<P>
	The justice minister knows that. The Prime Minister knows that. 
The government knows that. In fact, so do a number of members 
opposite who caught the government up on these statements. The 
government stays mute on the issue, hoping to get the bill through 
as fast as it can with as little damage as possible. In that way 
perhaps it can get more votes from the gay community than any 
other party, stay in power and we will still have social engineering 
at its worst.
<P>
	It is a vicious circle. It is a sad commentary about what is 
happening in the country. Do not dare oppose it because you will be 
called homophobic. Do not stand up for what you believe in, you 
could be a racist.
<P>
	I do not know how many times I have been called a racist 
because I had two individuals deported from this country. I fought 
hard over a year and a half to do that. One was from El Salvador 
and the other one was from Laos. Never mind the fact that one 
helped murder a kid in my neighbourhood. Never mind the fact that 
the other had 12 criminal convictions and had raped twice. Never 
mind those facts. By fighting for the rights of my community to 
help the police to help victims I was called a racist. My family 
takes great exception to that. So do my friends. So do I and I guess 
since my mother is watching so does she.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	If we do not agree with the governing party, everybody else is 
something different. They are racists, bigots and homophobics. I 
hope Canada goes in a better direction because we deserve better 
than that.
<P>
	Finally, it was no mistake that the turn of events which hit the 
Reform Party last week happened. When you are the mosquito of 
politics stinging the political elephant, then everything comes 
against you when you take on the system, including the media 
engineers and their  politicians. The House can be guaranteed that 
everybody who supports us and those who are considering us will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2413"> 2413 </A></B>
<P>
understand we are here to fight, we are here to stay and we are not 
going to be budged off of that mark.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am extremely proud to rise 
today to speak in support of this measure.
<P>
	Bill C-33 will add sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Introducing 
and passing this bill, which I look forward to with so many of my 
colleagues, will fulfil a longstanding commitment of the Liberal 
Party that goes back many years. It is consistent with countless 
resolutions of this great Liberal Party and it has overwhelming 
support within this Parliament and across this great land.
<P>
	The Liberal Party that I joined 20 years ago was a party noted for 
its defence of human rights and its advocacy on behalf of 
minorities. I am proud that the day has arrived where we are 
debating this measure which is long overdue.
<P>
	The bill does not take anything away from anyone else. It does 
not create special status but it responds to a reality. Gays and 
lesbians are discriminated against in our society because of what 
they are.
<P>
	I guess as a Jew I have a special sensitivity to other minorities 
because of my people's history. The Jewish people have known 
discrimination, persecution and worse in this century and 
throughout the centuries, too often simply because of who they are 
or what they are perceived to be. I attach great significance to what 
we are doing here today. I think Jews have a special responsibility 
to stand up in support of a human rights measure such as this.
<P>
	I am very pleased that the two principal organizations which 
speak for the Jewish community, namely B'nai Brith Canada with 
its fine record in defence of human rights with the fine work of the 
League of Human Rights and the Canadian Jewish Congress with 
its fine work as well in this field. They both stand strongly behind 
the government's efforts in amending the human rights act to 
prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.
<P>
	There are other parallels perhaps to the experience of the Jewish 
people that may be missed by some of my colleagues.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Perhaps some of us have a special sensitivity, but I get concerned 
when I hear people in this great country-our brothers, our sisters, 
our friends, our acquaintances-referred to in ways that make them 
seem as outsiders. Those kinds of words have a dehumanizing 
effect.
<P>
	Eli Weisel said it so eloquently and it is a lesson for all of us. 
``The holocaust began with words''. I would rather be part of a 
party, part of a government that uses words to enrich, to enlighten, 
to inform and to defend than to use words to tear down, to attack, to 
isolate, to denigrate.
<P>
	Some people have said that this provision threatens the family. It 
does no such thing. Some say that gays and lesbians or their 
lifestyles attack and undermine the family. I want to pause to speak 
about a couple that came to see me in my office recently, a mother 
and father roughly the age of my parents. They spoke about a child 
of theirs who is gay. The pain I saw in the father's eyes when I first 
met him was not pain over this child and his situation but rather the 
pain in knowing there were other Canadians who would want to 
treat his son differently because of it.
<P>
	When we speak about what might happen to the family as a 
result what is being suggested this bill gives rise to, we are 
overlooking the hurt that is causing in families. Let us remember 
who we are talking about. We are talking about people. We are 
talking about individuals. We are talking about human beings. We 
are not talking about some mysterious person out there who we do 
not know. We are talking about friends, colleagues, brothers, 
sisters, sons and daughters. They have families too.
<P>
	There is not much more to say. This is a very important matter. I 
look forward to hearing the interventions of other colleagues, 
although some may disagree.
<P>
	Gays and lesbians have not asked us to recognize them, as some 
have suggested in this House. Recognition is not something that we 
bestow or take away. Gays and lesbians have their own dignity. All 
they ask from the government and what it will provide is 
recognition of their right to equality under the laws of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank the House for the opportunity to speak at 
report stage of Bill C-33, a bill that was introduced in this House 
scant hours ago and is being railroaded through because of some 
concern by the Liberal government that Canadians may find out the 
facts about this bill. It is afraid that the dissent within its own party 
may grow as Canadians realize there is absolutely no need for Bill 
C-33, that the opposition to it is significant and growing.
<P>
	Members opposite have spoken in support of the bill but they 
have omitted a very significant factor in their speeches by saying 
that all good Canadians should support this bill and that all 
members in the House should support it. They have ignored the 
public that is speaking out in opposition to Bill C-33.
<P>
	I want to let the House know what is happening in the real world 
that is Canada. My office has received  hundreds of 
communications in the past few days since Bill C-33 was 
introduced in the House. The ratio is about 200:1 in opposition. Of 
course that does not matter to the Liberals. They have to railroad it 
through. They had better do it quick. If there is that kind of 
opposition building, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2414"> 2414 </A></B>
<P>
we certainly do not want the opposition to gain momentum. We 
want to squelch this opposition, nip it in the bud. We will railroad 
the piece of legislation through.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	On my answering machine over the weekend the calls were 
unanimous in their request that I as their member of Parliament 
oppose Bill C-33. There was not one call received suggesting I 
support Bill C-33.
<P>
	People have said to me please vote against Bill C-33. Prior to 
that, they asked me to vote against Bill C-41. They opposed that 
because of the undefined phrase sexual orientation included in the 
bill.
<P>
	I was chatting with another member of Parliament who said his 
office was receiving 15 phone calls every 10 minutes. His staff 
members did not have time to eat yesterday. They were being 
deluged with calls, 90 per cent of which were asking their member 
to oppose Bill C-33.
<P>
	To the members opposite it does not matter. They are on a 
mission that they want to succeed. They have made some 
statements, some claims that this legislation is necessary.
<P>
	Even if Canadians are strongly opposing it and the opposition is 
increasing, it does not matter. That is all the more requirement that 
they move with haste and make sure the bill is passed before the 
opposition can increase.
<P>
	Members opposite say they have no agenda other than the 
prevention of discrimination against the gay and lesbian element of 
society. They say ``that's it, we do not want to see anything happen 
beyond the primary principle. This does not mean there will be 
spousal benefits for gays and lesbians. It does not mean that we will 
give them adoption rights. We are not expanding the term sexual 
orientation to include currently illegal activities. We would never 
do that. Why don't you get your head on straight? Why would you 
even suggest such a thing?''
<P>
	We are debating Group No. 1 of the amendments to the bill. 
These amendments clarify those issues. They would reinforce what 
the members opposite are saying. We would think members 
opposite would be clamouring, saying ``that is a good idea, we 
want to support those amendments, that reinforces what we on our 
side of the House have been saying''.
<P>
	They do not do that. By not agreeing with the amendments put 
forward to this bill they are increasing the suspicion of 
Canadians. I will get more calls in my office. I will see more 
opposition to this piece of  legislation and other pieces of 
legislation like it that will follow.
<P>
	People are saying they cannot trust the Liberals. We could not 
trust them on the GST. Their word did not mean anything. Why 
should we trust them on this bill? Why should we trust them when 
they say this is not a stepping stone to spousal benefits for same sex 
couples? Why should we believe them when they say this will not 
provide same sex couples with the right to adopt children? They do 
not tell us the truth. They just play it by ear. They kind of go along 
and make it up as they go. Whatever seems convenient to the lobby 
group that last talked to them is what they will try to put forward in 
legislation
<P>
	I was on a talk show with a Liberal MP, the member for 
Saskatoon-Dundurn. Several callers were concerned about the 
infringement this legislation might create on religious freedom. 
The member for Saskatoon-Dundurn said: ``I am a good Catholic. 
This does not have any impact whatsoever on religious freedom. 
That is a red herring''.
<P>
	If that is true, why do the Liberal members not support the 
amendments that would protect religious freedom? One would 
think they would be clamouring for it. One would think they would 
be jumping up in their seats and saying they support these 
amendments, these are good amendments, but they do not.
<P>
	We are left to ask why they will not support the amendments. 
What is their agenda? What are their plans? They have not told us 
in the past. They certainly did not tell us the truth about the GST. 
They mislead Canadians about the GST.
<P>
	Canadians are wondering what they will do with this piece of 
legislation. What is their agenda? What is their mission? What are 
they trying to accomplish in the long run?
<P>
	If the claims they are making are true, why do they not say so by 
supporting the amendments put forward on Bill C-33? Why do they 
not put their actions where their mouths are? Why do they not stand 
up and vote for some of these amendment? Where is their courage?
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I am tired of these members saying it does not mean all these 
things and yet they will not support the amendments. That is 
fundamentally wrong and it brings dishonour to the House. I am 
very disappointed in members opposite who will not support 
amendments that clarify the very points they have been trying to 
make. That is intellectually dishonest and wrong. It brings 
disrepute on the House of Commons.
<P>
	The Liberals say the purpose of Bill C-33 is to prevent 
discrimination against gays and lesbians. Reform opposes 
discrimination against all Canadians. I do not see that 
discrimination is epidemic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2415"> 2415 </A></B>
<P>
in Canada. Maybe I have been  missing something. Maybe the 
member for Saskatoon-Dundurn knows something I do not and 
that is why he is not listening to the hundreds of calls he is 
receiving in his office and opposing this bill.
<P>
	I have not not been reading in the papers that discrimination is 
epidemic among the gay and lesbian community. However, even if 
it were we have laws in place that can be enforced. Even if 
someone discriminates against a gay or lesbian we have something 
called the charter of rights. Section 15(1) of the charter applies to 
all Canadians except gays and lesbians? No, that is not what it 
states. The charter applies to all Canadians. Everyone who is a 
Canadian is covered under the charter: ``Every individual is equal 
before the law and has the right to equal protection and equal 
benefit of the law without discrimination''.
<P>
	Angus Reid did a poll of Canadians which said right now the 
charter of rights reads that every individual is equal before the law 
and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law 
without discrimination. The question was ``do you believe 
additional legislation is required to protect the gay and lesbian 
group in society?''
<P>
	If Canadians knew this was present in the charter of rights and 
freedoms 90 per cent of Canadians would oppose Bill C-33. They 
would categorically say it was not required.
<P>
	I close by reading a letter I have written to those who have 
inquired about my position on this bill. This will also clarify the 
record for the House.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am opposed to the bill for the following reasons:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I support the equality of all Canadians regardless of race, language, culture, 
religion, gender or sexual orientation, not because of these defining 
characteristics.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is also Reform's position.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe all Canadians have ample protection against discrimination with the 
laws that are already in place.</BLOCKQUOTE>

important bill, particularly after the speech of the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some members have suggested there is no need for the law being 
proposed in this bill. I submit that if they have any doubt as to the 
evidence required in support of such  a law they need only look at 
the legions of cases that have been brought before the Human 
Rights Commission of Canada, many of which have been 
subsequently appealed to the courts of the country, dealing with 
acts of discrimination perpetrated against members of minority 
communities; not only ones based on sexual orientation but others.
<P>
	Discrimination is rife and rampant in Canada. I acknowledge 
that we have made significant gains in the last 10 years, but there is 
a continuing problem with discrimination. This bill, in amending 
the Canadian Human Rights Act, seeks to bring to an end that 
discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	We have seen evidence of that discrimination in the statements 
made recently by some members of the Reform Party outside the 
House. I will not go into those in detail. However, those statements 
have forced the leader of the Reform Party into issuing a manifesto, 
although a little late perhaps. I will quote from it because I think his 
reasons for opposing this bill and those he has put forward for his 
party are not reasonable or accurate. I quote from this morning's 
edition of the Ottawa Citizen:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Reformers are opposing the government's gay rights bill, not because they 
favour discrimination, but because they favour a better approach to prevention 
of discrimination. The party supports affirming the equality of all Canadians 
before the law rather than protecting that equality through the creation of 
special categories of Canadians with group rights. But the inability-or 
unwillingness-of some Reform MPs to support this principled reason for 
opposing Bill C-33 is at the root of the party's immediate problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am sure even the member for Halifax finds the last statement a 
little hard to swallow. Some of us find difficulty with the first part 
as well, and I will deal with that.
<P>
	What is the leader of the Reform Party proposing in terms of 
affirmation of equality for all Canadians? What is this chimera 
being put before us as a basis for changing this law?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is hard to understand, isn't it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member says I do not understand it. I am 
about to explain it to him because it is clear this is an excuse to 
cover the bigotry that has been displayed by his colleagues in the 
House. It is a sick excuse.
<P>
	What we have to look at in this case is that their notion of 
equality is to repeal the Canadian Human Rights Act and make a 
declaration that everyone is equal. I point out, as I have on 
numerous occasions in the House, the human rights code does not 
grant special rights to special groups. What the human rights code 
declares and what this bill will declare is that there may not be 
discrimination on certain bases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2416"> 2416 </A></B>
<P>
	The bases include things like sex, age and colour. Those words 
are in there and they are neutral. They are neutral in the human 
rights code. In other words, they give rights to both men and 
women when sex is talked about. When sexual orientation is 
mentioned it gives rights to bisexuals, to lesbians, to gays and to 
heterosexuals. These rights are across the board. They apply to 
everyone. The section on colour does not give rights only to blacks; 
it gives rights to all Canadians regardless of their skin colour.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite forget that. They think that because it 
says sex and colour and sexual orientation it means women, blacks, 
gays and lesbians. That is what they think it means. Why do they 
think so? The Reform Party is made up of older white men. They 
do not realize discrimination exists because it has not been a 
particular problem for men who are elderly, who are white and who 
already have jobs and are doing very well in society.
<P>
	That is primarily what the Reform Party is made up of. If we go 
to any Reform meeting the preponderance of men is overwhelming. 
They are almost all white. They are almost all Anglo-Saxon. They 
are not part of the other minority groups which form the country, 
and of the majority group of women who have been under 
represented in many of the institutions and professions in the 
country for generations.
<P>
	What we have here is an attempt by the Reform Party to cover up 
that its members do not agree with the principles of the human 
rights act in its effort to grant equal rights to all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Special status.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> There the member goes again, special status. 
Because it says sex he concludes it means special status because 
women receive rights they would not otherwise have under this act. 
Men receive the same rights, but the hon. member cannot accept 
that the rights have to be the same. In his view it is special status. 
His leader is doing his best to cover up the difficulties within that 
party by arguing that somehow we can just make a declaration 
which says everyone is equal.
<P>
	Let us go to the ramifications of that. What are the prohibited 
grounds of discrimination under this new Reform law? There will 
not be any prohibited grounds of discrimination. Everyone is 
declared to be equal and therefore everyone who is discriminated 
against in any way will have a claim.
<P>
	One of the members of the Reform Party is a retired professor. I 
wonder what he would say if a student applied to Simon Fraser 
University where he taught and was told that his or her marks were 
insufficient to get in and then the student laid a claim of 
discrimination saying: ``I am a Canadian citizen and the new 
Reform human rights code says discrimination is not allowed in 
Canada. My marks are lower than John Doe's. John Doe  got in and 
I did not. I want in''. What would the hon. member say to that?
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I would like to hear from the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest on that point. I bet he does not have the faintest idea of 
what he would say because he could not possibly come up with a 
law that will do what he says he is going to do and make it stick. 
This whole notion is a chimera.
<P>
	There is no sense of how you divide people into groups, how you 
discriminate against people if you do not have the bases of 
discrimination spelled out in the human rights act. This act spells 
out the bases of discrimination. Almost all Canadians agree that the 
bases set out in this act are fair and reasonable.
<P>
	The government by this amendment is providing justice for a 
group of Canadians who have complained loud and long that they 
have been unfairly treated. They have already been included in the 
human rights codes of seven of the provinces. They have been 
determined to be part of this code by the courts in their exercise of 
judicial interpretation of this statute.
<P>
	This law is doing virtually nothing new. What it is doing is 
bringing Parliament up to date with what has been going on in the 
rest of society. It is something that should have been done a long 
time ago and obviously has gone right over the heads of hon. 
members opposite.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and other 
members have suggested that this bill is being rushed through with 
undue haste.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Do you agree?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I do not agree.
<P>
	It is important for hon. members to realize the reason they are 
seeking to delay this is so they can spread false stories about what 
the legislation will do in order to generate opposition to the bill. 
This bill is clear cut and straightforward and it ought to be 
approved by the House without delay.
<P>
	Who are the groups the hon. member for Calgary Southwest 
refers to in his statement? I do not know. He says these groups are 
mentioned in the human rights act. They are not mentioned. I have 
indicated the words that are used. The words that are used include 
all Canadians. No group is singled out for special protection in the 
sections of the act we are dealing with in this amendment today.
<P>
	I have received a lot of letters on this issue, not so much from my 
own constituents but groups in British Columbia and Alberta in 
particular have written to me quoting chapter and verse from the 
book of Leviticus and various writings of the apostle Paul believe 
in his letter to the Romans I believe and a couple of others. I am 
concerned that these people would quote this kind of biblical 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2417"> 2417 </A></B>
<P>
reference to me and suggest that because of those  particular verses 
in the Bible I ought to vote against this bill.
<P>
	I have a message for them and for hon. members opposite which 
I ask them to consider. I know they regard the importance of 
biblical teaching very highly. I will read from the gospel of St. 
Matthew:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Do not judge and you will not be judged. For as you judge others, so you will 
yourselves be judged, and whatever measure you deal out to others will be dealt 
to you. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye, with 
never a thought for the plank in your own. How can you say to your brother: 
``Let me take the speck out of your eye,'' when all the time there is a plank in 
your own? You hypocrite! First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you 
will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another is: ``Always treat others as you would like them to treat 
you: that is the law and the prophets''.
<P>
	I can only urge those words on all hon. members in this House as 
we approach a vote on this very important bill. In my view those 
words from the Sermon on the Mount summarize what the 
government is attempting to do by this bill to bring fairness and 
justice to our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, there are two 
issues I would like to touch on. Obviously we could take a lot of 
time to talk about the details of the bill itself and the history behind 
it, or some of the drivel we have been hearing from the other side. 
Rather than doing that, I will talk about two things: one, democracy 
denied; and two, the equality issue and what Bill C-33 will really 
do in that regard.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Concerning democracy, I made a promise to my constituents that 
never again will they have to hear that Ottawa knows best. Instead 
of telling them what is good for them, we will discuss the issues 
and vote the way our constituents tell us. I will talk later about 
some of the results of consultations with my constituents in the last 
four days.
<P>
	The key issue is that time is short. Last Monday the bill was 
introduced, Tuesday it was debated, Wednesday closure was 
invoked. The bill was sent to committee and today it is back. 
Closure will be used again. At the latest on Thursday we will be 
voting at third reading. Somebody tell me how members are to 
consult with their constituents with that sort of time line.
<P>
	My constituents want town hall meetings. They want to review 
both sides of the issue. I had an excellent meeting with a group 
from the gay community in my riding. I told them I would have 
liked to have had the opportunity to talk about the issue of gay 
rights and all the other issues in public and to intelligently and 
scientifically discuss Bill C-33 in its entirety. Instead it is being 
rammed down our throats with the use of closure, closure, closure, 
just like the Progressive Conservatives did. There is no opportunity 
to really get involved. I certainly have had no opportunity to 
communicate with my constituents, as I promised. We have tried 
our best.
<P>
	One argument we have heard from across the floor is that the 
voters are really not that bright to understand these things. That is 
what the PCs thought and what the people orchestrating the 
Charlottetown accord thought. They did not think anyone would be 
informed enough to understand and vote on it. In 1993 the people 
took control and threw out the PCs for that same reason.
<P>
	I am saying that democracy has been denied in this place. 
Because of closure and the ramming through of this piece of 
legislation the people of Canada have not had the opportunity to 
communicate with their members of Parliament as they should. 
This sort of legislation has been around for 30 years. Why all the 
rush now? We only have one week in which to ram it through. I 
apologize to the people of Canada for being part of this. It is 
disgusting that we have to do business this way. Everybody should 
hang their heads.
<P>
	With regard to Bill C-33 and the whole concept of special status 
and referring to Charlottetown, any group that has ever tried to put 
forward this special status concept has found that it just does not 
work. If anything, it further divides Canadians. It divides families 
and neighbours who have known each other for years.
<P>
	When we say everyone is equal or that we are opposed to any 
kind of discrimination, everybody understands that. It is clear: I 
oppose discrimination because of sexual orientation, colour, 
religion or anything else. That is clear. Everyone is equal and 
everyone should protect that equality, not set out special status and 
categories within the law. That is another disgrace which has been 
brought on us by the government.
<P>
	Let us talk about what sorts of things we should be considering. 
We are saying let us talk to the people and get their views. In my 
riding I asked the question: How do you want your MP to vote on 
Bill C-33 which if approved will amend the Canadian Human 
Rights Act to include sexual orientation as a prohibited ground for 
discrimination? I tried to take that right from the bill, to make it as 
fair as I could. I said that there are two sides to all issues and they 
must look at both sides.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	To members across the way, the results to this point have been: 
opposed to the bill, in phone calls, petition signatures and letters, 
1,152 as of last night; in favour, we have received 18 names. A 
couple of weeks ago in response to the Senate bill, I mentioned I 
had met with the homosexual community in my area. They have 
collected 402 names in favour of a much broader petition which I 
will be presenting in the House as soon as it is approved. Even if we 
add those names to the list, if it was on the same bill, it would still 
be 1,152 to 420.
<P>
	The calls are coming in. Yesterday there were 80 calls to my 
office. Those 80 calls all said that I should vote against this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2418"> 2418 </A></B>
<P>
legislation. Many of the people in my riding, about 68 per cent, are 
in urban areas. Because we have a large petrochemical industry, 
because many of them are university graduates, I suppose they are 
better off than a lot of Canadians, but they are thinking 
intellectually about these issues. The fact that in less than a week 
we have received 1,500 responses concerning a piece of legislation 
tells me that those people are on top of the issue. It tells me that not 
like my colleagues across the way who think the voters are stupid, 
the voters are right on top of it. They know what is happening and 
they are watching very carefully.
<P>
	I remind all members that Canadians are watching. They are 
watching the taking away of democracy. They are watching the 
jamming of this material down their throats without an opportunity 
to get involved. They are saying enough is enough.
<P>
	Discussing the issue of homosexuality is not what this bill is 
about. This bill is about giving special status to a group. Every 
single Canadian should be treated equally, equally, equally. What 
does the government not understand about the word equality?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am speaking on Motions Nos. 1, 9 to 15 and 18.
<P>
	I am not certain that I understand the purpose of Motion No. 1. 
Motion No. 1 is a suggestion that we replace the words ``all 
individuals'' with ``every individual'' as they occur in the preamble 
to the legislation.
<P>
	The purpose of the changes in Bill C-33 were proposed by the 
drafters in the legislation section at the Department of Justice. 
They do not have anything to do with the sexual orientation 
amendments. The drafters were simply trying to follow the usual 
practice that when a section in a statute is changed they will also try 
to modernize the language.
<P>
	The modernization of the language has no legal effect, that is, it 
has no effect to alter the statute as it appeared. It is also necessary 
to make the English version of the statute equivalent to the French 
version which has contained the modern language for a period of 
time. What is being proposed by this amendment simply goes 
against modernization of the language. Modernization of the 
language is important when considering legislation, in essence to 
tidy it up.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	Motion No. 9 states in part that nothing in sections 2 or 3 shall be 
construed so as to render any provision of the Criminal Code 
inoperative or of no force or effect. I have read this clause very 
carefully. However, I do not understand its purpose.
<P>
	Any lawyer will say that Bill C-33 and the Canadian Human 
Rights Act have nothing to do with the Criminal Code. They do not 
affect the Criminal Code. They have no jurisdiction over the 
Criminal Code. I can only conclude this motion stems from a lack 
of understanding of the legislation in question. I would have hoped 
that by now a parliamentarian would have a better appreciation of 
federal legislation and the way it operates.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act and Bill C-33 only apply to, 
only affect, only regulate two main things: employment and the 
provision of goods and services. The Criminal Code has absolutely 
nothing to do with this subject matter.
<P>
	Perhaps hon. members have confused the Canadian Human 
Rights Act with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The 
charter is a part of the Constitution. As the supreme law of the land, 
the Constitution has primacy over all other laws, federal, provincial 
or municipal, and this includes the Criminal Code. However, we 
are not dealing here with the charter. We are simply talking about 
the Canadian Human Rights Act which has no application to the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Finally, the preamble makes it clear that Bill C-33 protects 
lawful conduct only. Any behaviour that was illegal before remains 
illegal now. It is not protected by the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	While I have tried to understand the purpose of Motion No. 10, I 
I do not know why an amendment like this is necessary. The 
Canadian Human Rights Act applies to a relatively small 
percentage of employers and service providers coming within 
federal jurisdiction, that is the federal government and federally 
regulated businesses such as banks, airlines, railways and 
telecommunications companies.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act and the amendment in Bill 
C-33 do not apply to churches or religious organizations. These 
come under provincial human rights acts and are not affected by the 
amendments being brought forward. The change proposed in this 
amendment is not necessary. If I could put it bluntly, it would be of 
no force or effect, it would be a useless amendment.
<P>
	Churches and religious organizations are regulated by provincial 
human rights laws. The federal act is the wrong place for these 
amendments. This is something for the provinces to address in their 
legislation. They are completely unaffected by Bill C-33 which can 
only change human rights legislation within federal jurisdiction, 
namely the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	If the Canadian Human Rights Act were applicable to churches 
and religious organizations, which it is not, an employer may still 
refuse to hire on reasonable and justifiable grounds in the 
circumstances. For example, the Supreme Court of Canada has 
held that it is reasonable and justifiable for a Catholic school to 
require that the  religious views of its instructors conform with the 
views of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2419"> 2419 </A></B>
<P>
church. Churches and religious organizations may rely on this to 
justify conformity with the tenets of their religions.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 11, no changes to the definitions of 
marriage, family and spouse are planned or necessary as a result of 
this amendment. Bill C-33 does not change the law. Sexual 
orientation is already in the law. The charter and the Canadian 
Human Rights Act by court order have already done this. This 
amendment would only make express in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act what is already there.
<P>
	The issue of same sex benefits and other issues are already 
before the courts and tribunals. Whether or not this amendment is 
made, those cases will be decided and the relevant statutes 
considered as the courts and tribunals see fit.
<P>
	Motion No. 12 proposes an amendment that states in part that 
sexual orientation ``shall not be construed so as to affect the 
freedom of religion, expression or association as guaranteed by the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms''. This amendment is 
also unnecessary. Freedom of religion, expression and association 
are in the charter.
<P>
	The charter is part of the Constitution of Canada. The 
Constitution is the supreme law of the land. It overrides all other 
laws, whether federal or provincial. It has supremacy over the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. Therefore, nothing that could be done 
in the Canadian Human Rights Act could take primacy over the 
charter or affect the freedoms of religion, expression or association 
as guaranteed by the charter. This motion is based on a fundamental 
misunderstanding of the law of the country. Freedom of religion, 
expression and association are guaranteed by the charter and 
cannot be taken away by Bill C-33 or any other law. The 
amendment proposed would add nothing to the law and is therefore 
not necessary.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	It is important to remember also that the Canadian Human 
Rights Act applies to the employment and the provision of goods 
and services at the federal level. Therefore, the scope of this 
amendment is very narrow. It does not apply to churches or 
religious institutions. There is no way in which Bill C-33 is going 
to affect freedom of religion or expression.
<P>
	Motion No. 15 would add a clause stating that nothing in 
sections 2 or 3 shall be construed so as to authorize the marriage of 
persons of the same sex. The Canadian Human Rights Act and 
consequently Bill C-33 have absolutely no application to marriage. 
The act applies to employment and the provision of goods and 
services only. The primacy of the act is over statutes on 
employment or which provide goods and services. While the 
federal government can make laws concerning the  capacity to 
marry, such laws do not fall into the areas of employment or goods 
and services.
<P>
	As Maxwell Yalden, Chief Commissioner of the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission, said last month before the Senate 
committee studying Bill S-2: ``We are not talking about who is 
married and who is not married. That is none of the business of our 
commission''. That is correct. The Canadian Human Rights Act 
simply does not apply to marriage.
<P>
	The common law has always provided that a marriage is a union 
of a man and a woman. The common law has equal force with the 
statute law. The common law on marriage could only be changed 
by specific federal legislation on marriage. As noted earlier, the 
Canadian Human Rights Act applies to employment and the 
provision of goods and services and cannot affect laws on 
marriage.
<P>
	In 1993, in the Layland and Beaulne v. Ontario case, the plaintiff 
challenged the common law requirement that marriage is a union 
between a man and a women under section 15 of the charter against 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The charter, as 
part of the Constitution, does have primacy over all other laws. 
This is what the majority of the court stated: ``The common law 
limitation of marriage to persons of the opposite sex does not 
constitute discrimination against the applicants, contrary to section 
15 of the charter''. This is the law and it is the law right across 
Canada.
<P>
	There is only one answer to Motion No. 18. Bill C-33 does not 
add and cannot have the effect of adding sexual orientation to the 
existing affirmative action provision, section 16, of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. The argument that it is included by implication 
is wrong. Section 16 stands by itself with its own list of grounds. If 
the intent were to provide for affirmative action on the basis of 
sexual orientation, section 16 would have to be amended.
<P>
	Bill C-33 adds sexual orientation to sections 2 and 3 of the act, 
not section 16. The list of grounds in section 16 remains 
unchanged.
<P>
	The government will be voting against all the amendments 
contained in Group No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the justice minister 
would have us believe that his proposed legislation is merely a 
fuzzy, feel good statement with no potential economic or social 
cost.
<P>
	He blithely assures us that the proposed amendment to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act will not open the door to same sex 
marriage, same sex spousal benefits, or the application of laws 
governing taxation and joint property.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. minister does not recognize the opinions of the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, which is a little out 
of character when one  considers that it is his party which has 
already essentially transferred governance of the country from the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2420"> 2420 </A></B>
<P>
elected Parliament to the appointed Supreme Court. However, that 
is a subject for another debate.
<P>
	Today, let us merely accept the reality that, to a very large extent, 
the court now calls the tune. In the Mossop case in 1993, Mr. 
Mossop was denied bereavement leave on the death of his 
homosexual partner's father because the partner did not fit the 
definition of common law spouse. Fair enough. However, the Chief 
Justice stated that if Parliament had included sexual orientation in 
the human rights act, the interpretation of family status might have 
been entirely different.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The minister is so defensive about the long term implications of 
this legislation that yesterday he circulated a lengthy paper in 
which he attempted through generalities and half-truths to discredit 
the detailed research done by the hon. member for Scarborough 
West and the research branch of the Library of Parliament. 
Methinks the minister doth protest too much.
<P>
	This is hardly surprising when one considers that in March 1994 
he stated categorically that the logical next step to amending the 
Canadian Human Rights Act would be to extend spousal benefits 
rights to same sex couples. If this bill is harmless window dressing, 
why is it being promoted through deviousness and deceit?
<P>
	The minister makes much of the fact that although the capacity 
to marry is within federal jurisdiction, solemnization and 
registration of marriages is a provincial responsibility. He knows 
full well that the law is the sum total of statutes and precedents. To 
suggest that federal legislation will have no effect on provincial 
policies is absurd. To say that it would not accelerate the avalanche 
of regulatory board and lower court decisions in favour of same sex 
spousal benefits stretches the bounds of rationality.
<P>
	Some of the oh so sophisticated and with-it members opposite 
might ask what difference does it make if a few hundred 
co-habiting homosexuals get spousal dental benefits? For one 
thing, it makes a lot of difference to me because it makes a lot of 
difference to my constituents.
<P>
	Bill C-33 was tabled only nine days ago, but it has already 
ignited a firestorm of anger. The minister's strategy of pushing 
legislation through the House before real public opposition can 
develop has already failed.
<P>
	Second, the payment of same sex benefits will add credibility 
to demands for state recognition of same sex marriage. These 
terribly sophisticated Liberals may then ask, what difference 
does it make if homosexual liaisons are classed as marriages? 
What does the collective wisdom of the ages mean to people who 
profess to know everything? What does it matter to them that the 
basic  building block of almost every civilization of record has 
been the traditional family?
<P>
	With minor variations, the definitions of those families would 
have conformed to the Reform Party definition of those individuals 
related by blood, marriage or adoption. Marriage is defined as the 
union of a man and a woman as recognized by the state, including 
common law relationships.
<P>
	This is the definition that we would endorse with respect to the 
provision of spousal benefits for many federally funded or 
regulated programs. If the state has no business in the bedrooms of 
the nation, surely the corollary is that the homosexuals of the 
nation have no business in the wallets of taxpayers of this country.
<P>
	Where does one rationally draw the line with respect to benefits? 
What of the common practice of same sex heterosexuals living 
together for long periods of time for convenience and household 
economy? Should they be less entitled to consideration than their 
homosexual peers? Will the government have a squad of bedroom 
police to ensure that applicants really are engaging in the requisite 
practices?
<P>
	The institutions of marriage and family developed over 
millennia and they have served civilization well. They have served 
the essential purpose of procreation and the nurturing of children. 
Strong family units are the foundation blocks of society. When they 
are weakened by hedonism society as a whole suffers. Anyone 
capable of learning from history should look at ancient Athens or 
ancient Rome.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	It is impossible to extend special rights to any group without 
detracting from the rights of others. In this case the potential losers 
are children. The minister maintains this bill does not endanger 
children because pedophilia, even though technically a sexual 
orientation, is now a criminal act. I remind the minister that less 
than 30 years ago homosexual acts were illegal, and please observe 
where we are now.
<P>
	However, assuming there is no danger of misapplication of the 
law, it should be obvious the proposed legislation will extend 
opportunities to potential molesters of whatever gender.
<P>
	Would any member opposite really want to put his or her 
children at risk by forcing communities to accept, for example, 
male homosexuals as scout masters or homosexuals of any stripe as 
guidance counsellors? How many Mount Cashel types of disasters 
would it take to impress on these people that the defensive instincts 
of previous generations of parents were based on valid concerns?
<P>
	Liberals like to prattle about their deep concern for children but 
they do not hesitate to expose them to potential trauma in order to 
bolster their ideological fantasies.

<P>
	Make no mistake, I do not much care what adult homosexuals do 
in private. I do care a very great deal about children. I am a 
parent-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Ringma around the collar.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> If the hon. member for Halifax really feels this is 
such excellent legislation we are running up to, I am gender neutral 
on this. I would not want to see a male heterosexual in charge of a 
girl guide troop either. This is the sort of thing which in the 
politically correct world of the folks opposite we would like to 
encourage; child molesters of the world unite.
<P>
	It is clear to all where I stand. This bill is a travesty. It is wrong. 
We will oppose it at every possible turn. We are standing up for our 
constituents who oppose this mightily.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker. I have been 
here since 10 a.m. and the hon. member for Central Nova has been 
here since approximately 10.10 a.m. and has attempted to seek the 
eye of the Chair since that time. She has been in her seat all this 
time, certainly before the hon. member for Halifax came. I would 
ask as a matter of courtesy that you recognize her.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
debate, the hon. member for Halifax.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to take part in this debate today. I am particularly 
delighted that my hon. friend, the member for Swift 
Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia, brought up history. Some of 
my remarks have to do with history. I want to make particular note 
of his comments that certain things were criminal acts in the past 
and are no longer.
<P>
	There are other things that were enshrined in our laws in the past 
and are so no longer. For example, women were considered to be 
chattel. That is no longer the case, at least in law, although it is 
sometimes still the case unfortunately in practice. Married women 
prior to 1870 anywhere in the British Commonwealth could not 
actually own property. Any property they brought to the marriage 
became the property of their husbands. We changed that. There are 
thousands of examples.
<P>
	However, murder has been murder since Cain killed Abel, and 
murder is murder today. Pedophilia is not a sexual orientation; 
pedophilia is a crime. It will continue to be a crime while good 
people sit in the House of Commons. I believe good people will sit 
in the House of Commons for a long time to come.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I believe most passionately in the separation of church and state. 
I believe most passionately in the separation of  moral issues and 
legal issues. I believe most passionately that amendments to the 
human rights act are legal issues and are long overdue.
<P>
	In 1604 England and Scotland became the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain under the monarch James I of England, also styled 
James VI of Scotland. He effectively completed the Elizabethan 
age. Under his reign we saw the completion of the Shakespearian 
plays. We saw the beginnings of the metaphysical poets, great 
poets and church men like John Donne and George Herbert, to 
name only two.
<P>
	We heard and saw the wonderful songs and poetry of Sir Walter 
Raleigh and Sir Philip Sydney. There were not too many women 
writing in those days because they were chattels then, but that has 
changed.
<P>
	Perhaps the jewel in the crown of the reign of King James was 
the justly famous and magnificent work known as the King James 
Bible.
<P>
	Not only is the King James Bible in the minds and hearts of 
adherents of Christianity the inspired word of God, but it is 
considered a masterpiece of world literature. I studied it in a course 
on the masterpieces of western literature at Mount Saint Vincent 
University some 25 years ago.
<P>
	The King James Bible is something which people of all faiths 
read with delight and pleasure, with its glories of the English 
language. I wonder if all my colleagues know that James I, James 
Stuart of England, James VI of Scotland, the son of Mary Queen of 
Scots and Lord Darnley was, in the minds of most historians, 
homosexual.
<P>
	Another great figure in British history is Richard I. We go back 
to time immemorial, the reign of Richard I, at the end of the twelfth 
century, the dark ages. A great king arose who left England to sail 
to the holy land to free the holy places from the Saracens. Who was 
that man? His name was Richard Coeur de Lion, Richard the 
Lionhearted. Guess what? In the minds of most scholars of that 
period, he too was a homosexual.
<P>
	There are those who suggest Julius Caesar was bisexual.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wappel:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. This is not 
third reading debate, as you are well aware. This is debate on 
specific amendments contained in Group No. 1 with respect to 
amendments to Bill C-33. None of them pertains to any sort of 
history of the crusades or anything like that. I ask that you call the 
member to order and have her address the motions listed in Group 
No. 1.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
debate, the hon. member for Halifax.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I am sorry the hon. member for 
Scarborough West is so threatened by the fact that history is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2422"> 2422 </A></B>
<P>
relevant to the debate today. He can  heckle me privately or 
publicly whenever he wishes, if he dares.
<P>
	Richard the Lionhearted was also a homosexual. Julius Caesar 
was, in the minds of most historians of the period, thought to be 
bisexual. There are hundreds and thousands of other examples.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	I listened to my hon. friend for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia talk about children, scout masters, pedophilia 
and all of that. What frightens me more than anything else in the 
House is bigotry, intolerance and fear of the unknown.
<P>
	What frightens me is a Salem like response, a witch hunt like 
attitude to people who have a different lifestyle or a different 
sexual orientation; not a criminal orientation, a different 
orientation.
<P>
	As we stand in the House later this week and see the passage of 
the justice minister's amendment to the Human Rights Act and see 
the defeat of the group of amendments we are debating here now, I 
will be proud that members on both sides of the House understand 
that freedom from discrimination, freedom from fear, the ability to 
live as full participants in society are things all Canadians deserve, 
things all Canadians should expect from their government.
<P>
	The rights enshrined in the charter of rights and freedoms are 
beyond the enforcement of many Canadians because of financial 
exigency. However, the rights spelled out in federal and provincial 
human rights act can and will be enforced by ordinary Canadians, 
and should be.
<P>
	I am proud that I am hear in the House this week supporting this 
amendment brought by the Minister of Justice and voting against 
the amendments that are fearmongering, intolerant and 
un-Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, if I had the unanimous consent of 
the House I would give up my time to allow the member for 
Scarborough West to present his views on this subject. I ask for 
unanimous consent of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> How do you spell Halifax? B-I-G-O-T.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Usually we go 
to a speaker from the government side and then to a speaker from 
the opposition side, et cetera. Do we have unanimous consent for 
the request?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. I believe 
you will find the member has already spoken and therefore his 
request is out of order.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of privilege. As I sat 
down the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia said, to my hearing and I believe to the hearing 
of some colleagues: ``How do you spell Halifax? B-I-G-O-T''.
<P>
	That is unacceptable and unparliamentary. I would ask you to 
rule.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I will review 
the transcript to see if we can identify the source of your complaint.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am glad to speak to these amendments but what is going on here 
today is a pitiful spectacle. It is nothing to be proud of on the 
Liberal side that they do not want to have a debate on subjects that 
many Canadians consider important. Whether or not we come to 
agreement on these subjects is one thing but surely we can have a 
debate.
<P>
	What is going on here? What is it saying, that we cannot talk 
about this. If we talk about it, what will happen? Will democracy 
occur? Will we have an overdose of democracy? Will we have 
people being allowed to speak conscientiously on both sides of the 
subject? What is it that they are afraid of?
<P>
	It reminds me a little of-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. 
The comments just made by the hon. member reflect on the 
motives of members of this House.
<P>
	Perhaps, question of privilege is not accurate. Perhaps it is a 
point of order. To reflect on the motives of members of the House is 
contrary to the normal procedures and rules of this House.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I would ask you to take that under 
consideration, especially because it is an unjustified reflection on 
motives, given that people on this side of the House have spoken on 
both sides of the issue. The Reform Party has not allowed that to 
happen in its caucus.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
deputy whip has made a point. I hope all members in the House will 
take that into consideration in their comments and statements on 
the motions we are addressing right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I will take it into consideration but 
it will not change my opinion much about what is going on. What is 
going on is not right.
<P>
	All we ask for is a debate on the topic in its entirety. We want all 
members of Parliament to speak their minds on important issues. 
What happens when debate is squelched on the Liberal side, or on 
any side?
<P>
	What happens is that contradictions are raised that cannot be 
answered. Good points are raised that people cannot answer. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2423"> 2423 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians say that there must be something wrong, that there must 
be something insidious, that there is something behind the door, a  
backroom deal going on because they will not allow discussion to 
take place.
<P>
	Listen to this contradiction if you will. When the Minister of 
Justice introduced this bill he said: ``This bill does not confer 
benefits on same sex couples''. That is the issue we are dealing 
with in this amendment.
<P>
	On March 12, 1994, in a talk to <I>Xtra West</I>, the gay magazine in 
Vancouver, he said: ``If the government takes the position that you 
cannot discriminate, it follows as a matter of logic that you have 
spousal entitlement to benefits''. In the House on Wednesday he 
said that this bill had nothing to do with spousal benefits.
<P>
	Two years ago to <I>Xtra West</I>, the gay magazine, he said: 
``Absolutely, this will lead to spousal benefits''. We could debate 
the subject of whether homosexuals should have spousal benefits 
or not. Is it an issue we want to get into, such as sponsorship in the 
immigration department?
<P>
	Are these the things we want to do? The minister also said that 
changes may not need to be extensive statutory amendments. They 
might just include regulations, such as immigration policy. Is that 
where we want to go as a country? Let us have a debate on it.
<P>
	We cannot have a debate because the government will not let a 
debate happen. That is what is wrong. On this side on one day to 
one audience, the minister says: ``Don't worry. There is nothing to 
it. It is just a simple amendment to make sure that we do not have 
discriminatory hiring practices''. To that I say hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Is that all it is about? Two years ago he said that this will lead to 
spousal benefits. We have a complete, absolute inconsistency from 
a minister, talking to two different audiences and sending two 
different messages.
<P>
	When he does that it raises the concerns of many Canadians who 
ask what is the government actually doing? What message is it 
sending and who is it sending it to? Is it the same wherever the 
minister goes? I am not sure. That is the trouble with clamping 
down on legitimate debate. We could have a good airing of this. We 
could have a good discussion but the government will not let it 
happen.
<P>
	It reminds me of what happened on the distinct society motion. 
When the distinct society was brought forward, some asked what 
does it mean? The government said do not talk about it and cut off 
debate. Members were not allowed to discuss it. I said that I had 
some concerns. When I have concerns I want them debated. I may 
not win my point. I may not always carry the day, obviously not, 
but I should have the right, as should all members of the House, to 
discuss important issues.
<P>
	Is it not interesting that again we have two tiny words. First it 
was distinct society, now it is sexual orientation. What does it 
mean? We are not allowed to say that we have some concerns.
<P>
	What has happened in this first group of amendments is that 
people have said they are not allowed to discuss it, they are not 
allowed to bring their concerns forward, the government will not 
allow them to talk about it. They are bringing forward some 
amendments to address the concerns of people that have been 
calling their offices, that have been bringing forward these 
questions. How else can it be done if members are not allowed to 
talk?
<P>
	Members have brought forward amendments. Some of the 
amendments are strictly for that purpose, to give some of the 
members a chance to speak. If they say they are concerned about 
the redefinition of the family, they will throw an amendment in.
<P>
	The minister says it is not about redefining the family, so 
members are moving amendments that state the family will remain 
defined as it is now in Canadian policy. That should put the issue to 
rest. If the minister is sincere that this bill does not involve spousal 
benefits, that it does not involve the redefinition of marriage, that it 
does not make any difference to the other areas these amendments 
address, then he will vote for them. He will say to the member for 
Scarborough West: ``Right on, you've clarified this for the 
Canadian people. You've shown how this is not a backroom deal, 
there are no sweetheart deals, there is no backroom game plan, we 
were up front. This is what it does not mean''. Just lay it right out.
<P>
	If he is sincere in this then he will support these amendments. He 
will say that he does not want to scare anybody, open a can of 
worms or lead us down a path of unknown destination. He will say: 
``I'm going to show you my sincerity by voting for these 
amendments because I don't want to redefine marriage, I don't 
want to use this bill to extend spousal benefits''.
<P>
	Perhaps the people on the other side could listen for a second. It 
is interesting that the Canadian AIDS society asks how one knows 
when somebody is homophobic. Do members want to know? Some 
of these are very good ideas. When one laughs at gay jokes, at 
people who tell jokes about gays that put gays down and so on, that 
could be a sign that one is homophobic.
<P>
	The second sign of homophobia is if one is against spousal 
benefits. It is interesting that during the debate on the private 
member's bill for spousal benefits last year, the whole flippin' 
cabinet voted against spousal benefits, pretty well the whole works. 
Why? Because they are flaming homophobics. Is that true? Of 
course it is not true.
<P>
	What has happened in this House and what has happened over 
the last week is that we are not allowed to talk about the issue 
without being homophobic. Is it not something that the Canadian 
AIDS society would say that most of the Liberal Party are 
homophobics? They voted against spousal benefits. Shame, shame. 
I voted against it too. Does that make me homophobic? No more 
than it made the cabinet homophobic, than it made people over  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2424"> 2424 </A></B>
<P>
there homophobic and many people over here. We are not 
homophobic. What does that have to do with it?
<P>
	It is a stifling of debate. We are not allowed to discuss the issue. 
If you raise the issue at all, if you speak of it in public, you are 
homophobic. What a crockamole. It is an intrusion on the freedom 
of speech where people are not allowed to come into the House of 
Commons, of all places, and speak their minds, and certainly not 
outside of the House of Commons, certainly not in public, maybe 
not in private. Perhaps we need the thought police to come in and 
make sure our thoughts are right.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	It is a disgusting display of strong arm tactics by people in the 
party across the way and also by certain societies that say: ``Only 
my complete and full agenda is satisfactory''. They are not 
satisfied to talk about it and educate one another, to talk about the 
issues of what should be a family. That is not the issue. We cannot 
talk about it.
<P>
	I see people over there who have been here since ten o'clock this 
morning who have not been allowed to speak. What a shame. I have 
offered to split my time with members opposite. I have said that I 
will give up my time because I am allowed to speak over here. I 
would give up my whole time to the member for Ontario. But he is 
not allowed to speak. Members rush in from the back saying: ``No, 
I will not let you speak''.
<P>
	Do the people of Canada think this is a democratic and free 
House? Do they think about changing the definition of spouse, not 
by debating it, because maybe there could be some consensus if 
they did? The Liberals say it is their way or the highway. Free 
debate is not allowed. They will do whatever it takes. They will use 
scorn, strong arm tactics, try to send us on trips around the world, 
whatever they can do to keep it quiet, because they do not want a 
discussion.
<P>
	That is what is wrong with the debate, as much as anything else. 
That is why I am going to-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard: </B>Madam Speaker, Reform members have, on 
several occasions, indicated that the Canadian AIDS Society, 
which you know, made a connection between being opposed to 
benefits for same sex couples and homophobia. Reference was 
made to the campaign conducted last year by the Canadian AIDS 
Society. I am asking the member to table the document he 
referred to.
<P>
	I am asking the Chair to ask the member to table that document.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the

with one point of order right now and then we will deal with the 
next one.

	Does the House give its unanimous consent to have the 
document tabled?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>

<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley East on his point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not have the document in my 
hands. I will be happy to table it shortly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it will be necessary for me to deal in general terms with 
many of the motions that have been presented to amend Bill C-33.
<P>
	For effective learning and for a better analysis of what Bill C-33 
really implies, it would be necessary for me to repeat quite a few of 
the facts and some of the concepts.
<P>
	It is with inner strength and conviction that I speak about Bill 
C-33, the government's commitment to amend the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. The act clearly states that it is against the law to 
discriminate on the basis of race, colour, religion, age, sex, marital 
status and disability.
<P>
	The bill where we are adding two more words to the list is in 
essence a fulfilment of a resolution passed by the Liberal Party at 
its 1994 biennial policy convention. This resolution represents a 
longstanding policy of the Liberal Party dating back to at least 
1978.
<P>
	In January 1994 the Minister of Justice indicated during a 
response to the government's first throne speech that amendments 
to the Canadian Human Rights Act were to come. Specifically he 
stated: ``In the throne speech the Prime Minister's commitment 
made during the election campaign was renewed. We shall 
introduce amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act. These 
amendments, among other things, will include sexual orientation as 
a ground upon which discrimination is prohibited''.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	This House has been attempting to implement this principle 
since 1986. Ensuing governments since that time have also 
expressed intentions to introduce this amendment. Bill C-33 will 
finally accomplish that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2425"> 2425 </A></B>
<P>
	What most people do not realize is that this bill will do what 
eight other Canadian provinces or territories have already done. 
Every province and territory has a separate human rights act, such 
as those found in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Yukon. This bill 
will also bring us in line with court decisions and with an all-party 
parliamentary subcommittee report from 1985 which recognized 
that gays and lesbians merit equal protection under the law.
<P>
	Just what is it that this amendment is advocating? Primarily this 
amendment seeks to allow someone who has been fired from their 
job or denied a service by a federal business because of their sexual 
orientation to file a complaint of discrimination. By federal 
business I am referring to any company, public or private, which is 
regulated by federal laws, rules and regulations, such as banks, 
railways, airlines and telecommunications companies, plus all 
federal employees.
<P>
	Clearly this is a question of fundamental fairness and justice, 
fairness and justice for approximately 10 per cent of the Canadian 
workforce. What about the other 90 per cent? I repeat, the vast 
majority of the remaining workforce is covered by provincial and 
territorial legislation.
<P>
	The Reform Party would have Canadians believe that this bill 
detracts from the importance Canadians place on strong, healthy 
families in our society. This is absolutely and completely false. The 
fact is that this government has, is and always will protect, 
maintain and introduce legislation that places the traditional family 
as the very basis of our society. A strong, healthy family unit is 
created through the loving relationships among all members of that 
family unit.
<P>
	In our family my loving wife and I have taught our children and 
grandchildren that Christian values are to be used as guiding 
principles in relationships with all groups and individuals. They are 
not to be used only with a selected few. How can one be a good 
Christian by selecting a few and rejecting others because of their 
differences?
<P>
	This amendment will have absolutely no bearing on the 
definitions of marriage, family or spouse. In fact, similar 
legislation at the provincial level has never had any bearing on 
issues of same sex benefits. These are the facts, whether the 
Reform Party likes it or not. Marriage is a provincial issue, not 
federal. Adoption is a provincial issue, not federal. That is where 
they shall remain.
<P>
	It was a very sad occasion last week when the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan made discriminatory statements regarding 
gays and visible minorities. It is truly unfortunate that members of 
the Canadian Parliament in this day and age subscribe to such a 
despicable belief. However, he is not alone. Let me share some of 
my recent experiences from my riding of Thunder Bay-Atikokan.
<P>
	In the past two weeks approximately 40 phone calls have been 
received by me and my office staff. We received most of them in 
the last two days, after people had attended church. Every time I 
managed to get one of the phone calls I asked the person: ``Why are 
you asking me to vote against this amendment?'' They always had 
reasons: ``It is going to allow same sex marriages''. I had to explain 
to them that they were wrong. ``It is going to lead to the adoption of 
infants''. I had to explain to them that what they were told and what 
they were saying was not true.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The calls established three categories. When I had a chance to 
explain what Bill C-33 was all about a very large percentage of the 
people accepted my position. They accepted what it was all about. 
They were happy and no longer distressed and uncomfortable. A 
smaller group did not want to discuss the matter with me on the 
telephone and asked that material be sent to them. We shipped 
material off to their homes.
<P>
	However, there was a small, small group, four in total, no more, 
who frightened me because of the kind of things they said. They 
made threats and declarations about what should be done to people 
who are so different from them, that they should be taken out of the 
city limits and stoned. They also talked about the leeches in our 
society, those who suck the treasury dry and said that they should 
be treated the same way.
<P>
	At that moment, I knew there were no options for me. I knew I 
had only one avenue to follow, which was to support Bill C-33. I 
had to make sure that as long as there were neo-Nazis in our 
community advocating what they said to me, members of 
Parliament must do everything to adhere to our mandate to protect 
the citizens of this country no matter what their differences might 
be.
<P>
	Canadians do not approve of discrimination based on sexual 
preference. A 1994 Angus Reid poll supported this, indicating that 
81 per cent of those surveyed would be bothered if a gay or lesbian 
colleague experienced discrimination in the workplace.
<P>
	In conclusion, I take pride that our government has done more to

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government has introduced a new Bill C-33 that would introduce the 
term ``sexual orientation'' into Canada's human rights charter. Liberal members of 
Parliament claim that the special inclusion for homosexuals in the charter would 
ensure their protection.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe that all Canadians are entitled to equal rights, responsibilities and 
protection under our current human rights legislation. In fact, this is a fundamental 
principle in Canadian law. Section 15(1) of the charter applies to all Canadians: 
Every individual is equal before the law and has the right to the equal protection and 
equal benefit of the law without discrimination-.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If this is the case, you, like me, must be asking yourself why we need to identify a 
particular group as needing special protection. Each and every one of us is a human 
being with a right to be treated equally and fairly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are some other concerns about the specific language and intention of the 
bill. The first is that ``sexual orientation'' is not defined anywhere in Bill C-33. This 
leaves the bill open to interpretation. The second concern that has been brought to 
my attention is how including sexual orientation in human rights legislation will 
affect the right of homosexuals to claim marital or marriage-like status. Finally, that 
the conscience rights of Canadians who may be morally opposed to homosexual 
behaviour be protected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Based on what I have outlined here and what I believe to be the opinion of the 
majority of my constituents, I will vote against Bill C-33. I am voting no in hopes of 
reinforcing our belief as Canadians that we are all equal with no special status for 
any persons or groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	Speaking to the motions before the House, I support Motion No. 
11 moved by one of our members. It adds a new clause defining 
that sexual orientation will not redefine the terms marriage, family 
and spouse in any act of Parliament.
<P>
	I say the following to my friend from Thunder Bay and to other 
members of the Liberal Party. The government has decided it is 
going to be including the word family in the preamble to the law. 
Notwithstanding that the preamble has no force of law and it is only 
a preamble to the law, the fact that the word family has been put in 
there undefined creates exactly the same problem as the fact that 
the term sexual orientation has been put in there undefined.
<P>
	I therefore will be voting specifically in favour of Motion No. 11 
in that the term family is not defined. In addition to that, it will not 
redefine or define the terms marriage or spouse. This lack of 
definition and leaving it up to the courts is just a cop-out on the part 
of the House of Commons. We should say what we mean and mean 
what we say.
<P>
	I also support Motion No. 10 moved by one of our members. 
This motion adds the recognition of the freedom of religious 
institutions, providing their practices are consistent with the 
charter of rights and freedoms. It should go without saying that if 
we extend rights to one group, by definition that means it will  
infringe on the rights of another group. Otherwise why would we 
be extending those rights in the first place?
<P>
	This House as a matter of principle must always guard freedom 
of association and freedom of worship. This House must stand on 
the principle that the church may not be interfered with by the state. 
If, as I believe, this legislation is going to give direction to 
recognized and organized religious groups and organizations and is 
going to define what those religious groups are capable of doing or 
not doing, that is my worst fear. I believe it is a very real fear. It is a 
very real fear on the basis of what has already occurred in the 
province of Alberta with respect to this particular question and with 
respect to a college in the city of Edmonton.
<P>
	This is not a partisan bill. This has clearly been shown by the fact 
that there are members of the Liberal Party who, like myself and 
my colleagues, have serious concerns about the impact of the bill. 
This is not a political bill in the ordinary sense and therefore I do 
not want to make strongly partisan comments. I want to respect the 
fact that there are some people in the Liberal Party who are 
thinking about the consequences and what this bill will do to the 
legitimacy of the separation of church and state.

Mr. Speaker, this is the fourth time in less than 30 days that the 
Liberal Party of Quebec and the Government of Quebec have taken 
a stand against Ottawa's policies.
<P>
	Three weeks ago, after unanimously rejecting the concept of 
``principal homeland'' proposed by the federal Liberals, the 
Quebec national assembly asked the Minister of Natural Resources 
to reconsider her decision to cut funding to the tokamak research 
project. Two weeks ago, the Quebec national assembly

ban the use of the additive MMT in gasoline.

the fundamental right of the people of Quebec to make up their own

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the International Association of Fire Fighters is meeting 
in Ottawa this week which makes this a good time to reflect on the 
tremendous contribution our firefighters make to the safety and 
well-being of our communities. They serve the public with 
distinction and heroism.
<P>
	Despite their dangerous jobs, the federal government is not 
doing all that it can to ensure their safety in action. Firefighters 
have been pleading with the government to take some basic 
measures to add safety to a very perilous profession, so far to no 
avail.
<P>
	They are asking for items that would not only be of personal 
benefit but would also help to protect their families, friends and 
communities, items like mandatory notification protocol to inform 
them when they come into contact with infectious diseases in the 
line of duty, items like the hazardous material identification 
process so they will know what kind of dangerous goods may be 
present at the scene of an accident. These are things that could 
benefit everyone, firefighters and the public alike.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
recently participated in a delegation to Chile sponsored by the

<P>
	The CLC and its Chilean counterpart have called on the 
governments of Canada and Chile to incorporate into any 
Canada-Chile trade accord a core set of labour and environmental 
rights that could act as a base for strengthening the now very weak 
provisions of NAFTA.
<P>
	Chile's labour laws are still fundamentally those put in place by 
the right wing dictatorship. If that is all that is required to join 
NAFTA, then that should tell Canadians a lot about the moral 
emptiness of such trade agreements.
<P>
	I also want to raise the concerns of the people of San Alfonso and 
those who live in a nearby nature sanctuary called Cascada Animas 
about the gas pipeline being built by the Canadian company Nova

multinational has behaved. I urge Nova Corp. to heed the concerns 
of these people and change its plans accordingly.

	Between the pipeline and what we heard about Canadian mining 
companies in northern Chile, I was starting to feel like the 
Canadian equivalent of the ugly American. Canadian companies

unsanitary field conditions. Firefighters are especially hampered 
by lack of information available when they arrive at such incidents, 
especially within the critical first minutes upon arrival at the scene.

need to effectively respond to any incident enabling them to protect

Still we have unemployment figures hanging around double digit

more time at home working on reducing internal trade barriers, 
maybe his government could honour its promise of jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	The Fraser Institute estimates that trade barriers cost Canadian 
families up to $3,500 a year. Think tanks and business groups 
estimate that interprovincial trade barriers cost Canadian business 
$6 billion to $10 billion a year. This means tens of thousands and 
probably hundreds of thousands of jobs, all lost because the 
government will not honour its promise to remove internal trade 
barriers.

	My riding is an urban-rural split. While that sometimes results in

	I have had calls and letters from throughout the riding and the

business. These businesses employ people in the community, 
contribute to community events and support the volunteer efforts 
that make a community strong.

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say first that I was happy to be in Montreal 
yesterday. I met with the premier of Quebec.
<P>
	This is a matter for the Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, who is, under the law, the Constitution and 
parliamentary custom, the defender of Canada's Constitution.
<P>
	I would like to quote what appears on the first page of <I>Le Devoir</I> 
this morning. On page 1A of <I>Le Devoir</I>, Mr. Bouchard is quoted as 
saying: ``It seems rather difficult, if not impossible, for a 
government to lose interest''. The attorney general represents a 
government. Mr. Bouchard said it was difficult for a government to 
lose interest. So the attorney general represents the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, by tying Quebec's participation to Ottawa's, by telling the 
Government of Quebec that, if it forgoes defending Quebecers' 
right to decide their future, it will then be easy for the federal 
government not to participate, is the Prime Minister not resorting 
to blackmail and is he not revealing by so doing his new strategy, 
which is to let the courts alone determine whether Quebec may 
decide its future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it was in fact the position Quebec 
took in this matter that caught our interest. We have no interest in 
Mr. Bertrand's position nor in the points he raised.
<P>
	However, the Government of Quebec said clearly, a few weeks 
ago, on this case, that neither the Constitution nor the courts of 
Canada had any say in Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	This is quite extraordinary.
<P>
	So, as the Attorney General of Canada, I must consider whether I 
can help the court with this question, because the position of the 
Government of Quebec is extraordinary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the attitude of the Government of Quebec may be 
extraordinary, but the responses of the minister are very ordinary 
indeed.
<P>
	I would like to know from the Prime Minister why he is suddenly 
so concerned about the legality of a referendum in Quebec, when 
he took part in those of 1980 and 1995 without ever questioning 
their legality or the right of Quebecers to decide their future. Why 
suddenly now has it become so important for him, unless his back 
is up against the wall and he knows it?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is not the legality of 
referenda. That is not the issue that has attracted the attention of the 
national government. Nor have we the least interest in the various 
positions by Mr. Bertrand.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Bertrand started his civil proceedings a number of months 
ago, in August of last year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have not been involved in that litigation at all. We have no 
interest in the various positions taken by Mr. Bertrand. Our interest 
is in the position taken by the Government of Quebec during these 
past several weeks.
<P>
	That has not to do with the legality of referenda. It has to do with 
whether the Constitution of Canada or the courts have a role to play 
in the whole process by which the separatist Government of 
Quebec aspires to sovereignty and independence.
<P>
	That is a fundamental issue. It is one on which the Attorney 
General of Canada may well be able to assist the court. We are 
considering intervention on that point in the public interest.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the government forgets that, in the Bertrand case, 
the Government of Quebec is the respondent, while the 
Government of Canada is only a third party. Perhaps a distinction 
should be made between the two.
<P>
	Unable to deliver the goods or to give clear answers to our 
questions, the Prime Minister continues to improvise his 
constitutional position, as is obvious again today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2432"> 2432 </A></B>
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that, by referring to the federal 
government's possible involvement in the Bertrand case, he is 
putting himself in a position of confrontation not only with the 
Quebec government, but also with his federalist allies in Quebec, 
Daniel Johnson first of all, who recognize the right of Quebecers to 
decide their own future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, the Government of 
Canada was named as a third party by Mr. Bertrand in his civil suit, 
so we are involved in the legal proceedings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member speaks of improvisation. What the House of 
Commons and the Canadian people are seeing is follow through. 
The government said in the throne speech in February that if there 
is to be another referendum the consequences will be clear and all 
Canadians will have a say. We are acting on that commitment. This 
is follow through on that commitment.
<P>
	If we do decide to intervene in the case it is because we are 
responding to a proposition which is wrong in principle and wrong 
in law because it is impossible to say the Constitution and the 
courts have no relevance to the process by which some would see 
Quebec accede to sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Government of Canada is only a third party, it 
should let Quebecers decide their own future and withdraw from 
this case without going to a higher court, period.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister-since the Prime Minister is here, I 
take this opportunity to question him-how can the Prime Minister 
reconcile his provocative attitude toward Quebec with the mandate 
he gave his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to travel across 
Canada preaching the gospel of national reconciliation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a case before the courts. The parties will present 
their arguments to the court. If the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc 
Quebecois are so sure of their legal position, they should have no 
fear of going before the courts. If their arguments are sound, they 
will prevail. If there is a lawyer representing the federal 
government and if he is wrong, he will lose. That is how the courts 
operate. When I was a practising lawyer and I had a good case, I did 
not ask my opponents to withdraw. I was very happy to argue with 
them.
<P>
	However, this is not a political but a legal problem at this point. 
It is not us but the Quebec government that filed the motion before 
the courts, arguing that there was virtually no longer a Constitution 
in Canada. So we will  defend our legal position, should the 
Minister of Justice decide to do so.
<P>
	As for reconciliation, we had a very well defined program in the 
throne speech and we intend to discuss its implementation with the 
provinces at the first ministers' conference in Ottawa next month. 
The reconciliation plan we put forward, which is being 
stickhandled very adroitly by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, will be on the table and show that we are in favour of 
renewed federalism and not Quebec's separation.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today the Government of Ontario will announce the first 
instalment of a promised cut in the provincial tax rate. Ontario 
taxpayers, however, are aware of the insatiable appetite for tax 
revenue by the federal government, an appetite that increased 
federal tax revenues by more than $25 billion since the government 
took office.
<P>
	In order to maximize the benefits of Ontario's tax cuts 
consumers have to be convinced the dollars will stay in their 
pockets and not be picked by some other government.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister today promise that his government will 
not raise federal taxes and negate the stimulative effect of Ontario 
provincial tax cuts?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the last three budgets have shown to the Canadian people 
that we have managed to reduce the deficit from 6.2 per cent of 
GDP to 3 per cent with no tax increases. In many cases there were 
reductions in taxes.
<P>
	We are very happy the Ontario government has tried to copy us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will excuse us for not believing the Prime Minister 
when it comes to pronouncements on the subject of taxation.
<P>
	The government's own record with respect to tax relief is 
abysmal. The only thing worse than its record on tax relief is its 
record on keeping promises. Canadians deserve to know that 
money left in their pockets by provincial tax cuts will not be sucked 
up by the federal government to pay for things like a $1 billion 
GST harmonization.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister willing to enter into a federal-provincial 
tax relief agreement to ensure tax relief given by provincial 
governments remains in the hands of Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the answer to this question remains the same as  the last 10 times 
the leader of the Reform Party asked it. We have discussed this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2433"> 2433 </A></B>
<P>
extensively at the federal-provincial finance ministers meetings. 
There is a general agreement that it would be counterproductive for 
any one level of government to fill in tax room simply because of 
the negative effect it would have on the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Let me remind the hon. member that not only in the last three 
budgets did the government not raise personal taxes, but in the last 
budget we very clearly nailed our colours to the mast. We did not 
raise corporate taxes, we did not raise excise taxes, we did not raise 
taxes at all, and we still kept bringing the deficit down.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, just a simple question. If there does exist a 
federal-provincial agreement on taxation not to invade each other's 
territory, as the minister says, will the minister table that agreement 
in the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member knows full well what I said. There was a discussion by 
the finance ministers. There was general understanding around the 
table.
<P>
	Let me ask the leader of the Reform Party something. In its most 
recent budget the Reform Party talked about cutting old age 
pensions. It talked about cutting health care. It did not talk about 
cutting taxes.
<P>
	Why is the member raising it here and now if he was not 
prepared to advocate it himself?

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Thursday, the Minister of Finance reaffirmed in this 
House that he was indeed speaking on behalf of the government 
when he said he had made an honest mistake by not abolishing the 
GST as promised.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister resigned over this broken promise 
and the Minister of Finance apologized again on behalf of the 
government. Only the Prime Minister refuses to admit that his 
government pulled the wool over Canadians' eyes by running on 
the promise of abolishing a tax whose scope he is now broadening.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister still insists his government did abide 
by its promise regarding the GST, could he tell us why his finance 
minister has made public apologies on behalf of the government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member must understand that, whenever a minister speaks 
in this House, he speaks on behalf of the government. As a matter 
of fact, that is what I did just the other day, when the Deputy Prime 
Minister and member for Hamilton East gave her press  
conference. She has put the situation very clearly. Incidentally, I 
would like to report to the House that I spoke with the member for 
Hamilton East this morning; she is doing well and she will win the 
election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the person the Minister of Finance should be speaking 
with is not the former Deputy Prime Minister but the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	I would like the Prime Minister, who is in the House today, to tell 
us if he agrees with what his finance minister said when he 
admitted he had made a mistake; that is what he said. The Minister 
of Finance said he was speaking on behalf of the government; the 
Deputy Prime Minister was also speaking on behalf of the 
government, and she resigned.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister speak on behalf of the government and 
stop acting like the old breed of politicians who always had to be 
right and were incapable of acknowledging their mistakes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Deputy Prime Minister indicated at the time of her 
resignation, what she had promised was more than what the red 
book stated. Our promise is stated on page 22 of the red book, 
where we say that our goal is to harmonize the tax, to simplify the 
system, to have in Canada a sales tax system in which businesses 
need not be visited by auditors from two levels of government. This 
was stated very clearly on page 22 and remains very clear.
<P>
	What the Minister of Finance said and what I have been 
repeating in this House is we wish we could have put this system in 
place sooner. That is what we were hoping to do. But since the 
provinces were involved, we had to get their consent.
<P>
	So far, four provinces have consented. This does not apply to 
Alberta. We expect the remaining provinces to get on board shortly 
and we are disappointed that all the provinces did not readily 
endorse the program, as we had hoped. We had said we wished to 
achieve this goal this year and we hope that the provinces that are 
still not involved in the process will be by the end of this year.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government has made it very clear that it will proceed on a set 
of rolling two year targets because it is that procedure which has 
given us the success in deficit reduction that we have had, a success 
that has been recognized by markets around the world.
<P>
	For the first time in an awful long time a Canadian government 
has not only consistently hit its deficit targets, it has beaten them, 
and we will continue to do it. It is too bad for the Reform Party 
because it has lost its agenda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is too 
bad for the Canadian taxpayer that when the Liberals talk about 
going from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent, to 3 per cent of GDP they do 
not mention $40 billion and $50 billion of interest payments that it 
is costing Ontario taxpayers.
<P>
	The lack of resolve on the part of the federal finance minister to 
eliminate the deficit is a cause for concern among Ontario 
taxpayers. They are asking whether a tax cut provincially will be 
swallowed up by a federal tax grab.
<P>
	Canadians are judging their finance ministers by their ability to 
balance their books. This finance minister is dead last in that 
concern. When will he start leading by example?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly do agree with the hon. member that there are times when 
one should cite the province of Ontario. On the GST let me simply 
cite the premier of Ontario.
<P>
	He said in 1994 that in terms of GST the manufacturers and the 
businesses in Ontario would save over a billion dollars by being 
able to deduct these costs they could not deduct at that time on the 
sales tax in Ontario. He also said it has been one of those areas of 
major competitive disadvantage that Ontario manufacturers have 
had. He went on to say that Ontario businesses have had it.
<P>
	I repeated this last week but perhaps the hon. member forgot. 
The premier of Ontario said: ``Stop the rhetoric, stop the politics, 
stop the finger pointing, get on with harmonization and 
simplification of the GST''. That is what he said and he was right.

	Yesterday, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration admitted 
in this House that the operation conducted in Quebec on the eve of 
the referendum, to  speed up the issuance of certificates of 
citizenship, was of a particular nature and required unprecedented 
efforts.
<P>
	However, whenever he was asked about this operation, the 
former immigration minister always downplayed it, saying that it 
was similar to those conducted in other provinces before an 
election.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister explain that his former immigration 
minister tried to downplay the operation conducted in Quebec just 
before the referendum, if not to hide from Quebecers the fact that 
Ottawa was doing its utmost to influence the outcome of the 
referendum?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I made myself very clear yesterday and I will do it 
again today. My predecessor, the current Minister of the 
Environment, did not deny at all the fact that we were making a 
special effort in Quebec, before the referendum, to issue 
certificates of citizenship to those who were entitled to them, just 
like we are making a particular effort now in British Columbia, 
where a provincial election will soon be held. Again, efforts are 
being made in British Columbia to speed up the issuance of 
citizenship certificates.
<P>
	The right to vote is a fundamental one in our country and if 
people have such a right, we must do our utmost to make sure they 
can exercise it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this government is really pushing its limits. The minister 
should read carefully what her colleague said, which is the opposite 
of what she claims.
<P>
	Of course he said that it was the same for any election. However, 
the government made a special effort in the case of the referendum. 
On checking, we found out that, in the case of the election held 
shortly before in Ontario, nothing special was done. As for British 
Columbia, if they did something special, then they only started 
yesterday, because as of last week nothing had been done.

was absolutely normal and the other confirming that the federal 
government did make a particular effort?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is no contradiction between the two statements 
made. As evidence of that, one simply has to look at the number of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2435"> 2435 </A></B>

citizenship certificates issued in 1995 in Quebec, in comparison to 
the 1994 figure. In 1994, about 40,000 certificates were issued, 
while the total number for 1995  will be around 43,000. As for 
British Columbia, 27,000 certificates were issued in 1994, while 
8,000 more will have been issued in 1995.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the auditor 
general disclosed today that Revenue Canada has approved a very 
questionable tax loophole for the rich. The loophole has allowed $2 
billion of assets from family trusts to leave the country tax free.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Why did the 
government take two and a half years to close a secret loophole that 
has cost hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenues while 
refusing to back off one inch on the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the new Minister of National Revenue I can say that I 
welcome my first advice from the auditor general.
<P>
	The case in point refers to two tax rulings in 1985 and 1991 
reviewed by the auditor general which predate our government. He 
raised some very important issues. I sat down with the auditor 
general. I went through his report  line by line to be sure that I was 
clear what his concerns were and to ask him for his views on 
appropriate action.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	I am glad to say he was clear and identified three areas of 
concern. His ideas for action were consistent with my own and 
along with the Minister of Finance we have been able to implement 
that action as we speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we really 
need to know whether the minister or the auditor general is running 
the department. That is the type of answer we want.
<P>
	When we take a look at the facts we find that every bureaucrat 
involved in decision making said that in a way it was a tax 
loophole. That is well documented in every meeting they had, but 
when it got to the final meeting with senior bureaucrats and 
perhaps even politicians-we do not know-there were no 
minutes, no record, and the decision was reversed.
<P>
	Will the minister explain to the taxpayers of Canada why they 
have to pay their income taxes while the rich and powerful can get 
a backroom, under the table deal to save hundreds of millions of 
dollars?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this occurred in 1991. I want the hon. member to 
understand that we have taken the matter extremely seriously.
<P>
	Let us be clear. The auditor general has said that he has some 
concerns about potential ambiguities in the Income Tax Act. He 
wants them to be clarified. So do we.
<P>
	We have asked that the finance committee review these 
particular aspects of the Income Tax Act and report back to us. We 
will look forward to its recommendations.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning the auditor general added his voice to the growing number 
of critics of Correctional Services Canada. In a scathing 
confirmation that quantifies what we have been claiming all along, 
his overall impression of the government and its bureaucracy was 
that of a rudderless ship with no one at the helm.
<P>
	My question is for the acting solicitor general. If the most 
important aspect of the two-part mandate of CSC is rehabilitation, 
why is it spending a mere 7 per cent of its $1 billion budget on 
rehabilitation while the bureaucrats squander another 93 per cent 
on operating costs?
<P>

General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the auditor general's 
report came out this morning. The solicitor general has looked at

<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade we have made substantial progress 
in terms of the world trading system.
<P>
	We have a system that is much more open, liberalized, clearer 
and with fairer rules than ever before. We have had substantial 
leadership from the United States and we continue to need that 
leadership.
<P>
	We do not need the Americans to pull back into a protectionist 
mode. That will not serve their interests or anybody's interests. We 
do not need bills like the Helms-Burton bill wherein they start to 
take action against their friends, their neighbours and their major 
trading partners because they are trying to get at another country 
such as Cuba in this case.

still need their leadership in terms of having liberalized and clear

Mr. Speaker, the government says that it believes in integrity and

	At the same time it allowed a senior military official to spend an 
outrageous $250,000 on a change of command party. That is a 
quarter of a million taxpayer dollars spent by Major General 
McInnis on a party for himself.

	Obviously the chain of command at the defence department has

outrageous waste of taxpayers' money?

It is extravagant. It is unacceptable.
<P>
	I disagree with the conclusion of the hon. member. We have a 
new commander of the army. We have a new chief of defence staff 
who has laid down the rules in no uncertain terms to senior military 
officers that they have to behave in a way with the public's money

conference he mentioned a few moments ago.
<P>
	I would like to know, on the one hand, whether the Prime 
Minister can tell us today the agenda of the proposed conference, 
which is to take place very soon, in June, and, on the other, whether 
he intends to move on respecting his referendum promises, 
including the promise to enshrine in the Constitution the 
recognition of Quebec as a distinct society?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the agenda is not ready at this time. The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs met with representatives of most 
governments and consulted them regarding the agenda, which will 
be made known when we have finalized it. I will meet next week 
with the premier of Quebec. The minister will be in Quebec City on 
Thursday of this week, and we must also speak with representatives 
of other governments.
<P>
	The agenda is not ready yet, but when it is, we will be happy to 
table it in the House.
<P>
	As for the promise I made, I submitted a resolution in this very 
House to that effect. In order to enshrine it in the Canadian 
Constitution, the consent of the  Government of Quebec is 
necessary. I would be only too glad if Bloc Quebecois members 
across the way could arrange to have the premier of Quebec tell us 
that he wants distinct society enshrined in the Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	I am certain that the House of Commons will be delighted to pass 
the bill, with the approval of the required number of Canadian 
provinces. But the Government of Quebec must tell us that that is 
what it wants. We cannot do this unilaterally, because the 
Constitution does not allow us to.

question is in relation to the disease known as BSE.
<P>
	The key point which bears repeating is that there is absolutely no 
evidence that BSE exists in Canada and therefore it cannot enter the 
food chain.
<P>
	Recently the World Health Organization has made certain 
recommendations to countries about what they might do with 
respect to BSE. I am pleased to note that the vast majority of those 
recommendations were introduced in Canada a long time ago, well 
before the fact and not after it.

cent, and with the Nisga'a soon to be guaranteed by treaty about 27 
per cent of Nass River production, and with at least two other Nass

the Canadian Human Rights Act, as reported (without amendment)

from a document showing that according to the Canadian AIDS

<P>
	I was challenged to present that document. I would like to 
present it to the Speaker at this time. It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That we all take part in homophobia when we deny basic rights like spousal 
benefits to lesbian and gay couples.</BLOCKQUOTE>
I just wanted to bring that to your attention.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There being unanimous consent on the 
tabling of this document, it is so done.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I was not here, but I am told that unanimous consent was given 
before. I hear the chief whip for the government agreeing with that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
conclusion of my intervention prior to the question period I was 
trying to make the point that an amendment should be moved that 
would ensure all Canadians continue to have the most closely held 
values in our society, namely the freedom of association and 
freedom of worship. Further, the state should not be intervening in 
issues that have to do with the church. That has to do with Motion 
No. 10 by my colleague from Edmonton.
<P>
	My colleague from Port Moody also added Motions Nos. 13 and 
14. Motion No. 13 adds a new clause which states that sexual 
orientation will not affect the enforcement of provisions of the 
Criminal Code and Motion No. 14 adds a new clause to affirm that 
nothing in the bill will result in the extension of same sex benefits.
<P>
	Members have received rather hollow assurances from the 
spokespersons for the government that this legislation will do no 
such thing. I draw to the attention of the government that we have 
an out of control constitutional industry that is populated by high 
priced lawyers located primarily here in Ottawa who do nothing but 
look at the laws that we currently have on the books. What do we 
find but that we have a constitutional industry or overriding 
legislation, such as this legislation would be which overrides all 
sorts of laws and provisions in law.
<P>
	I suggest there is no way that the government and the justice 
minister in good conscience can say that this legislation will not 
form a future challenge to existing legislation.
<P>
	I wish to quote the member for Mississauga South who today 
said: ``The fundamental point is that all legislation, all policy, is by 
its very nature discriminatory. Discrimination is not all bad. We all 
agree that there is unjust discrimination. It is the positive 
discrimination or, in American terms affirmative action, that 
allows us to discriminate in favour of the family because of its 
special status. We discriminate in favour of disabled people,  
aboriginal people, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2440"> 2440 </A></B>
<P>
seniors, just to name a few. Discrimination is not all unjust. It 
reflects societal norms and values''.
<P>
	I agree with the member. Perhaps his logical, common sense 
intervention in this debate is an example of why so many of the 
members who have been in the House all day long on the Liberal 
side have been denied the ability to become involved in this debate. 
They have a point of view that happens to be contrary to all the 
right thinking Liberals, if you know what I mean, Mr. Speaker, all 
of those Liberals who know what is right for Canada and will 
impose it on us whether we like it or not.
<P>
	What is the scandal of this legislation and the way in which it is 
being jammed through this House? The scandal is the massive 
hypocrisy of the Liberal government on this issue. There are people 
in the Liberal benches who believe the same things that I and my 
colleagues in the Reform Party believe, indeed the vast majority of 
Canadians believe, that this is bad, ill-thought out, unnecessary 
legislation. Yet this government in its hypocrisy is denying them 
the right to stand up and speak, to which I say to this government, 
shame on you.
<P>
	In conclusion, this is a very difficult and very emotional debate 
for many people in Canada to whom this is a very closely held 
value. I recognize that.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	However, it does not change the fact that denying people the 
right to express their points of view in the House of Commons is 
absolute censorship and dictatorship on the part of this government 
and it should not be countenanced by anyone in the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I comment in general on Bill C-33 I will comment 
on some information that has been conveyed from the other side of 
the House about censorship and not allowing debate.
<P>
	If I remember correctly, when second reading of this bill came to 
a free vote, some government members voted for and some against. 
The Reform Party voted as a block with no free votes, 29-zip. We 
will have to see where there is democracy and where there is not.
<P>
	The issue before us is far too important for that type of 
suggestion from the member. Let us talk about the substance of this 
bill which I think is important. I agree with the member when he 
says that it is controversial.
<P>
	Some of the words in the legislation worry people, they scare 
people. Some people feel, I do not think accurately, that their 
lifestyles and beliefs are threatened. They are not threatened.
<P>
	This bill is not about special rights for anyone or even about 
special privileges for individuals. It is about equal rights for all of 
us. It is about protecting through the law the rights of our fellow 
humans not to be discriminated  against, not to lose their jobs 
because of their sexual orientation, their race or their religion.
<P>
	If ever we needed to fight for this legislative protection, we saw 
that reason very clearly last week when we heard the comments of 
some of the members who sit opposite. Some of their comments 
reflect prejudice and intolerance. We heard outrageous comments. 
Those comments have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that 
discrimination exists in Canadian society and it is imperative for 
government to deal with that. That discrimination is shameful.
<P>
	Discrimination is a total violation of all that we as Canadians 
hold dear. Firing someone, sending someone to the back of the shop 
because of who they are or what they are, be it race, gender, sexual 
orientation or religion is simply wrong.
<P>
	As a government we need to show leadership on this issue. It is 
our duty to lead by example and to amend the human rights act to 
outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. As I said earlier, 
the recent press reports of last week make that very very clear.
<P>
	I am a strong supporter of the family and I wholeheartedly 
believe that families will continue to act as pillars of strength and 
unity in our society. I also wholeheartedly believe in human rights 
for all and that is why I speak in support of these rights for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act already contains a list of 
prohibited grounds of discrimination. Adding sexual orientation to 
that list would help ensure that Canadians cannot be discriminated 
against in such areas as employment, accommodation, access to 
goods and services solely because of their sexual orientation.
<P>
	This is not about the extension of benefits to same sex couples. It 
is not about changing the definition of marriage, family or spouse. 
The bill we are debating today simply guarantees the rights of 
individuals to live their lives free of discrimination.
<P>
	We are also affirming the importance of the family as a 
foundation of Canadian society. I quote from the preamble to the 
bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And whereas the Government recognizes and affirms the importance of 
family as the foundation of Canadian society and that nothing in this Act alters 
its fundamental role in society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I could vote against this amendment to the human rights act. I 
am sure that voting against it would make some of my constituents 
happy, just as it would disappoint others.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	However, at the end of the day my time as a parliamentarian will 
come to an end and I will have to answer to myself. Was it right 
what I did? Did I do what I believed in? Did I do what I believed 
was right for Canada and for Canadians?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2441"> 2441 </A></B>
<P>
	I will be able to answer yes because discrimination is wrong and 
saying it is wrong is exactly what is right. Someone ought to tell the 
Reform Party that.
<P>
	I wish to tell the Reform Party that discrimination is wrong and 
just saying it is wrong is simply not good enough. It is the actions 
we take in the House as parliamentarians that people will 
remember and act on. It is the action that we take in passing the bill 
that will clearly demonstrate to Canadians that discrimination is 
wrong and will not be tolerated in Canadian society.
<P>
	I ask the members of the Reform Party to join with me in voting 
for this amendment so that their actions state clearly, as their recent 
words have, that they also believe discrimination is wrong.
<P>
	There is a pressing need for this legislation. I hope the members 
opposite will do what is right and support the passage of this 
amendment.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we have an obligation to Canadians. We 
have an obligation to our constituents. We also have an obligation 
to do what is right for the nation, which is to state clearly and 
unequivocally that discrimination is not acceptable and will not be 
tolerated.
<P>
	If supporting this legislation costs me votes in the next election, 
so be it. If it costs me friends, I will have to live with that as well 
because I believe discrimination on any grounds is wrong. I will 
back that belief with my vote and the vote of my constituents who 
share this conviction and who want their children to grow up in a 
world free of hatred and bias. For those reasons I will vote in 
favour of this at third reading.

the Canadian Human Rights Act, as reported (without amendment) 
from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had a lot of appointments made in advance when the bill 
suddenly came up and so I was not here to vote on first and second 
reading. I assure the House I am here to stay now until the bill has 
been completed at both report stage and third reading and that I am 
clearly voting against the bill. I will be voting in favour of the 
amendments but I do not expect to get much support for that from 
the majority of Liberals opposite.
<P>
	They suggest this is a free vote. I think we should clarify this. I 
do not think there can be any argument on that side that it is a free 
vote. Had it not been a free vote they would have had just about the 
same number of Liberals voting against it in any case, which would 
have presented tremendous problems for the Prime Minister in 
light of recent actions on their side, their own peculiar version of 
Liberal democracy.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	It is interesting that despite the fact there is a free vote, there is 
an extremely restricted right of free speech on the Liberal side. We 
have witnessed that and I am sure we will continue to witness it as 
the the debate carries on.
<P>
	I am opposed to various types of discrimination, much of which 
has been stated in the bill. The problem with the bill is that it does 
not deal solely with those areas of discrimination. It opens up broad 
doors where someone can say that is not what they meant, and 
someone else could say they think it means this or they think it 
means that.
<P>
	We know the kinds of problems that happens to legislation, even 
good legislation, which I would not categorize this as at all. After 
continuous lobbying, the Minister of Justice finally agreed to pass 
legislation banning the drunken defence. What happened? The 
courts said that is not quite the way they interpret the Constitution 
in any case. There have been cases where that has been overturned. 
Despite the fact that the entire House passed legislation, the courts 
have made their own interpretation. When we put something like 
this in the open and deal with the courts we open up an incredibly 
bad can of worms.
<P>
	Some of the amendments deal with clarifications of various 
concerns that people think the bill may come to represent, things 
like alterations to the Criminal Code or ways to circumvent the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2442"> 2442 </A></B>
<P>
Criminal Code, possible situations where there will be special 
programs because  of sexual orientation. These are things people 
are concerned about, particularly in my riding.
<P>
	The previous speaker said he has to vote the way he thinks is 
right. I have to vote the way my constituents think is right. They 
did not elect me to be their ruler. They elected me to be their 
representative. Every member of the House as the elected 
representative of the people of their riding should represent the will 
of those people.
<P>
	Some people in my constituency are very concerned about some 
things that are already happening. I will read from a pamphlet 
funded in part by the federal government. It found its way into 
schools and the community college in my riding under the guise of 
AIDS literature. I assure the House that I will restrict and censor 
the way I read this, but the House may still find it offensive. It is 
not my intention to offend anyone. If the Chair sees fit to intervene 
at any time because it sees this as offensive, I fully understand. 
Keep in mind this is after censoring has been applied to a 
government funded document.
<P>
	This states choices for, in my word, fornication. It mentions 
things like fisting. Fisting is the insertion of the entire hand inside 
someone's body: ``Fisting can create serious tears in the anus or 
vagina. In the interest of safe sex the safe choice for fisting is to 
wear a rubber glove''. This is from the Man to Man Society, funded 
by the government.
<P>
	It mentions toys. I will not get into what it suggests should be 
done with these toys. It is suggested how to have safer sex with 
toys: ``Make sure you clean the toys you share''.
<P>
	It also deals with shaving, piercing and branding. It suggests that 
when branding with a knife, ideally a disposable scalpel be used. It 
suggests that branding with heat, a branding iron, is much safer 
because the heat kills the virus. It talks about how to use electric 
torture. The safer choice for electric torture: ``Thoroughly clean 
anything exposed to body fluids and blood''. This is a bad 
document. I have trouble reading some of the things in here.
<P>
	I think the point has been made. This is just one of several 
documents. This is not a document I found somewhere in some 
obscure specialty bookstore. This is a document in the public 
school system in my riding. That is why people in my riding are 
mad, upset and concerned.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	I have many constituents, not a huge majority obviously, I want 
to make that clear, who are part of the homosexual community. 
These are not rampant people like in Gay Pride and in some of 
these strange parades promoting the homosexual lifestyle. These 
are regular citizens who contribute to the economy of our area. 
They participate in community events. They run businesses. The 
people in my riding have no problem with people  simply because a 
man happens, through choice or otherwise, to fall in love with 
another man, or a woman a woman. That is not what is at issue.
<P>
	What is at issue is the bill is loosely written, so wide open, 
people are afraid of how it will be interpreted by the courts. I 
explained what happened with the drunken defence after it left here 
a good bill. They are concerned about this kind of garbage ending 
up in our school system, about the promotion of their right to 
promote an alternate life style openly to things like marriage 
benefits for same sex couples.
<P>
	I live in a rural community. I live in a western, outdoors, rural 
community. It has a beautiful hunting area and everything. I belong 
to a trap and skeet club. I am active with it. It is a very prominent 
activity in my riding. When Bill C-68 came out, it got tremendous 
response opposing it.
<P>
	Since I became a member of Parliament I received 
correspondence on all things, with more opposition for the 
possibility of marriage benefits to same sex couples aspect alone in 
Bill C-41 than I have for any other things, including Bill C-68.
<P>
	To date there has been a short amount of time available to people 
to mobilize, something I really object to. The previous NDP 
government in Ontario came out with a bill like this. It had free 
discussions and a free vote. The difference was it did not rush it 
through committee or debate. Closure was not used.
<P>
	It gave the citizens in the communities of this province the time 
to mobilize to let their elected officials know where they stood. It is 
my opinion the Liberal government is rushing this through in order 
not to allow people not only in Ontario but in the rest of the country 
to mobilize. That notwithstanding, they have.
<P>
	To provide balance, I will read from the file I have from people 
who are in favour. I want to be balanced. Because I want to be 
complete, I will read both of them. One suggests they are writing to 
support quick passage of Bill C-33 because it fulfils a commitment. 
That is the strongest argument they use in their letter. In the other 
one they want to make it clear that they view sexual relationships 
between consulting adults as a personal matter. So do I.
<P>
	What people do in the privacy of their homes, within reason, is a 
general concept I have no difficulty with. I can give more from this 
pamphlet. It suggests we should go into the homes a little.
<P>
	I do not think we should refuse to hire someone, fire them or 
refuse to allow them to rent an apartment simply because their 
orientation is different from ours if we care to define it.
<P>
	I cannot remember the official name of it, but there is the 
man-boy love society. Pedophilia is a sexual orientation. That I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2443"> 2443 </A></B>
<P>
completely and totally against. I  hope everybody in the House 
is. If it is not defined, if one just says sexual orientation, it 
leaves us open.
<P>
	Allow me, because I have a lot of opposition to this, to read a 
couple. One says: ``Each Canadian as a person is already protected. 
Why must what happens in the privacy of one's bedroom need the 
protection of the law?''
<P>
	Another says: ``This is an immediate and grave threat to the 
natural family. A homosexual as a person is entitled to respect 
because of his humanity, not because of his sexual behaviour''.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	The protections are there. If we need to clarify then it should be 
clear. This bill is not clear. This bill is incredibly vague. The 
amendments proposed now at report stage attempt to clarify many 
aspects of the bill. They were made by people who object to this 
bill. They are saying that if we must have this bill, let us at least 
make its intent clear. Let us have what the government says it 
means but has not said in the bill.
<P>
	I urge members opposite to seriously consider accepting the 
amendments that have been put forward. Without these 
amendments the House can be assured I will vote against Bill C-33.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been listening to this debate for too many years. For those 
with a deep interest in the issue of human rights in Canada and the 
introduction of sexual orientation as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination and for those with serious and legitimate concerns 
about Bill C-33, I would like to recommend the speech given at 
second reading by my colleague, the Minister of Justice, for their 
enlightenment.
<P>
	They will find the answers to many of the questions and to some 
of the concerns which I legitimately recognize are from the depths 
of their hearts. I understand that.
<P>
	We would be foolish if we did not acknowledge that over time 
there have been misunderstandings, stereotypes, myths, 
misrepresentations and all the words that one would care to use. 
However, the bottom line is that there are groups of people in this 
country who suffer from discrimination. They suffer from 
prejudice, they suffer from bias. Within that group, which is a 
major group-we just have to turn on the Internet to see what I am 
talking about-there are people who have a different orientation 
with respect to the expression of their sexuality.
<P>
	In the time I have today I am not able to explain as clearly and in 
such an enlightened way as the minister did. He has expressed, as 
we have all expressed in our remarks, why we are not adding a 
special right and why we are being very defined and confined in our 
view that there is a segment of our population which is suffering  
from discrimination. This is not the Canadian way. This is not how 
we care to address these issues. Adding sexual orientation to 
section 3 of the human rights act completes the list which was 
intended with respect to the prohibition of grounds of 
discrimination.
<P>
	As the chairman of the Standing Committee on Human Rights 
and the Status of the Disabled, I have found that this bill is in some 
way a logical progression of the work I have done over many years 
in this House. I have had a great interest in the field of human 
rights. When the charter of rights and freedoms was first 
introduced in 1982 there was a three-year hiatus during which time 
the question of section 15, the question of the application of 
non-discrimination and a list of those areas in which people were 
most vulnerable were included in this charter.
<P>
	We were asked to look at section 15, study it and see how to 
bring it into force by the year 1985. Time allocation was an 
extremely interesting eye opener. We looked at many areas of 
discrimination, including the elderly, the disabled, women and 
children. We went through a whole range of acts, including those 
related to the economy, insurance and all aspects of our daily lives.
<P>
	I was proud to be a member of that very hard working, all-party 
committee which examined, inquired into and reported on equal 
rights. We looked at areas in which federal law had to be changed 
so the rights of the individual would be respected. The committee 
was convinced after consulting Canadians across this country that 
``to leave any one group of citizens beyond the pale is a dangerous 
precedent. In a democracy it is equally dangerous to leave the 
decision about inclusion or exclusion of any particular group from 
human rights safeguards to the will of the public or at any moment 
in the course of our history''.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Many people react to questions involving homosexuality on a 
visceral level. We have heard that reaction in this House. I think 
they are expressing some serious concerns which they have been 
exposed to over a long period of time. This reaction reflects 
longstanding attitudes and stereotypes in our society. It is time we 
wiped the cobwebs and put the facts on the table.
<P>
	We are dealing with a question of public policy that must be 
reasoned through. We have reasoned this through since 1985. 
Minorities in our society need protection to put them on an equal 
footing with all others.
<P>
	Because the government provides legal protection, does not 
mean it endorses a particular religion, a particular political belief 
or a personal trait. It simply means that in a free and democratic 
society, discrimination under our laws on the basis of those 
differences will not be tolerated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2444"> 2444 </A></B>
<P>
	We have said many times in the House that racism is not to be 
tolerated, ageism is not to be tolerated. We have removed the 
obligation to fire people based on age. We have looked at racism 
and we have developed a whole series of programs to address the 
unfounded targeting, particularly of people who are visible 
minorities.
<P>
	In 1985, the committee met Canadians of all ages, professions 
and religions who were gay. For many of us this was our first 
contact with people who professed this kind of lifestyle. In all 
honesty and all candour, we were a bit shocked. First we were 
shocked by the number of people we met. In every city we went to, 
in all the towns and villages there were people who had chosen a 
lifestyle that we had not chosen. They live everywhere. They are 
part of the larger family and I guarantee that if members look at 
their families, they will find people with homosexual preferences.
<P>
	Minorities in our society need protection. Provision of legal 
protection does not mean we endorse their approaches. 
Discrimination under our laws on the basis of those differences is 
what we are talking about and will not tolerate.
<P>
	We met these people. We heard details about physical abuse, and 
psychological oppression from which they have suffered. We heard 
about the hate propaganda which had been targeted toward them 
and that they had been demonized in many ways. We heard about 
the outright discrimination they faced in employment, in housing 
and in services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some, moreover, were apprehensive about coming before the 
committee, for fear of losing their jobs or their homes.
<P>
	That was what the situation in Canada was like just 10 years ago, 
in a country that boasted of its justice, compassion, tolerance and 
mutual respect, but did not extend them to people with a different 
sexual orientation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My colleagues and I, some of whom had never before been 
aware of or been very concerned about the discrimination faced by 
homosexuals and lesbian Canadians, submitted to this House a 
unanimous report called ``Equality for All''. In it we recommended 
that sexual orientation be added to section 15 of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act as a prohibited ground of discrimination.
<P>
	If members would care to read the document which contains 
some of the things we heard, they will see we used the term sexual 
orientation. It could have been any one of a number of different 
terms. This term is used and referred to very often worldwide. It is 
an inclusive ground of exclusion. It covers homosexuals, 
heterosexuals and transgendered Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> What about pedophiles?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Pedophiles have nothing to do with this law. 
The member's ignorance is absolutely abominable. Go as a 
parliamentarian and understand pedophiles and the whole question 
of criminal acts in this society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That was the least we could do to meet the charter requirements, 
to ensure that Canadian values had any true meaning, and to 
maintain our country's reputation for justice.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Last week when the standing committee heard witnesses on this 
bill I learned that not much had changed. We were told of a lesbian 
couple on a train that was ordered to stop holding hands or be 
thrown off. We learned about ongoing dismissal in our forces and 
of employees here on the Hill, which you might want to look into, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We heard the story of a homosexual building manager who had 
been in his job for years without a single complaint, and who was 
let go when the management learned that he was gay.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have been told by parents of gay and lesbian children that 
they had to face their own prejudices. They had a lot to learn, as do 
many members of the House. They were very concerned for their 
children's well-being, knowing they would have to face ignorance, 
hatred and discrimination.
<P>
	No one in the House, and I have been here to witness not less 
than seven-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, the hon. member's time has 
expired. Is there unanimous consent for her to continue for one 
minute?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been no less than seven 
justice ministers who I have had to listen to in this House. They all 
made promises to make sexual orientation a prohibited ground of 
discrimination. Not one of them did. Gay and lesbian Canadians 
have paid the price until now.
<P>
	We are very fortunate to have a minister who is prepared to move 
ahead to finally give gays and lesbians the same status, the same 
protection from discrimination as all other Canadians now enjoy: 
nothing more, nothing less. The bill will not, as many members 
fear, have anything to do with being protected in three areas. There 
will be no changes in the definitions of marriage or family. It will 
not legalize criminal sexual behaviour. It will not confer benefits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2445"> 2445 </A></B>
<P>
	I find it somewhat unfair and irresponsible for hon. members of 
this House to say that those issues will be covered in the bill. They 
know perfectly well it is not so. They are using this issue to 
promote their own ends. The bill does not confer benefits. It does 
not cover illegal acts or criminal acts. It does not change the 
definition of family.
<P>
	If we want to have the discussion at some time about the state of 
the family, we should put it on the agenda. The state of the family is 
a reflection of economic, social and political realities in the country 
at this time. Those factors are causing some of the concerns 
regarding families.
<P>
	Lesbians have families. Gays have families. There are 
reconstituted families. There are common law families. There are 
all kinds of families. This bill deals with sexual orientation and 
asks that as a group these people not be discriminated against. It is 
only fair.
<P>
	When was the last time that granting equal rights to women 
diminished the rights of-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has certainly had more 
than a minute to wrap up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel honoured 
that I was able to make the list to speak on this bill.
<P>
	We are at a crossroads in our country because of the process on 
which we have embarked and the results which will undoubtedly 
follow from this bill.
<P>
	I am very concerned about the procedure that has been followed. 
It seems that respect for the law and respect for government are a 
direct result of members of Parliament representing their 
constituents, of being careful to listen to what the people of Canada 
are saying.
<P>
	There is a growing disrespect for certain governments that, 
without the consent of the people, have imposed different rules, 
regulations and laws on Canadian citizens without their consent. 
The best example of that is the GST which has seized our attention 
in Parliament and across the country. During the election campaign 
of 1993 I heard over and over again the complaint that my 
predecessor did not represent his constituents on that issue.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	When we embark upon a change in law, an important bill such as 
this one, it is important that individual members of Parliament be 
given time to return to their constituencies to debate the precise 
wording of the bill and discuss its implications with the people.
<P>
	That process has been and is being denied to us. It is almost as if 
we had a question of privilege in terms of how we are hampered in 
effectiveness in doing our work.
<P>
	I feel frustrated that the government, through a motivation which 
I think is straight political expediency,  introduced the bill at this 
time. It was not in the long term plans. It was not mentioned in the 
throne speech. Suddenly at the end of January it was very important 
to prorogue Parliament to get a new start. Then there was a new 
throne speech with a list of all items the government considered to 
be priorities. The bill was not mentioned in the throne speech. The 
minister expressed approximately a month ago that it was not his 
intention or plan to introduce the legislation at this time.
<P>
	Why was it introduced? I confess to a growing amount of 
cynicism in the political process. I believe it was introduced as a 
simple tactic to divert the attention of the press and other media 
away from the extreme attacks the Liberal government was 
receiving on accountability, keeping promises made during the 
election campaign, the GST and other issues. It was brought 
forward as a strategy to divert criticism.
<P>
	That is unconscionable. I do not think the lives and well-being of 
Canadians and their families should somehow be put on the list of 
items which are disposable for political reasons.
<P>
	My second complaint is even greater, that is the necessity to 
invoke closure. It does not make any sense. When we want to 
rebuild trust in government, in the House of Commons and in 
Parliament why would we ram through a bill because we suspect if 
the people ever got to debate it there would be opposition and a 
great political fallout from it? It is unconscionable.
<P>
	Closure should be used for matters of dire emergency. It should 
be used when our country or our security is a stake and we need to 
bring an item to conclusion because there would be great 
consequences if it were not done right away.
<P>
	It is unconscionable of the government to close off debate in the 
House and in committee. Many Canadians sincerely want to have 
input. How much time were they given to prepare? I suppose they 
got a weekend and should not complain. Should they drop 
everything to make sure they get to Ottawa to appear before the 
committee to present their briefs? People were asked to respond in 
a very short period of time.
<P>
	The vote will be finished before a lot of people even know it is 
taking place, simply because it takes time to communicate to 
people. What would be wrong with giving us an opportunity to put 
the question fairly and squarely to the people we represent?
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	If the argument in favour of the legislation is strong surely it will 
have the support of the people. If it does not have the support of the 
people, let us be honest and admit that we are giving but a token 
acknowledgement to democracy. We are clearly abandoning the 
principle that the majority rules in a democracy. We are abandon-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2446"> 2446 </A></B>
<P>
ing the principle that the voters even count. I do not know  why we 
should bother with this process if there is such a limitation.
<P>
	I should like to make a few comments about the bill. A lot of 
people who support the legislation have tried over and over again to 
assure us that this is the end of it and that all we are talking about is 
discrimination.
<P>
	I will speak loudly and clearly in favour of principles that do not 
discriminate against individuals because of personal 
characteristics. However there are two real flaws in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act when it starts making lists. One flaw is the 
difficulty of not including all possible groups and individuals. The 
second flaw is just as important, that is somehow implying that 
anyone not on the list is fair game for discrimination.
<P>
	I reject that hypothesis. One of my main reasons for opposing the 
bill is that I am not on the list, which means it is correct and 
acceptable to discriminate against me.
<P>
	Members must be wondering what I am talking about. I am one 
of those people who some describe as being robust. Sometimes the 
word rotund is used and I am discriminated against because of my 
weight. It goes beyond being squeezed into economy seats in 
aeroplanes. It goes much beyond that. I was discriminated against 
in the House because of my weight.
<P>
	This is what happened. I used to work at the Northern Alberta 
Institute of Technology. As a staff member I was permitted to 
participate in its insurance plan. When I came here I thought I 
could replace it. I was refused participation in the House of 
Commons life insurance plan because of my weight. They did not 
take into account the fact that my dad is 85 and just as heavy as I 
am. They did not take any of these things into account. I am not on 
the list.
<P>
	In closing, the list is not complete until every Canadian is on it. 
That is the situation. Discrimination is not acceptable. All we are 
doing is adding to the list, which means by implication that 
everyone who has not yet made the list is fair game. I reject that 
hypothesis and I urge Liberal members, who have it in their power 
to do something about it, to vote against the bill because it is so 
wrong.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to enter the debate on Bill C-33.
<P>
	Before getting to the substance of the bill perhaps it would be 
good to take stock of our great country and to take a look at the 
evolution of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	There is no question that when the French and the English first 
came to the country a sizeable native population had its own nation. 
There is no question that over the years one shortcoming was the 
way we handled our native people. There is no question when we 
look at immigration to Canada from other places that we have had 
painful experiences of racism.
<P>
	I recall reading some articles on the evolution of the various 
groupings in Canada. I came across a part of a book with a poster 
which said: ``Help wanted. Irish need not apply''. My wife is Irish.
<P>
	There is not question the Chinese who helped build our railway 
were discriminated against as a group. Their spouses were not 
allowed to join them and they were kept in barrack-like conditions.
<P>
	What happened to Canadians with Japanese ancestry during the 
second world war is well known. They were uprooted, put in 
camps, dispersed outside British Columbia, and their properties 
were confiscated.
<P>
	In my community of Kitchener-Waterloo there is no question 
there were problems involving the German population. There was 
also discrimination against Italians during the second world war.
<P>
	Jews were discriminated against in this century and previous 
centuries. The <I>Spirit of St. Louis</I>, a boat carrying hundreds of Jews, 
was denied access to free ports. The people on it, mostly women

	I came to this country as a refugee in 1957 from Hungary. I am 
painfully aware of what is happening in Europe, the former

there are problems with minorities dealing with each other.
<P>
	When I was president of the federation of students at the 
University of Waterloo in the early seventies I heard of cases where 
people were denied accommodations because they were Chinese or 
of other ethnic origin. They were proven.
<P>
	Previous to that time we saw the great human rights debate in the 
United States wherein we came to know what we shall overcome 
means and what was being done to African Americans in the 
United States. Some of that was happening in Canada as well.

	In the late seventies a volunteer working for an organization in 
which I was executive director committed suicide because she 
could not bear to live in a world where homophobia was so strong.
<P>
	In 1990 during Desert Storm people with Arab and Jewish 
backgrounds in my community got together to try to bridge some 
of the gulf between their two communities and make sure what was 
happening in the Middle East would not spill over to our 
community.
<P>
	One result was the establishment of the Mayor's Race Relations 
Commission in the Waterloo region to foster understanding among 
the various groupings in our community.
<P>
	It is not difficult to recognize that bigotry is alive and well. It 
certainly has been expressed in the Chamber. I noticed in today's 
paper that the Reform Party member for Calgary Southeast 
questioned her place in a party whose members espouse racist and 
bigoted views. It comes from the incident last week when the 
former whip of the Reform Party told Canadians that it was okay to 
fire somebody on the basis of their sexual orientation, that it was 
okay to fire somebody or to move someone of a different colour to 
the back of the shop.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately too many people in the third party express those 
views. It is unfortunate that those views are put forward by 
members of Parliament. The job of members of Parliament should 
be to try to bridge various communities, not to drive them further 
apart by setting community against community. What makes this 
country so great is we have learned from our past experiences and 
we have worked on building a tolerant society.
<P>
	The question as to whether the issue before us should be subject 
to a free vote or whether it should be subject to party discipline was 
one that was debated prior to the decision being taken last week. I 
was of two minds on that issue.
<P>
	I believe that the bill deals basically with human rights and 
equality of Canadians. We also say that someone is not going to be 
fired on the basis of their sexual orientation. Also, a bank for 
example will not be able to deny service to someone on the basis of 
their sexual orientation. To me that is a human rights issue. Some 
of my colleagues in the Liberal Party have said that for them it is a 
moral issue.
<P>
	Originally I told our party whip that I considered this to be a 
party vote and I wanted us to vote along party lines. I listened to the 
debate. I saw what happened in this House when the former Reform 
Party whip stood up and made those comments. Not only did he 
make those comments, many of the members around him 
supported those comments, including the leadership. When that 
happened I said to myself, I want this to be a free vote. When this 
issue comes on the floor of the House of  Commons I want the 
people of this country to know that we are allowed to vote our 
conscience on it.
<P>
	I am very proud to be voting in favour of the bill. I am very 
proud to stand up for this bill which is going to help make Canada 
the best country in the world. It is going to take us forward to be a 
more tolerant society.
<P>
	I do not think that any Canadian would ever believe that 
someone should be denied a job based on their sexual orientation. I 
do not believe that any Canadian would want someone rejected for 
a bank loan on the basis of their sexual orientation.
<P>
	I am sad that some people would misrepresent the bill and bring 
forward issues that are totally false, for example, that once we pass 
the bill we are legalizing pedophilia. That is a red herring which 
has been thrown out by people who want to keep the status quo. 
They are sad that we actually have human rights legislation in 
Canada and would undermine this bill.
<P>
	This bill does not give anything to people based on sexual 
orientation that other Canadians do not have. It makes sure that 
they are not denied what other Canadians can have.
<P>
	I will be proud to stand in my place to vote for this legislation. 
The people of Canada will be proud of us as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as usual I 
am pleased to debate the bills before us in this House.
<P>
	Bill C-33 is another bill that has raised some serious debate 
across the country and rightly so. I will raise three issues on which I 
believe hon. members on the other side have not given any real 
serious consideration.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	First, this bill deals with the workplace. It deals with the working 
environment of government, crown corporations and industries that 
are federally regulated. We already have a law on the books which 
deals with sex in the workplace called sexual harassment.
<P>
	Sexual harassment is completely outlawed in the workplace and 
rightly so. Anyone who feels they are going to impose some kind of 
sexual overtones needs to be punished. We will not tolerate that in 
the workplace. Sexual harassment has been defined to be more than 
physical assault. It considers such things as discussion of sexual 
innuendo, sexual prowess, sexual adventure, anything sexual in the 
workplace that offends someone else. That is the way it should be.
<P>
	Therefore, to provide sexual orientation in the workplace is in 
direct contravention to the law that already exists which says that 
sexual harassment is not allowed. Now we are going to say that 
sexual orientation is allowed, and sexual harassment is not 
allowed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2448"> 2448 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not know why the government thinks that sexual orientation 
in the workplace, however that manifests itself-and I am not sure 
how-is acceptable. People can walk down any street and I am sure 
they will pass people of a different sexual orientation and never 
know what they are. Somehow or other we are going to say it is 
perfectly acceptable to demonstrate sexual orientation in the 
workplace, yet sexual harassment is absolutely and totally illegal. 
This is a total contradiction of the facts which this government has 
not considered as it pushes the bill through against the wishes of 
many Canadians.
<P>
	Second, there are many Canadians who find the term sexual 
orientation to be code words for homosexuality and lesbianism. 
Some people find these acts repulsive and repugnant and are 
opposed to legal sanction being granted to them by this House. The 
Reform Party has a responsibility to represent that opposing point 
of view. There are some people who feel these types of issues 
should not be entrenched in legislation.
<P>
	It is important to give expression to those who are opposed to the 
point of view that is being put forth by the government. It is 
important to recognize that these people hold these views quite 
legitimately. They are entitled to their opinions. They are entitled 
to see their opinions expressed. These opinions are being expressed 
freely by the Reform Party. I hope they are expressed by more than 
just a few of the people on the other side who have to summon the 
courage to stand up against their colleagues in the Liberal Party and 
give free expression to the large number of people in their ridings 
whom they represent that they do not agree with this bill.
<P>
	Third, this bill has been in the public domain of debate for the 
last two or three weeks. Something else has been around for the last 
two or three thousand years, the moral code we call the 
Judeo-Christian principles. We could say they have withstood the 
test of time. These are principles such as thou shalt not kill, thou 
shalt respect thy father and thy mother, thou shalt not commit 
adultery, and so on.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	When we look at those and what we have done in the last 25 
years, we find that this House of Parliament has abandoned the 
principle of thou shalt not kill. It does not even express an opinion 
on abortion any more. We do not have a law in this country against 
abortion. In Canada 100,000 unborn children are being aborted 
every year. We have turned our backs on an expression which is 
3,000 years old: Thou shalt not kill.
<P>
	The hon. member for Burnaby espouses the principle that we 
should take away the principle of thou shalt not kill. Now we are 
focusing on the older generation. Euthanasia is almost upon us. 
That will be debated in this House at some point in the future. If we 
measure the old principle and moral code of thou shalt honour thy 
father and thy mother against the debate on euthanasia which  is on 
the horizon, we have to ask ourselves what is going on.
<P>
	I ask all members of the House to weigh a code which has been 
around for 3,000 years against the debate which has been going on 
for approximately three weeks. I would say to government 
members and my colleagues in the Bloc that if these principles 
have withstood the test of time for 3,000 years, and thousands of 
people have died for them and committed their lives to upholding 
them, surely there must be something in them that we should not 
lightly cast aside.
<P>
	I sincerely hope that government members and Bloc members 
will give serious thought to that point. While they may think they 
are in command of all the facts and while they may think it is the 
right thing to do, let us remember that for 3,000 years we have had 
a code which says that what we are about to do is wrong, what we 
have recently done regarding abortion is wrong, and what we may 
do in the very near future regarding euthanasia is wrong.
<P>
	We are dropping a moral code which we have had for 3,000 years 
into the trash can. We are saying that members of the House and the 
people on the street in Canada today are imbued with a sense of 
wisdom and knowledge which far exceeds the people who lived on 
this earth in the last 3,000 years. That is a note of caution.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to weigh the issue very carefully. In my 
humble opinion we will be wrong if we approve this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I usually like 
to begin my speeches with the salutation that I am happy to engage 
in the debate. Unfortunately, I find that the debate on Bill C-33 has 
caused confusion and indeed hostility and division even within my 
own community.
<P>
	The general public still questions the integrity of members of 
this place. I note the recent publication of a survey by Ekos 
Research which discovered that only 15 per cent of the general 
public places trust in elected officials. I have often taken the time to 
consider why this should be so. It seems to me it is because many 
believe that politicians once elected do not represent their views. 
This of course occurs to some extent because of the diversity of our 
nation. How do we get Ontario members to vote for harmonized 
consumption taxes in the maritimes when financially it does not 
seem to be in their own best interests?
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	This problem becomes even more exasperating when it comes to 
the question of moral issues. The public generally has two views of 
Bill C-33. One is that it is a matter of human rights. The second is 
that it is about morality; those who believe we are ensuring all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2449"> 2449 </A></B>
<P>
citizens can live free from discrimination and those who believe  
this is a stepping stone to the redefinition of family and marriage.
<P>
	I am very uncomfortable about being placed in a position of 
prejudging the morality of the people of Durham. It is not that I 
shirk from my responsibilities but rather realize that one person's 
definition of morality can be quite different from another.
<P>
	On this point I congratulate my leader for allowing a free vote. 
We should take the time to put more faith in our elected officials, 
but at the same time these officials will have to prove they are 
individually up to the challenge.
<P>
	The United Kingdom has experienced many government 
members who had contrary viewpoints and yet their governments 
have not fallen. I suspect the views of their electorate are more 
effectively heard. A tiered disciplinary system would do much to 
restore the faith of the public in the House.
<P>
	I note in passing that statements by the homosexual community 
that the vote should be a free vote are inconsistent with their own 
desires for freedom from discrimination and the social abuse of 
power.
<P>
	This brings me to the bill. I have studied the amendments as well 
as having read the jurisprudence. The bill is quite clear in that it 
deals with hiring practices at the federal level, both within and 
outside government, as well as the provision of goods and services.
<P>
	Most of us would agree we should not discriminate regardless of 
our attitude toward lifestyles. ``Blacks and gays to the back of the 
store'' tells us that not all the prehistoric creatures from Alberta are 
in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller. I am 
sure many Albertans feel the same way.
<P>
	I have conventional values. As a family person I respect the 
historical role of the family. That means marriage between those of 
the opposite sex. A study of anthropology can hardly lead one to 
any other conclusion.
<P>
	The legal interpretation of one act does not necessarily affect the 
definitions of another. In any case, most of the problems expressed 
by those who regard this as an issue of morality should be 
addresses to the charter of rights and freedoms and the 
interpretation of section 15 of that act. Marriage and adoption are 
essentially matters of provincial jurisdiction in any case.
<P>
	Seven provinces now include a provision in their human rights 
legislation preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
Furthermore, the courts have interpreted the CHRA as if the 
terminology sexual orientation were already included as a 
prohibited grounds of discrimination. In other words, these 
amendments simply bring the legislation into conformity with what 
the courts have already interpreted the act to say.
<P>
	In spite of my understanding of the issues as well as the desire to 
truly represent the people of my riding, I undertook a professional 
poll between May 1-3, 1996. Over 400 calls were made to my 
riding.
<P>
	The question was very simple: ``As you know, the Minister of 
Justice has introduced legislation in the House of Commons that 
would include the addition to the human rights act that people 
cannot be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. 
This would apply to employment in the federal civil service and 
employment in federally incorporated companies. This act would 
also apply to the receiving and selling of goods and services. Are 
you strongly in favour of the legislation, somewhat in favour, 
somewhat opposed, strongly opposed, or do you have no opinion?''
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	My riding is both urban and rural. In spite of the fact that my 
office has been inundated with calls of non-support, the poll 
reflects an entirely different position: 56 per cent of the people of 
Durham support this legislation.
<P>
	A national poll by Angus Reid between April 18-24 called about 
561 people in Ontario. The results were identical to my own poll: 
56 per cent of the people are in favour of this legislation.
<P>
	It is clear the majority of those in Durham want me to support 
this legislation, which I intend to do. A civil society is not 
measured on how it treats its majority but on how it treats its 
minorities.
<P>
	In order to ensure all the elements of our society are treated 
fairly, it is reasonable to find ways of preventing discrimination of 
those who, in shear numbers, find themselves to be a minority. This 
is both fair and reasonable. Even those who take exception to these 
changes will accept this corollary.
<P>
	I believe I have fulfilled the obligations given to me by a free 
vote on this matter. I am pleased to have represented the views of 
those in Durham. To those who are opposed, this is a great strength 
of our democratic institutions. People can openly debate issues 
such as this and arrive at a conclusion.
<P>
	While this may still be far distant from the concept of consensus, 
most people in Durham can appreciate that it is not the member of 
Parliament prejudging their moral conduct but rather the people of 
Durham who have come to the conclusion that it is fair and 
reasonable to ensure specific elements in society are free from 
discrimination.
<P>
	I am happy to have been an agent for the people of Durham in 
this matter. I will be voting as they have directed, to support the 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to speak to this bill today. It is a bill to which I am opposed. I find it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2450"> 2450 </A></B>
<P>
is fundamentally flawed. A measure  of that is the co-operation 
among all parties where there is widespread concern about the bill.
<P>
	The bill stands for more than the government would have us 
believe. Chief Justice Lamer, in the Mossop case, said: ``Indeed, in 
this case if Parliament had decided to include sexual orientation on 
the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act, my interpretation of the phrase family status 
might have been entirely different. I might then have concluded 
that Mr. Mossop's situation included both his sexual orientation 
and his family status''. That is the underlying concern that many of 
us have with the bill.
<P>
	Max Yalden, chief commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, similarly stated: ``We are strongly in favour of an 
amendment that would prohibit discrimination based on sexual 
orientation. That means if benefits are paid to a heterosexual 
couple living in common law, the same benefits should be paid to a 
couple living in the same situation except that they are two men or 
two women. Our position on that matter is very clear. We are 
waiting for the government's reaction''.
<P>
	That sentiment is fairly well founded when there is the Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court and someone of Mr. Yalden's 
expertise commenting.
<P>
	It was reported in a local newspaper that the government's 
position on this, that these matters were not of concern, was a 
position that was seriously flawed. If I used the wording in the 
newspaper article I would be called to account for unparliamentary 
language.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	I will point out the comments of one member opposite who said 
that some of our members stood up in the House today and said 
``blank'' about this legislation. I will leave the word ``blank'' to 
your discretion. However, the legislation is more than it seems.
<P>
	The previous speaker talked about polling. In my riding we tried 
to get a feeling about how our constituents felt about this 
legislation. We asked two questions. The first was: ``Do you think 
the federal government should amend legislation to add sexual 
orientation as a grounds of discrimination?'' A slim majority of 
people felt this was a reasonable objective.
<P>
	The second question was: ``Would you support this amendment 
if it means that homosexual couples would receive economic and 
family benefits which include medical, survivor, income tax 
benefits and so on?'' That was where people drew the line. When 
we factored that question into it there was opposition to that bill.
<P>
	Anybody who seriously polls their constituents on this bill must 
ask those two questions, the first question being simply whether 
they support the bill and the second and most important one being 
whether they support it if these are the implications.
<P>
	Given the implications and that there is a large religious 
community in the country concerned about these implications, the 
Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops proposed some 
amendments to the member from Edmonton from my party. He 
checked with the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada and asked if it 
would support the amendments to the bill.
<P>
	The amendments proposed by the Catholic bishops are simply: 
one, the definition of marital status and family status under the 
Canadian Human Rights Act be limited to heterosexual couples, as 
the Canadian Council of Catholic Bishops says, because of their 
irreplaceable role in the procreation and nurturing of children, upon 
which the future of our society depends; two, it should be 
legislatively permitted that the history and social objectives of this 
legislation be taken into account in determining whether certain 
policy distinctions amount to unjust discrimination; three, the 
teaching and hiring practices of religious institutions are to be 
protected.
<P>
	Unfortunately the government, although claiming the bill would 
not have these effects, is reluctant to support amendments which 
would support the position of Canadian Catholic bishops and 
Evangelical Christians in Canada. I believe that really speaks 
words for the intentions of the government in promoting this bill.
<P>
	I do not have any difficulty in voting against this. I believe my 
constituents are solidly opposed to the bill for the reasons I gave. 
However, the big concern I have in addressing the bill deals with 
my first priority in life. Believe it or not, as much as I value my 
position as a member of Parliament, it is not my first priority in 
life. The first priority in my life is trying to be a reasonable father 
for my children. As much as I may have failings, I do have good 
support at home from my wife, for which I am eternally grateful.
<P>
	When I look at the bill and recognize the implications the 
government has in proposing it, I ask whether the bill is really 
stating that thou shalt not discriminate, or is it presenting to the 
children of this country an alternate lifestyle in stating that this 
lifestyle is of equal significance, importance or value as another.
<P>
	I as a parent cannot say I would sit my son or daughters beside 
me and tell them one of their choices is to marry Jane down the 
street, have a family and raise children, but another equally 
legitimate lifestyle is the homosexual lifestyle. I do not believe 
those two lifestyles are equal. Because an adult makes a personal 
decision in these matters does not say that I am opposed to him or 
her, or that I look down on him or her. My role is not to be 
judgmental to that degree.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	My role as a parent is to present reasonable alternatives to my 
children. By supporting this legislation which will lead, I believe, 
to family benefits and that sort of thing for homosexual couples, 
the underlying theme  for our children that this is a legitimate 
alternative. I do not think it can be presented that way. For that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2451"> 2451 </A></B>
<P>
reason I am very concerned and will be voting against it when the 
time comes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I begin I 
would like to say a couple of words about what the last speaker 
said.
<P>
	Obviously different families have different ways of approaching 
things, but in my family I believe the most important lesson that I 
can leave for my children is to respect, value and appreciate the 
dignity of every individual no matter how he or she lives his or her 
life. For a party that continues to speak about equality these kinds 
of statements fly in the face of that.
<P>
	It is with a great deal of pleasure that I speak in support of Bill 
C-33. The Canadian Human Rights Act applies to the federal 
government and federally regulated businesses. All 10 provinces 
and the two territories have their own human rights laws.
<P>
	Human rights laws in every jurisdiction have a list of grounds or 
characteristics of discrimination that are against the law. Most 
human rights laws in Canada apply to employment, 
accommodation and the provision of goods and services.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act governs principally 
employment and the provision of goods and services under federal 
jurisdiction. Currently the grounds for prohibited discrimination in 
the Canadian Human Rights Act are based on race, national or 
ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, marital status, family 
status, disability or conviction for an offence which a pardon has 
been granted.
<P>
	All that Bill C-33 does is add sexual orientation as a ground for 
prohibited discrimination. Last year I stood in this House in 
support of Bill C-41. As I gave my speech I was subjected to loud 
and rancorous heckling from the members of the Reform Party. 
They objected to my support of the inclusion of sexual orientation 
as a prohibited ground of discrimination in reference to hate 
literature. They did not get it then and they are not getting it today.
<P>
	Last year I stated that many of us assume that Canada is an open, 
tolerant and inclusive society. However, it cannot always be taken 
for granted. Members of the Reform Party have publicly stated that 
they would fire a homosexual employee. In addition, they made 
very unkind comments about black Canadians. These comments 
are totally unacceptable and are strong evidence of why human 
rights legislation is so very necessary.
<P>
	Imagine for a moment being a gay or lesbian employee working 
for someone like the Reform members who feel that it is their right 
to fire employees, not on the basis of merit but on the basis of a 
personal characteristic. This  from the Reform Party that 
consistently states over and over again that it is the party of 
equality and that the only hiring criteria is merit.
<P>
	No one can deny that discrimination in the workplace for gay 
men and lesbians is very real. Many work in hostile and 
homophobic work environments where gay jokes are an accepted 
norm. Lesbians and gay men must often conceal their identity in 
order to get hired or to keep their jobs. As a result they cannot talk 
openly about their personal lives or about their partners.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	When people are unable to share in simple conversations with 
colleagues about non-work activities, this can be very isolating. No 
one would want to be in a position where one has to conceal who 
one is for fear of verbal or physical abuse or for fear of being fired.
<P>
	While some members on both sides of the House are not willing 
to extend protection against discrimination to gay men and 
lesbians, I am most disappointed with the Reform Party that has 
taken as a matter of party policy the right of individuals to 
discriminate against gay men and lesbians. Reform members say 
they are the party of equality, but is this only for people who look 
like them, who behave like them? Is there no one in the Reform 
Party who has the courage and the principles to stand and vote 
against the Jurassic Reform Party line? Is there no one in the 
Reform Party to stand in this House and be counted as someone 
who supports protection for all Canadians regardless of race, 
ethnicity, gender, age, ableness, religion and sexual orientation?
<P>
	Some try to confuse the public by suggesting they would support 
this legislation if only the term sexual orientation was properly 
defined. This is merely an excuse for their homophobia or 
adherence to the third party line.
<P>
	Courts and tribunals have looked at a number of cases pertaining 
to discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. They have 
clearly understood sexual orientation to mean heterosexuality, 
homosexuality and bisexuality. Opponents of this bill mislead 
Canadians when they say pedophilia will be sanctioned. 
Pedophilia, whether the perpetrator is homosexual or heterosexual, 
is an illegal act. As illegal behaviour it remains under the Criminal 
Code and is not protected by this amendment.
<P>
	Tom Harpur has said there are many paths to God. For believers I 
agree with Mr. Harpur, there are many paths to God. The path that I 
have chosen is Christianity. I have to tell the House how hurt and 
angered I am that some individuals in this House use religion to 
further their political agenda. They have threatened and they have 
manipulated well-meaning individuals and I find this inexcusable.
<P>
	The basic tenets of the Christian faith include compassion, 
respect and tolerance. Protection against discrimination is about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2452"> 2452 </A></B>
<P>
compassion, respect and  tolerance. Diversity is the hallmark of 
creation. Diversity is healthy and natural. It must be protected.
<P>
	Over 70 years ago as a woman I was not considered to be a 
person. If political leadership to change this gross inequity had not 
occurred I would not be in the House today arguing for the basic 
rights of other vulnerable groups in Canadian society. If we are to 
be civilized and humane we must protect the rights of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	In my maiden speech I said that as parliamentarians we merely 
pass through this place. I feel very fortunate and honoured to be in 
this House when a federal government has finally made the 
decision to bring forward legislation that extends protection against 
discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues on both sides of the House to seize this very 
important historical moment and support this legislation.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate this afternoon on Bill C-33, to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to prevent discrimination 
against homosexuals and lesbians.
<P>
	How many people have suffered discrimination because of their 
homosexuality? There are of course people like the members of the 
Reform Party who go into trench warfare at the sound of the word 
``homosexuality''. How many people have lost their homes or have 
been driven out of them because of their homosexuality?
<P>
	Discrimination occurs even at the workplace. There are firms, 
companies and associations that used to send for and still do send 
for Cvs when a job competition is announced. How many people 
have been discriminated against because of their age and have been 
penalized in the selection process? How many people have been 
discriminated against and have even been denied an interview 
where they could explain their skills and how they would go about 
doing the job? How many people have been bypassed in 
promotions at the workplace, again as the result of discrimination?
<P>
	Discrimination is not limited to homosexuality. It is faced by 
older people, who are often said to be too old to do the job. People 
have also been passed over because they are considered too old to 
be promoted. Older people are often offered a retirement program, 
because their age threatens company performance. Older people 
currently face a lot of discrimination in our society.
<P>
	Members of visible minorities also face discrimination. Let us 
look at an example. In Montreal, 60 per cent of people represent 
visible minorities, coming from Vietnam, Japan, Italy, Greece and 
so on. In short, 60 per cent of the present population of Montreal 
come from cultural communities.
<P>
	Naturally these people want to put their experience and their 
qualifications to use for the benefit of their fellow citizens and of a 
company. Very often, unfortunately, companies do not want them. 
With Cvs again, a lot of discrimination occurs when a firm looks at 
an individual's age and nationality and is afraid of his or her effect 
on business. It does not hire the individual. It does not even give 
the person a chance to go through a selection interview.
<P>
	How many people are punished because of their sex? There are a 
lot more non traditional jobs in industry these days. I myself am a 
former employee of Reynolds in Baie-Comeau. I am on leave 
without pay at the moment. In the aluminum plant in Baie-Comeau 
today there are women electricians, women solderers and women 
doing jobs that, in the past, were always done by men. Women are 
being trained in and are doing these jobs.
<P>
	In French, job posters often specify that the masculine includes 
the feminine or that the position is open to women. Whether you 
are a man or a woman, the job is open. Equal skills, equal pay. I 
think a woman who works beside a man should not earn less 
because she is an electrician. She should earn the same as the man.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	How many people are discriminated against because of 
language? They say that nowadays, salaries being equal, employers 
will go for the person who speaks several languages, English and 
French for example. There are also companies in the tourism field, 
airlines, travel agencies, which will give priority to people 
speaking several languages. This can end up penalizing people who 
have, unfortunately, not had the chance to learn another language, 
particularly in Quebec where the first language is French. They are 
highly qualified, through their experience, to work as travel agents, 
but would be penalized because they do not speak two languages.
<P>
	And how many people are discriminated against and penalized in 
Canada because they are disabled? Because of an accident? The 
person was highly competent, active and cost-effective to the 
employer but now is pushed aside, sometimes even let go, because 
of a handicap resulting from accident or illness.
<P>
	In the Quebec National Assembly in 1977, then Premier 
Lévesque introduced a clause in the Quebec charter of rights and 
freedoms which allowed male homosexuals and lesbians to live 
free of discrimination. So it is already in the Quebec charter, and 
here we are getting around to it only 20 years later. Quebec has 
definitely always been ahead of its time in such things.
<P>
	This is the reason Quebec has sent 53 or 54 Bloc MPs to Ottawa 
to show the Canadian government that it is high time in 1996 to 
include the same clause in the federal charter that is in the Quebec 
charter. This is not, I feel, any sort of luxury. The federal 
government must  evolve, must keep abreast of the latest 
developments. The Bloc position is quite simply to see that Ottawa 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2453"> 2453 </A></B>
<P>
endorses what the Parti Quebecois put in place back in 1977 under 
René Lévesque.
<P>
	Some things that have been said by the Reform Party around this 
bill I would classify as racist remarks and liable to incite to 
violence. Let me explain.
<P>
	The comments made by the former Reform whip recently, about 
moving someone into the back room in a store if the employer were 
to discover that person to be homosexual, strike me as both vulgar 
and racist.
<P>
	The Reform Party is calling for more and more free votes in this 
House, yet when members call in caucus for their people to be less 
far to the right, closer to the centre right-as was the case recently 
when the hon. members for Calgary Southeast, Simcoe Centre and 
Calgary Centre called for the party to take less radical 
positions-the Reform caucus jump on them like a pack of wolves. 
This makes absolutely no sense.
<P>
	I feel the Reform Party needs to take the path of reason. We have 
read in the press that the leader of the Reform Party, the hon. 
member for Calgary Southwest, approved of violence, approved of 
the Prime Minister's violence toward a demonstrator, especially if 
a sovereignist. This is inciting violence, inciting his party to 
violence, and now we see the consequences. We have just had 
several byelections in Quebec and the Reform Party got only 0.5 
per cent of the popular vote in Quebec.
<P>
	Might I, in closing, make it clear to both this House and the 
voters who are viewing us at home that there is a great difference 
between recognizing same sex couples and preventing 
discrimination.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enter this debate with respect to the amendments in Group No. 1, 
which are concerned with the freedom of religion, expression and 
association, marriage, family and spouse, the Criminal Code and 
the preamble. With that in mind I will address the comments made 
by the Minister of Justice during debate on Bill C-33, which are in 
<I>Hansard</I> of April 30.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice indicated on debate, ``in my respectful 
view no participant has the moral high ground, no one is holier than 
any other''. I wish to remind this honourable House that in in the 
preamble to our Canadian Constitution we recognize the rule of law 
and the supremacy of God.
<P>
	By recognizing the supremacy of God we entrench in our laws 
natural law. Therefore, justice, law and morality are inseparable. 
Bill C-33 is an issue of morality. When legislating, Parliament 
must ensure that its laws are just and moral. The issue before the 
House is one of morality  and conscience; therefore it is also an 
issue of one's religious belief, opinion and freedom of expression.
<P>
	The justice minister in debate stated unequivocally, ``it is an 
issue of human rights''. What is a human right? I remind this House 
that the first right, the most basic right and the primary 
fundamental right is the right to life. Until Parliament addresses the 
right to life, from the moment of conception until natural death, it 
has no jurisdiction to extend the human rights to include sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	To profess and to legislate that sexual orientation is a human 
right is to find that a human right is determined on the basis of 
behaviour, which is erroneous. To confer a human right on the basis 
of sexual orientation is to confer a special right, a specific right to a 
special interest group on the basis of behaviour identified by 
lifestyle.
<P>
	To confer homosexuality as a human right on the basis of sexual 
orientation will provide homosexuals with a special legal status 
that will allow them to redefine the family, to redefine spouse, to 
enter into the realm of the sanctity of marriage, to infiltrate the 
curriculum of our schools and education and to impose an 
alternative lifestyle on our youth.
<P>
	To legislate that sexual orientation is a human right is to elevate 
the existing legal test in Canada from one of tolerance to a legal test 
of condonation and acceptance.
<P>
	All Canadians are equal before and under the law. Canadians are 
tolerant and compassionate people. However, by conferring a 
specific right to homosexuals in the Canadian Human Rights Act, 
Parliament is requiring Canadians not only to be tolerant and 
compassionate but also to condone and accept homosexuality as 
natural and moral.
<P>
	Homosexuality is unnatural and immoral. The words unnatural 
and immoral are terms used in legal debate. Justice, law and 
morality are inseparable. As recognized by our justice minister, 
this is a moral debate.
<P>
	I also wish to refer to <I>Hansard</I> wherein our justice minister 
attempts to refute arguments with respect to the rights this 
amendment in Bill C-33 will confer. He talks about family: ``It is 
suggested by some that this bill will either directly or indirectly 
undermine or diminish the importance of family in Canadian life''. 
I am one of those some.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	Families have inherent and inviolable rights in Canada. Families 
have existed before the church and families have existed before the 
state. The rights of family must be safeguarded and protected.
<P>
	The reference to the importance of family in the preamble to Bill 
C-33, which was included merely to appease those members of 
Parliament with morality and conscience issues on their minds, was 
in my opinion a grave error on the part of the Minister of Justice.  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2454"> 2454 </A></B>
<P>
Introducing family in an amendment to confer special rights with 
respect to sexual orientation is a violation of the rights of family. It 
allows the very redefinition of family that we choose to protect.
<P>
	In <I>Hansard</I>, the justice minister makes reference to his 
subjective opinion on how the bill will not affect his own family. 
Canadians are not interested in the subjective opinion of the 
Minister of Justice. He has no jurisdiction to impose that opinion 
on Canadian families.
<P>
	With respect to the issue of religion, the Minister of Justice 
stated in <I>Hansard</I>: ``This bill is fundamentally consistent with the 
most basic teachings of religion''. He also stated: ``I developed a 
deep respect for the tenets of the Catholic faith. I suggest this 
amendment and the action it constitutes is completely consistent 
with those tenets''. This is not a matter for debate.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has exceeded his jurisdiction by speaking 
on behalf of the church. I use the word church in an all inclusive 
sense. The justice minister has made a pronouncement on issues of 
ecclesiastic law and canon law that is not within his jurisdiction. 
For the Minister of Justice to state that this bill is fundamentally 
consistent with the most basic teachings of religion is to interfere 
with the individual and personal freedom of religion and belief that 
every individual in Canada has, pursuant to our Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	To state that this bill is fundamentally consistent with the most 
basic teachings of religion also closes the door on any religious 
defence that may be argued in future with respect to the 
introduction of Bill C-33.
<P>
	``This bill is fundamentally consistent with the most basic 
teachings of religion'', as stated by the Minister of Justice, is an 
interference with the domain and jurisdiction of the church. The 
principle of separation of church and state is well founded 
historically, culturally and in our laws. The state has no jurisdiction 
to interfere in matters of church.
<P>
	However, the House should be reminded that the church has a 
right and a responsibility to concern itself with matters of state on 
issues of morals, values, principles and religion. In this regard I 
have called on the Minister of Justice by letter, and I do so here 
again today in the House, to withdraw the statements he made in 
this House specially with reference to religion, to withdraw the 
statement: ``This bill is fundamentally consistent with the most 
basic teachings of religion-I suggest this amendment and the 
action it constitutes is completely consistent with these tenets''.
<P>
	I ask that the Minister of Justice be accountable for exceeding 
his jurisdiction in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, considering the imposition of time allocation on Bill 
C-33, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on 
this piece of legislation. However, I must inform the House that it 
is not a pleasure. I would  have far preferred if this legislation were 
not brought forward by the Liberal government.
<P>
	I will begin my remarks by indicating my approval for the 
amendments we are presently discussing. They are put forward in 
good faith, dramatically improve the intent of the bill and make it 
much more palatable. It is certainly my wish to see them passed 
and the bill amended as in the grouping of the first nine 
amendments.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	In particular I should like to indicate my support for the basic 
thrust of Motion No. 11 put forward by my colleague. It would add 
a new clause affirming that sexual orientation will not redefine the 
terms marriage, family and spouse in any act of Parliament.
<P>
	This is particularly important because this area seems to be 
causing so much concern among the constituents of Prince 
George-Peace River, the riding in northeastern British Columbia 
which I represent. The people of Canada from coast to coast to 
coast are very concerned about this amendment being put forward 
and about the term sexual orientation when it has not been defined 
by the justice minister or by Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to read into the record ``A Statement Regarding Bill 
C-33'' from the Archdiocese of Vancouver:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order for the federal government's proposed amendment of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act regarding sexual orientation to be acceptable, three basic 
safeguards need to be built into the legislation. First, sexual orientation must be 
defined; second, the amendment must not be used to give homosexual couples 
marital or marriage-like status; third, the conscience rights of Canadians 
morally opposed to homosexual behaviour must be protected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sexual orientation should be defined to refer to homosexual persons but not 
homosexual activity. By homosexual persons I mean individuals who 
experience a predominant, exclusive or very strong attraction to members of 
their own sex. Such a definition will ensure that the focus of the amendment will 
be where it should be: on prohibiting unjust discrimination against homosexual 
persons who have the same inalienable human dignity as other members of 
society. By specifying homosexual persons, the definition also would prevent 
the amendment from being used to protect pedophilia or other aberrant sexual 
behaviour.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is also necessary for the legislation to explicitly state that the amendments 
should not be used to redefine the meaning of marriage, family or spouse so as 
to include homosexual couples or confer marriage-like benefits on such 
couples. Without such a statement, the amendment's preamble, which refers to 
preserving the role of ``family'', is unclear and subject to misinterpretation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thirdly, the legislation should make it clear that the amendment is not to be used 
to restrain Canadians who are opposed to homosexual behaviour from acting in 
conformity with their conscience, assuming they maintain due respect for 
homosexual persons. It should not force them to do something which reflects 
approval for homosexual behaviour, and it should not prevent them from doing </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2455"> 2455 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>something which reflects disapproval for such behaviour. For example, it should 
allow  employers to make the non-practice of homosexual activity a bona fides 
occupational qualification. (Manitoba's human rights act explicitly provides for this).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These safeguards are necessary to preserve the common good while at the 
same time enabling Canadian society to clearly oppose unjust discrimination 
toward homosexual persons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This document comes to me from the most Reverend Adam 
Exner, OMI, with the archbishop's office in Vancouver. I thought it 
was particularly appropriate to read it into the record because it 
certainly fits in quite nicely with amendments we are debating at 
present.
<P>
	Motion No. 12, also submitted by my colleague, adds a new 
clause affirming that sexual orientation will not affect freedom of 
religion, expression and association as guaranteed in the charter of 
rights and freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I refer briefly to the Reform blue book. Bill C-33 has certainly 
caused quite a stir in the Reform Party, the Liberal Party and most 
if not all political parties over the last week or so since it was 
introduced in the House.
<P>
	This is my first opportunity to speak to the bill because over the 
last couple of weeks I was back in my riding. There are many 
people at the grassroots level across Canada discussing the 
legislation. There is open and honest discussion about the possible 
ramifications of Bill C-33.
<P>
	The constituents of Prince George-Peace River have made it 
very clear to me as their elected member where the majority of 
them stood on the bill. Motion No. 12 dovetails nicely with 
principle number eight in the Reform blue book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that every individual, group, province and region in Canada is 
entitled to fundamental justice. That fundamental justice entitles the people of 
each region to benefit equally, without discrimination, from participation in 
Confederation and from the programs and expenditures of the Government of 
Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Certainly that fits in quite nicely with this amendment. That is 
why we are supporting this motion.
<P>
	Motion No. 13 warrants some attention. It adds a new clause that 
sexual orientation will not affect the enforcement of provisions in 
the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Motion No. 14 adds a new clause to affirm that nothing in the bill 
will result in the extension of same sex benefits. This is consistent 
with Reform policy and consistent with survey results from my 
own riding.
<P>
	I conducted the survey in a householder in the spring of 1994, 
some two years ago, but it is still appropriate today. Because we 
were forewarned in the infamous Liberal red book of what they 
intended to do, I took it upon myself to ask questions of the 
constituents of Peace George-Peace River. Over 1,200 
constituents replied to the questionnaire.
<P>
	Question No. 3 indicated that the Canadian Human Rights Act 
should prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. It 
was very succinct and very straightforward. Thirty-four per cent of 
the respondents agreed, fifty-four per cent disagreed and twelve per 
cent were undecided. It was not a large majority but a majority 
nonetheless.
<P>
	On the accompanying question of same sex couples being 
eligible for spousal benefits received by traditional couples, men 
and women, 16 per cent agreed, 75 per cent disagreed and 9 per 
cent were undecided.
<P>
	The vast majority of the constituents of Prince George-Peace 
River feel quite strongly about the issue, certainly those who 
responded to the questionnaire at any rate.
<P>
	As early as about an hour ago I was faxed a memo from one of 
the more prominent radio stations with a very high profile talk 
show, CJDC out of Dawson Creek in my riding. It is signed by a 
number of people who work at the station and states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I oppose the initiative to have sexual orientation added to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act without definition and proper input from the Canadian 
people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	A large number of people have advised me as their 
representative how they feel I should be voting on this piece of 
legislation. I have received over 100 E-mail letters in the last two 
days alone, all in opposition to the bill. I have received faxes, 
phone calls and personal consultation over the last couple of weeks 
I had the opportunity to travel throughout my riding. Certainly 
constituents were coming to me and making their views known on 
this piece of legislation.
<P>
	In summary, without these amendments being passed I will have 
to vote against the legislation, not because any individual should 
suffer from discrimination but having the term undefined could 
lead to all types of things that I have clearly laid out in speeches in 
the past. Those are my concerns and therefore I will be voting 
against Bill C-33.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there will be a free 
vote on Bill C-33. It is my understanding that government practice 
requires members of the government, ministers, secretaries of state 
and even parliamentary secretaries, to support a government 
measure. That is almost axiomatic. However I would want 
members to know that in voting on this measure I am voting on the 
merits as I see them.
<P>
	I have had the advantage of consulting with my constituency 
association over the last 18 months. We knew a bill might be 
introduced with a social policy forum. Only a week or 10 days ago I 
spoke with members of my constituency association who were 
delegates to the annual convention of the party a month ago. My 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2456"> 2456 </A></B>
<P>
vote  has been influenced very heavily by the opinions which have 
been expressed to me. However I believe I can contribute to the 
debate by addressing some unnecessary confusion in the 
discussion.
<P>
	First, there is a false dichotomy between constitutional positions 
and ethical opinions. Every constitution is an expression of an 
ethical position, a value choice. It is sometimes forgotten that 
Jefferson and Madison who inspired so much of contemporary 
constitutionalism had a commitment to what we today call open 
society values, and that is a value choice. I believe we should have 
mutual respect for the positions on both sides of this debate so far 
as they have been articulated to date.
<P>
	Part of the problem in our Canadian approach to the issue comes 
from one of the significant choices made in 1980-82 when we were 
patriating the Constitution. Many of us advised the government of 
the day and Mr. Trudeau that they should take as a model for a 
charter of rights either the American bill of rights, which by legend 
Madison wrote one Sunday morning, or the great French 
declaration of the rights of man and the citizen of 1789 and 1791, 
which is still in the constitution of the fifth republic and the most 
widely copied of all charters of rights throughout the world. The 
essence of those charters is that they reduce to a single page the 
basic principles of a free society.
<P>
	There is a principle of equality, equality before the law, equal 
protection of the laws, but it is cast in broad terms without 
limitations. Perhaps it is regrettable that our charter is very long 
and the equality principle proceeds to list in extenso examples of 
equality or categories to which it is applied. It has the effect of 
cutting down the generality, the sweep and the opening to creative 
innovation. It may be one of the reasons our courts, including the 
Supreme Court, have been spasmodic and non-sequential in the 
development of principles under it.
<P>
	I understand, therefore, the feeling of people not on a list that 
they are excluded. It is the old Latin maxim: expression unius est 
exclusio alterius. If a person is expressed they are in; if they are not 
expressed they are out. In some ways it distorts the dialectical 
notion of constitutional development that broad principles are 
capable of changing in their application according to new societal 
facts.
<P>
	I have an interesting letter from the president of the bar 
association, Gordon Proudfoot, which rejects the step by step, 
pragmatic, problem oriented development which was the key to 
human rights development in the United States and in many 
European countries which were subsequently influenced by it, with 
the Supreme Court playing a creative role in lock-step with the 
justice ministry that puts up the test cases. What has occurred there 
is pragmatic incremental change, not wild experiments in judicial 
legislation as some might have  feared. This would have been a 
better development for us in Canada, but it is water under the 
bridge.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	We have a lengthy charter that is really a lawyer's charter, not a 
people's charter. It is hard for lay people to understand. The 
Canadian Human Rights Act replicates the charter of rights in that 
sense.
<P>
	I also had a thoughtful letter from Archbishop Exner of 
Vancouver. It was quoted by the hon. member opposite. It is 
thoughtful and helpful. One problem here I think relates to the way 
the amendment to the human rights act was drafted. The human 
rights has a wide range, covering some agencies which might be 
considered private for the purpose of the charter of rights. Beyond 
that it covers bodies subject to federal regulation such as airlines.
<P>
	Contrary to general impression, the human rights act is not a 
general code of human conduct. The amendment makes very clear 
what is inherent in the Canadian Human Rights Act, unlike the 
charter, is it is really limited to removing discrimination in 
employment and the provision of goods and services. That is in the 
act. It may be enough to make that purpose explicit and make it 
clear as a matter of legal interpretation.
<P>
	I would have suggested to the Minister of Justice that rather than 
put it in the preamble it be put in the substantive part of the act, 
perhaps section 1. It would make clear as a matter of law that the 
act applies to prevent discrimination in employment and the 
provision of goods and services. That as its scope would remove a 
good deal of the unnecessary fears or questions raised by people of 
integrity and good faith that somehow this is a licence for a fishing 
expedition into many other areas of social policy.
<P>
	It may be that the community will decide in its wisdom that it 
wishes to move into other areas, but if the purpose of the law is as I 
have said, and I think that is very clear, it would be better in the 
language and drafting if it said so.
<P>
	I do not believe the fears that have been expressed that this may 
be too widely and too loosely interpreted by unelected judges. I do 
not think they are warranted on the language as it stands. I simply 
suggest that to make certainty doubly clear, and there is a Latin 
maxim for that but I will not quote it, the justice minister might 
consider at the committee stage of the bill making the change I 
have suggested.
<P>
	The open society values implicit in the charter of rights are 
implicit in this measure too that the Canadian people as whole 
accept the notion that discrimination in employment based on all 
the factors mentioned in the amended bill is unacceptable in social 
terms. That is a good and worthy motive. It is on that basis that I 
have given my support to the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2457"> 2457 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not really expect to say anything in the debate today. 
I thought I might at third reading. However, now I have the chance 
and I will add my comments.
<P>
	I am a Reform member and I believe in equality for all citizens. 
That is why I ran for Reform. I have had experiences in another 
country where it said there was equality but I did not see it. I have 
said a number of times in my speeches that the visits I made to the 
Soviet Union it made me realize how important democracy is.
<P>
	When I see the democracy in the House today it reminds me a lot 
of the manifesto of 1917 when there was freedom of speech, 
freedom of religion, freedom to have property. It was freedom only 
for two or three people at the top. The rest were shut down or 
exterminated.
<P>
	It sounded almost biased when I heard the government over the 
last couple of days making excuses that it could not fulfil its 
promises because of acts of God.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	If we look back to the story of creation, God did create a husband 
and a wife. What do members think happened? The husband 
blamed God for his breaking the promise not to eat the fruit of life. 
He said it would not have happened if God had not given him that 
woman. That is where discrimination started.
<P>
	I do not think that is the type of thing we want to reinforce, 
blaming God for our problems or making us do some things. We 
want to give him credit to show us and give us the wisdom to make 
the right kind of legislation.
<P>
	When I look at this bill, it is a stepping stone to attacking the 
basic family unit. I cannot see it differently. If it is not, why would 
the government refuse to endorse the amendments made by my 
colleagues? They have been made to protect the basic institutions 
of marriage and family. If that is not acceptable, what is in the bill? 
Think about it.
<P>
	The bill is a smoke screen. It is probably a way to get the door 
opened up a little wider to destroy the basic unit of the family. As 
we have heard in the House a number of times, when that happens, 
when the basic family unit becomes disintegrated, when it becomes 
non-functional, so does the country. That is something we have to 
look at very seriously in this legislation.
<P>
	The communists in 1917 said they would be equal, that they 
would have freedom. They said families did not do a proper job of 
raising their children and they would take over. They said they do 
not really need marriage, the basic family unit. It was not many 
years later that Stalin took over the reigns and had a huge problem. 
He had so many orphans he did not know what to do with them.
<P>
	If members want to read about history and some of the tragic 
stories before he got the system back on track, it is horrendous. In 
1935 or 1936 Stalin passed legislation that gave the world the 
toughest divorce laws ever implemented. He could see the basic 
family unit was there for a reason. Even if he did not believe in God 
he could see it would not work otherwise.
<P>
	I was amazed when yesterday or the day before I was watching 
``Newsworld''. I saw the documentary on the Igor Gouzenko 
family. I remember when the Gouzenko family defected from the 
Russian spy system and asked for asylum in this country. Those 
people are still under protection today because the edict is out to 
kill them for what they did. They were warned when they discussed 
whether they would defect. Mr. Gouzenko said it means our family 
will die in Russia. What do we do? Can we afford to take that risk? 
They will be executed.
<P>
	Their family told them if they ever got out of the country they 
had better not come back no matter what it meant to them. Today 
they are under strict security. They are hidden in this country. 
Nobody knows who they are. When they are on television they still 
must have their faces screened. What a life. What a penalty to pay. 
What a penalty the Soviet Union put on that family.
<P>
	It took 50 million people, according to Mr. Gouzenko, to die 
because of what they believed before that system was overthrown. 
Solzhenitsyn wrote that 40 million people died. When I was in the 
Soviet Union in 1991 after the coups and the books were finally 
opened, the estimation was 60 million.
<P>
	One old gentleman said ``because of our mistakes, because our 
government tried to stamp out the religion that brought the earth 
into being, we will pay for it for centuries.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	For five years of greatness in the second world war we 
propagated that and bragged about it for 70 years but never allowed 
the world to see what was happening our country''.
<P>
	According to that rate, he said it will take 970 years to write the 
horror stories that happened in that nation because it failed to look 
at the basic family unit, what it was set up for and what function it 
had.
<P>
	Today we are debating this issue. Are we willing to bring that 
kind of a punishment on this nation? We have heard about the 
Roman Empire and other empires where the family unit became 
dysfunctional the nation finally did fall. If that is what we are 
trying to do we are on the right path.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2458"> 2458 </A></B>
<P>
	I will not be part of that. I will vote against this legislation on 
third reading. I hope the Liberal government sees there can be no 
value in passing this legislation without ensuring those 
amendments are passed.
<P>
	There is not one issue that has been debated in the House on 
which I have had so many phone calls, letters and petitions as those 
asking me not to support Bill C-41 and Bill C-33.
<P>
	When we were voting on Bill C-68 we heard a comment from a 
senator that this was really not a bill to register guns or put guns 
under further restrictions. This was a social engineering project. 
This is exactly what happened in the Soviet Union. It outlawed 
capital punishment, then it implemented gun registration and 
implemented gun confiscation. Finally what did it have? It had a 
revolution. Only the people on the top had the guns. The poor 
people who did not have them died very violently by them.
<P>
	If we do not want to believe what we read let us go back and look 
at history to see what has happened and what the examples are. If 
we want to look at what homosexuality and permissiveness have 
done to some countries let us look at Africa and the problems it has 
run into. There are guidelines laid down in this universe that we 
have to follow or we will pay the consequences.
<P>
	What do we want? Do we want more freedom for a few years and 
then pay the consequences or do we want to follow what has been 
laid down for us in history, something that has worked for 
centuries? The family unit has built one country after the other. 
Once we have a country we have a government. Where are we 
going to go? Are we to destroy the family and destroy the 
government? Let us look at Liberia right now. Do we want that type 
of system? I do not.
<P>
	It is a privilege and honour to say a few words on this subject. I 
hope we will take this seriously, look at the amendments and pass 
them with the bill because we all want equality.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take measures to 
prohibit the importing of goods manufactured or containing parts manufactured 
by child labour as defined under International Labour Organization 
conventions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise today to speak 
to my motion which calls on the Liberal government to take 
measures to prohibit the importing of goods into Canada made with 
child labour, one of the great scourges of the contemporary global 
economy. At the end of my speech I will be seeking unanimous 
consent for a vote to occur on this motion so that the House might 
be able to express itself on this very important issue.
<P>
	This is not the first time the House has had the opportunity to 
debate this important issue. In November 1994, during the 
ratification of the World Trade Organization agreement, the House 
considered a New Democratic Party motion to amend Canada's 
customs legislation to prohibit the importing of goods made with 
child labour. We argued at that time that as the international 
community grappled with the social implications to the 
globalization of the world economy, there was an obligation to 
ensure that the emerging new  trading rules protected not only the 
legitimate rights of international investors, but also the legitimate 
rights of labour, especially the basic human rights of vulnerable 
groups such as child labourers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2460"> 2460 </A></B>
<P>
	We sought to make a constructive contribution to the trade 
agenda by joining with a growing international movement seeking 
to put the social implications of trade front and centre of the project 
of improving international trading rules. The government, along 
with the Reform Party, voted against our amendments on child 
labour and a social clause, signalling that it did not want to be part 
of the constructive movement to develop an international trading 
system that pays as much attention to the rights of child labourers 
as it does to the multinationals.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	It echoed this position in the actions it took in international 
bodies, siding with those who wanted the child labour problem 
studied rather than acted on in the OECD and the International 
Labour Organization.
<P>
	The government's position appeared to change as a result of the 
determination and hard work of Craig Kielburger, the young 
activist whom many Canadians have come to know about recently. 
Craig confronted the Prime Minister publicly in Asia when Team 
Canada was touring that part of the world. Craig confronted the 
Prime Minister on the question of what Canada was doing to help 
in the struggle to end child labour. It was clear that Craig and the 
other child campaigners in India and elsewhere struck a deep vein 
of concern with the Canadian public and the international 
community.
<P>
	Through his dramatic confrontation with the Prime Minister, he 
was able to break through the mantras of the advertising industry 
which attempts to cleanse the image of their products of the taint of 
the dreadful human context in which they are often made in 
developing countries. He was able to pressure the Canadian 
government to say that it would take action on child labour.
<P>
	Craig appears to have shamed the government about its inaction, 
but so far he has not been able, nor have I nor anyone else been 
able, to shame it into action. The government did put a line in the 
throne speech about working toward an international consensus on 
the issue of child labour. It also has made a financial contribution to 
the ILO's program on child labour, something by the way that I had 
called for in a private member's motion tabled in the last session of 
Parliament. Anything more decisive or bold than these timid 
measures seems very far off at this point anyway.
<P>
	What I hope to accomplish with today's debate is to help sustain 
or indeed add to the momentum that there may be on this issue by 
allowing members of the House to join in the growing chorus of 
those calling for real international and national action on child 
labour and to  ask the government to put its cards on the table about 
exactly what measures it will be taking.
<P>
	For despite the pleasant words in the throne speech, the media 
reported that Canada's position at the recent meeting of G-7 
officials on the unemployment crisis remained one of keeping child 
labour and human rights out of international trade rules. This is not 
consistent with what the Prime Minister promised to Craig 
Kielburger.
<P>
	The numbers of children involved in child labour in developing 
countries and the conditions they face are staggering. The 
International Labour Organization estimates that there are some 
200 million children working as child labourers around the world 
with some 55 million in India alone. The conditions these children 
work under are often inhuman and in many contexts in India and 
Pakistan are literally conditions akin to slavery.
<P>
	Accordingly to the International Labour Organization, half the 
children in Pakistan's carpet industry die of malnutrition and 
disease before the age of 12. Girls 10 years of age work in China's 
special export zones in toy factories for $10 a month.
<P>
	No one pretends that a social catastrophe on this scale can be 
overcome overnight. It is a very complex problem that is deeply 
rooted in the social and economic cultures of some developing 
countries and in the absence of political structures that respect 
basic human rights. Most importantly, child labour is also rooted in 
the globalization of world markets. The fact is that child labour has 
been growing in tandem with the liberalization of world trade, as 
multinationals seek to find labour markets with ever lower and 
lower wages and lower standards. They find the cheapest labour 
with contractors in developing countries who use children to 
produce rugs, textiles, garments, shoes, toys and other light 
manufacturing products which the multinationals market in the 
global economy.
<P>
	It is because child labour is so deeply intertwined with 
international trade that the international community has a large 
obligation to participate in the efforts to respond to the plight of 
child labourers and begin the process of eliminating child labour.
<P>
	Canadians I believe are clearly looking for ways to play a 
leading and constructive role in these international efforts. The 
question everyone wants to know is what Canadians and their 
governments can do to make a difference.
<P>
	On one level Canadians can make a difference as consumers. 
The bewildering world of international trade rules, the 
organizations that operate them, and the obscure jargon of 
international economics must at times seem to most Canadians as 
having little immediate or direct bearing on their own lives.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2461"> 2461 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	As consumers we are all directly connected to the global 
economy. Every time we purchase a pair of athletic shoes made in 
Indonesia, a toy made in China or a carpet made in India or 
Pakistan, we are directly involved in international trade and very 
likely involved as well in the problem of child labour.
<P>
	A growing number of people in Canada and around the world are 
awakening to the fact that as consumers of goods made with child 
labour, we are implicated in the problem. We are complicit in the 
problem. It is too rare for any of us to feel anxious when buying 
clothes or toys for our children because we wonder about the 
children in Indonesia or China that worked in the sweatshops to 
make the clothing or the toys.
<P>
	Yet there is an awakening sense that as consumers of goods we 
have a moral obligation to ask questions about how these goods 
that we are consuming are produced. That leads us to have a moral 
obligation to child labourers.
<P>
	As consumers, potentially we have a great deal of power to 
change the situation. If consumers did not purchase goods known 
to be made with child labour, the multinationals who had them 
produced and imported would have to adjust their business 
practices. The challenge is in providing information to consumers 
about how, where and by whom goods were produced.
<P>
	Two approaches have emerged out of the insight about the 
potential power of consumers. The first is a movement to attach 
effective labels to products attesting to the fact that they were not 
made with child labour. One such program is the recent innovation 
of the ``Rugmark'' label which addresses the problem of child 
labour in the South Asian carpet industry, one that is particularly 
notorious in the use of child labour. There are proposals to extend 
this kind of approach to other products as well.
<P>
	The other response to the potential use of consumer power as a 
tool in the struggle to eliminate child labour is the fair trade 
movement. Organizations such as Oxfam's ``Bridgehead'' market 
products from developing countries that are traded on a fair basis, 
that is with good labour standards and fair prices. Consumers who 
wish to ensure that they consume goods traded on a fair basis have 
the opportunity through such organizations to shop in a morally 
responsible way by shopping through Bridgehead and similar 
organizations around the world.
<P>
	The movement for better labelling and the growth of fair trade 
opportunities for Canadian consumers are developments that I am 
sure everyone wants to see flourish and expand. Child labour and 
other problems with international labour standards cannot and 
should not be solved by conscientious consumers alone.
<P>
	In the first place, the multinationals have an extremely powerful 
advertising industry with an awesome grip on  our popular culture 
that they use to hide the social context of how their goods are 
produced in developing countries.
<P>
	For every Craig Kielburger who may prod the conscience of 
Canadians or the Prime Minister by getting a few minutes on <I>The 
National</I>, there are dozens of sport celebrities with ready-made 
public reputations who are used by the multinationals to market 
their goods. It is not really a fair contest and the gap between the 
millions paid to the sports star to endorse a running shoe in a 
30-second ad made in an Asian sweat shop, and the pennies paid to 
the child labourer to manufacture that shoe in a lifetime of 
miserable drudgery, has got to be one of the most eloquent 
condemnations of the new global economy.
<P>
	The other reason we should not limit ourselves to consumer 
power is that we are not only consumers making decisions in the 
marketplace, we are also citizens. We are citizens of a state that is 
in a position to take action itself, and as a participant in 
international agencies that are in a position to take effective action 
toward the elimination of child labour.
<P>
	Canadians want to know that their government is doing all that it 
can to play a constructive part in international efforts on child 
labour. Unfortunately, the Canadian government has not done all 
that it could do. In spite of being shamed into mouthing some 
reassuring rhetoric, the policy of the government on child labour 
has been hands off. It has been content to have the problem studied 
by the OECD and the ILO. But in its opposition to having the 
World Trade Organization, the one body that sets trade rules, have 
anything to do with human rights or labour standards or 
environmental standards, the government has consistently sided 
with those who want trade rules to be blind and deaf to child labour 
and other human rights abuses. Nor has the Canadian government 
taken any action on its own to restrict the importation of goods 
made with child labour.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	What are we to make of the government's decision to condemn 
child labour but permit it in trade deals, to study the problem but 
not to take action? There are, I think, some unstated assumptions 
behind the government's inaction: that child labour is an inevitable 
and inescapable part of the development process; that it is 
necessary for the children of developing countries to suffer under 
child labour until their societies properly adjust to globalization; 
and that in the future the practice of child labour will disappear as 
the developing economies become more prosperous just as child 
labour disappeared in Europe and North America.
<P>
	There are two things terribly wrong with this unfounded 
confidence in the inevitability of economic progress. The first is its 
blindness to the fact that much child labour in developing societies 
has been an outgrowth of so-called economic progress. Child 
labour is  not some old uneconomic social custom that liberal 
economic practices will eventually dissolve. Child labour has 
grown as a result of trade liberalization. It is how many societies 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2462"> 2462 </A></B>
<P>
have responded to trade liberalization. It will continue to grow as 
long as low labour costs remain the main source of competitive 
advantage for developing countries with no labour standards.
<P>
	The second thing wrong with this optimism is its misreading of 
the history of child labour in western societies. Child labour did not 
wither away in Canada as a result of economic progress. It was 
abolished as a result of the outrage of citizens who thought it was 
immoral to allow businesses to exploit children, an outrage that 
eventually forced governments to regulate the workplace and set 
labour standards to protect children.
<P>
	If we are to make any headway against child labour in the 
developing world today, there must be a recognition that it will not 
happen without the setting and enforcement of legal standards to 
protect the rights of children. In the current context of 
globalization, the international community will have to play a role 
in ensuring that those labour standards are in place.
<P>
	Let us imagine what would happen if we treated the rights of the 
multinationals with the same lackadaisical inaction that we treated 
the rights of children. For example, an integral part of the new 
world trading rules of the World Trade Organization is the 
protection of the intellectual property of multinationals. 
Pharmaceutical companies want to have full rights to the value of 
their drugs and entertainment companies do not want independents 
bootlegging their CDs or videos.
<P>
	Imagine a situation where governments said to the 
multinationals as they are saying to child labourers: ``We think 
your rights should be respected, but to actually make trade rules 
that enforce your rights would destroy trade. But do not worry. We 
are studying the problem in the OECD and in any case, as these 
countries become more prosperous by exploiting your intellectual 
property they will gradually come to respect your rights. Just be 
patient, it is just a matter of waiting for the proper adjustments to 
take place''. The multinationals would not tolerate it. They would 
laugh in the face of any government that offered such an argument.
<P>
	The trouble is the multinationals have the power to laugh in the 
faces of governments and child labourers do not. As a result, 
governments have worked hard to protect the multinationals' 
interests. China's lack of regulation of black market CDs and 
videos has kept it out of the WTO. Canadian governments protect 
multinational drug company interests with drug patent legislation. 
However, these same governments, the Canadian government 
among them, have refused to put enforceable clauses on labour 
rights in international trade agreements. It is the utter 
powerlessness of children in the face of the very powerful 
multinational corporations  that exploit them that imposes on 
governments an inescapable moral obligation to defend their 
rights.
<P>
	Governments can do two things. They can work together in 
international organizations to pay as much attention to human 
rights as economic interests when developing international 
economic agreement. This could take the form of social clauses in 
trade agreements. It could take the form of a new mandate for the 
International Labour Organization to enforce its agreements and 
conventions. Or it could take the form of a new United Nations 
body, an economic security council to parallel the existing security 
council. Whatever the mechanism, it is vital that human rights and 
labour standards be a central part of the international trade agenda.
<P>
	Governments can also take independent action. This brings me 
to the specifics of my motion today. Governments can on their own 
initiative regulate the trade in goods made by children in 
contravention of International Labour Organization conventions. 
My motion today asks the government to take the kind of measure 
which would compel importers to make a declaration that the 
goods they are importing were not manufactured by child labour.
<P>
	It would be important in designing the measures to stipulate that 
importers would have to attest that their suppliers did not exploit 
child labour in the manufacture of a product. It is common practice 
not to hire children themselves but to contract out production to 
local manufacturers that in turn make use of child labour.
<P>
	The main advantage of this kind of approach to combating child 
labour is that it puts the regulatory sophistication of a developed 
country like Canada at the disposal of a problem of 
underdevelopment.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	Many individual governments of developing countries are 
making efforts to introduce regulations to protect children. Many 
such countries do not have the resources to police regulations on 
child labour however well intended those regulations may be. 
Developed countries like Canada have an obligation to help the 
governments of developing countries prevent multinationals from 
trading in goods made by children.
<P>
	Measures by the Canadian government to prohibit the 
importation of goods made with child labour would put the burden 
of proof on the large importers and retailers to establish that they 
have not imported goods made with child labour. The costs of 
regulation would therefore be shouldered by the corporations 
themselves.
<P>
	Some will say that we cannot help child labourers by cutting 
them off from their source of employment which after all would in 
most cases be a crucial part of their family's subsistence income. In 
this regard, some observers have noted that the very success of the 
Rugmark program in raising public awareness of child  labour has 
hurt child labourers in Bangladesh where firms exporting to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2463"> 2463 </A></B>
<P>
western Europe and North America no longer employ children. 
Child labour may be exploitative, it has been argued, but for the 
very poor in very poor societies at least it allows for survival and 
we would be wrong to remove an opportunity for families to 
support themselves.
<P>
	The immediate impact of a successful cessation in international 
trade in goods made with child labour is something the 
international community must address. It must do so with a 
commitment to relate with developing countries in more ways than 
through liberalized markets. To argue that we should not stop the 
trade in goods made with child labour because it will harm the 
standard of living of the poor is to be blind to the fact that the 
international community can do much more for the very poor than 
purchase products made by their children.
<P>
	As everyone involved in international development knows, 
access to primary education is one of the keys to development. 
International communities should be helping the very poor by 
building schools for their children, not by buying trinkets made by 
their children.
<P>
	At this point, I would seek the unanimous consent of the House 
that my motion be voted on at the end of the hour.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like the record to show that 
pursuant to a letter I received from the deputy government House 
leader, it was the government that denied unanimous consent to my 
request.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to 
personally commend the member opposite for continuing to put 
before the public in this House of Commons the very important 
issue of the exploitation of child labour. He has spoken very 
passionately about the issue for a very long time. There are others 
in the House who share his point of view. I think the House would 
like to recognize that.
<P>
	The reason unanimous consent was denied is not that anyone in 
this House believes that this issue should not be dealt with but 
perhaps it was the method of dealing with it. The hon. member's 
motion in and of itself is very commendable and touches part of the 
problem but many of us believe the problem is much larger. Those 
of us who have been in this place for a while know that sometimes 
there is only one kick at the can on these things. If a motion which 
only addresses a small part of the problem gets on the agenda and is 
dealt with, it will be a very long time before parliamentarians are 
asked to deal with the broader issues in a more substantive manner.
<P>
	The member knows full well that these issues are dealt with by 
the procedure and House affairs committee. The bills and motions 
are drawn. Very many worthwhile private members' bills and 
motions come up and in its wisdom, that operating committee 
determines which will be votable. That committee has 
representatives from the Reform Party, the Liberal Party and the 
Bloc Quebecois. It decides on the votable items. It does not mean 
that certain issues are not important but that the committee does not 
believe they are issues which at that point should be dealt with.
<P>
	Before I start my brief remarks in support of what the member 
has put forward today, I am in an unusual position. I am 
representing the government which believes that this motion, 
although the intent of it is very commendable, does not deal with 
the issue broadly enough.
<P>
	To the member opposite, a letter was sent by our acting House 
leader to Mr. Craig Kielburger. The House leader said: ``As deputy 
leader of the government in the House, I am prepared to discuss 
with Mr. Blaikie ways and means of asking the House to pronounce 
itself on this issue in the very near future. This will have to be done 
in an orderly process in consultation with parliamentary leaders of 
all parties''. Although consent has not been given for this to be a 
votable motion, the deputy leader of the government in the House 
of Commons on behalf of the government has indicated support for 
the initiative that has been put forward and has put an offer to the 
member to deal with it expeditiously.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	Indeed, the people in the House and across the country will 
recognize that no less than the Prime Minister of Canada has 
indicated by public statements abroad, by statements outside of this 
place and also in the speech from the throne that this is an issue the 
government takes very seriously. It is an issue on which the 
government wishes to find a forum to deal with it very quickly.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is fully committed to action to end 
this abuse and to work co-operatively at all levels to ensure the 
elimination of conditions which limit the chance for all children to 
achieve their full potential.
<P>
	The validity of the goal underlining the motion is not in doubt. In 
fact, there is a great deal of logic to the idea that by making the 
products of child labour unprofitable, the practice will stop. Action 
against imports is an area where the government continues to 
struggle in considering the most effective way it can act on its 
throne speech commitments to child rights and protection and its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2464"> 2464 </A></B>
<P>
fundamental conviction that economic activity and human rights 
must occur in tandem.
<P>
	The debate is about whether prohibiting the import of goods 
made by child labour in and of itself will actually achieve the goal 
sought. A number of criteria have led the government deliberations 
on this issue.
<P>
	Is this action likely to be effective? Will it go as far as the 
government believes it will have to go in ending the practice? 
Labour practices which exploit and harm children present a 
dilemma of the worst and defining problems of underdevelopment; 
poverty, failed government, weak democratic institutions, just to 
name a few. Child labour is also a matter of culture and traditional 
social practice and a response to family poverty and a lack of 
access to education. Simply banning the import of goods that are 
made by child labour does not really deal with the fundamental 
underlying issues.
<P>
	In well over 90 per cent of the cases, children work in domestic 
rather than export oriented activities. Therefore 90 per cent of the 
activities would go unchecked. Import restrictions would not touch 
these millions of children, nor would they affect the conditions of 
underdevelopment which allow abusive practices to continue. 
Development is a key to ending such practices.
<P>
	There is evidence to conclude that import bans do not effectively 
reduce the problems associated with export products, as hard as 
they try. Rather they would drive the children who have been 
thrown out of the factories into potentially even more dangerous 
situations. Employers ready to use such practices are devious, 
determined and skilled. Other children will be found and their 
practices probably better disguised.
<P>
	Canada has made significant advances internationally toward 
encouraging and implementing a rules based multilateral and open 
trading system. It is the view of Canada that only by working 
multilaterally with other governments through international 
organizations, trade organizations, banks, et cetera, that we can 
truly deal in an expeditious fashion with the horrendous practice of 
exploitation of child labour.
<P>
	We have to look at the selection of the best alternatives to end 
child abuse. It is the view of the government that the most effective 
use of Canadian policy to end child labour would be: one, through 
long term development of co-operation aimed at meeting basic 
human needs, reducing poverty and promoting good governance; 
and two, through multilateral actions reflecting Canada's 
fundamental commitments to human rights and to just, equitable 
and a rules based trade and labour standard system.
<P>
	CIDA currently spends about $1 million per day directly 
addressing the development and protection of the needs of 
children. A number of these programs are aimed at expressly 
eliminating the causes of child labour, alleviating its most harmful 
effects and rehabilitating its victims. The Department of Foreign 
Affairs, the Department of National Defence and CIDA are also 
paying attention to the plight of child soldiers and to  children in 
the context of post-conflict reconstruction and transition 
economies where child employment, often physically very 
dangerous, is tolerated and encouraged as acceptable features of 
rebuilding social and economic conditions.
<P>
	Through CIDA and human resources development and with 
active policy support from foreign affairs, Canada has provided a 
grant of $700,000 to the international program for the elimination 
of child labour, to implement training to that end based on and in 
conjunction with countries that have committed to end the practice 
in their own back yards.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	The result of this project will feed directly into conferences to be 
held in Norway and The Netherlands later this year. These 
conferences will include over 30 developing and developed 
countries, including Canada, which will seek to produce real action 
plans to deal with the real problems of child labour.
<P>
	Canada was active in the decision of the International Labour 
Organisation to initiate a new convention to eliminate the most 
harmful forms of child labour. Foreign affairs and human resources 
development continue to work closely toward the pending June 
ILO conference which has child labour as its central theme. The 
government is also exploring means of providing better consumer 
education and is working with the private sector and community 
groups to that end.
<P>
	Building on the determination of Canadians to play an active 
role through their governments is a very key part of our 
commitment. Acting on our commitment in the throne speech, 
foreign affairs and justice have tabled an act to amend Canada's 
Criminal Code to permit the prosecution of Canadians who engage 
in child sex tourism, which is the most heinous form of child labour 
abuse.
<P>
	Canada is also working to ensure successful adoption of the 
optional protocol to the rights of the child concerning the sale of 
children, child pornography and child prostitution, activities which 
do not take place only in foreign countries. Unfortunately they also 
take place on the streets of cities and towns across Canada.
<P>
	We have also participated in the Americas regional consultation 
and have contributed substantively to the draft declaration of action 
in preparation for the conference on commercial sexual 
exploitation of children to be held in Sweden in August, to which 
we will be an active participant.
<P>
	We are learning through like minded countries and through our 
own experience that success is most assured where multiple 
approaches which stress local participation in poverty reduction, 
child care, education and broadly based job creation for youth and 
adults are emphasized, and where efforts are made on the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2465"> 2465 </A></B>
<P>
multilateral level to implement rules based trade and core labour 
standards.
<P>
	The government supports the initiative of the hon. member. 
However, the government has committed itself in the throne speech 
and in statements made by cabinet members, in particular by the 
Prime Minister, to taking its limited resources, its goodwill and its 
international reputation to the international community to deal with 
this very real problem.
<P>
	It is my hope that the offer which has been put forward by our 
deputy House leader to the hon. member will be taken up quickly. 
Perhaps in a very short period of time we will find the proper forum 
and the proper opportunity to have all members of this place 
participate in the debate to deal with the very far reaching problem 
of abusive child labour.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would first like to tell you that we will be supporting the 
bill introduced by the hon. member from the NDP, and we hope that 
this bill will be made votable.
<P>
	I would like to mention that a few days ago a delegation of 
Canadian parliamentarians, including myself, went to Geneva to 
take part in the international conference on human rights. As part 
of this conference, we visited the International Labour 
Organisation.
<P>
	I find it strange, to say the least, that the government is refusing 
to make this bill votable, because, and I will have an opportunity to 
explain this in some detail, the point was brought home to us, as 
Canadian parliamentarians, in figures we were given showing the 
International Labour Organisation's estimates of the extent of child 
labour in various countries throughout the world.
<P>
	I should perhaps read a definition provided by the International 
Labour Organisation: ``We consider child labour to be any 
economic activity performed by a person under the age of 15, 
regardless of their professional status''. There is a clear definition. 
It is the economic activity performed by a person under the age of 
15-not very old really-regardless of their professional status.
<P>
	The International Labour Organisation estimated that, 
worldwide, in 1990, there were 78 million children under the age of 
15 engaged in economic activities. And of these 78 million, close 
to 70 million were between the ages of 10 and 14. I think it is 
important to keep these figures in mind.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	It must be noted that there is, throughout the world and 
particularly within the large UN agencies, a growing awareness 
that it is no longer acceptable for 78 million of the world's children 
to find themselves in the situation of having to choose between 
education and work.
<P>
	As the mover of the motion perhaps mentioned in his remarks, 
Asia now holds the record for the largest number of child labourers. 
Sometimes, we might think that this is the fate of developing 
countries, that this is a reality not found in industrialized countries. 
I myself asked the question when I travelled to Geneva with a 
number of my colleagues, and I learned that there were companies 
in Ontario that exploited children, young children that are hired, 
particularly from immigrant families. I was told that this is also 
true in the United States, our neighbour to the south.
<P>
	In the case of Turkey, the International Labour Organisation has 
more specific estimates showing that in 1994 8.3 per cent of 
children in that country were economically active. I think that it is 
important to know, as Canadian parliamentarians, that this is not 
just a fate that befalls children unfortunate enough to have been 
born in developing countries.
<P>
	As a further point of interest, it is also known that children in 
rural areas are twice as active economically as those in urban areas. 
Still more interesting, because this gives us some idea of what we 
will have to do, or what we will have to subscribe to, at the next 
conference in Norway, to which our colleague has referred. 
Three-quarters of children involved in economic activity in the 
various countries around the world, those who make up the 78 
million figure I have referred to, are engaged in family businesses.
<P>
	This adds to the difficulty we will be facing, since there are all 
sorts of considerations relating to family life, life in cramped 
conditions, in short to the connections between a child and his 
immediate family. Three-quarters of children engaged in economic 
activity are involved in a family business, in very specific sectors 
such as the textile, garment or rug industries, as the motion's 
sponsor has mentioned, particularly in Egypt and India. They are 
also involved in making shoes.
<P>
	It is important to understand that a connection has to be made in 
the understanding we members of Parliament must have of this 
reality between access to education and child labour.
<P>
	When in Geneva, we came to understand that in the developing 
countries enrolling a child in primary school can take one-third of a 
family's cash income. Many of the households in question have a 
number of school aged children. This is why the International 
Labour Organization, in parallel with its efforts to help us in the 
rich countries understand how important it is for us to have 
solidarity around future child labour legislation in these countries, 
is making us see how closely related the issue is to education.
<P>
	We are, I think, capable of understanding this as members of 
Parliament, particularly those of us who are from Quebec. It is not 
all that long ago that we too have had to do a lot of catching up as a 
society in the area of education. It is only when the conditions for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2466"> 2466 </A></B>
<P>
access to  primary school are also addressed that it becomes 
possible to militate against child labour.
<P>
	Let me remind you that only 68 per cent of children in the world 
finish primary school, whereas the rate is 95 per cent in 
industrialized countries. I think these figures remind us of the 
whole relationship to be made between child labour and education. 
There is also of course a link, as the mover and the parliamentary 
secretary have pointed out, between child labour and family 
poverty. There is also a link between child labour and the overall 
wealth of a family.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	In studies done by the International Labour Organization, 
especially for countries like Bangladesh and India, child labour is 
closely linked to family survival.
<P>
	There is good reason why the International Labour Organization, 
through its director general in Geneva, has made it clear that, even 
within the UN, the issue is extremely sensitive. It is one that 
strongly divides the rich and the poor countries, because the poor 
countries are not necessarily prepared to pass legislation.
<P>
	This takes us back to the question of the transfer of wealth. What 
is the recommendation of the International Labour Organization? It 
asks us to set up an international organization and to establish a 
regulatory framework to monitor this issue. It reminds us that 
concerned governments should take three basic steps.
<P>
	The first, obviously, is to establish legislation on child labour. 
The second is to establish a national policy on child labour that 
would set public priorities and mobilize society as a whole. The 
ILO also reminds us that funding for a system of primary education 
guaranteeing access to quality schools for all children is absolutely 
vital if the battle is to be won.
<P>
	I thank the NDP member for introducing the motion. I hope it 
will be made a votable item, and I want to assure my colleague that 
the Bloc Quebecois is very concerned about this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure 
to speak to this motion which deals with a very serious and 
important topic, the exploitation of child labour.
<P>
	We in the House should be doing whatever we can in the best 
interests of children who are forced into labour throughout the 
world. The member who put forward this motion genuinely 
believes, as we all do, that we must address this problem. In the 
course of my remarks I hope to outline a non-partisan way to find 
some answers to this problem.
<P>
	While Motion No. M-189 makes a very strong statement by 
prohibiting the importation of goods manufactured through child 
labour, will it really improve the lives of the children we are talking 
about? I believe  there are other solutions. I welcome what we have 
heard here tonight. It is certainly a start, but I think there is another 
approach which I will try to explain.
<P>
	The main problem with implementing Motion No. M-189 is that 
many of the children who work in the developing world absolutely 
need the income to survive. If these kids lose their jobs right away 
without the simultaneous implementation of programs to feed, 
house and educate them, we would actually be hurting them, not 
helping them. This is not just my opinion. I have made a real 
attempt to try to get answers or at least some possible answers.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville who has 
provided me with information from agencies such as UNICEF and 
some of the other NGOs around the world. These organizations 
have looked at this problem for a long time. They are there, they 
deal with it on a day to day basis. They know where it exists, how it 
exists and they know the abuses that occur and the evils of it.
<P>
	This afternoon some of us had an opportunity to talk to five 
members from CCIC. It is an umbrella organization which tries to 
bring together the NGOs and put forth a common front not only to 
parliamentarians but to the donors, industry, labour and to all of the 
other areas.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	I did not have a long time with those people but I did get the 
opportunity to present this motion to them. I said I would be giving 
a speech in a couple of hours and wanted to know what they 
thought of the overview of what I had to say. I was pleased that we 
were all are opposed to child exploitation but that we cannot jump 
right into it, that we must come up with a program, a complete 
package to deal with this problem. They tended to reinforce what 
my other research had demonstrated.
<P>
	UNICEF officials oppose a ban on child labour because they 
have learned through experience how devastating the results of that 
can be. For example, just the threat of such a ban in the U.S. led to 
mass dismissals of children from garment factories in countries 
like Bangladesh. That is documented. They showed me the figures. 
They said this is proof and went on with a lot of other proof.
<P>
	One official said the schools could not absorb them and every 
one of them ended up in more exploitive, more dangerous and less 
remunerative work. Some of these poor children were even forced 
into the sex trade because of the loss of their garment factory jobs.
<P>
	This is not what Motion No. 189 seeks to achieve but it could be 
an unintentional byproduct. As a result I cannot support the motion 
as it is but I would suggest something further that might come up 
with a solution. I repeat, we all abhor the exploitation of children 
but we must have a back-up. We must have something else to offer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2467"> 2467 </A></B>
<P>
	Going back to the UNICEF study on this issue, those people 
surveyed over 2,000 garment factories that employ around 12,000 
children. They found that almost 90 per cent of the children were 
from single parent households and homes where there had been a 
death or a disability. More than 50 per cent of the children were the 
sole supporters for those particular families.
<P>
	In addition, often the children were girls who accompanied their 
mothers to the garment factory, and it was found that it was safer 
for them to be working alongside their mothers than if they were 
left home alone.
<P>
	I also draw on some of my personal experience. I think back to a 
visit to Nepal where I had the opportunity to visit with a number of 
Tibetan children who were making rugs. I thought I would be there 
for 10 minutes but I ended up there for a couple of hours. The 
amazing part was that those kids they knew five languages. These 
were 12, 13 or 14-year old kids. They had gained that experience 
from talking to tourists, from selling their rugs. I asked them about 
what they were doing. The dedication they felt in producing those 
rugs, in selling those rugs, in raising that money for their families 
and for the refugees who were coming from Tibet was quite 
amazing.
<P>
	I thought they would have been unhappy, angry about the 
situation, but it was quite different. I have been lucky to talk to kids 
in factories in Egypt, India and Rwanda, and it is the same sort of 
thing. I am not saying we should condone that. I am saying that 
before we put them out of a job, we need an alternative.
<P>
	What might that be? Clearly the problem of child labour is 
complex. There is not an easy fix for it. A longer term solution 
which takes into account the needs of the children and their 
families is what we really need to do.
<P>
	If the government would like to pursue such a solution through 
Canada's development aid program, perhaps to start off we could 
take a look at it in the foreign affairs committee, of which I am a 
member.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	I do not think there would be anything more rewarding for that 
committee than to take on a project like this. We would be able to 
say instead of doing some of the meaningless work we do, let us 
talk about this child labour situation. Let us examine the facts. Let 
us come up with a solution. Maybe there is a better way.
<P>
	Through the co-operation of the NGOs, and I know they would 
love us to get involved in a project like that, maybe we could 
collectively come up with an answer where our aid program, 
instead of going off to a government somewhere, could actually go 
to change lives.
<P>
	If nothing else, we would give those kids the money it would 
take to go school, maybe at night at first. Maybe  they would work 
during the day with their parents and then go to school at night. 
Maybe that is a possibility. However, we would help to better those 
kids.
<P>
	I do not have all the answers. All I know is there is a problem 
here. We all agree there is a problem. I have heard all the speakers 
here agree. Maybe this is something that would be really 
meaningful that we as parliamentarians could put our stamp on and 
say we collectively, as Canadians, did this for those impoverished 
kids.
<P>
	While I support the whole concept, I cannot support this motion. 
I know the member for Winnipeg Transcona has moved it with the 
best of intentions. That is why I would like to see the government 
take a long term, comprehensive approach to the problem of child 
labour.
<P>
	I also suggest the foreign affairs committee would be an 
appropriate forum for holding these meetings on this topic, 
interview witnesses, make recommendations to government and 
hopefully come with a solution to this serious problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I listened to the speakers this 
evening in this debate I can say this is one of the rarer moments in 
this place where I have no doubt there is unanimous agreement 
about the spirit of the motion among all members here.
<P>
	The economic exploitation of children is a violation of basic 
human rights. It is a violation that certainly outrages the sense of 
fairness and decency shared by virtually all Canadians.
<P>
	I know very well that if we held a vote calling on nations to 
abolish child labour, all members of this assembly, regardless of 
their political affiliation, would be on their feet to support such a 
motion.
<P>
	The hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona, who brought this 
motion forward, believes its passage would be a significant step by 
Canada in that direction. Regrettably it is rather more complex than 
that. Sweeping condemnation of all child labour assumes all 
children who work are being exploited. However, in many 
countries, including Canada, part time work is a fact of life for 
many children and it is neither exploitative nor detrimental to a 
child's development. It can help young people acquire skills and 
build confidence.
<P>
	I know the hon. member will say he is not addressing part time 
jobs of people working at restaurants, McDonald's or delivering 
newspapers after school, and I understand that. However, to 
effectively combat exploitive child labour we must distinguish 
between work that helps a child grow into a responsible adult and 
work that is clearly detrimental to their well-being. That is the 
approach of the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Oppressive child labour is rooted in poverty but it is also 
influenced by culture and traditional social values.  Its eradication 
will not be easy. Simply putting children out of work is not the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2468"> 2468 </A></B>
<P>
answer. We need alternatives that ensure their education, their care 
and, equally important, substantial incomes for their families.
<P>
	With reference to the hon. member's call for the government to 
prohibit imported goods made by child labour, as defined under the 
International Labour Organization conventions, let me point out 
that Canada is a member of the governing body of the ILO 
secretariat. We are represented by officials of labour programs 
from Human Resources Development Canada.
<P>
<B>(1855 )</B>
<P>
	That enables us to play a proactive role within the ILO. I am sure 
the hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona is aware the ILO has 
taken a number of initiatives regarding child labour. An agency of 
the United Nations with 173 member states in 1973, it adopted 
convention 138 which addresses the minimum age for admission to 
employment.
<P>
	There is considerable compliance in Canada with the underlying 
principles of convention 138. For instance, all jurisdictions in 
Canada have protective legislation specifying conditions under 
which children under the school leaving age can be employed. The 
employment of children under the school leaving age is generally 
prohibited during school hours. In terms of work outside school 
hours, jurisdictions generally prohibit work for young people under 
specified ages in specific occupations and situations which are 
likely to be injurious to their life, health, education or welfare.
<P>
	Nevertheless, there are some divergences between the 
convention's requirement and the Canadian situation. No 
jurisdiction in Canada prohibits all work, including light work, for 
children under age 13. The general approach in Canada is that light 
work outside school hours can be a valuable a learning and 
socializing experience.
<P>
	For these reasons, ratification of convention 138 is still under 
consideration. The agreement of all jurisdictions would be 
necessary to both ratification and implementation of the 
convention.
<P>
	Canada is also supporting the global effort by the ILO to 
eliminate child poverty through the international program for the 
elimination of child labour, commonly known as IPEC. Last 
February the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in co-operation with the 
Minister for International Co-operation and the Minister of Labour, 
announced that Canada is contributing some $700,000 to assist in 
this program
<P>
	Canada's contribution to the IPEC will enable the program to 
carry out its work, an endeavour that encourages governments to 
conform to international minimum age requirements for workers. 
This investment will help move us closer to the ending of the 
exploitation of nearly 200 million child workers around the world.
<P>
	The hon. member is no doubt aware that the ILO is holding its 
annual conference in June. Child labour is expected to be on the 
agenda of the formal tripartite meeting at the ministerial level. The 
Minister of Labour will head the Canadian delegation which will 
seek the support of other delegations to have the ILO member 
states address the most abusive forms of child labour.
<P>
	Besides the measures I have mentioned, in 1991 the Government 
of Canada ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
The convention required signatories to protect children from 
economic exploitation and to protect them from work likely to 
interfere with their education or cause harm to their health or 
well-being.
<P>
	Support for children is an important aspect of Canada's 
development aid program. My colleague from Dartmouth said a 
few minutes ago that about a million dollars a day from CIDA's 
budget is devoted to programs that address the needs of children.
<P>
	As a member of NAFTA, Canada is a partner in the North 
American agreement on labour co-operation which also includes 
the principle of labour protection for children and youth.
<P>
	Furthermore, we are not relying solely on measures now in 
place. The government is currently working with the ILO to build 
an international consensus. This consensus, which will be 
discussed at the 1998 ILO conference, will explore the 
establishment of a new legal instrument to strengthen international 
action against the worst forms of child labour. We believe our 
principal focus should address the main abuses suffered by working 
children.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion calls for the government to take 
unilateral action to prohibit the import of goods made by child 
labour. My colleague from Dartmouth has already spoken on that 
matter. There is also a risk of driving the problem underground 
which would force working children into even more dangerous 
situations.
<P>
	It is important to stress the government's unequivocal position 
that trade and human rights objectives are not in competition with 
each other. They are mutually reinforcing. They enable us to 
express our basic values. They enable us to work for clear and open 
rules to govern trade. In this way we reinforce our values and move 
closer to achieving our trade and human rights objectives. Besides 
working with the business community, the government is prepared 
to consult with trade unions, anti-poverty and child advocacy 
NGOs in the academic community.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	In closing, I say to the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona that 
I share his frustration. I share his anger that exploitative child 
labour exists. However, I honestly believe the government has a 
more effective approach which will contribute to long term 
solutions. For that  reason I regret that I am unable to support the 
hon. member's request for unanimous consent to have this motion 
made votable.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
two minutes which are remaining it is possible to say that the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Transcona has once again come forward 
with an excellent initiative.
<P>
	We have all heard various viewpoints. It is an initiative which 
requires political will and the unanimous, full voice of Parliament. 
It is not one of those issues where we can say, ``Yes, but-'', with a 
long list of qualifications which would have to be met before action 
is taken. It is one of those issues on which a political decision is 
made by way of the unanimous consent of the House, which would 
send a political signal to the government.
<P>
	The hon. member for Red Deer elaborated at length on all the 
qualifications which would be required for him to support the 
motion. Every <I>i</I> would have to be dotted, every <I>t</I> would have to be 
crossed. The hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona met most of the 
items which were mentioned in the intervention of the hon. 
member for Red Deer.
<P>
	The matter before us has moved and touched the Canadian 
people profoundly as a result of what they saw on television a few 
months ago.
<P>
	Obviously, parallel initiatives will have to be taken. However, 
first and foremost the international community must send a strong 
signal, not simply in Geneva at the ILO, but also in this and other 
Parliaments, to let the world know what we think of child labour 
and the remedial action that must be taken. In that respect I am sure 
that most members of the House would fully support the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Transcona.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the Order Paper.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, tonight 
the topic for discussion is whether the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans will keep the 1993-94 budget levels for the Freshwater 
Institute in Winnipeg and the Canadian Centre for Inland Waters in 
Burlington. Both of these institutions are internationally renowned 
freshwater research institutes. They study and monitor the quality 
of Canada's lakes and rivers.
<P>
	During the 1970s and 1980s policies were developed to control 
acid rain and to regulate the use of phosphates in detergents. Those 
policies were due, in good part, to the groundbreaking science 
developed at the Freshwater Institute.
<P>
	Another achievement came recently when researchers at the 
Freshwater Institute proved that the banned insecticide toxaphene 
travels by air from as far away as Asia and Central America and 
contaminates some of our lakes.
<P>
	These studies warn us and help us to understand the ecology of 
our country. They also tell us when toxins are entering our food 
chain. Thus we are able to monitor their effect on the long term 
health of Canadians and the environment.
<P>
	Freshwater is the resource of the future. Unfortunately, we are 
cutting back on the research budgets at the Freshwater Institute and 
the Centre for Inland Waters. I am told that in 1993-94 the budget 
for freshwater science was $10.5 million and that this amount will 
be reduced by up to 70 per cent. This spells virtually the end of 
important work of many Canadian scientists at the Freshwater 
Institute and their leading research as well. The protection of our 
freshwater resources for the benefit of future generations requires 
continuous funding of research.
<P>
	To conclude, tonight I ask the minister through his parliamentary 
secretary whether he will commit to maintaining the budget for 
freshwater science in Canada at the 1993-94 levels.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 
respond to the hon. member for Davenport who has distinguished 
himself in national and international environmental protection 
action.
<P>
	As part of the contribution of the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans to the federal government's program to manage the deficit, 
the department's budget will be reduced by approximately 40 per 
cent over five years. To meet its budget reduction target, the 
department has reviewed all its programs using the following four 
strategies: reduction, elimination, privatization and cost recovery.
<P>
	This program review has required some difficult decisions to be 
made regarding all departmental activities, including science 
programs. For example, the department will be divesting its 
responsibilities for over 800 recreational harbours. Research 
programs in parasitology and freshwater aquaculture will be 
eliminated and the department's major oceanographic research 
vessel MV <I>Hudson</I> will be decommissioned as part of its program 
review reductions.
<P>
	There is no question that the department's Freshwater Institute in 
Winnipeg and the Great Lakes Laboratory for Fisheries and 
Aquatic Sciences in Burlington have made  valuable contributions 
to the field of freshwater ecology. It has been impossible to insulate 
the budgets of these two centres in light of the substantial budget 
cuts facing the department.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2470"> 2470 </A></B>
<P>
	Despite the reductions to its science programs across the 
country, the department is committed to maintaining a freshwater 
science program at both the Freshwater Institute and the Great 
Lakes Laboratory for Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. Research 
priorities for the freshwater science program at the Freshwater 
Institute include focus on the experimental lakes area, ELA, fish 
health diagnostics and maintenance of expertise to support the 
department's fish habitat management responsibilities as well as 
expertise on growth and reproduction of fish.
<P>
	In addition to the department's core funding for the ELA, the 
department is continuing to seek partnerships that will provide long 
term funding stability for the ELA program.
<P>
	In the Great Lakes, the department will focus on habitat 
restoration in areas of concern in the lower lakes, research on 
accidentally introduced species and the measurement of toxic 
contaminants in fish.
<P>
	Government-wide, it is important to note that there are a number 
of agencies, particularly Environment Canada, that have freshwater 
research programs. Environment Canada operates such major 
facilities as the National Water Research Institute and the National 
Hydrology Research Institute.
<P>
	The budget for Environment Canada's programs in freshwater is 
much larger than that of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
The reduction in the department cannot be downplayed, but the 
government is and will continue to be an active and major force in 
issues affecting the freshwater environment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.08 p.m.)
