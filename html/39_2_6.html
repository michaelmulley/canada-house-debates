      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill will require all voters to establish their identity, with their faces visible, before they can vote.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have mentioned, this situation is absurd and must be corrected through legislation. This is why we are introducing the bill. </div>

As I am sure you recall, a few days ago, I informed you that the Bloc Québécois intended to respond to the Conservatives' request concerning Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073283,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073283&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-357</A>. They called for a royal recommendation concerning the creation of an independent employment insurance fund. I will now raise a few points that will surely enable you to make an informed decision about this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring to your attention our argument against requiring a royal recommendation to pass Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073283,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073283&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-357</A>, to create an independent employment insurance fund. That is why I am addressing you today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, we recognize that the content of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073283,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073283&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-357</A> is very similar to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1461101,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1461101&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-280</A>, as introduced in the 38th Parliament. It is clear that the Speaker's ruling on June 13, 2005, included a number of elements that were open to interpretation. The Conservatives are referring to those very elements to support their assertion that the bill now before us requires a royal recommendation. That is why we must take the time to review the Conservatives' arguments point by point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Conservatives claim that passing this bill would lead to additional expenses. That is totally false, because the current legislation already provides for fluctuations with respect to premiums and conditions of eligibility, which determine the fund's revenues and expenditures that go through the government's consolidated revenue fund. This bill is not designed to change these provisions, so it is not true that the bill would engender additional costs. Therefore, there is no basis for the claim that this bill would bring about “additional” or “new” expenditures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are saying that the appropriation of public revenue will be altered depending on the circumstances and the way it is managed. The current legislation provides for a contribution to be deducted from every pay cheque and it is understood that this money will be used to ensure supplementary income to contributors who need it because of their own economic circumstances. The eligibility criteria for employment insurance and the premium rates that determine the revenue and expenses of the fund, will serve the same purpose and use the same mechanisms when this bill is enacted. I would add that a change to the eligibility criteria would still require a legislative change. Let us be clear, not only does this bill not require additional expenditures, but what is more, the purpose of and reason for these public funds will not change in any way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We acknowledge, as the Speaker said on June 13, 2005, that it does involve transferring public funds to an independent employment insurance fund, but royal recommendation is not needed for two reasons. The Speaker himself said, on May 9, 2005, that:</div>
    </p><a name="Para754421"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The royal recommendation is also required where a bill alters the appropriation of public revenue “under the circumstances, in the manner and for the purposes set out” in the bill.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para754422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there will indeed be a transfer of revenue to an independent fund, the circumstances, manner and purposes by which the commission will set the premiums and manage the revenue will not change at all. Furthermore, the spirit of the current act will be better protected since the revenue generated by the premiums will no longer be used to serve interests other than those defined by the act, namely those of the workers. Using revenues that should go into the fund, but instead are taken into the consolidated revenue fund for purposes not listed in the act, will no longer be possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A royal recommendation would be necessary if the bill were seeking to withdraw revenue from the government's consolidated revenue fund to be used for purposes other than those described in the act. In this case, it is clear that the purpose of the bill will not alter anything in the current legislation. On the contrary, it will allow the spirit of the act to be respected and prevent the misappropriation of funds that the Liberals and Conservatives are known for. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015">(1015)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the argument cited on June 13, 2005, that the investment of public monies by the Commission represents new or different expenditures, must have workers seeing red.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government continued to invest—or, in other words, spend—the public monies from the fund to pay down the Canadian debt, which violated the spirit of the law. It clearly did not act in the interests of workers, who watched these monies—that they, with their employers, had paid to ensure themselves against economic downturns—disappear. It was the government, not this bill, that invented a new purpose for the fund and its surpluses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, adding 13 commissioners will be financed by a small increase in expenses, which will no longer appear as an expenditure from the consolidated revenue fund, given that the Conservatives recognize that the employment insurance fund will no longer be a part of the consolidated revenue fund. Since the Conservatives no longer know how to oppose an idea that they supported in the past for purely populist considerations, today they are attempting to use procedural arguments to avoid openly declaring themselves against a bill that is necessary and that contributors have demanded for many years. Only their neo-conservative ideology, hidden behind a populist facade, can justify such deplorable actions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one will be surprised if I speak specifically about justice. Overall, the Bloc Québécois was disappointed in the throne speech. Our leader, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78493,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78493&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Laurier—Sainte-Marie</A>, clearly indicated our conditions and expectations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also spoke about the Kyoto protocol. We clearly wanted the government to confirm that it would follow through with the commitment we made when Kyoto was signed: to bring greenhouse gases down to their 1990 levels and then reduce them further still. We do not have a green government—this we know. This government is very irresponsible when it comes to the environment, and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78641,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78641&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie</A> has had many opportunities to speak about this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also have liked the government to agree with the views of many important representatives of civil society and our fellow citizens, that Canada's mission in Afghanistan must end in 2009. Since the beginning of the mission we have been critical of the fact that there has not been a satisfactory balance of development assistance, international cooperation and military objectives. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously we hope that attention will be focused on the entire question of forestry and the manufacturing sector. We know what hard times those sectors have experienced. Certainly we hope that supply management will also be discussed, for it is an extremely important issue in rural communities. And we hope that the government will eliminate the spending power in relation to matters under provincial jurisdiction. There have been calls for this for 50 years, and the Bloc Québécois is certainly not going to be satisfied with the government’s dishonest subterfuge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that introduction, we must now talk about the justice system. First, what an exercise in cosmetics this is, what an exercise in stage management! Watching the press conference given by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A>, his colleague the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78755,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78755&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Public Safety</A>, and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78745,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78745&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</A>, we had the impression that we were attending a play by Molière, starring Tartuffe. We were given to think that since the Conservatives took power in 2006 the House of Commons has been the victim of obstruction when it comes to the justice system. We were also given to think that the government has been prevented from having its justice initiative passed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet when we look a little closer, we see that since January 2006 the Conservative government has tabled 12 bills relating to the justice system. As we speak, six of those bills have received royal assent and have thus become law. Of those six bills that have become law, three were passed using what is called the fast-track procedure, with the unanimous consent of all leaders in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So out of 12 bills, six have become law, and three of those were passed with the consent of all parties using the fast-track procedure; four reached the Senate, at first, second and third reading, while both in the House and in committee there were only two bills remaining. It has to be said that in parliamentary history there have been more vigorous examples of obstruction. When six bills receive royal assent, four are being considered in the Senate and only two are left, you cannot, in all honesty, appear at a press conference and say that you have been unable to get your bills passed.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, there was Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172003,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172003&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-9</A>, on conditional sentences. It is true that we did propose some amendments. It is our job to do that. We are a responsible opposition. What is the role of the opposition? It is to ensure that bill are improved and made as perfect as possible. We would be completely irresponsible if we did not do our work. As far as the bill on conditional sentences is concerned, the government ultimately wanted to do away with that option for judges and we highlighted that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2222191,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2222191&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-17</A>, which dealt with judges’ salaries, was also passed, followed by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2250003,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2250003&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, a rather technical bill on DNA data banks. Moreover, in tribute to our unfortunately deceased colleague, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2277339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2277339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-19</A>, which creates a new offence under the Criminal Code with regard to street racing, was passed unanimously.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other bills were passed within 48 hours, which is an indication of the cooperation among opposition parties. One of those two was introduced by the Bloc Québécois, because of incidents of piracy, the unauthorized use of camcorders to record movies in theatres, particularly in Montreal. The other bill dealt with the signing by Canada of an international convention to fight organized crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four other bills were being dealt with in the Senate, or I should say, “the other place.” There was, first, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, concerning minimum penalties for offences involving firearms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, there was Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2304794,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2304794&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-22</A>, which dealt with the age of protection under the Criminal Code. Some of my colleagues followed that subject with a great deal of interest. The Bloc Québécois had asked for a five-year proximity clause. The Bill was before the Senate. In spite of some questions, our position was relatively favourable. The bill had been amended in committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2304866,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2304866&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-23</A>, somewhat technical, on the language of juries and the accused.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not want to forget to say, Mr. Speaker, that I am sharing the time allotted to me with the likeable and charming member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78644,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78644&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sherbrooke</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2519653,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2519653&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-35</A> on reversing the onus of proof was also passed. Some television journalists described this bill as reversing the onus of proof for parole. However, the bill was not about parole but about pre-trial bail hearings. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were two bills remaining about which we had and still have questions and amendments to propose. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first deals with drug-impaired driving. We are in favour of the new provision in the bill requiring individuals to take sobriety tests. Peace officers and police could stop people who are driving erratically under the influence of drugs. We were in favour of certain provisions to require people to submit to sobriety tests. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We amended the bill however because, as unlikely as it might seem, it would have been irresponsible to pass this Conservative bill without any amendments. Imagine someone driving along in his car together with a friend. They drive down the road—let us say the Trans-Canada highway, for example, to please some of my colleagues here—and it turns out that the friend, who is driving, has marijuana in his pockets or his luggage. If we had passed this bill, the car owner would have been held liable. That did not seem responsible to us or legally sound. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also another bill about which we had a lot of questions. Unfortunately though, I have only a minute left and so I am going to proceed to my conclusion and allow the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78644,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78644&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sherbrooke</A> to take over. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are going to take our work in committee very seriously. We will not allow ourselves to be dictated to by the government which, in a fit of authoritarianism, might demand that the opposition propose no amendments to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>. </div>

If I am not mistaken, he is the youngest member of Parliament from Quebec. The bill he is referring to concerns dangerous offenders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 50 years, the Criminal Code has contained provisions we have not challenged. We agree that some people are extremely violent and present such a high risk of reoffending that they must be declared dangerous offenders. People who are declared dangerous offenders can receive indeterminate prison sentences and are not eligible for parole for seven years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the new Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>, has to do with the list of 22 offences. Some of them, such as incest or attempted murder, are very serious, but others such as assault need some explanation. For instance, if my dear colleague and I were to have a fight—it would not last very long—that would constitute assault.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not downplaying assault, but we want to know why it is on the list of 22 offences. After an offender has committed three offences on the list, automatic sentencing applies. We question whether this is the right way to assess how dangerous an offender is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that we will vote against the bill, no more than it means we will vote in favour of the bill. What it means is that we have some serious work ahead of us, in committee.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, would like to ask him about the member's response to this question vis-à-vis the reverse onus. I am exasperated when I hear this member and other members in the House, members from the Liberals and sometimes also from the NDP, decrying this. Somehow they feel it is unfair to people because they are being called guilty instead of being called innocent until proven guilty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not true that if one has been charged and convicted of serious crimes such as aiming a gun at a person, pulling the trigger and missing, not once but twice or three times, it really has been the accused himself who has proven he is a dangerous offender? The bill the member is talking about merely proposed that at this stage this individual be declared what he has already proven himself to be, that is, a dangerous offender. The reverse onus actually is a way out, whereby this person gets yet another chance in which he can say, “I am not a dangerous offender and here is the proof”. It gives him that opportunity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we not have, as a government and as the enforcers of the law in this country, the obligation to put away people who just cannot learn after one, after two and after three times?</div>

    </p><a name="Para754464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore try to be very clear. First of all, the American states that tried this system of reverse onus later reversed their decision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because in matters of justice, when we set out to imprison someone indefinitely—I hope the interpreter will translate this clearly: the result of being declared a dangerous offender is indefinite incarceration—this is not seen as automatic sentencing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that the Criminal Code should contain provisions for declaring someone a dangerous offender. Now, maybe after just one offence, an individual might have to be declared a dangerous offender. Perhaps three offences are not needed. It is possible, at this time, for a psychiatrist to be called by the Crown in order to testify, after one offence, that the individual should be declared a dangerous offender.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754467"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para754470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois was quick to set out what the throne speech should contain. Even though this has probably been done many times before, for the benefit of the voters who are watching us on the parliamentary channel—I imagine there are a few million people watching this morning—we should give a bit of background again and tell people what may have inspired this throne speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-one of the 126 Conservative members used to be Reformers, and eight of the 32 cabinet members were as well. That gives us some idea of the thinking behind this throne speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc's demands were very clear on Afghanistan, federal spending power, measures to address the forestry crisis, meeting Kyoto commitments and commitments to Quebec, and supply management. Of course, there were many other elements, which my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hochelaga</A> mentioned previously, including justice. Important issues still have to be discussed in this House, and I know he will do a good job and introduce important improvements to the bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did not address any of the Bloc's five priorities. Although we demanded a withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2009, the government set the date at 2011, after creating a commission to analyze the situation and make recommendations to the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal spending power has by no means been eliminated. Instead, the government is placing limits on federal spending power for new shared-cost programs in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. We were clear on this. Federal spending power had to be eliminated, and in the event the government invested in areas of jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces, they had to have the right to opt out of these programs with full compensation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also care about respecting our Kyoto commitments. The government's sanctimonious attempts to make us believe that it is an ardent crusader in the fight against greenhouse gases and for clean air are green indeed, but they are more often the inexpert sort of green than the environmentally friendly kind. We are a long way from achieving the goals that we must reach as soon as possible given the current state of our air quality and the greenhouse gases that are threatening the entire planet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to discuss measures to address the crisis in the forestry industry and supply management.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis in the forestry industry has been going on for a long time. The Conservative government—which has done no better than its Liberal counterpart—resolved the softwood lumber crisis in a way that was bad for the industry and for workers. The Bloc Québécois has demanded that the government do something to help the forestry industry and, especially, forestry workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Speech from the Throne, the government said that it was concerned about the crisis, but it offered nothing concrete to help revive the industry or to help older workers who have been laid off. I would like to read the following excerpt from the throne speech.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I hear that “it will continue to do so in the next session”, knowing that 130,000 jobs have been lost in Quebec in the manufacturing sector since 2003—of which 65,000 since the Conservatives came to power—I find unfortunately that the fears of Quebec and Canadian workers are justified with regard to even greater job losses in the future than what we have already experienced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the manufacturing sector, I would like to return to the attitude of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78741,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78741&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of International Trade</A>, who is currently negotiating 28 free trade agreements with various countries. He is rushing into 28 agreements when no study or analysis of the impact on Quebec and Canadian industries has been carried out—nothing that was not minor or cursory. Consequently, we are unaware of the potential impact on manufacturing jobs in Quebec and Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know very well that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78741,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78741&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of International Trade</A> supports purchasing goods at the lowest cost for our companies. Therefore, he supports importing to supply Canadian companies. This also has a direct impact on the Canadian suppliers of the same types of goods. This will result in greater job losses.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78503,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78503&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Terrebonne—Blainville</A> tabled Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3075743,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3075743&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-411</A> to establish more specific and pertinent criteria for preventing, among other things, dumping by various countries.

That gives rise to concern, as voiced by the government itself in the throne speech, that the situation will further deteriorate rather than improve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is supply management. It is obviously an important aspect which has an impact on the regions, in agriculture, forestry and manufacturing, because of the crises.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know full well that the regions are important components in the development of a country—Quebec and Canada as well—and in the stability of agriculture, as well as of employment in the manufacturing sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for agriculture, let us remember that in the past few months, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78741,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78741&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of International Trade</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111568,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111568&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food</A> have made many statements that betray the government's true intentions. Even if, in the throne speech, the government seems to be in favour of maintaining supply management, contradictory comments have been made. The Minister of International Trade even said that one day supply management would have to come to an end. The former Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food suggested that supply managed farmers prevented the government from properly defending the interests of Canadians at the WTO, and that they should consider compromising. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is clear that none of the Bloc's five demands was satisfied. And even if there seems to be an interest in supply management, the evidence is there and the comments have been made. The agricultural community will not be able to survive with policies like the ones this government could develop.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045">(1045)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, supply management is very important, as is the manufacturing industry. But all the other issues brought up by the Bloc Québécois in speeches and debates are important as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754489"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for these five main reasons—the demands I mentioned earlier—and for a number of other reasons that were brought up in this House, we ask the Liberal Party to reconsider its position, to not give in, to not go against its beliefs and to give the Conservative government a chance to go back to the drawing board.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hon. member and I sat on the international trade committee together in the last session. We had some very interesting discussions. We learned many interesting facts, some of which the hon. member maybe did not portray in the best light, regarding some of the reflections from witnesses who talked about what this new government has done to support the economy, to grow the economy and to encourage trade.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take exception to some of the member's comments. Certainly some jobs have been lost in many of the sectors, and we empathize with those folks who have lost their jobs. However, we have to look at the overall numbers. Since this government took power, there have been 590,000 new jobs created and 80% of those new jobs are high paying jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are very adaptable. They do not necessarily have to move to find these jobs. They have gone out and found these jobs. That is a positive. They think that this government is doing a great job of providing new economic growth for them. In the last year alone, 280,000 new jobs have been created.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize in the hon. member's region there have been some job losses. We have had this discussion. However, is there not a reflection in the jobs that have been created that they actually are compensating for some of the lost jobs?</div>

On a political level, the Conservatives are telling us not to look at the polls but at what is happening on the ground. However, when we see statistics on the unemployment rate, we have to be equally careful not to always accept the figures we are given as gospel truth, since determining the unemployment rate and conducting political polls are done by a similar process and methodology.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754496"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, jobs have been created, but what kind of jobs? We have to make a distinction between the manufacturing world in Quebec and that in the rest of Canada. It is absolutely not the same thing. They do not compare. Quebec's economic growth is largely geared toward exports. The manufacturing world is rather seriously affected by the Conservative government's international trade policies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the ease with which the Conservative government enters into free trade agreements with other countries, without really weighing the consequences to the manufacturing industry, causes significant job losses: since 2003, almost 130,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing. These jobs may have been replaced, but not with jobs of the same quality with the same income for the workers. We see more workers slipping into poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our society we look at the unemployment rate from time to time and we say that everything is going well since the rate is steady or going down. Nevertheless, people are getting poorer. We have to do everything we can to try to keep our manufacturing jobs. We have to invest in research and development. We have to encourage innovation and not just settle for creating indirect service jobs that often pay minimum wage. We have lost a great deal of good salaries that helped people get out of poverty, a poverty they are quietly slipping back into with Canada's trade policies.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to stand here today to talk about one of the five priorities that our government set out in last week's Speech from the Throne. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was laid out in the speech, this is a time of economic uncertainty and volatility in the wider world, and while the economic fundamentals of Canada continue to be strong, our country is not immune from this turbulence. The key to getting through this kind of turbulence is coming out in a strong and prosperous way and making sure that we get the economic picture right. This is critical.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para754502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are certainly living in dynamic economic times. Technology is changing faster than ever and there is no slowdown in sight. The power of computers doubles every 18 months and bandwidth is expanding even faster.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when we have finally figured out our BlackBerries, we are being offered the next generation of wireless devices we can use to access more information faster than we could ever have imagined. All of this is already here, literally at our fingertips.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para754504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid this fast-paced change, intense global pressure is now redefining how businesses must compete. As a result, economic success is judged by different standards than it was even 10 years ago because with the click of a mouse, billions of dollars can move around the globe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it stands, Canada is well positioned to be successful. Our economy is strong, growth continues to rise, unemployment is low, and taxes are declining.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of our industries are in excellent shape. Our aerospace industry is the fifth largest in the world. Our biotechnology sector ranks third in terms of the number of firms. Our automotive industry stands among the best in the world and our performance in oil and gas extraction is unequalled the world over.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite all this, there is no doubt that Canada is still facing economic challenges and that we must be vigilant if we are to be able to stand up to global economic pressures. As I said, part of the solution lies in having a clear understanding of the overall situation. It is the government’s responsibility to do that.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para754508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since coming to office, our government has taken that responsibility seriously. We have worked hard at creating the right economic climate, cutting taxes, reducing the federal debt, investing in education, improving the regulatory environment. In other words, we have ensured that the best conditions for the private sector exist so that the private sector may flourish, so that it may do what it does best, which is to create jobs for Canadians and prosperity.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advantage Canada, the government’s long term economic plan, is based on sound fiscal management and is intended to create five advantages for Canada that will help individuals to improve their quality of life and help businesses to succeed on the global scene.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para754511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is a tax advantage establishing the lowest tax rate on new business investment anywhere in the G-7. Second is a fiscal advantage eliminating Canada's total government net debt within a generation. Third is an entrepreneurial advantage reducing unnecessary regulation and red tape. Fourth is a knowledge advantage developing the best educated, most skilled and flexible workforce in the world.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para754512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fifth advantage, an infrastructure advantage, will create modern, world-class roads, bridges and ports to ensure the seamless flow of people, goods and services.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para754513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In providing effective economic leadership, the government has made great strides, but we realize that more needs to be done. The Speech from the Throne gives us a clear path to follow in moving toward Canada's goals and economic objectives.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para754514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that the taxes Canadians pay are still too high. Since we came to power, we have implemented or announced income tax and other tax reductions of over $37 billion for individuals and families, and reductions of more than $3.5 billion for businesses. But we have to cut taxes even farther.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why we will be presenting a long term plan for broad based tax relief for individuals, businesses and families, one that will include keeping our promise to cut the GST again.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para754516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know it is the government's role to set the right conditions for entrepreneurs to succeed and to help create the ideal climate in Canada. In this sense, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> released the national strategy on science and technology in May and invested $1.9 billion in budget 2007 to support new science and technology policies, programs and priorities.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadians expect all levels of government to cooperate in creating a more vigorous economy. The government of Canada is firmly resolved to work together with the provinces and territories to eliminate barriers to domestic trade. We will be considering ways of using the federal power to regulate trade and commerce to improve the way our economic union works, for the benefit of all Canadians.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para754518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is aware also of the need for copyright reform and that this is essential to ensuring Canada remains competitive. We will introduce legislation in the next few months that will provide legal measures for rights holders, clarify the rules relating to copyright as they apply to Internet service providers, address the educational and research use of copyrighted materials, and address consumer interests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will launch our building Canada plan, the largest investment in Canadian infrastructure in half a century. The result will be safer roads and bridges, more competitive businesses and, indeed, a better quality of life for all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success as a trading nation relies in part on modern and efficient transportation systems. This is indeed a primary responsibility of government. Through the building Canada plan, we are investing in our transportation and trade hubs, including the Windsor-Detroit corridor and the Atlantic and Pacific gateways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that what the government has put forward in the throne speech has received wide acclaim from Canadian business leaders. Today in the <i>National Post</i> Carrie Tait noted that Canadian business leaders praised this particular throne speech, with 71% of business leaders from small and medium-sized businesses considering this a great road forward for the country.

Only 5% found these measures to be undesirable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an incredible vote of confidence. Of the people surveyed, 88% are in strong support of reducing interprovincial trade barriers. As well, a majority of those polled are strongly in favour of the proposed plan to reduce the GST to 5% from 6%.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And by providing economic leadership, our government will also be standing up for Canada’s traditional industries. Key sectors such as forestry, manufacturing and tourism all have challenges that must be met. The fluctuation in the Canadian dollar in recent years is one of the factors causing problems for Canada’s traditional industries. While our government has already taken steps to assist Canada’s traditional industries, we will be doing more. Our long term plan of broad based tax relief for individuals, businesses and families will provide significant and timely assistance for those industries.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agricultural sector will benefit from our government's promotion of biofuels and the new growing forward agricultural framework.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, this is an excellent throne speech. Canadians can trust that the government will provide them with continued leadership to ensure continued prosperity and a quality of life unequalled anywhere in the world.</div>

There are many deficiencies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the government missed a wonderful opportunity to paint the future for Canadians. A successful Speech from the Throne is one that paints a future where people see themselves. I do not think many Canadians see themselves in this Speech from the Throne.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cities do not see themselves in this speech. Gord Steeves, the president of the Canadian Federation of Canadian Municipalities states, “Clearly, the budget surpluses of recent years demonstrate that the government has the resources to provide tax relief to Canadians and invest in our cities and communities”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, of course, was the Liberal legacy.</div>

Let there be no doubt that when Canadians look at the throne speech, they will not see an image of the Liberals. There will be no Liberals who will find themselves represented in this throne speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we talk about sovereignty and Canada's place in the world, economic leadership, or dealing with criminal justice or the environment, and I will deal with each of those in turn, this is not a Liberal throne speech. It sets the priorities of Canadians, not the priorities of the Liberal Party. In that sense, I agree with my friend. If Liberals look at this throne speech, they will not find themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to dealing with sovereignty and Canada's place in the world, the Liberal Party had 13 years to deal with these issues. The Liberals had 13 years to assert our sovereignty in the world, in the north, in the Northwest Passage, in Canada's Arctic, and they did not do that. This government is doing it. We are engaged in the necessary steps to make that happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of our place in the world, this government and this <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> have done more to put Canada on the world stage in a proud place, standing up for freedom and democracy, than ever happened under the Liberal Party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, and I do not think anyone in the House would disagree, that we will not find the Liberal image in this throne speech, because we are getting on with broad based tax cuts for families, for businesses and for individual taxpayers and that is not what the Liberal Party is about. We have reduced the GST. We have indicated that we are going to reduce the GST again. Liberals will be deflated by the throne speech because the throne speech is about reducing the taxes of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On criminal justice, the bill that has been put before the House is dealing with the priorities of Canadians. If one is soft on crime the way the Liberals are, one will not find one's image in the throne speech. There is no doubt about that. But this is what Canadians are telling us they want to see. We are moving forward. We are tough on crime. We are going to deal with these issues because they matter to Canadians. We are going to keep our streets and our communities safe. That is what people want us to do.</div>

We promised to do it in a manner that was committed, focused and fiscally responsible. That is exactly what we did and that is what we will continue to do.</div>

This commitment is why Canadians sent us to Ottawa. We have a plan, a plan that is not just for the short term to win votes. Our plan shows that we are in it for the long haul. It is a long term economic plan called Advantage Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage Canada provides Canada with five key advantages so that we can compete effectively in the global economy and attract new growth and investment. Let me remind hon. members of just what those advantages are.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Advantage Canada provides a tax advantage. In short, our goal is to reduce taxes for all Canadians and establish the lowest tax rate in the G-7 on new business investment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Advantage Canada will create a fiscal advantage by eliminating Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third part of our long term plan is to create an entrepreneurial advantage for Canada by reducing unnecessary regulation and red tape and increasing competition in the Canadian marketplace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, Advantage Canada will provide a knowledge advantage. This will create the best educated, most skilled and most flexible workforce so that Canada is ready to take on the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Advantage Canada will create an infrastructure advantage. In order to compete internationally, we need to build the modern bridges, roads and gateways necessary to link our nation and make our workers and businesses more efficient.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put our plan into action by building on previous initiatives to deliver on the government's vision for Canada. Today, I would like to remind hon. members of some of the initiatives the government has taken, initiatives that are important to Canada and to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first jobs to be done when we formed the government was to reduce taxes for Canadians. We did that in our inaugural budget of 2006. In fact, we delivered more tax relief than the previous four federal budgets combined, something to be proud of. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not stop there. Our first two budgets, combined with our tax fairness plan, have provided significant tax relief for Canadian individuals, families, students and seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, we reduced the GST from 7% to 6%, which was a tax cut for everyone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We introduced the Canada employment credit to help offset the costs of working. This recognizes employees' work expenses for things such as home computers, uniforms and supplies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are providing a new child tax credit that recognizes the additional expenses involved in raising a child. About three million taxpayers will benefit from this initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is more, we are introducing a working income tax benefit to help low income Canadians over the so-called welfare wall. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110">(1110)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are increasing the lifetime capital gains exemptions for Canada's two million small business owners to $750,000 from the existing $500,000, and the first increase in that in 20 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our tax fairness plan, we introduced income splitting for pensioners, a move that will provide targeted assistance to many seniors. The tax fairness plan also took action to level the playing field between corporations and income trusts, bringing Canada in line with other jurisdictions around the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2007, we are taking tax fairness a step further with our anti-tax haven initiative, an initiative that will help prevent tax avoidance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government also recognizes the importance of improving our ability to compete globally and we have done just that. The fact is that we have moved quickly to improve Canada's competitive environment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what we have done so far. We are reducing the general corporate income tax rate from 20.5% in 2008 as part of our commitment to 18.5% by 2011. We are eliminating the corporate surtax in 2008. We increased the threshold for small business income eligible for a reduced federal tax rate from $300,000 to $400,000 as of 2007.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are reducing the 12% rate for eligible small business income to 11.5% in 2008 and 11% in 2009. We eliminated the federal capital tax in 2006 and we increased capital cost allowance rates for buildings used in manufacturing and processing and other assets. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also providing a major new accelerated capital cost allowance for manufacturers until the end of 2008. This will allow them to write off their investments and equipment over two years, a much needed shot of adrenalin to help Canadian businesses encourage new economic investment and create jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, our plan for Canada is more than just reducing taxes. Advantage Canada's multi-faceted plan illustrates just that. Just look at budget 2007's historic investment of more than $16 billion over seven years for infrastructure. This brings federal support in this area to over $33 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we are reducing the federal paper burden for businesses by 20% and reducing the number of tax filings and remittances for more than 350,000 small businesses. This government set out a challenging agenda for Canada and it has risen to that challenge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, we have reduced taxes significantly for individuals, families and businesses, total tax reductions over three years of approximately $41 billion. We have reduced the federal debt by $27 billion. Not only that, through our tax back guarantee we are passing on the interest saving on reducing the national debt to Canadians by reducing personal income taxes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are limiting the growth of spending in government, we are balancing the books, and we are taking on the environmental challenge with a plan that is both responsible and capable of being achieved in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are we today? I can say that we are in an enviable position internationally. Our economic fundamentals are rock solid. We are on the best financial fiscal footing of any country in the G-7.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do we go from here? We have a solid foundation firmly in place. The Speech from the Throne lays out the plan for the future that will build on that foundation. The government said in the Speech from the Throne that it will bring forward a long term plan of broad based tax relief for individuals, businesses and families. This follows through on our commitment to ensure economic security for Canadians as we look toward the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we need to work together as Canadians. By supporting the initiatives contained in the Speech from the Throne we can make this happen. The upcoming fall economic and fiscal update will detail progress on our plan, which is built on a foundation of sound fiscal management. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together we have built a country that is prosperous and safe. Now, with strong leadership and a solid plan, we can build an even stronger Canada and offer an even better future for our children.</div>

As I said before, Canadians are very adaptive. They have gone out and found new jobs. There are job opportunities because of the strong economic growth in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize this may not refer specifically to the hon. member's province, but in Quebec alone that province added 70,000 jobs this year. Those are not just part time jobs. Those are real, high paying jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member asked how tax cuts help Canadians. We cut the GST from 7% to 6%. Every Canadian who spends money benefits from that tax cut. So for anyone to suggest that this tax cut did not help all Canadians is not reflective of the positive decision that was for this government to make. Positive enough with the feedback we have received, we are going to push forward on reducing it to 5% because we realize with this strong economy people are spending money. They want to receive the tax benefits and by reducing it to 5% there is going to be tax reductions for all Canadians.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is $3.7 billion to support low and modest income Canadians through the cut in the GST. Those are real numbers.

More than $7.4 billion for Canada's low income seniors and $1.4 billion to provide basic social development programs for our first nations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754588"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para754590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speech from the Throne is a broad array of platitudes. It is made up of self-congratulatory statements and promises, some of which are encouraging, some of which of course were made before and remain unfulfilled.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Hon. Shawn Murphy: </B>Yes, I will. I neglected to mention that. I will be sharing my time with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78587,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78587&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Don Valley East</A>, and I want to thank you for pointing that out to me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the general ideological thrusts I certainly can agree with. I certainly support some of the statements dealing with the Arctic. The last time I believe I read a statement about this, the direction at that time was to have three or four major military boats in the Arctic and leave it at that. This speech seems to develop on that and take it one step further, talking about development, research, et cetera, which I find a much better direction to follow.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are going to be disappointed in some of the other areas that they are looking for. With climate change of course, we have more words, but we are dealing with a government that has done absolutely nothing since it got elected. It canceled the Kyoto accord. It removed any reference to it on its web page. It joined the APEC organization, which is dead against Kyoto. It wants to use what it calls aspiration goals, which members know, I know and every Canadian knows, are totally meaningless.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech talked about the Afghan mission. I certainly agree Canada has a role and Canada has a future role in that particular part of the world. It is very important but it is my position and our party's position that the combat mission should end in February 2009. We certainly will have other roles and obligations in that particular country. It is time for other NATO countries to put their shoulders to the wheel.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, what the government has tried to do here is put it over to a group of five individuals who are told not to consult the public, have no public consultations, but come back with a report in February. In other words, to turn the channel as it has done with climate change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to use the limited time available to me today to talk about a statement in the Speech from the Throne that I believe we as parliamentarians should consider. It is very significant to this country, and that is to introduce legislation to place formal limits on the use of the federal spending power, which of course is implicit in the British North America Act. It has been recognized by our courts and of course it has been going on for years and years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada has to consult with the other 10 provinces and three territories, respect their wishes, their aspirations and their values, but at the end of the day, the Government of Canada has a responsibility for each and every Canadian for the common good. It has to have a pan-Canadian view. It has the responsibility to act on behalf of the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successive governments from various political stripes have developed programs, they have maintained programs, and they have enhanced programs under this particular ambit. Some examples are the Canada Health Act, medicare, employment insurance, old age pension, the old age supplement, the Canada pension plan, the child tax benefit, post-secondary research, the national housing program, infrastructure, and the new deal for the cities. This is just a partial list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one of them was supported by successive governments, enhanced, improved and changed, but each program required a government with a pan-Canadian view.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in a large geographical country with a relatively small population. We have to have a shared destiny. We have to have common goals because many of us in this House and many Canadians believe that Canada is stronger than its diverse parts. We have to have programs, policies and initiatives that respond to our values, our sovereignty as a nation, and as a government we have to act in the best interests of the nation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have at this juncture a toxic mix of a government that does not believe in a strong Government of Canada and another party that does not believe in Canada. This is an unholy marriage and it should concern all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians may ask where this thinking is coming from. It is not coming from Canadians I have talked to. It is not coming from members of the government. People will say that they are proud Ontarians or proud Manitobans but first they will say that they are proud Canadians. Where does this come from? The answer is that it comes from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the last time the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> was elected, he set out his vision for Canada in an open letter to the premier of Alberta. In that letter, he stated that Alberta should build a firewall around itself, that it should withdraw from the Canada pension plan, that it should collect its own personal income taxes, that it should eliminate any association whatsoever with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and that it should ignore whatever provisions there are in the Canada Health Act. In other words, it should break the law, fight the matter in the courts, pay the penalties and allow no federal involvement in health care in that province. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter concludes, “take the initiative, to build a firewall around Alberta”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I assume the letter was addressed to the premier of Alberta, but that same policy, that same line of thinking, would apply to the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, New Brunswick, et cetera.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There might be those who are watching this on TV who think I am making this up. I am not. I will post that letter, that vision of Canada, on my website later today for all Canadians to read and analyze and come to their own opinion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not my agenda for Canada. It is not the agenda of those people who sent me here to Ottawa. This is not about standing up for Canada. People are screaming that they want their country back. It is not the position of members of the government party either. This will be an interesting debate in this particular Parliament. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we even start the debate, as we discuss the role of the federal government to meet the future challenges of this great country, we should ask ourselves what John A. Macdonald would think. What would Tommy Douglas think? What would his views be on this direction? What would Lester Pearson think? That is going to be a very interesting aspect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have put my thoughts on the table on this particular issue. It is my firm belief that to succeed in the future, this country needs a strong federal government, a government that has a pan-Canadian view and a government that acts on behalf of every Canadian. I do hope we have that in the years and decades to come.</div>

I do thank my hon. colleague for his response. It is a matter of legitimate debate as to what role the provinces play and what role the federal government plays. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, and this <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> is no different, there is a strong role, and he has never strayed from that, for the central government in Ottawa. There is also a very strong role to be played in cooperation with that central government in Ottawa by the provinces in determining what is best for those provinces. There is some leeway. There is some overriding federal legislation, such as the Canada Health Act, on which all the provinces need to stay between the ditches. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely my hon. colleague would agree, or not, that the provinces should be in a position to deal with the federal government on, not necessarily an equal footing but a respectful footing, and that their aspirations that apply to their area of the country should be taken into consideration.</div>

They need to cooperate and collaborate. The point of what I am saying here is that there is a role for the federal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the whole list of plans that came forward. All it would take, if someone had the attitude that certain people in this House have right now, which is that the provincial jurisdiction cannot do it, then we would not have medicare, the Canada pension plan, employment insurance, the child tax benefit nor the old age supplement. The list goes on and on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is a role there. Both levels of government need to stop the politics and begin to cooperate, collaborate and act in the best interests of the people they represent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these programs cannot change just to suit the ideological bent of a certain provincial party that is in power in that province. Ottawa must have a strong central government that puts the interests of every Canadian first, that has a pan-Canadian view and is here for the common good.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have had the opportunity to review the contents, I am astonished, not by what is actually contained in the speech, but more so by what the speech fails to mention.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the chair of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women, I am shocked by the fact that the throne speech makes absolutely no mention of women or women's programs in spite of the fact that women constitute 52% of the population. This is astonishing given the fact that Persons Day, the day in 1929 when the British privy council office declared that women were persons under the law, fell in the same week as the Speech from the Throne.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose this apparent omission by the government is due to the fact that this past year the Conservatives made history through drastic cuts to the Status of Women, including the closure of regional offices, staff layoffs and the elimination of advocacy from the mandate of the organization.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are also surprised that the 25th anniversary of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was somehow overlooked in the throne speech as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another glaring omission is any mention of relief for the estimated one million Canadian children who live in poverty and an estimated half million impoverished seniors, many of whom are women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can assure all members and my constituents that a plan to fight poverty will be at the heart of any future Liberal agenda, as it always has been in the past.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the aboriginal Canadians where poverty is rampant in communities across the country? The Speech from the Throne does contain a decision to finally offer an apology to the victims of the residential schools program but it in no way discharges the Conservative government from its obligation to implement the Kelowna accord. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By ignoring the aboriginal people, the Conservatives are refusing to provide desperately needed measures in health, education and infrastructure as promised in the accord. Instead, the Conservatives see it far more fit to make “the serious problem of auto theft” a national priority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of crime bills, Canadians are wondering why the Conservatives are attempting to blame the opposition for holding up legislation when it was the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> who sabotaged his own agenda when he prorogued Parliament. The fact is that for more than a year now the Liberals have offered repeatedly to fast track as much as 70% of all the justice measures that the Prime Minister brought to Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, when the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> decided to prorogue Parliament and kill all five of the original justice bills, four of them had passed through the House of Commons and were awaiting approval by the Senate. In fact, those bills would have been law by now if it were not for the partisan games that we are currently witnessing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a lame attempt by the Conservatives to force an unwanted federal election on Canadians. Who pays the price as a result of this political brinkmanship? Ultimately, it is ordinary Canadians who will pay the price while the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> dithers and wastes another 18 months with no measurable results.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the economy, the throne speech mentions tax cuts but, after almost two years, the Conservatives new government has come up short on tax relief.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there has been a 1% reduction in the GST, many leading economists have warned the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> that the reduction in consumption tax does little to stimulate the economy. Nor does it allow Canadians to keep their hard-earned cash. In fact, the first budget of Canada's new government introduced a tax increase for those who earned the least in our society. Low income Canadians saw their personal tax rate increase from 15% to 15.5% in budget 2006. It is unfair to low-income Canadians to pay for a reduction of the GST when it is far more efficient to reduce income taxes at source and give Canadians a real tax break.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, the leader of the official opposition addressed the Economic Club of Toronto on the subject of how to generate more investment, improve living standards and ensure good jobs for ourselves and for our children. Part of the plan is to continue to reduce corporate income tax.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the previous Liberal government, the corporate tax rate was lowered from 28% to 19%. As a result of these tax reductions, companies have more capital to reinvest in the Canadian economy and ultimately offer high quality jobs to Canadians. Unfortunately, the Conservative government's tax record has been, to say the least, sadly lacking thus far. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A>'s first blunder was the income trust fiasco, when the Conservatives deliberately broke their promise to Canadian investors, many of them being seniors, who saw more than $25 billion in retirement savings go down the drain overnight.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new government's next blunder, which was universally denounced as the worst tax policy announcement in 35 years, was to end interest deductibility and therefore deny Canadian companies a competitive edge in the global economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Conservatives were first elected, they promised to usher in a new era of accountability and transparency into government. Indeed, the throne speech declared that Canada's new government was clean, this despite the fact that the Conservative Party is under investigation by the Ontario Provincial Police, the Commissioner of Elections and the federal Privacy Commissioner.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Privacy Commissioner has launched an inquiry into whether the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> violated the privacy of Canadians by compiling a mailing list based on the ethnic and religious background of Jewish communities and other so-called target groups.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754649"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para754652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has now been disclosed that the current Conservative government is far more secretive than any previous government. Not only are access to information requests taking longer to be released, they are far more likely to be censored and to have information withheld. Moreover, many requests have to be vetted by the Privy Council Office, the bureaucratic office of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government uses an attack approach and goes full steam ahead with everything connected to its ideology.

    </p><a name="Para754669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of addressing poverty, they have overwhelmingly told us that they need a change, a reduction in income taxes. Instead of reducing income taxes, the Conservative government increased it from 15% to 15.5%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754670"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of child care spaces, the Conservatives created no child care spaces. The $100 baby bonus gave nothing to families struggling to make ends meet. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a younger man, as a public servant in British Columbia, the premier of the day had an expression which I find has been very useful to me over time and is useful again today. He used to say, “If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech is a good example of a document with leadership provided by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the government. It shows Canadians and parliamentarians where we want to go.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the reference to the North Star, as members know, the North Star is a navigational beacon that helps navigators, who are faced with turbulent waters or confusing routes, with a variety of choices. They always come back to that North Star, that navigational beacon, to ensure they are always ultimately headed in the right direction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we think about the North Star in the context of the throne speech context, there are five points to a star. These correspond to the five priorities articulated in the throne speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will focus on the economic prosperity priority, economic management, in my comments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we look at the Canadian economy and address the issue of Canada's prosperity, and we have had a lot of it over the last 10 or 15 years, indeed over the last many decades, we have to recognize that Canada is a small trading economy. By that I mean Canada's population is about 34 million people spread over a varied and huge land mass, close to 10 million square kilometres of land, the second largest land mass, nationally speaking, in the world. We can compare that with the state of California which has 37 million in one state. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we are a country where our prosperity has been fundamentally driven by international trade. Without liberalized and open trade, Canadians would be much poorer. In fact, we would be a marginal economic society today without trade and commerce.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the global economy and what is going on in the world, the whole issue of trade, the way we trade and what drives trade and competitiveness has changed fundamentally with changes in the global economy. People talk about globalization.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his book Thomas Friedman refers to the world as being flat. It is a world where it is no longer good enough to sit back in Canada, produce here and sell abroad. We have to face the fact that in the world economy today we are dealing in an economy of global value and global supply chains. We are in an economy where anyone in any part of the world is a potential customer, supplier and competitor.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in a world today where if one wants to be competitive, one has to be prepared to import technology. Over 95% of the technologies developed in the world are not Canadian. We have to reach out to the world economy to get them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in a world where if one wants to be a competitive supplier in the global economy, one has to recognize that production, distribution, marketing, manufacturing, research may all have to be situated in different places around the world. That is not to say that Canada cannot have a very powerful economic base here. We absolutely can, but we have to recognize that we are competing in a global economy. There is nowhere to hide.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is here to stay as is India, Brazil and Russia. There are many emerging economic dynamos in the world economy and we will have step up and compete with those economies as we go forward.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155">(1155)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the throne speech refers to a global commerce strategy. The government is developing a global commerce strategy. It is a strategy that changes the way we think about international trade and investment. It is a strategy that basically looks at trade in the world as dominated by global supply chains, global value chains and networks, whatever one chooses to call them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that kind of world, the objective of a global commerce strategy has to be to ensure that Canadians and Canadian companies get as high up in those value chains as they can possibly be. Ideally, we want to be driving those supply chains on a global basis, but at a minimum, we want Canadians and Canadian companies to be high up in those chains.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That takes a different approach to trade. It is no longer good enough to go on trade missions to try to sign contracts for sales here and there. Global competitiveness in this economy requires that Canadian companies invest abroad, that we bring foreign investment into Canada and that we import, because a lot of imports are in fact critical inputs into Canadian production and ultimately into Canadian exports and wealth creation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take a very different approach to global commerce today, but the goal is to get high up in the global value chains. The question is what are the tools that we have to do this and how do we array those tools in a cohesive way, in a way that knits them together in a self-reinforcing, comprehensive and effective trade strategy? That is what we are doing with global commerce.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we are looking at the negotiated legal framework agreements that facilitate global trade for Canadian companies, such as free trade agreements and foreign investment promotion and protection agreements. We are looking at bilateral trade agreements. We are looking at multilateral trade agreements. We are looking at air bilaterals. We are looking at all of the framework policies that we have to negotiate with other countries to create a level and attractive playing field for Canadian companies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the frameworks do nothing by themselves. There has to be a globally competitive transportation and logistics system. The throne speech focuses on gateways and corridors for trade. The Asia-Pacific gateway initiative is a good example of a transportation and logistics system that is going to transform Canada's and indeed North America's ability to compete in the global economy of today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing that will do more for northern Canada, whether we are talking about the northern Prairies, the territories or the Arctic, for the creation of wealth and prosperity than the Asia-Pacific gateway initiative, particularly the port of Prince Rupert and the whole transportation and logistics corridor through Prince Rupert, across Canada and up into Canada's north.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third piece of our strategy is to provide direct services and resources. Whether it is Export Development Canada, the Canadian Commercial Corporation or our trade and consular service, we are increasing the tools that we have to directly support Canadian companies that are engaged in international commerce. We are expanding our presence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the regional focus of our global commerce strategy, we begin with the North American platform, as we call it. The North American platform basically refers to NAFTA. The North American economy is an economy of 400 million people. That is a huge market. It is one of the most dynamic, technologically rich economies in the world. It has enormous sources of capital. It is an opportunity for Canadian companies to participate in a major economy which is broader and deeper than Canada's and to build our competitive strength on the basis of the North American platform.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have given top priority to ensuring that the North American platform is strengthened. Whether it is a security prosperity initiative, improvements under NAFTA, or a variety of other initiatives relating to improving the flow of goods and services and people within North America, the platform is critical.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1200"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1200"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1200">(1200)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going from the North American platform, we are giving top priority to the Americas. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has given top priority to the Americas. We are negotiating free trade agreements with a number of countries in the Americas. Then when we look across the Pacific, we are doing an enormous amount of work to develop trade agreements, investment agreements, technology cooperation agreements with countries in the Asia Pacific region. We are doing the same on the Atlantic side. We have just signed an agreement with the EFTA countries and we are intensifying our work with the European Union.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, we do believe very strongly that we have to do better than governments have done in the past to take advantage of our human resource assets which are multicultural in nature. Second, the government has put in place and will continue to implement an agency to assist with the recognition of foreign credentials. Many of our ethnic communities are highly trained and could contribute very substantially economically, but they have not had their credentials recognized. This government is committed to doing that both with resources and the way we organize--</div>

    </p><a name="Para754716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little over a year and a half ago Canadians made a choice. It was a choice to end the reign of a tired, scandal plagued and directionless Liberal government. Canadians seized the opportunity to elect a government with clear goals, focused determination and a willingness to make tough but very necessary decisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is achieving real results. Our government is being accountable to the people. We are putting the needs of individuals, families, workers and seniors first.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians elected a Conservative government with a bold new vision for Canada, a government that is continually aspiring to further growth and greater prosperity for the benefit of all Canadians. At the centre of this vision is our long term economic plan called Advantage Canada. It is a plan to give Canada and Canadians the key advantages to be able to compete effectively and attract new growth and investment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advantage Canada focuses on creating five key advantages: a tax advantage, reducing taxes for all Canadians and establishing the lowest tax rate on new business investment in the G-7; a fiscal advantage, eliminating Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation; an infrastructure advantage, building modern, world-class infrastructure that promotes economic growth, a clean environment and international competitiveness; a knowledge advantage, creating the best educated, most skilled and most flexible workforce in the world; and an entrepreneurial advantage, reducing unnecessary regulation and red tape, and increasing competition in the Canadian marketplace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an ambitious, forward thinking plan. It is, as Thomas d'Aquino of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives remarked, a strategy that will “enable Canadians to take on the world and win”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage Canada was laid out before the Canadian people last fall. Since then we have not let this plan collect dust on a shelf. Canadians elected a government that would act and not deliberate ad nauseam. We have begun taking concrete action to create the advantages to build a strong economy for today and for tomorrow. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past 20 months, we have been creating an environment for further investment by reducing taxes significantly for individuals, families and business. It is a total of $41 billion in reduction of taxes over three years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are paying down the national mortgage by an amount equivalent to $1,142 for each man, woman and child in Canada. In fact, in September the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> announced an additional debt payment of $14.2 billion for 2006-07. This moves the federal debt to GDP ratio to its lowest level in a quarter century. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dedicating all of the interest savings from the shrinking federal debt to further reduce personal income taxes as part of our tax back guarantee. To date, we have provided Canadians with over $1.5 billion in annual personal income tax relief.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are limiting the growth on spending. We are balancing the books and improving our environment with a plan that is not only responsible but is achievable. After years of debate we have also restored fiscal balance in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While advantage Canada is the road map guiding our way, the Speech from the Throne gets us closer to our destination. The Speech from the Throne outlined five core priorities for this session: strengthening Canada's sovereignty and place in the world; strengthening the federation and our democratic institutions; providing effective economic leadership for a prosperous future; tackling crime and strengthening the security of Canadians; and improving the environment and health for all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These priorities do not respond to the needs of politicians and bureaucrats in Ottawa. These priorities were not imagined through a top-down, paternalistic approach. Those of course are the hallmarks of a Liberal government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to and acting on the needs of everyday Canadians, these are the hallmarks of a Conservative government. We are putting Canadians and their families first. We are building a proud legacy of tax relief by committing to broad base tax reductions for all Canadians. We are giving all Canadians real choice in child care through the universal child care benefit. We are working to ensure Canadians get the medical care they need faster. We are making historic investments in infrastructure and post-secondary education. We are creating safer neighbourhoods through tough new legislation on crime. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all issues that matter to everyday Canadians and we are taking real action to tackle these issues. That is what Canadians want: a government that responds to their needs and gets the job done. This government understands that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition, especially the Liberal Party of Canada, does not understand that. In government, the last Liberal leader, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, was routinely derided for his lack of direction. In opposition, the current Liberal leader, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78331,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78331&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Laurent—Cartierville</A>, has carried on this legacy, waffling on issue to issue to such a degree that even some of his Liberal colleagues have openly criticized him. I raise this not simply as partisan rhetoric, but to contrast our decisive leadership with that of the Liberals. We do not waffle and dither. We get the job done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are getting the job done on cutting taxes, but taxes in Canada are still too high. That is why, as I mentioned earlier, the Speech from the Throne made a commitment of further broad based tax relief for individuals, businesses, and families. This, in addition to a further cut in the GST, is something that constituents in my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78389,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78389&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Simcoe—Grey</A> cannot praise enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further tax cuts will help make a strong Canadian economy even stronger. Indeed, since we took office, over half a million new jobs have been created. Even better news is that not only is the economy is creating a lot of jobs, but it is creating good, high paying jobs as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoting from a July 2007 CIBC World Markets report, I note, “The good news is that the Canadian economy created almost 200,000 new jobs in the first 6 months of 2007”. In even better news, the quality of those jobs is on the rise and, states the report, “the combination of rising employment and improving quality is a sure recipe for rising personal income”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754734"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of such employment numbers should not be minimized. As Eleni Bakopanos, former Liberal MP and now new chief adviser to the present Liberal leader, once noted in this very House, “The best economic and social program is job creation”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe in the value of work, but we acknowledge that some people need support to succeed in the labour market. For many low income Canadians, taking a job can mean being financially worse off. Some individuals who receive social assistance benefits often lose in-kind benefits such as subsidized housing if they get a job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having had eight and a half years at the provincial level working as a political staffer and having spent a great deal of time in constituency work, I can relate and I can recall this as an issue. Of course our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> also worked provincially, and I am so pleased to see that this is why he has addressed this issue. That is why we are implementing the working income tax benefit. This new benefit will make working more profitable for low income Canadians, helping them over the so-called welfare wall.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also acted to support low income Canadians on other fronts. We have provided $1.4 billion in funding to increase the affordable housing supply. We launched the nearly $270 million homelessness partnering strategy to help homeless and at-risk individuals build a better future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians made a choice a year and a half ago. They chose a government with goals and a vision responding to their needs. We have delivered results. We have put the needs of everyday families first. To quote a recent <i>Macleans</i> editorial, “It's been a long time since we've had a prime minister so closely attuned to the interests and priorities of the Canadian main street”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet there is still work to be done, with opportunities and challenges ahead, but Canadians can rest assured that this Conservative government will provide the leadership needed to ensure a strong and secure economic future for Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the minister's capacity with respect to Canadians abroad, I wonder if she would undertake to apprise this House of the latest developments with respect to Brenda Martin, a Canadian who has been incarcerated for some time in Mexico.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out from the minister if she will undertake to this House to ensure that our consular officials are attending to Ms. Martin's situation. We had every expectation that she might be released within the next few weeks, but it turns out that this case has been put back again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the minister will probably respond by saying that we do not get involved in judicial matters within another country, I am looking to ensure that from a consular perspective--I will not bore the minister with all the details because I think she knows them--she will undertake to apprise herself of the latest developments with respect to Ms. Martin's case, and I hope there will be absolutely no misunderstanding with Mexican authorities as to how important this case is for Canadians and, I trust, for her office.</div>

I would urge her to look at the blues with respect to what I did say. While we cannot get involved in the judicial matters of another country, we do have a consular perspective, and I do understand that the minister may have mistaken what I said.</div>

Yesterday the UN special rapporteur on adequate housing talked about Canada's track record on housing and homelessness. He talked about how shocking it was in a country as prosperous as ours to see housing and homelessness in a state of crisis. His report talked about a number of factors, but there were two specific things I would like the member to address.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he said that he was “disturbed to see the devastating impact of the paternalism that marks federal and provincial government legislation, policies and budgetary allocations for aboriginal people on and off reserve”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, he talked about the fact of the lack of funding to non-government organizations that advocate on behalf of first nations, women and other minority groups for adequate housing. These organizations are seriously underfunded in Canada. He said that it undermines our democratic process when we do not have NGOs that can actually advocate in a democratic way for people who are perhaps facing homelessness and the housing crisis. I wonder if the member could address those two questions.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really important here is that we can have a debate in the House and talk about how we can improve situations, but I think it would be nice just every once in a while if the opposition were able to recognize some of the support the federal government does give to low income Canadians. I happen to have a list of that support with me and I would not mind going over it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 proposed significant benefits for low income Canadians. It included $550 million annually through the working income tax benefit to make work more rewarding for more than 1.2 million individual Canadians. There was also a working families tax plan that will remove 230,000 low income taxpayers from the tax rolls. That is a substantial number. I have just one more, which is the introduction of a new registered disability savings plan program to improve the financial security and the well-being of children with severe disabilities. This is just part of what we are doing.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really was looking forward to the government's throne speech. The government said when it prorogued the House that it would chart a new course for this country. I expected it to live up to those words. The government prorogued this House. That is a very serious act. That turned back the clock on many bills and motions that had been worked on for months by the members of this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that since the government took this step, it would truly have a new direction, a new course, but I was disappointed. Once again the Conservative government looked in the rear-view mirror. It missed an opportunity. It is taking Canada in the wrong direction, the wrong direction on climate change and the wrong direction for seniors, for children, for first nations and for ordinary Canadian families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest disappointment was the government's complete and utter failure to address climate change. Last spring, my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79026,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79026&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Skeena—Bulkley Valley</A>, worked hard in an all party committee to improve Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A>, the clean air and climate change act, so that Canada could begin to move in the right direction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All parties agreed that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2397040,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2397040&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-30</A> was going to be a good start, but the government is not even bringing it back. In fact, it is bringing back only a small portion of it even though the majority of the House agreed on the changes to Bill C-30. What arrogance. What contempt for this House the government has. Once again it has broken the trust of ordinary Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I and many others from my riding and across the country are disappointed in the government's stance on the environment because we are running out of time. Ordinary Canadians are doing their part. They are changing their light bulbs. They are conserving water. They are converting to hybrid cars. However, no matter how many of us change our light bulbs, if the government does not change course all our efforts will be futile.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government could have made a big difference if it had implemented hard caps on large carbon emitters. That would go a long way to meeting our emission targets. It decided to go with intensity based measures instead. With the expansion of the oil sands looming on the horizon, intensity targets will do nothing to reduce Canada's emissions. When we produce more oil from the oil sands, we also will be producing more greenhouse gases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another opportunity was missed by the government when it came to addressing the needs of seniors. My colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78613,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78613&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hamilton Mountain</A>, introduced the seniors charter last year. It was debated and passed by the House, but the government has never enacted it. The government had an opportunity in this throne speech to implement the priorities of the charter, including primary care, long term care, home care and free pharmacare and dental care. These things would all enhance the quality of life for seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, once again the government has let seniors and all Canadians down. It is another broken promise. The governmentt said it would act on what was passed by the majority of this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to hope and fairness for ordinary Canadians, the government has done nothing on the issue of affordable housing and homelessness. We have just seen $14 billion in federal surplus. The government has announced that this year's surplus will be twice what it had anticipated. Quelle surprise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all that extra money in the coffers and with all the need for housing in my communities, and in fact with nearly two million Canadians across this country who do not have what is deemed to be acceptable housing, why did the government not make it a priority to invest in a national housing strategy?</div>
    </p><a name="Para754766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been to many first nations communities in my riding. The housing situation there is even worse. For example, in Port Hardy, the Gwa'Sala-Nakwaxda'xw are in dire need of acceptable shelter. They live in mouldy homes. Sometimes as many as 25 people are living in one house and three families live together in a home built for single family occupation. These are deplorable conditions and they need to be addressed immediately.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225">(1225)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for child care. I have been talking with parents and child care workers in my riding from Port McNeill to Courtenay, and they are telling me that there is a crisis. Failure on the part of the government to address the crisis has resulted in longer wait times for child care space and increasing costs. There is up to a two years wait for a space. That means we have to register our child before it is even born.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child care centres need reliable, long term funding to provide the kind of access that parents and their children are looking for. That is why the NDP proposed the child care act that will soon be voted on at third reading. That is the kind of solution today's families are looking for, real commitments to child care in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address two things that are crucial to <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78991,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78991&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Island North</A>, two things the government mentioned in its throne speech that it would protect. It said it would stand up for forestry and fishing, but on these two files, the government has a very bad track record. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives sold out forestry communities and forestry workers in my riding and across this country when they signed the sellout softwood agreement. Because of that agreement, it is not profitable for companies to mill logs in Canada, so they ship raw logs to the U.S. or abroad and we get to buy them back as finished lumber. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irony is not lost on the constituents of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78991,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78991&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vancouver Island North</A>. Our communities are surrounded by forests, yet lumber mills are closing from B.C. to Atlantic Canada as more and more raw logs and jobs leave this country. Pulp and paper mills and fibre mills are having a hard time getting fibre because there are very few sawmills left to provide it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I introduced Motion No. 301 to curtail raw log exports and to encourage value added and manufacturing right here in Canada. The natural resources minister said he recognized that something needed to be done about the situation that is killing our resource based communities, but again, the government has failed to act. I do not call that standing up for an industry, for workers or for our communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that I would like to mention is that the Conservatives said they would stand up for the fishing industry, but again, they are going in the wrong direction. Last spring, they introduced Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2590531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2590531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-45</A>, a new fisheries act, without consultation with fishermen, first nations or anyone from our communities. That bill has gone now because of prorogation, but why did they bring it forward in the first place? No one wanted it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also said that they would decentralize the DFO and have more decision making on the coasts of this country. After almost two years there has been no movement on this promise. Instead, I have to ask the government if they are trying to kill our west coast fisheries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few weeks ago an order came down from on high to cut the Chinook egg take for the entire west coast. When asked why, the Conservatives said it was due to a lack of funds, but I remember last year when I asked the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</A> about a budget cut, I was told that it had not been cut, so there should have been lots of money there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, the decision to cut this egg take and to kill the Chinook fishery was turned around, but a decision like that should never have been made in the first place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, a recent barge spill in my riding in Robson Bight is causing grave concerns because the fuel tank and vehicles are on the bottom of the ocean continuing to leak oil and diesel to the surface. Environmental groups, local businesses, students and concerned people from around the world donated money to carry out an investigation. We called on the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</A> to also carry out an investigation, but the ministry waited a full two months and finally, after the environmental organizations announced that they would do carry out an investigation, the government was embarrassed and had to come forward and say it would do one too. It finally did the right thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These oil spills are having a devastating effect on the waters and on the salmon in the Strait of Georgia. Salmon are the canary in the coal mines of our oceans. They feed whales and people, and are a source of cultural and ceremonial significance to first nations of B.C. The health of salmon is important to the west coast and we are in danger of losing them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754779"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancement must be increased. Monitoring of sport and commercial fishing must be increased if we are to have a clear picture of what is going on off our coast.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address a number of things, but I recognize that my time is limited so I will go back to what she said on the environment. She said regular Canadians are cleaning up, they are changing their light bulbs, changing cars that they are driving and they are taking transit. Is that not exactly what the government has been encouraging? Is she not missing the point? Did the government not take the initiative to encourage a change from incandescent bulbs to the new energy efficient bulbs?</div>
    </p><a name="Para754784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke to the Vancouver Transit Authority. Its transit pass sales were up 40% after the measures that the government took to encourage people to buy transit passes. The member misses the point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ecotrust transfers to the provinces. In my own home province of Ontario we are going to start piping in clean hydro electric power to replace coal-fired energy. These are massive advances on the environment. It is a shame the member misses the point and does not see it. I would like to know if she would acknowledge these advances on the environment.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that ordinary Canadians are doing their part. They are trying really hard because they understand how critical it is to save the environment and they are looking for leadership from their government and they are not finding it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ecoenergy program that the government put forward is a disaster. People are writing to me to tell me they have tried to get funding but that they cannot get it, so many things are not covered, things that would actually work such as solar panels. It is one thing that is not covered.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to take action on large final emitters. We can do everything such as change light bulbs, cars and all kinds of things, but if the government does not introduce hard caps on large emitters, it is all for not. It will not make any difference.</div>

As we all know, the Bloc Québécois has long criticized the government's inaction in this file. We were calling for, among other things, loan guarantees to allow businesses to get by until we could resolve all the problems with the Americans, using every available legal recourse against the United States. The government refused to act and, in the end, concluded this terrible agreement, which is a sellout.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the companies were in such a difficult situation that everyone in Quebec was asking their member to support the agreement. When I say everyone, I mean employers, employees, unions and the entire industry. Naturally, since the Bloc Québécois represents Quebeckers, we supported the agreement. The NDP did not support it, which I can understand, given that, at the time, that party had no elected members in Quebec and does not claim to represent Quebeckers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to know the following. Now that the NDP has a member in Quebec, the next time such a situation arises, when the party must choose between defending the interests of people outside Quebec or the interests of Quebeckers, what will it do? Will it continue to turn a deaf ear to the people of Quebec? Or will it change its stance? For instance, is the party going to allow its member in Quebec to vote in favour of something that is unanimously called for in Quebec, even if it goes against the official party line?</div>

It is a privilege for me to rise in the House today to reply to the Conservative government's throne speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to re-emphasize that our caucus, unlike others, is united in our belief that the throne speech shows clearly that the Conservative government is planning on taking Canada further in the wrong direction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am part of a party that knows what it believes and unlike some other members of the House, we will not be afraid to stand up for the principles we share with hard-working Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak a little later about some of the specifics of the speech, but I want for a moment to reflect on what is not in the throne speech. What is not in the speech is almost as telling about the Conservative vision for Canada as what is in it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though one of the Conservatives' key promises in the last election was for health care and reducing wait times the throne speech makes no mention of improving wait times. In fact, the throne speech does not even mention the words “health care” or “medicare”, not even once. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech also does not speak about education or training. The words “university students” and “post-secondary education” never even appear in the throne speech. In fact, the only reference to education in universities and colleges at all is to say that families are worrying about the escalating cost.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, if one is a student or a parent looking to save for post-secondary education, one cannot depend on the Conservatives to deliver. It is not part of their vision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development workers we are asked to honour by voting in favour of a mission in Afghanistan that we know a majority of Canadians do not support. Other workers mentioned are those in Canada's traditional industries, like manufacturing industries and steel. Steel is still a major employer and economic driver in my community. I guess apparently these industries can rest easy. At least they are mentioned in the Conservative vision for Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How workers in these industries who are supposed to be comforted by the fact that for nearly two years in power absolutely nothing concrete has been done to plan for the future of these industries is actually beyond me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least manufacturing workers are in the vision for the future. No other workers are mentioned. The entire topic of jobs alone is mentioned only once in the entire throne speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan gets six mentions, the military three, the same for the Canadian Forces, but jobs and the Conservative vision of this country is worth only one single mention.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech also does not speak about inclusion or multiculturalism. Those words are not in the speech because of a lack of vision that the Conservatives have in these particular area. The only time women are even mentioned in the throne speech is in the context of men and women in uniform.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on but during this last week Canadians are beginning to express the concerns the NDP have expressed for months in the House and in communities across the country. They are beginning to say as we have that the government must change direction. Canadians see Canada at war. Canadians see our climate in crisis and that middle class families are falling further and further behind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the time for the federal government to show leadership. This was the time for the Conservative government to show all Canadians that its vision includes their needs, their hopes and their desires for a better future. Sadly in the eyes of many it did not do it. The Conservative government has proven once again that it simply cannot get the job done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our NDP members listened very carefully to the throne speech and the subsequent debate, and we were somewhat surprised to hear that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> is now open to the NDP proposal of long standing that the Senate should be abolished. That is a long ways from the man who put an unelected Senator in charge of signing cheques for our people's money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promised apology in the Speech from the Throne to Canada's first nations for the terrible injustices and abuses in the residential school system is possibly the only bright spot. An actual apology might have been better. It is unclear why Canada's aboriginal peoples have to wait even one moment longer, but that promise is one that I guarantee my colleagues and myself will hold the government to.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the prolonged summer break I met with many of the hard working folks in the riding of Hamilton East—Stoney Creek. As an aside I would like to mention and acknowledge the excellent provincial campaign of the NDP's Paul Miller in my riding. The people of Hamilton East--Stoney Creek have chosen the NDP to represent them in Ottawa and now in Queen's Park. I know they have chosen an excellent representative. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240">(1240)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the extended summer break, I heard countless stories from hard-working folks who are having real trouble making ends meet. Today, when tremendous wealth is being created in our country, in fact more wealth than at any other time in history, these families have told me that they now need to work longer just to make ends meet. Something is clearly wrong with this picture and Canadians know it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP has been warning about the growing prosperity gap and how it is putting working families and the middle class further and further behind. Now we have the shame of more than two million seniors living in poverty across this country, the same folks who helped establish the fundamentals that gave us the wealth that we have today. At the same as our seniors are facing financial and personal crises, a few people at the top are enjoying the benefits of the current economy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fine example of the growing gap happened in my community. When Stelco came out of CCAA protection and was sold, while former shareholders and retirees dangled in the wind, one of Stelco's top company executives pocketed over $60 million. People also told me that they were expecting action from the government to help their families make ends meet, to make the necessities of life more affordable and to ensure them greater financial security. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the throne speech, the Conservative government could have chosen to reduce the prosperity gap between the rich and the workers of Canada, but no. Instead, it chose to do nothing on that front.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of workers from my riding, on the weekend I was told of their disappointment in the throne speech because it showed them how much the government fails to understand their plight or, worse, that it does not care. Canadians know that what is needed now is real leadership in these key sectors of the economy. What they also now know is that the Conservative agenda announced in the throne speech has failed them once again. A quick mention of the sector fails to give hope to the families and communities that are suffering massive job losses across this country resulting from the government's devastating policy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech also fails to provide leadership for families when it comes to health care. Still today, across Canada millions of families cannot find a doctor, wait times are still too high and the cost of prescription drugs continues to skyrocket. By ignoring these fundamental issues, the Conservative agenda, as it was laid out in the throne speech, has turned its back on improving health care for today's families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say here today that despite the Conservative indifference through all of this, the NDP caucus will redouble its efforts to campaign for universal drug coverage. Whether it does so in the House or on the streets, no matter. The hard-working families of this country must get the drugs they deserve based on their doctors' advice and not on their ability to pay.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this summer, I was in Montreal in Outremont and I observed one very important thing that voters in Quebec have in common with voters all across Canada. They are terribly concerned with climate change. If we listen, working Canadians everywhere are very concerned about the future climate changes being predicted by scientists from around the world. They are now beginning to recognize that the current government has and the preceding government failed to get Canada on the right track for tackling climate change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebeckers and all Canadians know that under the Liberals greenhouse gases increased by 23% beyond Kyoto objectives. Canadians are asking questions, such as how the Liberals, when the current leader was minister of the environment, could have allowed greenhouse gases to increase to levels even greater than the Bush administration. Canadians know we are facing an uncertain future and an unprecedented global crisis and they are, rightly, asking why the Conservative government continues to use Liberal failures as an excuse for inaction on this file.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond those questions, Canadians are demanding real, concrete action now. They know that the watered down clean air and climate change act is not the path to follow if Canada is to truly respond to this crisis. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding, I have heard folks talk regularly about the growing concerns with regard to the combat mission in Afghanistan and that it is not the right mission for Canadians. People were very clear. While they support our troops in every sense of the word, they told me that this was not the role they wanted to see their country play on the world stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only the NDP that has always been clear and consistent on this issue. It is the wrong mission for Canada. We are not a afraid of the consequences of our actions because we firmly believe in our principles. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we will oppose the Speech from the Throne. Unlike the leader of the Liberal Party, we will not pretend and we will not criticize only to sit back later and hide behind excuses. We will not shirk our responsibilities.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is not what I want to talk to the hon. member about. He quoted some items on poverty.

    </p><a name="Para754828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its May income report, Statistics Canada revealed that Canadians at every level benefited from the positive economic conditions that have prevailed since the early 1990s. Before taxes, the richest 20% in the country make 13 times as much before taxes in income redistribution as the bottom 20%. However, after taxes and transfers, that gap is 5.6 times, which can be significant to the folks in the bottom 20%. I would point out to my hon. friend that in 1996 the gap was 5.6 times. It has not changed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the member to stand there and say that poverty is accelerating off the clock is absolutely untrue.

That is just like the NDP. I agree with him, except that the way he describes it, we would have a universal drug plan imposed and run by Ottawa. In Quebec, we already have drug coverage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he went to Outremont and that Quebeckers have things in common with Canadians when it comes to the environment. I agree. However, having a centralist party like the NDP in power would mean the imposition of Canada-wide standards, when we are fighting to get recognition for the efforts made by Quebec's industries to achieve the Kyoto protocol targets. But the NDP would like to impose Canada-wide standards.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the same question for him that my colleague had for his predecessor: with respect to the Bloc's amendment to reduce and even eliminate the federal spending power in provincial jurisdictions, namely that of Quebec—for which there is a consensus in Quebec—why did he vote against the Bloc amendment, against our desire to stop the federal government from interfering in the jurisdictions of Quebec and the provinces? </div>
    </p><a name="Para754835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like an answer. I do not want him to be evasive and skirt around my question, as his colleague did. I would like him to respond directly to the question.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to speak in response to the Speech from the Throne in this second session of the 39th Parliament. However, much like the original first session throne speech, there is a lot of rhetoric but little substance. Even worse, the new government has completely failed to live up to its billing in its first throne speech. I need to mention a couple of those points.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons that I believe I need to mention that is because we really need to see specific legislation because the words of the government mean little other than to try to manipulate the public minds, in which it tries to leave the impression it will do something and does not do it. I will give a couple of examples.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754843"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its highly publicized and propagandized Federal Accountability Act, the public appointments commission never came into being and yet Conservative political patronage just about flows like molten lava, frothing against what seems to be a brow-beaten federal bureaucracy and the appointments go through. I cannot understand how many of those appointments that are going through are strictly political patronage appointments coming out of former premiers' offices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On accountability itself, the new government finds itself under three investigations and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> fails to answer questions on those matters. Question period is dominated by the Conservative in and out scheme, in which the Conservative Party padded its last campaigns to the benefit of its national election spending. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, there is evidence of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> for the new government saying and doing two very different things. Nowhere is this more evident than the government's response to primary producers, the farmers of this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754846"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the new government's greatest failures is in agriculture. I want to spent a little time on that subject as agriculture critic for the official opposition.</div>

He even promised cash before spring. That cash never did come through. Did farmers see cost of production? Is a $720 cheque on a $60,000 loss meeting cost of production? No, I certainly think not.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the bottom line is that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> cannot be trusted, especially when it comes to the farm community. He cannot be trusted on accountability. The evidence is in. He cannot be trusted on his word to farmers because he failed to meet cost of production.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech absolutely fails to address the agricultural concerns of our country. The government has failed to follow through on its commitment to farmers in the last election. The throne speech has failed to demonstrate any concern for the plight of beef and hog producers facing historic low prices. It has failed to address the unfair trade practices used by our competitors internationally. It has failed to bring in more aggressive safety net programming to deal with low farm incomes and high debt. It has failed to propose implementation of an all party agriculture committee recommendation to deal with the farm crisis. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all party committee made 36 recommendations, any number of which the Government of Canada could have picked up. For example, it could have ensured that a product in a box was a product of Canada. The government failed to pick up that recommendation. It could have ensured that imported food met the same standards as those that Canadian farmers have to meet. It failed on that one and failed to pick up on 34 others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Conservatives really wanted to go a little further out on a limb, they could have gone back to a report that I drafted in 2005 called “Empowering Canadian Farmers in the Marketplace”. They could have picked up on any number of recommendations in my report, such as strengthening the Competition Act so farmers had some protection or policies to help farmers receive decent prices from the marketplace. Again, they failed in that regard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me mention where the government has tried again to manipulate the public mind through the throne speech. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech claims support for supply management. However, with the government's targeted attack on the orderly marketing of the Canadian Wheat Board, which appears in the very same paragraph, it is demonstrating complete hypocrisy and an absolute contradiction of its stated support. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions speak louder than words. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> stated “he will enact market choice” for western grain farmers. This completely undermines collective marketing through either the Canadian Wheat Board or supply management. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754858"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be clear. The alleged support for supply management in the throne speech is an absolute and complete fraud, nothing less, nothing more. We just need to look at the paragraph. If there is choice in one marketing system, it has to be allowed in the other. It will undermine collective marketing, which empowers farmers in Canada to receive decent returns in the marketplace. Obviously that point is in the throne speech for consideration only.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come back for a moment to hogs. The hog industry is in terrible trouble. Let me quote a letter from a person in my riding:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In P.E.I. alone, in the last several months producers accounted for some 2,500 sows that went out of business. That is the equivalent of 80,000 hogs. This industry is in trouble, yet there is not a word in the speech about the hog industry and hog production. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a word about beef either in the Speech from the Throne. Beef producers find themselves in the situation where they are receiving around $900 when they were receiving $1,400.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would love to get into the government's failure in terms of coming up with a safety net, but let me conclude this way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech sets out the government's vision for the near term future of our country. There are only 60 words in the speech that are devoted to the government's vision for an industry that provides the food we eat each and every day. Only 60 words have been given to the industry that provides jobs and sustains communities. The Conservatives spend more time attacking a marketing institution than talking about a vision that would put income and returns in the pocket of farmers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech is absolutely unacceptable. The government is an abject failure in terms of what it is doing, or not doing, for the farm community.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard enough about the Wheat Board. Sixty-three per cent of farmers said that they wanted a choice and the Liberal Party said they should not have one. Those farmers will render their decision on the Liberal Party at some point in the not too distant future.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government will take no lessons from the former government on agriculture because it decimated agriculture in our country. This government is providing some of the best times for agriculture that our country has seen in decades. I am proud of it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the government took $246 million out of the pockets of farmers on the family farm options program.

    </p><a name="Para754889"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the Speech from the Throne and to voice some of my concerns with it, concerns on behalf of my constituents in the riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78591,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78591&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Brant</A>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with the manufacturing sector. Although it was mentioned, albeit briefly, along with the forestry, fisheries and tourism sectors, I was troubled by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s failure to mention any specifics regarding a plan to support Canada's ever important manufacturing sector. As manufacturing jobs are being lost in Ontario and elsewhere across Canada, the Conservative government is doing virtually nothing to stop this very significant job loss crisis. I am fearful that the government does not fully comprehend the consequences of its inaction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs since 2002 and real output in manufacturing is declining, not just employment. For instance, value added GDP is below its year 2000 peak. Some argue that manufacturing is simply becoming more efficient and that is why it is shedding jobs. In reality the entire sector is shrinking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a country, Canada is especially sensitive to exchange rate concerns since fully 90% of our exports go to the United States. We are thus much more vulnerable than Europe, Japan, China and India to changes in the international value of the U.S. dollar. With our dollar now at par with the U.S. dollar, the government must come to understand that reliance on a weak Canadian dollar is not a strategy. It is certainly not an effective strategy with respect to preserving Canada's manufacturing sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A manufacturing sector under pressure clearly affects the 2.1 million Canadians who work in the sector as well as their families. Job loss in this critical sector affects the millions more jobs that depend on manufacturing as the engine of our economy, especially in Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754894"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para754895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premier McGuinty's Liberals put together a $500 million package that attracted over $7 billion worth of new investment in the auto sector. The Ontario government also improved the tax credit available to businesses, which take on the important task of training of future skilled workers. This incentive is designed to reduce training costs in an effort to get more young people into skilled trade apprenticeship programs. Education sources confirm that students are lining up to enter the skilled trades, but have been unable to secure training positions for the essential hands-on portion of their programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly the Ontario government is helping out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How should the federal government? For starters, the federal government could adopt the 22 recommendations made by the House of Commons industry committee, including the key recommendation of a five year window for writing off capital investments at an accelerated rate. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310">(1310)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of that window obviously is to encourage investment in the equipment needed to regain and enhance Canada's competitiveness. Instead, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> has reduced that window to just two years, not enough time for businesses to properly plan and three years less than the all-party committee itself recommended.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Canada's manufacturing sector clearly struggles, the booming oil sands industry continues to enjoy a much more generous accelerated capital cost allowance, an advantage which will continue at least for the oil sands until 2015.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many business leaders have justifiably called for an extension of the accelerated capital cost allowance for the manufacturing and processing industries. This is especially true with the Canadian dollar at par. It has never been more affordable for Canadian businesses to invest in new machinery and equipment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada needs to create more investment, to create rising living standards, to create the jobs of tomorrow in the Canada of today, to create a competitive tax system, to create a true Canadian corporate advantage. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also bothered to hear virtually nothing in the Speech from the Throne about poverty. We need a plan to fight poverty. Poverty today for many Canadians is a reality, a reality that mocks the prosperity known by most Canadians. Today in Canada more than half a million of our senior citizens live in poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men and women who built this country deserve much better. Pension splitting I concede is of some assistance for seniors with partners, but what about those seniors without partners? What about the hundreds of thousands of single seniors? There is no mention whatsoever in the throne speech of anything that will help single seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the disabled? It is to Canada's shame that over 50% of disabled individuals cannot find employment. These are individuals who through no fault of their own were born visually impaired, born hard of hearing, born physically disabled. Surely in arguably the fairest, freest, finest country on earth everyone without exception deserves a chance, deserves an opportunity, deserves the affirmation and the self-esteem which accompanies a job, which accompanies a place in the workforce.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Canadians who do not face physical challenges, the unemployment rate is around 6% or 7%. For Canadians with disabilities, the unemployment rate is in excess of 50%. This is shameful. There is no mention in the throne speech about incentives for corporations or businesses to hire individuals with disabilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> for a provision with respect to severely disabled children, but those are the children. What about disabled adults in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s who want to work but have no opportunities presented to them? I think it is time with a $14 billion surplus that this country come to the aid of those individuals who have disabilities.</div>

These seniors are having difficulty finding affordable home care, finding high quality services so they can stay in their homes. Some of them have difficulty in paying nursing homes that have decent nursing care.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talked about the importance of narrowing the prosperity gap, the gap between those who are rich and those who are having difficulty making ends meet. However, I noticed the Liberals' record while they were in government that there was a huge tax cut of $100 billion which started in 2000. Each year since then, until 2006, there is almost $50 billion to $54 billion in tax cuts. This means that Canada has fewer financial resources to invest in seniors to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. The prosperity gap continues to grow.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would the member justify that kind of huge corporate tax cut? I recently heard the Liberal leader saying that it is the direction in which he would like to take Canada.</div>

    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para754920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Speech from the Throne made clear, the Government of Canada will continue to build a better Canada by focusing on five clear priorities: first, strengthening Canada's sovereignty and place in the world; second, building a stronger federation; third, providing effective economic leadership; fourth, continuing to tackle crime; and finally, improving our environment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government will continue to provide Canadians with the economic leadership they want and deserve. That leadership has delivered practical and positive results. Today, after 21 months of Conservative government, our economy is strong and our finances are healthy. We have the right long term economic plan for Canada, called Advantage Canada, a plan that will give us the means to deliver on all of our commitments set out in the Speech from the Throne.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 21 months, by any measure our economic and fiscal fundamentals are the strongest they have been in a generation. Canadians are enjoying the second longest period of economic expansion in Canadian history. Canada's unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 33 years and the share of adult Canadians participating in the workforce is at a record high. In fact, since our government took office, employment has increased by more than 590,000 jobs, with employment up in every province in Canada. Indeed, Canada is one of the few countries with a public pension system that is financially sustainable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past weekend, I met with my G-7 finance minister counterparts in Washington. While we have much in common, Canada stands alone in one key respect. We are the only G-7 country with budget surpluses and a falling debt burden. That is something of which all Canadians can be proud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons why our country is doing so well: strong consumer demand and employment growth; record high commodity prices; near record corporate profits, which have boosted investment; low stable inflation; and a shrinking tax burden. I will have more to say about the state of the Canadian economy shortly when I release the fall economic and fiscal update.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to our strong economic and fiscal fundamentals, we have what it takes to deal with any existing or new challenges to the nation's future prosperity. One such challenge is the potential for weaker growth in the United States and overseas as the United States housing market continues to contract and recent turbulence in global financial markets continues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another challenge, of course, is the rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. currency. On the one hand, our stronger dollar should lower costs for imported machinery and equipment for businesses, and it should also reduce prices for consumer goods. On the other hand, we recognize it has been a real challenge for the manufacturing, forestry and other exporting sectors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Canada is on the verge of a demographic change with the rapid aging of our population. This issue will affect all levels of government as the share of the working age population begins to decline.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While challenges are out there, they are not insurmountable. Private sector forecasters expect continued economic growth over the next two years. What does that mean for the government's finances? It means government revenues should remain strong and government finances healthy. It means we can continue to eliminate debt, reduce taxes and invest in the priorities of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in an exciting, changing, challenging world, a world where people, jobs and investment move more rapidly across the globe than ever before. It is a world Canada is more than capable of taking on. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754930"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government recognized early on that building an even greater country for our children and grandchildren requires a solid plan, a plan to create jobs, keep unemployment low, reduce taxes, reward hard work and help people get ahead. That is why in November 2006 we unveiled our long term economic plan, Advantage Canada, a plan to make Canada a world leader for today's generation and for generations to come.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325">(1325)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para754931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage Canada focuses on creating five key advantages: first, a fiscal advantage eliminating Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation; second, a tax advantage reducing taxes for all Canadians and establishing the lowest tax rate on new business investment in the G-7; third, an entrepreneurial advantage creating a business environment that unlocks private investment by reducing taxes, reducing unnecessary regulation, reducing red tape; fourth, a knowledge advantage creating the best educated, most skilled, most flexible workforce in the world; and fifth, an infrastructure advantage building modern infrastructure to ensure the seamless flow of people, goods and services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage Canada was designed not only to provide our country with a clear long term economic vision, but also the ability to adjust to ever changing global realities. It is an ambitious plan. Just as important, it is a practical one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has not allowed Advantage Canada to become another document accumulating dust on a shelf. Over the last 21 months we have been creating an environment for further investment by reducing taxes significantly for individuals, families and business, a $41 billion reduction over three years and by moving Canada's overall tax rate on new business investment from third highest to second lowest in the G-7 by 2011.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We released a plan to create a Canadian advantage in global capital markets, a plan designed to achieve increased protection and income for investors, better jobs, more investment and prosperity. We set out a global commerce strategy. This is a new course for Canada's engagement in commercial relations worldwide and we released a new science and technology plan to guide future government decision making. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After years of debate we have restored fiscal balance in Canada. These achievements are clear evidence of a government ready and willing to go a little further and reach a little higher.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On building a fiscal advantage for Canadians we have already made a significant down payment that any homeowner can appreciate. We have reduced the federal debt by more than $27 billion over the past two years or more than $1,142 for every man, woman and child in Canada. This is at the same time provincial and territorial governments will have reduced their debt by almost $40 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754937"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean for Canadians? This means that we are paying off the national mortgage and at the same time reducing taxes even further. Under our tax back guarantee we are giving Canadians a direct stake and a direct benefit in how we manage government finances on their behalf. We are dedicating all interest savings from the shrinking public debt to further reduce personal income taxes. To date we have provided Canadians with over $1.5 billion in annual personal income tax relief as a result of our tax back guarantee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754938"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also intend to focus future federal-provincial discussions on strengthening the economic union by improving regulatory efficiency and removing barriers to internal trade and labour mobility in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754939"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On creating a tax advantage, I have already described the tax back guarantee. We have reduced taxes for Canadians by over $41 billion over three years and yet that is not enough. Canadians still pay too much tax and deserve to keep more of their hard-earned tax dollars. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754940"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken initial steps also to bring forward the working income tax benefit which the official opposition failed to do and this is to help Canadians who are receiving social assistance to get into the workforce and not have all of their benefits clawed back so that it is not worthwhile for someone to enter the workforce in Canada. We need people to enter the workforce. We have labour shortfalls across Canada and this is a good way of moving forward on that agenda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754941"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrepreneurial advantage is important. Reducing red tape is very important. We need to support the RCMP and industries, as we have indicated in the Speech from the Throne. Also requiring assistance are the forestry industry and of course the automotive industry which is facing some manufacturing challenges as are other manufacturing industries, particularly in Quebec and Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754942"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have accomplished a great deal in the first 21 months. Of course there is more to do. That is why we have the five new clear priorities that will enable us to build a legacy of peace and prosperity.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that there have been losses in the manufacturing sector, particularly in central Canada.

From the moment the speech started, I knew that it was a defining moment for not only our government, but also all Canadians. And I was not disappointed with the vision this government has for Canada's future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have every reason to be proud of their country and of what we have accomplished. We have worked together to build a nation that serves as model for the rest of the world. Advantage Canada, our government's long-term economic plan, is based on sound fiscal management. Canadians now want a government that will help them build on this heritage, a government that sets clear objectives and that gets real results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet those expectations, our government set out in the Speech from the Throne, its vision of a Canada based on the following five priorities: strengthening Canada’s sovereignty and place in the world; strengthening the federation and our democratic institutions; providing effective economic leadership for a prosperous future; tackling crime and strengthening the security of Canadians; improving the environment and the health of Canadians. In the final analysis, Canadians want a government that will be accountable for its actions and their results. They want a government that gives priority to Canadians and their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Canadians are holding on to a bigger share of their income because we have reduced taxes, including income taxes. Families have a real choice in terms of day care thanks to the universal child care benefit. Canadians can now count on a government that is determined to help them receive the medical care they need more quickly, and a government that is tackling crime and strengthening the security of our cities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these matters are of great importance to Canadians. That is why they elected our government: to improve conditions for them and their families. Canadians want a government that gets concrete results. Thanks to the dynamic leadership of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, our government is getting those results. The economic and fiscal update this fall will spell out our progress toward achieving those objectives. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us stop for a moment to reflect on some of the initiatives launched by our government to show how we are investing in our families. In terms of taxation, for example, we have delivered or announced tax reductions amounting to more than $41 billion over three years for Canadian companies and individuals. The family is the basic unit of our society and our government will continue to support our families and help them to achieve their dreams of a better and more secure future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the first measures taken by our government in its first budget was to honour our promise to reduce the GST. We immediately reduced it to 6%, which was an important step because it really was a reduction with general application. It affects all Canadians, whether individuals or families. In the Speech from the Throne last Tuesday, the government announced that it will deliver the second part of its election promise and will reduce the GST to 5%. Our government keeps its promises. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 2006 budget, we also introduced the universal child care benefit to provide support for families. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan is giving families the resources to make the choices that will enable them to balance work and family as they see fit, regardless of where they live, their particular circumstances or their preferences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Advantage Canada, the government has committed to working with the provinces and territories to do away with the social security trap by implementing the working income tax benefit to make work more profitable for low- and middle-income Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working income tax benefit is designed to make work more lucrative and attractive for approximately 1.2 million Canadians who are already part of the workforce and to encourage them to keep working. Moreover, we expect that the working income tax benefit will encourage about 60,000 more people to join the workforce.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754983"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Budget 2007, the government followed up on the group's recommendations by announcing a new registered disability savings plan to help parents save money to ensure the financial security of their severely disabled children. This plan, the first of its kind in Canada, will ensure the financial security of disabled children, improve their quality of life, and bring peace of mind to their parents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754984"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax fairness plan allows pension income splitting for pensioners. This initiative will give families a greater incentive to save and invest their money to ensure their financial independence following retirement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754985"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, our government will continue to invest in our families and our future. As we said in the Speech from the Throne, we are committed to helping those who want to escape the hardships of homelessness and poverty. As you know, the new homelessness partnering strategy came into effect on April 1, 2007. The strategy's $269.9 million over two years will promote new structures and support measures to help the homeless and people at risk create a better, safer future for themselves. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754986"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have accomplished great things, but we still have a lot to do. Our government believes that families, individuals and businesses are still paying too much tax.</div>

    </p><a name="Para754988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we passed the first Speech from the Throne after the election, his party accepted one of the Bloc's amendments, which targeted an assistance program for older workers. Last year, in the latest budget, a committee was created in order to eventually establish an income security program for older workers, to help them make it to their retirement. This time, however, there was no mention of this issue in the throne speech. </div>
    </p><a name="Para754989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have been waiting for this program since the last election, for the past year and a half. On many occasions, his colleagues have said that we will eventually see something. In the meantime, people do not have the minimum income they need to get by until their old age pension. Couples are being torn apart and, sadly, some people have even committed suicide.</div>
    </p><a name="Para754990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the member explain to me why his government has not shown enough sensitivity to announce, once and for all, an assistance program for older workers? This is a matter of respect for the dignity of these workers who have been supporting their families for the past 30 or 35 years by working for the same company, but who are now forced to rely on social assistance, because of his government's insensitivity.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet these expectations, our government announced, in the throne speech, its vision for Canada based on the following five major priorities: strengthening Canada's sovereignty and place in the world, strengthening the federation and our democratic institutions, providing economic leadership for a prosperous future, tackling crime and strengthening the security of Canadians and improving the environment and the health of Canadians.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to speak about the throne speech today as my party's critic on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I would like to talk mainly about the situation in the forestry industry. In this throne speech, the Conservative government completely ignores the crisis the forestry industry is going through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the throne speech, the government only briefly mentions the challenges facing an industry that has existed for more than a century in Quebec, perhaps because the crisis does not affect Alberta's interests. In Quebec, the whole economy is being affected by the problems in the forestry industry. Entire regions are suffering because of job losses, unemployment and plant closures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding, <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78399,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78399&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Trois-Rivières</A>, the Kruger paper mill had to close temporarily, laying off 1,000 workers. Many plants north of La Tuque, in Saint-Michel-des-Saints and elsewhere have also been affected. These plants cannot count on the federal government to address the problem, which requires a reorganization of the regional economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the non-negotiable demands the Bloc Québécois made as a condition of its support for the throne speech was that the federal government introduce tax measures to support the regions of Quebec affected by the forestry crisis. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that the federal government will have to fix some of the mistakes it has made. We all remember its refusal to help the forest industry throughout the entire softwood lumber dispute and the major effects this had that are still being felt today. An economic upswing in many parts of Quebec has long been hampered by Ottawa’s refusal to act. The Bloc Québécois demands an end to this Conservative ideology of laissez-faire. The Conservative government must realize the urgency of the situation, act responsibly, and take the necessary action to turn the situation around. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois has insisted on a clear mention in the Speech from the Throne of fiscal measures to help the regions affected by the crisis in the forest industry. However, there are no specific measures in this speech to help workers, companies and regions affected by this crisis. Although the government says it is very concerned, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> has not provided any solutions or taken any steps to help the industry recover, not to mention any programs to help workers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government even has the crust to boast about what it has done to support the industry and the people working in it. There is no truth to any of it. The only thing the government has done is cut the community assistance programs and leave the workers who lost their jobs at the mercy of the crisis. The only promise in this speech is that the government will continue doing nothing to offset the effects of the crisis in the forest industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We in the Bloc have proposed a number of measures. One of them, for example, is to bring back the fund to diversify forest economies that was eliminated by the Conservatives, although the management of this fund would be turned over to local stakeholders. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78745,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78745&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec</A> did away with this fund on the excuse that it was not being used properly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of relaxing Ottawa’s inappropriate and bureaucratic criteria, decentralizing the program, and making the regions responsible for managing it in accordance with their own needs, the minister simply eliminated the program, thereby depriving the regions that needed it most in order to diversify their economies. Like a lot of federal programs, this fund was more suited to meeting Ottawa’s objectives than the real needs of the regions affected by the crisis. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these reasons, the Bloc Québécois wants the fund brought back, although the management of it should be turned over to local stakeholders. It is local people, as we have always said, who know what is needed. They are best placed to determine who needs this fund, why they need it, and how to get the regions out of the economic quagmire in which they find themselves. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second measure would set up a loan and loan-guarantee program to help finance investment in production equipment. There is nothing about this in the Speech from the Throne. The federal government has done nothing to help the industry caught up in the softwood lumber crisis. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eunice was born with the maiden name Service, a most fitting name for she gave so much of herself for the benefit of the less fortunate in our community.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This industry employs some 12,000 people and contributes $7 billion a year to Canada's economy. We provide 12% of the world's fertilizer materials and export to more than 50 countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fertilizer industry helps farmers provide safe and nutritious food to the world's growing population. Fertilizers have enabled farmers to triple crop production in the past four decades.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry can also take pride in its environmental record by reducing emission levels 10% while it increased total production by 39% since 1993. Increasing fertilizer use means more carbon dioxide is taken from the atmosphere by plant growth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, the Canadian fertilizer industry rates among the most efficient in the world.</div>

It is a lot of money. That sum, $60 billion, has been given in corporate tax cuts to huge corporations, like big banks, since 2000.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fail to understand why banks that made $19 billion in profits last year will get even more tax breaks according to the Conservatives' throne speech. In all, by 2011 there will be a 10 point drop in the federal corporate tax rate since 2001. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals and Conservatives give tax breaks to the richest Canadians, but there is nothing for affordable child care. There is nothing to hire more nurses and doctors. There is nothing to invest in our cities, our artists and to improve our public transit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for this year without the big corporate tax cuts, Canada would have had $12.7 billion to invest in ordinary Canadians. To give even more corporate tax cuts after the billions in tax giveaways is insulting to the two-thirds of Canadians who say they are not benefiting from the economic growth. It is wrong and it is unfair.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para755282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, view such matters seriously, as I know all honourable members do. The premature release of important documents, such as the Speech from the Throne or the Budget, runs contrary to our practices.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular situation, however, there seems to be some disagreement about the responsibility for this leak.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reference to the secrecy of the budget, <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i> states at page 753: “Speakers of the Canadian House have maintained that secrecy is a matter of parliamentary convention, rather than one of privilege”.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest to the House that the same is true with regard to throne speeches. I therefore must rule that no breach of privilege has occurred in the present case.</div>

During the lengthy softwood lumber crisis, the Bloc Québécois repeatedly asked the government to give loan guarantees. But the government never helped the softwood lumber companies. Today we can see the sad results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April 1, 2005, 21,000 workers who depended on forestry for their livelihood—including plant workers, forestry workers, machinists and truckers—have lost their jobs and 156 plants have closed. Our regions in Quebec have been very hard hit. It is unbelievable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this time, many companies have not been able to invest the money they need to upgrade their machinery and perform on par with their competitors. The government must abandon its laissez-faire approach and help fund investments in production equipment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also suggesting numerous labour-related measures. For example, we are proposing that the government provide incentives for skilled workers to settle in the regions by offering, as the Government of Quebec does, a refundable tax credit of up to $8,000 to any young graduate who settles in a resource region and takes a job in this field. Another measure promotes job creation in resource regions and gives secondary and tertiary processing companies in these regions a tax credit equivalent to 30% of the increase in their payroll.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure promotes the development of SME manufacturers in resource regions by offering them a tax break equivalent to 50% of their income tax. It is essential that the government use tax measures to stimulate the creation and development of processing businesses in resource regions. Measures such as this would make it more attractive for skilled workers to settle in areas affected by the forestry crisis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government must follow the example of the Government of Quebec and promote the labour market to these future workers. Populations are dwindling in our regions and urgent action is needed. Federal corporate income tax is twice as high as the Quebec tax rate and there is no such measure at the federal level. Support from Quebec cannot achieve the maximum effect until Ottawa adapts its taxation to the needs of the forestry industry.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the government did not announce any specific tax measures in the throne speech. It simply repeats that tax cuts will solve everything. However, tax cuts for businesses that have no profits are completely useless. There is nothing concrete in the throne speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a final point, I would like to talk about research and development. Tax credits for research and development must be improved by transferring them into refundable tax credits, which would be beneficial for all companies that engage in research and development activities, including those that are not earning any profits, as I was saying earlier. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget for the industrial research assistance program, or IRAP, must be increased significantly. IRAP is managed by the National Research Council Canada. It is receiving money, but not nearly enough. Through that program, Ottawa must invest in the development of new products, in order to later reap the benefits of the royalties when the product is put on the market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also ensure that the future Canadian wood fibre centre, a new federal research centre announced during the last budget, is established in a forestry region in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is responsible for stimulating the research and development of new products. Tax credits alone will not do it. There is not enough support for research and development within businesses. Quebec, in particular, is suffering.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe it is important for the government to make a commitment and to invest, and we saw no indication of this in the throne speech. It must bring back a fund to diversify the forestry economy, to be managed by local players. However, it must also adapt federal taxation in order to stimulate job creation.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to official languages, she congratulated herself on having signed service and education agreements with all of the provinces.

It found all manner of ways to avoid this word, avoid this specific commitment. What the linguistic minority communities across the country are asking for, and what the ministers responsible for la Francophonie across the country asked for, is that the action plan be renewed. In the Speech from the Throne, there is not a single occurrence of the word “renewal”. The government has chosen its words carefully.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister wanted to focus on the issue of official languages; we were hoping she would, because it is not clear. Would the plan be renewed for one year, two years, five years? It is not clear. How much money would be allocated? Not a word. Are we talking about broadening this action plan? A promise was made after many consultations with the communities. It was a matter of broadening the plan to incorporate programs for young people, women, seniors, culture and international issues. Not a word.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not talk about the setbacks we have had under her government either; the cancellation of the court challenges program, for example. As for the Official Languages Secretariat, which was a branch of the Privy Council, the government decided to transfer it to Canadian Heritage, when we know full well that a secretariat located in a central agency has a lot more influence and a greater ability to take action.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were it not for the existence of this secretariat at the Privy Council when I was minister responsible for official languages, we would not have succeeded in getting language clauses in the early childhood agreements with every province. What did this government do? It relieved the Privy Council of its role in official languages and gave that role to Canadian Heritage. The communities are having a hard time getting their bearings. The minister could have said a few words about this, but she chose not to say a word.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the new round of budget cuts just starting, which her department is subject to, would the action plan for official languages be protected from these cuts this time? Not a word.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Department of National Defence in this struggle to promote linguistic duality, and we totally agree that it is the role of the Government of Canada to ensure that the Official Languages Act is respected across the country, there is not a word. National Defence has given up and there is not a word on this from the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor was anything said about one of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s first actions when he came to power, informing us that he intended to cancel all early childhood agreements—the very agreements that had been negotiated and that communities were celebrating from one end of the country to the other. It is a major setback for these communities. The minister did not say one word about this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not one word about the fact that, after they were elected, the Conservatives decided that the Commissioner of Official Languages, an officer of this House, would no longer report to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> but would report to another minister. Previous governments had indicated the importance they attributed to the issue of linguistic duality and the official languages. They said that, in terms of the government, the Commissioner of Official Languages reported to the Prime Minister. In terms of his mandate, he obviously reports to the House of Commons, as he should.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even more disturbing, there is not a word about Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1426991,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1426991&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-3</A>.

I had the honour of being associate minister of defence and my colleague, Mr. Graham, who is no longer in Parliament, had asked me to look into the official languages application in defence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the question is to be found in what others have said. When we look at the concerns expressed by ACTRA, by the Canadian Conference of the Arts and by la Fédération culturelle canadienne française following the Speech from the Throne, we see they have some grave concerns as to the absence of anything to deal with culture writ large, our cultural industries in the Speech from the Throne. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they acknowledge there is mention of copyright legislation which we have been waiting now for 18 months, either in industry or in heritage, as my colleague over there from Edmonton knows. The absence of where the government wishes to take or not to take Canada's cultural concerns is very much something that frightens people. There are a number of signals that have emanated in the past, as I mentioned one, from the Reform Party in its dissenting opinion on the Clifford Lincoln report about the role of a public broadcaster, wishing for the privatization of CBC. That has never been denied by the current government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of concerns out there which the government had an opportunity to address in the Speech from the Throne and it chose not to. The question is still very valid: Is there something that the Conservatives do not wish to tell us? Perhaps in questions in the House or perhaps even better in committee, we can get some answers to these questions. They are fundamental to the well-being of Canadian identity in a continent where we are dominated by our neighbours from the south.</div>

The government should reach out not only to the opposition parties, but it should include the opposition parties and reach out in terms of what our expectations are. Before that, it should reach out to the industry, and not just the industry side of that, because there is industry and there is heritage. There has forever been a bit of a dichotomy in heritage. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague was not here during the last round of modernization of the Copyright Act which I think was Bill C-32 in the 35th Parliament.

They elected me on September 17 with a very clear mandate: defend their interests and demand that the government meet the five conditions of the Bloc Québécois.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are against the Speech from the Throne. We think it represents another missed opportunity for the Conservative government to meet the repeated demands of Quebec, for which the Bloc Québécois set out five conditions. In other cases, the Conservative government is refusing to respond to demands based on unanimous motions from the Quebec National Assembly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues who spoke earlier explained very well the reasons my party is against the Speech from the Throne. Nothing in this speech gives me a reason to tell my constituents in Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot that their demands have been met and this is what I am going to speak about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the issue of Canada's current combat mission in Afghanistan, it is completely unacceptable for the government to extend the mission until 2011. More and more people are saying that resources that should be invested in humanitarian aid and reconstruction are being invested instead in combat forces and that rather than being considered as allies by the Afghans, our soldiers are making enemies of them. It is reported that poppy production has never been healthier in Afghanistan. This proves that the mission objectives have not been met. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am tempted to draw a parallel with the problems associated with marijuana production in my region. When a population is faced with the consequences of drug trafficking, there is only one way to fight the problem, and that is to involve the people, as the Bloc Québécois members have succeeded in doing in Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, with the help of law enforcement authorities. Have our soldiers in Afghanistan succeeded in making the Afghan people their allies? The answer is no.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally know some of the soldiers from my region who are serving on this mission. I believe that they deserve our admiration because they are bravely risking their lives to defend the lives of others. But at the same time, at the very least, our soldiers need to feel that they are taking part in a mission that is really helping the Afghan people. That is why we must tell NATO now that the current mission will end in February 2009.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Conservative government is proposing to limit federal spending power only for new shared-cost programs, with the right to opt out with “reasonable compensation”. This proposal calls to mind the proposed social union, which makes it unacceptable to Quebec for a number of reasons. I will mention only two.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason is simply that the government is not proposing to eliminate federal spending power, but limit it. Quebeckers agree that federal spending power must be eliminated. Quebec has been challenging that power for over half a century. Even after his government was elected, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> repeatedly stated that he and his party would oppose federal spending power. Our party asked that the federal government promise to stop spending altogether in Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. The throne speech does not come anywhere near that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that the Conservative government claims that it is responding to our demands, but in reality, it is referring to non-existent spending.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535">(1535)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para755354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the government wants to limit use of the federal spending power only in the case of shared cost programs. The fact is, most federal spending in areas of Quebec jurisdiction is not for shared cost programs, and there are fewer and fewer programs of this nature.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have seen in recent months under the Conservative government have been transfers that are conditional on federal priorities and therefore constitute interference, pure and simple, such as the new Canadian Mental Health Commission or the cervical cancer vaccination program. The federal steamroller continues to interfere in provincial jurisdictions. Clearly, the recognition of Quebec as a nation within a united Canada has in no way changed the federal government's desire to interfere.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now discuss the Bloc Québécois' third condition, which involved specific measures to support the workers, businesses and regions suffering from the manufacturing crisis and the forestry crisis. With the help of people from the field, the Bloc Québécois had proposed some measures to modernize and revive the forest economy, thereby supporting the workers affected by the crisis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have probably already mentioned this, but it is worth saying again: 21,000 of Quebec's forestry workers have lost their jobs since April 1, 2005, and no fewer than 156 mills have ceased operations. The rising Canadian dollar has not helped things at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People sometimes forget that the crisis in the forestry industry can affect regions whose economies are not resource-based. For example, in my riding, <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',113958,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=113958&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot</A>, a heavy machinery manufacturer that supplied the forestry sector had to close its doors in 2006, forcing a lot of people to look for new jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rising dollar also led to the closure of two pork processing plants in my riding. Once again, many jobs were lost.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that my colleagues know just how hard it can be for a worker in his or her fifties to find another job, especially when several workers lose their jobs at the same time. We were hoping that the Conservative government would help these workers by creating an income support program for workers aged 55 to 64 who cannot be retrained and who were victims of massive layoffs, a program that would have helped them bridge the gap between employment insurance and their pension fund, as proposed by the Bloc Québécois.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also hoping that the Conservative government would use this opportunity to restore everything the Liberals cut from the employment insurance program. This would have given most unemployed people the benefits they are due for having contributed, along with their employers, to a fund that belongs to them. After all, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, too, used to criticize the Liberal decision to dip into the employment insurance fund.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we got nothing. Too bad for older workers and for forestry regions in dire straits. The Bloc Québécois thinks that is unacceptable.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to address the Bloc Québécois' fourth condition: respecting Canada's commitments under the Kyoto accord by adopting a territorial approach that would recognize Quebec's compliance with the Kyoto targets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech contained no surprises in that regard. There was nothing in it that would be good for Quebec or for sustainable development in general. My colleagues have already said a lot about this, so I will just add that the Conservative government is still trying to fool the public by choosing intensity targets over real results.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois' fifth condition was that the government make a firm commitment to defending the supply-managed system for agriculture. We know how important this is to the producers of milk, poultry and eggs, products that supply a livelihood for many farm families in Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the throne speech, the Conservatives only mention the “government's strong support” for supply management. This is a very half-hearted statement especially when we think of the statements by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78741,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78741&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of International Trade</A>. At a time when the concept of food sovereignty is increasingly taking hold of citizens in Quebec and elsewhere in the world, it is unacceptable that the Canadian government is not taking responsibility for defending supply management.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could also have talked about the Conservative approach to justice, the creation of a single securities commission, proposals in the throne speech that run counter to the Quebec consensus or recognition of the primacy of the French language in Quebec, of which there is no mention in the throne speech, but I will stop there. I believe that there are enough reasons for us to vote against this throne speech.</div>

This is actually a great opportunity to respond to what the Conservative government has outlined for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I do want to say that it is good to be back in the House of Commons. It is good to be back after so many Canadians have asked us: “Why was Parliament shut down for an additional month? Why were MPs not at their desks, in their offices, and in the chamber doing the work that Canadians expect them to do?”</div>
    </p><a name="Para755388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be honest, during the summer I spoke with many of my constituents. I went door to door. I met with them at events, at my office and they all asked me this question. I really did not have any convincing response. I could not explain to them why the Conservatives decided to prorogue Parliament and delay the return of Parliament for an additional month.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Conservative government really wanted to do that, why did it not prorogue Parliament during the summer months? The House did not sit for over a month's time, so why did the government not prorogue Parliament during the summer months? No, the Conservatives wanted to delay Parliament. They wanted to lock out MPs from doing their work. They wanted to avoid answering questions about which Canadians expect to hear answers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many pundits gave us an answer about why this Conservative government is good at playing political games. It wanted to stop questions. It wanted to avoid questions. It wanted to appear that it had this new agenda. It wanted to create some hype and that is what it is good at: playing political games and posturing. But nothing serious for Canadians. The Conservatives are running on fumes. They have run out of ideas. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have expected the throne speech, after that delay, to come up with a new set of ideas, a new vision, an invigorated plan, and some kind of explanation for why the government prorogued Parliament. There was nothing. This was quite a disappointment. We would think that at least the throne speech would address the items that the Conservatives claimed were their priorities. We would think that at least they would have answered questions about their failed promises and their broken promises and unfulfilled promises. There was nothing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Which ones?</div>
    </p><a name="Para755393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Omar Alghabra:</b> I am glad an hon. member asks me which ones. Let me begin.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, I did not expect him to address the in and out scheme from Elections Canada. I did not expect that. I understand why the Conservatives would avoid explaining that in the throne speech. Never mind, we will be asking these questions and the Conservatives will have to answer these questions, not just to us and to Elections Canada, but to Canadians who want to know the answer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members:</b> Oh, oh!</div>
    </p><a name="Para755396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Omar Alghabra:</b> I do not mean to get on the nerves of the Conservatives. I am just doing my job here. I hope they can sit down and listen, and answer these questions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about the items that were priorities. The Conservatives falsely claim that they are the champions of accountability. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members:</b> Hear, hear!</div>
    </p><a name="Para755399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Omar Alghabra:</b> Yes, that is right, falsely claim. I am glad they are applauding. What have they done so far? Where is the public appointment commissioner? They promised to appoint a public appointment commissioner. They have not appointed a public appointment commissioner. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the government has appointed more than 2,000 people. Many of them are their friends and supporters. Where is the public appointment commissioner? What did they do the other day? They struck out the word “accountability” from their manuals. Is this what they talk about when they say accountability? Is this what they mean when they say “we are accountable to Canadians”. It is very transparent. This was the number one priority for the Conservatives. I would hate to see what they would do if it were not one of their priorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want a public appointment commissioner. We want to make sure that these appointments are held in check and the Conservatives are accountable to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number two, they made a promise, and this is again one of their priorities, on health wait time guarantees. Where is that promise? Constituents in my riding are asking me and saying that health care needs support from the federal government. The federal Conservatives are absent. They said nothing about it in the throne speech. They have done nothing about it so far and they have failed Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives did not explain in the throne speech why they raised income taxes. Why did they not explain why they raised income taxes? They raised income taxes. They reversed decreases that the previous government had implemented in the fall of 2005. That is very shameful. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550">(1550)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para755404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more shameful is that the Conservatives claimed they were reducing taxes. They are misleading Canadians. They have raised income taxes. All Canadians need to do is look at their income tax return to see that the rates have been raised by .5% from 2005 to 2006. That is shameful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives talk about having safer communities as one of their priorities. They promised to put 2,500 extra police officers on the streets, yet in the last two budgets there has been no fulfillment of that promise. My constituents are asking: if the Conservatives are really serious about crime, why are they not fulfilling that promise, why are they not reforming the judicial process? The Conservatives are just posturing. They are just misleading Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755406"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about another priority that the Conservatives had in the last campaign: early learning and childhood education. They promised the creation of 125,000 extra spaces. Where are these spaces? Not a single space has been created. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been two budgets and it has been close to two years and they have not only not fulfilled their promise but they are not even talking about it in the throne speech. It is completely absent from the throne speech. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mississauga, there are more than 2,000 kids on waiting lists for child care spaces. The government cares nothing about that and has done nothing about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about the environment. The Conservative government pretends to care about the environment, but what has it done so far? Nothing. It has cancelled Liberal programs, it has misled the public, it has misled the international community, and it has done nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do members know what the Conservatives are all about? They are about pretend politics. I read a letter in <i>The Globe and Mail</i> the other day written by one Canadian who has them figured them out. He wrote that the Conservatives were all about pretend politics and that Canadians were going to pretend to vote for them in the next election. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are all about rhetoric but no action. With regard to the environment, they failed Canadians and they failed the international community while everybody else knows that this is the number one challenge that our planet is facing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have the Conservatives done about infrastructure spending? They have done nothing. Mississauga has already been promised by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> an additional $80 million to help in the rapid bus transit project last March. The money has yet to come. Our provincial counterparts have made that pledge and the money is there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the federal government, because there was a risk of an election last spring, has yet to send the money. Many people in Mississauga are waiting for that money. We need infrastructure money. The City of Mississauga has been let down by the Conservative government. Do members know why? Because the Conservatives know they are at odds with the people of Mississauga. They do not care about the people of Mississauga. They do not listen to the needs of the people of Mississauga.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about immigration? There is not a single word in the throne speech about immigration. Everybody knows that immigration is essential to the success of the future of our country. What did the Conservatives do? They ignored it. They have been ignoring it for the last two years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made a promise, by the way, in the last campaign about creating an assessment office for foreign credentials. What have they done? They broke that promise. They looked straight into the face of the Canadian public and said, “Sorry, we can't fulfill that promise”. Yet, in last election campaign, they exploited the angst and frustrations of many new Canadians and told them, “Don't worry. We're going to fix it for you. Vote us in.” And once they became the government, they have broken that promise shamelessly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy is facing a huge labour shortage. What is the government doing about it? Nothing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I only have one minute left, let me get down to the point. Let me talk about how difficult it was to decide what to do about the throne speech. I explained quite clearly how the Conservative government has neglected the needs of Canadians. However, we have a priority. We have a responsibility to Canadians.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555">(1555)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para755418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very tempting to bring the government down today, and I want to go to Canadians and ask them to kick the Conservative government out of office. However, we cannot act irresponsibly like the Conservatives. We have to be responsible, we have to be deliberate in our decision-making process and we have to be thoughtful. We cannot go on a whim of emotions and political posturing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the throne speech has nothing binding to Canadians, we will sit down and wait to see what the Conservatives will do. However, next time there is legislation that we feel is taking Canadians in the wrong direction, we will be sure to hold the government to account and ask Canadians to be the judge.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue I want to raise specifically with the hon. member is this. He mentioned a lack of any reference to new Canadians in the throne speech. In Hamilton we continue to have a huge problem with foreign trained professionals being unable to perform the work in the profession for which they are trained. There are far too many. This is not a caricature; this is reality. We have far too many PhDs driving cabs and delivering pizza. Not that it is not honourable work, but we have more important things for them to do.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would assume the member has similar problems in his community of Mississauga. Perhaps he would like to expand on why he believes, like I, that the government, whatever it is, needs to do a lot more in this area. If we truly want to build our economy and say to the world that Canada is open to having new people join us, then we need to find a way to ensure we are translating their professional skills into jobs in Canada where we need the service and they need the work.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 50% of the people of Mississauga were born outside of Canada. Many of them have immigrated here particularly because of their amazing and incredible skills. We have attracted them to Canada so we can utilize those skills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as many economists tell us, we are missing out on much economic activity because we are unable to utilize those skills. We are missing out on $6 billion a year of economic activity.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives could introduce initiatives that retrain these individuals. They could introduce initiatives in cooperation with assessment agencies or the regulating bodies to ensure they recruit individuals and upgrade or assess their credentials, but they have done nothing. They have created a kiosk that points fingers for individuals and tells them to speak to that individual or that agency. They have not fixed the problem and I am really sorry about that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an agricultural day on the Hill. A lot of groups are around the Hill advocating and lobbying and so on. I started out my day at about 7 o'clock this morning with a breakfast with fertilizer groups from across the country. We talked about their future and the role they play in agriculture.

We working toward that end.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight a lot of us will end up with the CAFTA group that is here. At the same time the Canadian Federation of Agriculture is putting on another function as well. There is never any lack of things going on in the agricultural files.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of things I have been happy to pick up from my predecessor, now the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111551,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111551&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development</A>, who did a fantastic job on this file. We have a saying in agricultural areas that I am basically harrowing the ground that he ploughed on a lot of these issues. I tried using that logic with a member of the media in Ottawa at one time and the person got it backward. The individual was harrowing before ploughing. Out in the real world we do it in the right order and a lot of it has to do with the environment and taking care of that in our charge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of things in the throne speech have been decried by the Liberals. A lot of that may be alligator tears and a bit of an impression that they never really measured up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a number of Liberal throne speeches. They prorogued a number of times and recessed and did all sorts of funny tricks. Most of their throne speeches ended up in the archives because nothing ever came out of them. I never found any mention of agriculture in any Liberal throne speeches. You have been here longer than I have, Mr. Speaker, and I would challenge you to try to remember back over the years any words of encouragement to the agricultural sector in a Liberal throne speech. I could not find any at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I started to think that maybe the Liberals put it all into their budgets. Maybe that was when they kept their powder dry in the throne speeches and rather than over promise, they would deliver something in their budgets. I started checking those too and other than a trail of tears leading to the vault from Canadian taxpayers, I could not find mention of agriculture in their budgets either.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of neglect on the agricultural file over the 13 years the Liberals were in office. My colleague from Prince Edward Island, who is with us here today, is agreeing with me. He is nodding his head. Farmers on the emerald isle are telling him that as well. I am happy to have that support. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a great trip out to Prince Edward Island a couple of weeks ago. The member of the agriculture committee from Prince Edward Island followed me around and re-announced my announcements a day later. That is the greatest form of flattery. He is agreeing with everything we are doing. I am certain we will see a lot of support from the member.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a mistake in question period. I should have said the former minister, the agricultural brain child from Prince Edward Island. I want to apologize to the rest of the country for mistakenly calling him the minister. Everybody is going to have a late night trying to get to sleep after that one.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of great initiatives have been announced in the throne speech that pertain to agriculture. There is mention about interprovincial trade barriers. We all know the cost and the cause of those types of things as we have these little kingdoms across the country. Some of the provinces, specifically British Columbia and Alberta, have come forward with an agreement called TILMA, which gets rid of that boundary when it comes to agricultural products especially. We hear some discussions are happening between Ontario and Quebec. It is all great news. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need free and unfettered trade among our provinces the same as we are seeking. My seatmate, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78741,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78741&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of International Trade</A>, was on his feet today a number of times. He talked about bilateral trade agreements, on which we are working. Those are requirements of a trading nation like our country, whether we get everything we are looking for at the WTO in Geneva this go around or not. We are still going to need bilateral trade agreements to build on that foundation or to take the place of that if a deal does not go through. It is not looking good at this point. There are a lot of different interests at play.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main trade negotiator, a fellow named Steve Verheul, has done yeoman service. I have a lot of time for Steve as do most farming operations across the country. He has done a tremendous service for Canadian agriculture in carrying that message and that load to the round tables at Geneva. Steve deserves our respect and certainly a bigger pay cheque than we could ever give him. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does that job. He is the greatest cheerleader for Saskatchewan agriculture, Ontario agriculture, the Maritimes agriculture and Quebec agriculture. Every form of agriculture in the country is being represented equally and robustly by Mr. Verheul at those tables as we could ever imagine. I just cannot comment enough on the great job he has done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of other things in the throne speech. We reiterate our movement toward free and unfettered trade in the world. We are very close in negotiating some of the trade deals. Some of them we have signed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started to check back in history. I wanted to compare our action with what the Liberals did over 13 years and I could not find one action. The member who spoke before me went on and on about what is not in and what is in and how they would do a better job. I guess if we want to compare report cards, that is what the next election will be all about, whenever it comes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy doing my job. If it comes to pounding campaign signs tomorrow, next spring or next fall or October 2009, when we have actually stipulated the date, I am happy to do that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am here and I want to govern. I have enjoyed working with my provincial counterparts, teeing off on the great work that the former minister did in Whistler last June, moving forward with “Growing Forward”, getting past that old CAIS program, which even the Liberals have said we should have done earlier. We campaigned and made a promise on that. We are following through on this and we are replacing it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are coming forward with user friendly products. They are bankable, they are predictable and they are the best of which we can work. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had two rounds of discussions with the farm groups. We are looking forward to a third round. I had a conference call with my provincial counterparts last week. I am looking forward to a face to face meeting in mid-November to carry on with the great work the farm lobby has done in building this new generation of products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we cannot back stop everything we would like to. There are trade rules that curtail us in certain ways. However, we have been very innovative and appreciative of what the farmers have gone through sector by sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about innovation, I came to this job with one concrete principle, having been a former producer. My one and only concrete principle is farmers first. Without a robust farm gate, a vibrant farm gate, none of the rest of my portfolio or a lot of other portfolios make any difference at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are about ensuring that farmers can do what they do best, which is to plant those seeds, raise those livestocks, grow the vineyards, the orchards and so on, which make this great diverse agricultural sector.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have stayed with that bedrock principle. I have had great discussions with some of the processing sector, which is also facing some anomalies at this point with the dollar rising as quickly as it has and as dramatically as it has. A lot of that speaks to the robust Canadian economy as a whole. Our American counterparts are slipping a little and they are our major trading partners. Some 85% of what we trade goes back and forth across the border on a daily basis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all about free and unfettered trade, but it is easier to get a piece of steak into Montana than it is to get it from Lloydminster into Alberta. That is how crazy that interprovincial trade stuff is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking at a lot of those issues, working with our provincial counterparts, building a stronger economy around the farm gate. In the statement my parliamentary secretary made today in the House, his S. O. 31, he talked about the contribution of agriculture to the GDP of our great country. The third largest contributor, some 8% of our GDP, comes right out of that farm gate. If we do not stop and think about the great work the men and women in the farm families are doing across the country every time we sit down to a great meal or a great snack, then we are missing the boat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a disconnect over the years between the gate to plate analogy. I remember years ago being raised on the farm. There was not a Sunday that I can remember that the aunts, uncles and cousins did not come out from Saskatoon or the cities they lived in and enjoyed a great chicken or beef supper, or a trip to the pasture to check on the cows. Of course we had the good old wiener roast down there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not remember ever losing that disconnect. They were all born in farm families, moved to the city to carry on with a career, but they never lost that analogy. They always came back and remembered that foundation, that anchor, which was what Canada was all about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had a tremendous opportunity to look at the future of agriculture. In my mind it is all about science and technology and it is all about innovation. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a comment at the biotech summit a couple of weeks ago. I said that when my grandfather was homesteading, his hands were on the plow and he dressed accordingly. Today, the pioneers for agriculture are wearing lab coats. That has dramatically changed over the last 100 years. Over the next 10 years, I think we will see a paradigm shift in agriculture as we start to look at bigger and better things for our farmers and our farm gate.</div>

However, I did not hear any convincing arguments concerning the throne speech itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Bloc Québécois member, I would like to discuss an issue that, I believe, is crucial. Now that Parliament as a whole has recognized Quebec as a nation, I think the government missed out on a good opportunity to make certain gestures after such a fine declaration. This is important to all Canadians, but most of all, to Quebeckers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to discuss more specifically the federal spending power. For the past 50 years or so, this federal spending power has been denounced in Quebec, by both the Liberal Party in power and the Parti Québécois. The Séguin report, whose author was a Liberal, recommends that, and I quote:</div>
    </p><a name="Para755480"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Quebec vigorously reiterate its traditional stance concerning the absence of a constitutional basis for “federal spending power” since this “power” does not respect the division of powers stipulated in the Constitution.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para755481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is merely one element I could mention. Building on the recent recognition of the Quebec nation, the throne speech timidly proposes limiting use of the federal spending power, but only in shared cost programs. Shared cost programs are practically non-existent. Here in this House, the government tends to adopt programs that interfere in provincial jurisdictions, such as the mental heath program and the cervical cancer program. Both of these programs involve political interference in the area of health care, which falls under provincial jurisdiction.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech reinforces our government's overall approach to growing the Canadian economy.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have been in government for only a short time, we as Conservatives have done so much to provide the country with effective economic leadership. At the core of our economic philosophy is the belief that Canadians still pay too much tax. As a consequence, over the past year and a half our government has brought forward and implemented broad based tax relief for individuals, businesses and families. To be exact, we have enacted or announced $41.5 billion worth of tax cuts for hard-working Canadians since coming to office.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members from the Conservative Party believe that Canadians should be able to rely on an income tax system that rewards those who work hard. As Minister of National Revenue, I am responsible for the CRA and its fiscal policy administration activities. That does not mean just collecting taxes. It also means giving money back to Canadians and their families through a number of sensible benefits programs the government has launched. This makes everyone happy, including the tax man.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech recognizes middle class Canadians and their families as the bedrock of our workforce. It reminded us that we must understand their priorities and address their concerns if we are to achieve our goal of a more prosperous Canada. As <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111554,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111554&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Revenue</A>, I fully support this objective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to describe how our government turns fiscal policy into monetary reality for Canadian families and the 25 million individual tax filers in this country. Let us look, for example, at the impact of our universal child care benefit. This benefit helps parents of young children balance their work and family lives. It means a family with two children under the age of six receives $2,400 a year which contributes to a choice in child care. In fact, our government has already distributed $3 billion in UCCB payments to about 1.5 million Canadian families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good example of how the government is delivering valuable benefits to Canadians and their families is the child disability benefit. This program assists families in caring for children with severe and prolonged impairment in mental or physical functions. The program reported over 53,000 recipients in the last fiscal year, with a total of $155 million going directly into the hands of caregivers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 introduced a non-refundable child tax credit for parents. In practical terms, this means that the government will issue a cheque to more than $3 million Canadian families for up to $310 for each child under 18.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child fitness tax credit offers parents an annual tax credit of up to $500 to help offset fees paid to register their children in eligible physical fitness programs. For instance, a family that pays a total of $1,500 to register three kids in hockey programs will reduce their taxes owing by $232. Parents will get this tax credit when they file their 2007 income tax return. Besides helping the pocketbook, it will also help address other critical concerns like childhood obesity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list goes on. We are helping Canadians with the cost of post-secondary education through registered education savings plans, deductions for the cost of textbooks, tax exempt bursaries and scholarships. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, countless Canadians applied for the public transit tax credit and we fully expect these numbers to significantly increase this year. Early indications have shown that it is having a positive impact on public transit ridership. Last year, the Toronto Transit Commission confirmed the credit had resulted in about a 5% increase in sales just months after coming into force.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now working with our partners in the provinces and territories to implement a new working income tax benefit. The goal of this benefit is to strengthen incentives for low income Canadians so that they can earn income from work without sacrificing needed social benefits. Once implemented, we estimate that this will help more than one million Canadians and their families to get over the so-called welfare wall.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para755508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some examples of how we, the Conservatives, are working to improve the quality of life of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has shown Canadians that filing their tax return does not necessarily mean they will have less money in their pockets. For many Canadians, it even means they will get money back.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of the Conservative Party, we also believe that the government has an important role in creating the appropriate conditions to help Canadian businesses and organizations prosper. We also believe that we can achieve this by using the income tax system to reward hard work, encourage investment and create jobs, and to help Canadian businesses be competitive internationally.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para755511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why our government has enacted or announced more than $3.5 billion in tax cuts for business since taking office, cuts that directly impact 1.6 million corporate tax filers throughout Canada. More specifically, our government has introduced the Canada employment tax credit, eliminated the corporate surtax, and increased the taxable income threshold for small businesses and reduced the rate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that small businesses are essential to economic competitiveness. To this end, we committed to reduce the administrative burden and red tape for business by 20%. In fact, we have already taken steps toward this goal. For instance, the CRA's small business action task force introduced measures to reduce the frequency of tax remittance and filing requirements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means the compliance burden for small businesses is being reduced substantially, on average by about one-third, and by up to 70% for some very small businesses. CRA estimates that 350,000 businesses stand to benefit from these changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding online access to tax services is another way we are reducing the burden for businesses. Today, I am pleased to announce the addition of several new features to the CRA's My Business Account suite of electronic services for businesses. Our government continues to deliver on its goal to meet the needs of business taxpayers for faster, secure and expanded online access to tax services. The new My Business Account services are a significant improvement in service delivery and help to reduce red tape.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also mention another initiative we have undertaken to improve the situation of the business community. We have updated the Canada-U.S. tax convention to facilitate cross-border investment and commerce. This newly signed agreement protocol represents a major milestone in that its provisions will help facilitate cross-border investment and commerce. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are modernizing our competition and investment policies to ensure they can attract the kinds of foreign investments that create jobs and opportunities for Canadians and let us compete against the best in the world.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para755517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most effective ways for our government to improve the quality of life of our citizens is to reduce taxes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss if I did not mention our government's historically and economically important decision to reduce the GST. A lower GST helps families and businesses. It lets individuals and parents keep their money to meet their needs. It also leaves more money in their pockets for them to use to stimulate our economy, which is good for all businesses.</div>

We hear about tax cuts for all Canadians, but we would rather have more services put into the underserviced areas of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Kenora riding is one of the ridings that has the least amount of services. We have difficulty right in our southern communities of Dryden, Kenora, Ignace, Pickle Lake and Sioux Lookout. They all have their challenges, especially in health care. In many communities such as the community of Dryden, for example, with 8,000 people, people cannot get dialysis. They have to drive and they have to drive a long way. Therefore, a stronger recognition of health care in the throne speech would have been a strong sign to all Canadians, especially in the riding of Kenora. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for major procedures and significant health care issues, people have to be sent out of their communities to Winnipeg or Thunder Bay. These are long distances, but in small communities we understand that. What we do not understand is a government that does not have a stronger commitment to health care and to making sure that service levels can be raised in all these ridings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak now about the northern 500 to 700 kilometres of my riding and I will talk about some of the health care issues for first nations that could have been addressed in the throne speech. Right now, many members of the House would not realize that of my 21 fly-in communities, five of them do not have proper health care to any degree. They have a nursing station or unit that basically runs five days a week. Due to weather, we average about three days a week when there is no nurse in the community at all. When these communities were very small, from 200 to 250 people, that was acceptable, but they have grown. Our populations in the north are increasing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about these communities: Poplar Hill, with Chief Elie Moose; Keewaywin, with Chief Joseph Meekis; Slate Falls, with Chief Glen Whiskeyjack; Muskrat Dam, with Chief Vernon Morris; and North Spirit Lake, with Chief Donald Campbell. All these chiefs fight constantly for health care. They would have taken it as a sign from the government in its throne speech if there were a commitment on a vision for Canada to make sure all Canadians can share some level of health care, but they have nothing. They have nurses who fly in, generally on Monday morning or at noon, and they leave Thursday night or Friday morning because of weather situations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is talk about providing tax cuts for Canadians and all these other issues, but let us talk about providing services for the residents in the areas of Canada that need it most. For these communities that do not have nurses from Friday morning to Sunday night, doctors' visits are very rare. Health care could have been addressed in a much broader agenda. I know that health care has slipped from number one on the radar screen for Canadians, but it is still number two, and it should have been identified in the throne speech.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these fly-in communities in the north, all residents have to travel for even the most minor of procedures. There are issues. Thanks to the former government, we do have technology in the north that could have been used to make sure some services were brought into these isolated places. In fact, with the technology in place in communities such as Sandy Lake and Big Trout Lake we could actually train nurses if there were some support. The residents accept this burden, but they do not understand why we are cutting taxes for some of the most wealthy people in Canada when services are not being provided for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the issue of residential schools, an issue inside the throne speech that I applauded. It is closure at last, but only maybe. The action initiated by the previous Liberal government led to this and delays after the election have brought us to this point. I am glad we are here at this point, but it is important that we get it done, that we start the healing process and move on with the apology, which is in this throne speech. We need this to make sure that we actually get this closed out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a couple of comments on the building Canada plan. The speech mentions very clearly the Windsor-Detroit corridor and the Atlantic and Pacific gateways, but it leaves out a large section of Canada, which I happen to live on, and that is the Trans-Canada Highway.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1645"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1635"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1640">(1640)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para755547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trans-Canada Highway should have gotten something. It is one of the largest transportation networks we have. Any product made in the Kenora riding has to go through one of those gateways to get to one of the southern border points, and it is good to look after those, but what about the Trans-Canada Highway? It travels for 300 miles through my riding, from east to west, and there are many points where it could close down and the network between the east and the west would be cut right off. There could have been some identification about making the Trans-Canada Highway a highway we could be proud of. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are far too many tragedies, as you are well aware, Mr. Speaker, as I know you travel on that section of highway. There are too many tragedies that could have been averted with some kind of infrastructure program which included the Trans-Canada Highway. If we cannot have pride in our national link, our national highway, what else can we do?</div>
    </p><a name="Para755549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My municipal experience allows me to know that we need a strong, non-partisan infrastructure program. This needs to be led by the municipalities. If the federal and provincial governments get involved and dictate priorities for the municipalities, it does not work. We need to make sure that the people who are using those streets are planning the projects, making sure that they are non-partisan, making sure that they are led by the municipalities so that the projects that actually need to be done are the ones that get done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On forestry, I will quote directly from the throne speech, where it states, “Key sectors, including forestry”. That is as much wording as forestry got.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Kenora, we have lost thousands of jobs. Entire towns have closed. The city of Kenora closed its mill, which not that many years ago had 900 employees. The site is being taken apart as we speak. That happened since the election of the Conservative government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech says that the government has taken action to support workers and that it is actually going to cut taxes for all Canadians. Many workers in the Kenora riding do not have jobs. One's tax burden is not too high when one is not working.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenora, Dryden and Ignace are all communities that have lost or have downsized plants. Plants in both Kenora and Ignace are totally closed at this point. The Dryden mill, which supported 1,100 inside workers sometime ago, is running with about 500 right now, and it is really a day to day operation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have workers who need support. They are going to get a tax cut, but they do not have jobs. That is the kind of challenge they face.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech contains a lot of great words but we need action. In communities like Red Lake, Pickle Lake and Bending Lake, with the diamonds that are in northern Ontario, there is a lot that can happen.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the words that are used in the throne speech, “a single window for major project approvals”, we need details. We need to get to the point where there is actually a program, so all parties in this House can take a look at it, see that it fits northern Ontario or any part of Canada and that it actually provides value on the ground, so we can make sure there are jobs for some of the forestry employees who have lost their jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to see support in the throne speech for the military. I happened to be very lucky this last summer. I spent a week out in Wainwright, Alberta. It was one of the largest exercises for training of reserve forces. There were more than 1,200 there. I want to point out very clearly that in Wainwright they are training combat soldiers. Our soldiers are combat soldiers. They are able to do many other duties, but they have the pride and determination of the best of Canada and they are the best in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the environment, northern Ontario will feel the effects of climate change as quickly as anywhere in Canada, including the far north. The 21 fine communities I mentioned earlier are all served by ice roads. We are suffering more and more as the climate continues to warm, and we cannot get the goods in to service these communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example, in a community like Keewaywin, when the ice road opens, gas drops in price from $2.75 a litre to about $1.25 a litre. We just celebrated Thanksgiving. If a truck can deliver a turkey, it is a reasonable price as it is in the south but turkeys were $85 to $95 up there on Thanksgiving weekend. The ice roads are extremely important.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one but Canada's aboriginals will feel the effects of climate change as painfully as they will. They have lived in that area for thousands of years. They understand the situation. They need to be sure that the Canadian government is going to look after them and treat climate change as a very serious issue that has to be dealt with.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared. We have heard the throne speech. There are facts in it that we would like to see examined, but we are going to wait for solid facts and solid legislation. We need solid commitments from the Conservative government. We have heard the fancy speeches and there is posturing and rhetoric going on here now. Let us get down to the legislation. Let us get down to serving Canadians. Let us see the meat and potatoes. Let us find out what we are talking about. Let us debate it for all Canadians.</div>

    </p><a name="Para755563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to start with his comments regarding health care. It sounds as though he may need to make a call to Queen's Park. Perhaps Howard Hampton, who also represents that riding, could help him out, or he could call Dalton McGuinty and talk to him about the shortages that are apparently in his riding. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that this government has provided record health care funding. We put in an escalator clause as well and provided funding for things like the Canada Health Infoway. Clearly, the problem in his riding did not start here in Ottawa.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did mention something about infrastructure. I am very proud of the $37 billion that this government has committed to infrastructure in the Building Canada fund.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the member very specifically, during the period of time that the former Liberal government was in power, Ontario only received--and it was not a big fund--about 22% of the total infrastructure spending that the government committed. We are actually about 40% of the population and about 42% of the GDP. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a government that is principled, that has brought in principled equalization formulas and principled transfers to the provinces. I am wondering, now that we are actually going to commit per capita funding to places like Ontario, if the member considers that fair and if that is something he supports. I know I sure do. If we are to have the proper infrastructure that we need in Ontario, specifically in northern Ontario, we need fairer funding. That is what this government has brought forward. I would like to know if the member supports that.</div>

He mentioned health care and that I should call Queen's Park. He should know, and I will inform the House, that 60% of my riding is first nations, dealt with by Health Canada, a federal responsibility, not a provincial responsibility. We are in the process of building a joint federal hospital in Sioux Lookout, which does not happen in a lot of places, but it is happening there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755569"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para755570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the infrastructure program, we can talk about the amounts of money that are put in, but what we really need is an honest infrastructure program that fits the needs of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The municipalities are suffering, as the hon. member well knows. They have issues and needs. Infrastructure programs have been taken over by partisan politics. That is not right. These projects should be approved on their merit and value to the communities, whether it is in Ontario or anywhere across Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot we could do if we have the details and we make sure that partisan politics does not play out, but let us make sure that it is of value to the communities. All the communities need our support.</div>

He suggested that he wanted more meat and potatoes in the Speech from the Throne. He suggested that perhaps that was a way to justify what would appear to be the Liberal decision to complain about the Speech from the Throne and then vote with the Conservatives, or for the Liberals to sit on their duffs and not take a position.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is about meat and potatoes. This is about food for ordinary Canadians. This is about sustenance. It is about economic security. If the member is not aware of it in his own region, which he should be, I want to remind him about the statistics that came out just last week from Statistics Canada. A new study showed that in fact the rich are getting richer in this country. After two decades of overall economic expansion, the top 5% of earners saw their average income leap from $133,000 to $178,000. During the same period, earners in the middle of the pack saw average incomes frozen at $25,000, with family incomes nudging up slightly from $42,000 to $43,000.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have tried to do in the House and around the Speech from the Throne is give living proof and testimony to the fact that the gap between the rich and the rest of society is growing. It has to be addressed by the government of the day. The support of the Liberals is needed once and for all on this issue. It is not good enough to simply repeat past mistakes, nor is it good enough to stand up in the House and propose an amendment to the Speech from the Throne that talks about tax--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals, when we were in government, paid unprecedented attention to the north. There was $120 million as a down payment for the northern strategy. There was $90 million for economic development. There were four different infrastructure programs. There were lots of exciting initiatives such as the beautiful facility for the Canada Winter Games. From the economic development money we helped out with advertising across Canada, which can still be seen on airplanes, advertising and marketing of the north. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was excited about the many infrastructure programs such as the recreation centres in Mayo and Marsh Lake. Recently a footbridge was opened at Carcross. With the assistance of that money, a very important road is being built which will go from my area near Copper Ridge and Arkell and Granger down to the highway, which will provide an alternate exit. This initiative has been talked about for years.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the new Conservative government came in, some of the attention to the north was dropped. There was no mention of the northern strategy for a long time. Northerners convinced the Conservative government that it was very important, and I am excited to see the northern strategy framework finally coming back. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755586"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Conservatives did at first was make two promises to northerners, one for icebreakers and the other for a northern port. As everyone knows, the government broke the first of those promises, taking away the tens of millions of dollars that had been promised. We went through two budgets and a throne speech without any mention of the port, so we kept pushing and the government finally mentioned it. Many people decried the lack of consultation on that port and the best location for it. I do hope that port actually comes to fruition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to congratulate the government for mentioning housing for first nations and Inuit people in the throne speech. I have talked about this issue a number of times. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked about a world class Arctic research station, and I am always supportive of that. Fifteen years ago I coined a phrase that we needed more research in the north, for the north and by the north, that we needed more researchers in the north. I decried the lack of scientific infrastructure in the north last summer when I visited Sweden with Arctic parliamentarians and saw how much other countries had. This summer in my article on sovereignty in <i>The Hill Times</i> I mentioned that one of the ways to advance sovereignty is by doing more science with both the infrastructure and operation and maintenance in the north. I am delighted to see the proposal for a world class Arctic research station. We have been working for a long time for a northern research station in Whitehorse that would look at climate change at a time when it is so important for the north. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was happy to see seabed mapping mentioned in the throne speech. Unfortunately, there were not a lot of details. Once again, I am not sure if this is like a number of other items that are in the throne speech that are already being done either by the Conservative government or other governments and are just being reannounced. Seabed mapping was put in place a long time ago by the Liberals. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hoping that mention of this means that the Conservatives will accelerate the schedule. The schedule is so tight right now that it is going to end right on the last day. We cannot afford to lose part of Canada if the mapping is slowed down by mechanical failures or the climate. Hopefully this means that the government has accelerated the schedule and the mapping is being done right now.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was astonished to see the government put the slush boat scandal into the throne speech. That took money away from northerners by replacing icebreakers with patrol boats that can go through one metre of ice when many people know that the ice can be as much as 18 metres thick, including old ice in that area. For a good portion of the year those patrol boats will not be able to patrol the north.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was delighted that tourism was mentioned in the throne speech but, like a number of other items, there were no details. The jury will need to remain out on that issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that during the Conservatives' term they have made some tremendous cuts to tourism. Cuts were made to the tourism marketing funds that were available, taking away the GST rebate, cuts to museums and students. Some of those programs have been reinstated but they still have not reinstated all the GST rebate, for instance, for individuals. That is more important for my riding than perhaps any riding because it is the largest private sector employer. I am glad that it is there but we will see what it means.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On infrastructure, I will follow up on what my colleague said and what I said earlier today, which is that it is good that infrastructure is there. I am speaking on behalf of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, the Association of Yukon Communities, the Nunavut Association of Municipalities, the Northwest Territories Association of Communities and all municipalities in Canada when I say that the municipalities must get their fair share and a percentage of the funding they had under the four Liberal infrastructure programs which helped them so much.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone know, we have a skills shortage in the country. I heard about this at length at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce meeting last week. I am delighted that there was money in the budget or discussion in the budget of increasing funds for aboriginal skills training so they can take advantage of opportunities in the north. This is one way of solving the skills shortage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would liked to have seen additional emphasis on other ways of solving that problem as well related to immigration, older workers, improving the integration of immigrants into the workforce, integrating disabled people into the workforce and so forth.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Larry Bagnell:</b> I know the member enjoyed that part but I need to talk about the failings and, unfortunately, there are some very substantial failings. I am talking about the big four items of major importance to Canadians. It is almost inconceivable that so many major issues affecting Canada were not addressed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is child care. When the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> visited my riding, a demonstration was held concerning the fact that the government had cancelled the Liberal child care program. Some media said that the demonstration was the biggest demonstration ever against the Prime Minister. I do not necessarily agree but it was certainly a strong sentiment that Canadians would like a national child care program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, of course, was taking $5 billion away from our aboriginal people in the Kelowna accord and not replacing it. This is not debatable. Everyone knows what a shame that is, especially when the deal was with the honour of the Crown and not a particular party, but with Canada and the first nations people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change is a huge issue for the north. More than anywhere else, the effects take place in the north. We certainly need adaptation for the damage that climate change is causing to our infrastructure and to our wildlife. We need to adapt to these things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the local environmental organizations explained that over 100 of our programs had been cut, and some of them have been put back but certainly not with as much money or not with as good conditions, such as the EnerGuide program, then it is certainly bad for the people of the north. As I said, it affects them more than anyone else. There is a lack of attention to these greenhouse gases and the investments that we are making in renewable energies, in wind power, in solar power, in large final emitters, in car emissions, in clean coal and in carbon sequestration. Those are areas in which it is important for the government to keep investing. </div>

He started off talking about all the great things in the throne speech. I think that is echoed in Canada. Canadians have picked up on the fact that the throne speech is a very forward looking document. It was a clear statement of where Canada wants to go. It wants to take its place on the world stage. It also wants to grow as a country and provide a great place for Canadians to live. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talked about Arctic sovereignty. He supported our initiatives there. He talked about tourism. He talked about infrastructure and supported that. He liked the aboriginal skills training. He liked the water strategy. He also liked the citizenship for Aung San Suu Kyi. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then got into these big four but he actually never got around to talking about them because, quite frankly, I suspect that he actually really liked the throne speech. Perhaps he should be on this side of the House rather than that side.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the plaudits that he gave our throne speech and all the positive comments he made about the throne speech, he and his leader, the Leader of the Liberal Party, have stated that they will sit on their duffs and not even vote. They will not represent their constituents and Canadians across the country and take a position on the throne speech. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything the member said seems to indicate that he liked our throne speech, subject to what he calls the big four, which he did not get into in great detail.

    </p><a name="Para755614"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to quickly summarize the things that were missing from the throne speech is medical, which is astounding to the medical community; the implementation of land claims in the north; search and rescue in the north; literacy; speeding up the aboriginal broadcasting funding; ensuring that rural voters without an address can have a vote; and women. We do not want constraints on federal spending powers which are very important for the north. It has nothing for rural health care related to centres of excellence; nothing for competitiveness and productivity; nothing for O &amp; M for rural museums; nothing to speed up border crossings; nothing to help with immigration and the line-ups of refugees; no details on what will happen to the Youth Criminal Justice Act; and no details on the protection of human rights under the anti-terrorism legislation. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also see no improvement in the northern allowance, which we have asked for so many times and which has not increased in 20 years.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as Canadian unity has fed the fire of my patriotism since childhood, the people of Ottawa—Orléans have witnessed that I am not a one-trick pony. So, to balance my passion for matters that constitute the cultural makeup of our country, I am focused tirelessly on turning the National Research Council into a pole of attraction for economic development in east end Ottawa. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to this came from my friends Bob MacQuarrie and Ken Steele, when 30 years ago they advocated the establishment of a technology transfer centre. In the past 21 months I have been very active in reviving that dream. This goal is realistic and this project can be the most significant element in the transformation of Orléans from a bedroom community to a self-sustaining community where, in addition to sleeping, people work, shop and play.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people feed expectations and make empty promises about moving federal jobs to Orléans from elsewhere. That is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. It creates no wealth, except for selected speculators. Economic development is not just a matter of serving the interests of land speculators. It must be based on a web of compatible assets, such as the intellectual property that lies dormant at NRC. Just as Bell Northern Research was a source of spinoffs for economic development in Nepean and Kanata, the NRC must be for North Gloucester and Orléans.</div>

    </p><a name="Para755672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its theme, its vision and strong leadership sums up this government's commitment to continually aspire to further growth and a higher quality of life. We intend to build upon a proud legacy of peace and prosperity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is starting from a position of strength. Our economic fundamentals are the strongest they have been in a generation. We are experiencing the second largest period of economic expansion in Canadian history. Business investment is expanding for the fifth consecutive year. Core inflation has remained within our set range of 1% to 3%. Our unemployment rate is the lowest in 33 years, with more Canadians working today than ever before. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is one of the few countries in the world with a sound public pension plan. Canada is also an emerging energy superpower. We have the second largest established petroleum reserves on the planet. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal, provincial and territorial governments are all in surplus, and we are on the best fiscal footing of any country in the G-7. In fact, we are the only member of the G-7 with both an ongoing budget surplus and a falling debt burden.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's economy is ranked second among the group of seven nations. Canada is on solid financial footing, but we are mindful of the various challenges and opportunities that confront us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I will highlight some of the key economic initiatives this government is pursuing, particularly those that affect business and Canada's competitiveness on the world stage, in particular, our long term economic plan, “Advantage Canada”, a plan designed to ensure that Canada has a modern infrastructure, an innovative and entrepreneurial business environment and a tax system that rewards hard work, all based on the foundation of sound fiscal management.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, our government is committed to reduce the federal paper burden on business by 20% by November of 2008. We are modernizing our competition and investment policies to ensure they work better and attract even more foreign investment to create jobs and opportunities for Canadians and let us compete against the best in the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the issue of tax relief. The government believes that Canadian individuals, businesses and families still pay too much tax. Our tax system must reward hard work, encourage investment in job creation and help Canadian businesses compete on the world stage. We are providing tax relief in every way a government collects taxes: consumption taxes, business taxes, excise taxes and, yes, personal taxes, more than $41 billion in tax relief over three years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know tax competitiveness is critical to our economic success. That is why we are establishing a tax advantage for the benefit of Canadian entrepreneurs. Our government will bring forward a long term plan of broad base tax relief for individuals, businesses and families, including following through on our commitment to a further cut to the GST.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne speech also highlights our commitment to support a wide range of economic activity across the country. For example, our government will stand up for Canada's traditional industries, fishery, forestry, manufacturing and tourism. Our government is taking firm action to support workers as these industries adjust to global conditions, and we will continue to do so.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar over the past few years, and other challenges, have made it difficult for traditional industries to cope. We have responded to these needs in a host of ways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Government of Canada has provided $400 million over two years to strengthen the long term competitiveness of the forestry sector, to combat the pine beetle infestation and support worker adjustment to ensure that those who depend on forestry can look to a future with confidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also allowed manufacturing and processing businesses to write off their capital investments in machinery and equipment using a special temporary, two year, 50% straight-line, write-down rate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also say a few words about renewing Canada's infrastructure. Through our building Canada initiative, we are making the largest single federal investment in public infrastructure. When combined with funding under previous initiatives, our government is committing about $37 billion over seven years for roads, bridges, water systems, public transit and international gateways, infrastructure that Canadians want and that our country needs.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725">(1725)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para755686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern infrastructure supports economic growth and productivity, improves Canada's competitiveness and facilitates the movement of people and goods.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building Canada plan addresses the issue of the comprehensive program to support our long term growth. We will invest in infrastructure that supports a stronger economy, a cleaner environment and more prosperous, safer communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to another key driver of Canada's economic engine. Our mining and resource sectors present extraordinary opportunities across Canada and our government will help seize these opportunities by providing a single window for major program approvals. Our government is investing $150 million in a new major projects management office to increase the capacity for the approval of mining and energy projects within those federal departments. This office will ensure that regulatory reviews are carried out with greater efficiency and transparency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This streamlined approach will reduce red tape and improve the overall competitiveness of Canada's resource industries. The government's commitment to provide effective economic leadership will also address the federal government's responsibility for strengthening Canada's economic union.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the globalization of markets, Canada still has a long way to go to establish free trade among our provinces. It is simply unacceptable that there are fewer internal barriers to trade and mobility in the economic union than there are in Canada. This hurts our competitive position but more important, it is just not the way a country should work. Our government will consider how to use the federal trade and commerce power to make our economic union work better for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada's prosperity and quality of life depend on our success as a trading country. We have exported goods and services, accounting for more than 36% of the GDP in 2006. More than $1.9 billion in trade crosses the Canada-U.S. border each day. To ensure efficient transport of goods—</div>

    </p><a name="Para755698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I introduced the bill because it would eliminate a grave injustice in Canada's social security system, an injustice presently causing great harm to seniors across Canada and to the families and communities to which they belong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians believe that the elimination of poverty, especially among those most vulnerable in our society, should be the top concern of the Government of Canada.

    </p><a name="Para755700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my sincere hope we will set aside partisan concerns and work together to improve the well-being of a great many seniors, families and communities all across Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my remarks today I have three goals. First, I will correct a common misconception about old age security. Then I will identify and clarify the grave injustice that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> would eliminate. Finally, I will explain why the bill warrants the support of every member of the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since first tabling Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A>, I have received correspondence from a number of Canadians living throughout the country. Most Canadians who take the time to write do so in order to express their support for the bill. However, there are those who write to express their opposition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing the correspondence, it has become clear to me that they share in common a misconception about the true nature and the intent of the old age security. Because members of the House may also share this misconception, I would very much like to identify and correct it here and now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The misconception is this. Some Canadians think old age security was introduced by the Government of Canada as a kind of reward to seniors for their lifetime contribution to Canadian society, to the economy and to their communities. Nothing could be further from the truth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Old Age Security Act was tabled in the House of Commons in 1951. A careful review of the debate at the time indicates that it was introduced principally as a matter of social justice and was motivated by a genuine concern for the needs and welfare of Canadian senior citizens, whatever their contribution may or may not have been to society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, since 1951, successive Canadian governments, on behalf of all Canadians, have made a number of important changes to old age security, including the introduction of the guaranteed income supplement, inflation protection and a definition of the word “spouse” that recognizes and includes common law partners.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Human Resources Development Canada's online history of Canada's public pension system, these changes were motivated by the desire of all Canadians to help those persons and groups most vulnerable to poverty, including women, low income workers and disabled persons. In other words, old age security is not a reward for service rendered. Rather it is motivated by a sense of justice and a recognition that no Canadian, especially seniors, should live in poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of social justice, which motivated old age security, is also reflected in the way the Government of Canada funds the scheme. Unlike the Canada and Quebec pension plans, which are funded by contributions from each person over his or her working life, old age security is presently funded from general tax revenues. This means old age security is funded from the taxes of every person living and working in Canada right now, not 10, not 15, not 20 years ago, regardless of their country of birth.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735">(1735)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para755709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, old age security income is itself subject to tax, so ultimately only those Canadian seniors most in need receive any old age security income. We fund old age security in this manner because Canadians believe we all have a duty to earmark some of our earnings each year to eliminate poverty among our seniors, whether we have lived here six weeks, six months, six years or 60 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say it again so there is no misunderstanding. Old age security is not intended to reward seniors for services rendered; rather, it is intended to ensure Canadian seniors will not live in poverty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having now clarified and corrected an important misconception about old age security, I will now identify and clarify the great injustice Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2326957,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2326957&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> is intended to address and remedy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Old Age Security Act requires a person to reside in Canada for 10 years before he or she is entitled to receive old age security. Although the old age security program is intended to act as the cornerstone of Canada's retirement income system, this residency requirement excludes many seniors from its benefits. Indeed, because of a 10 year residency requirement, it is not uncommon for a Canadian senior citizen to go entirely without the benefits of old age security for many years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, the residency requirement creates two different classes of senior citizens: those who qualify for old age security at 65 and those who do not because they have not lived in Canada for 10 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the residency requirement also creates two different classes of families and communities within Canada. There are those families and communities whose seniors receive the benefits and peace of mind of old age security at age 65, and there are those families and communities that do not and as a result are required to take on a burden of responsibility that other families in Canada are not also expected to bear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The net result is that the 10 year residency requirement for old age security treats a whole group of Canadians as second class citizens. This, as I am sure we can all agree, is unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755716"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be noted that the 10 year residency requirement also adds insult to injury by targeting, inadvertently, I think, some of the most economically vulnerable seniors in Canada. As some members of this House know, in some cases seniors can circumvent the 10 year requirement and qualify for old age security if they emigrate from countries that have signed reciprocal social security agreements with the Government of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755717"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These agreements allow for the coordination of the two countries' social security programs. They make the benefits portable between the two countries. They normally exist because both countries provide social security plans with similar benefits. As a result, in many cases the very reason no reciprocal agreement exists between Canada and a particular country is that the other country is unwilling or unable to provide comparable social security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755718"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that those persons who may need old age security the most, because they emigrated from countries with little or no social security, must go without old age security here in Canada even after they have become Canadian citizens. I am sure we can agree that this as well is unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarize the injustice this is intended to address, there is the fact that the 10 year residency requirement for old age security treats a great many Canadians as second class citizens and denies benefits to those seniors most in need of assistance. If we also recall that poverty is epidemic among our seniors, and especially among women and new Canadians, there is only one sensible and decent conclusion to be drawn: the 10 year residency requirement is unjust and unacceptable and must be changed. That is exactly what this bill aims to do. Canadian citizenship is certainly sufficient to entitle a person to old age security. It takes three years to apply for old age security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to conclude my remarks today by explaining why this bill deserves the support of each and every member of the House.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740">(1740)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para755721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, Bill C-362 deserves the support of every member of the House as a simple matter of decency. However people may choose to make sense of the notion of decency, whether they prefer to talk of a principle of fairness, or equality of opportunity, or the equal dignity of all persons, the underlying sentiment remains the same: a person should not be made worse off than others arbitrarily.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unquestionably, the 10 year residency requirement arbitrarily prevents a great many senior citizens from receiving old age security benefits. This creates undue and unjust hardship for them, their families and their communities. There is no good reason that justifies the imposition of this harm on so many Canadians. The only truly decent thing to do is reduce this residency requirement to three years, as my bill proposes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> also deserves the support of every member of the House because of the immeasurable contribution made by seniors across Canada to our families, our communities and our country each and every day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755724"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors, thanks to their lifetime of experience, provide immeasurable support and guidance to us all. Not only do seniors help us to remember and understand our history, our values, and our identity, they very often help alleviate the very real pressures of raising a family in today's fast paced society. There is, for example, no better child care than that provided by a loving grandparent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755725"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, seniors will not be in any position to offer us guidance, wisdom and support if they themselves are trapped in abject poverty. So by securing the economic well-being of all seniors, ultimately we do a service to all Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> also deserves the support of every member of the House because in supporting this bill we formally recognize that all Canadian seniors deserve to live their entire lives with a sense of dignity and self-respect. No person, and certainly no member of the House, would ever want to face a choice between abject poverty and a life of absolute dependence on family and friends. By guaranteeing a certain basic level of support for all Canadian seniors, we guarantee a lifetime of dignity and self-respect for all Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> deserves the support of every member of the House because Canadians all across the country want us to address the very real injustice faced by so many seniors and their families and communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the whole, Canadians are a decent people. Without exception, whenever possible we strive to do the right thing and to right wrongs whenever we encounter them. To even the most casual observer, the injustice of an arbitrary 10 year residency requirement is a wrong that needs to be corrected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in closing, I want to remind members of the House that Canada has been, remains and always will be a country of immigrants. Even today, Canada has one of the highest per capita rates of immigration in the world, with roughly 17% of our population foreign born and another 30% descended from earlier generations of non-British or non-French immigrants. It should also not be forgotten that the British and the French were themselves immigrants at one time. Moreover, research indicates that within the next 20 years immigration will account for all our net population and labour force growth in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view and the view of a great many Canadians, every single one of our recent immigrants and future citizens deserves a social security net that encompasses a person's entire life. While it is certainly tempting to say that we need to provide this kind of social security as a necessary exercise in marketing, that is, we need to do it if Canada wants to attract and retain the best and brightest immigrants, I think there is a deeper and much more meaningful motivation. We owe it to all Canadians as a matter of decency, the kind of heartfelt decency that motivates and unites every person in this great and caring country of ours.</div>

    </p><a name="Para755753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians can be proud of our country's retirement income system. Simply put, it is recognized as one of the best in the world and is emulated by countries looking to set an effective long term public pension system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old age security program, along with the Canada pension plan, provides all Canadians with a solid foundation upon which to build their retirement income. Together, Canada's public pensions deliver about $54 billion in benefits to Canadians each year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> proposes reducing the minimum residence requirement for old age security benefits from ten to three years. However, I will respectfully disagree with the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78449,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78449&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Brampton West</A> on the premise of this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a public policy perspective, the old age security program is fair and sound. It is the first tier of Canada's retirement income system, serving over four million Canadian seniors every year. The old age security pension is designed as a measure of income security for seniors. It recognizes their valuable contributions to Canadian society, our economy and their community over a lifetime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike pension plans in most countries, Canada offers, as part of its public pension system, a tier that is fully funded by general tax revenues instead of contributions. Most countries have pension schemes that require years of contributions to qualify for benefits. For example, Japan's seniors must contribute for 25 years to be eligible for a pension. From this standpoint, we can see that Canada's pension plan is exceptionally generous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Canada, there are none of the restrictions about citizenship or nationality often found in other countries. To gain the right to a lifelong public pension, we ask only that seniors make a reasonable contribution of 10 years to Canadian society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of governments have examined the current old age security residence requirement since it was established in 1977 and they have kept it intact.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, during the last parliament, the Liberal Party voted against the Bloc amendments that could institute these very changes. So, for the Liberals it only became an issue of fairness or respect for new Canadians when this government came to power and they no longer had to worry about the consequences of their actions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the 10-year residence requirement is sound and it is reasonable. It makes no distinction between immigrants who have just arrived in Canada or Canadians who are returning to Canada after living abroad.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current rules, a person must live in Canada, after reaching the age of 18, for a total of 40 years to receive a full pension. A person must live in Canada for a minimum of 10 years to receive a partial pension.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many seniors who qualify for old age security and who have low incomes also receive the guaranteed income supplement, GIS, designed to help Canada's poorest seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755764"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, a 10-year rule is a reasonable compromise. It strikes a good balance between the individual's contribution to Canadian society and his or her right to receive a lifelong public pension. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755765"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy is the result of a longstanding and dynamic conversation with Canadians. Since 1977, the residence requirement for old age security has served countless new Canadians. The program has been there for generations of immigrants who built a new life for themselves and their children in Canada, and this government will ensure it remains that way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755766"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these immigrants come from countries that have signed social security agreements with us, and on the world stage Canada is a leader among countries that have signed social security agreements. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755767"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, 50 agreements have been signed between Canada and foreign countries. Because of these reciprocal agreements, many newcomers to Canada are able to meet the 10-year residence requirement to receive the old age security pension by using years of residence or contribution in both countries. This means that these seniors may be able to receive benefits from both Canada and their country of origin.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755">(1755)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para755768"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a nutshell, it means that people who have lived or worked abroad can meet the 10-year residence rule by adding these periods to their Canadian residence. These agreements recognize the contributions people have made in their previous country of residence and allow them to qualify for benefits to which they might not otherwise be entitled.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755769"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is continuing to negotiate agreements with countries that share comparable pension systems so that we can improve the access of our growing immigrant communities to pension benefits.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755770"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts have also considered the residency issue that the bill raises. In two landmark cases they upheld the issue of fairness of our residence provisions for the old age security pension.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these legal challenges made it all the way to the Federal Court of Appeal. The 2003 ruling confirmed what most Canadians knew. The 10-year residence rule does not in any way discriminate against Canadians on the grounds of national or ethnic origin as my hon. colleague across the aisle would like us to believe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it interesting that it was the former Liberal government that fought this case in court and yet today the Liberals are claiming the opposite. Today it has become an issue of discrimination and hypocrisy abounds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no secret that seniors constitute the fastest growing segment of Canada's population. With baby boomers poised to retire in record numbers, our pension costs will skyrocket in years to come. In the next 25 years nearly one in four Canadians will be a senior. With our rapidly aging population, relaxing the residence rule for old age security could have significant fiscal implications to Canada and the public pension program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is estimated that reducing the 10-year rule for old age security to three years would cost Canadians over $700 million in combined old age security and GIS benefits in the first few years alone. In the long run these costs will surely rise exponentially.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755775"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has a responsibility to ensure that this program remains for the generation of Canadians to come, including the children and the grandchildren of new Canadians, and that is just what we plan on doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755776"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the previous government, which largely ignored seniors issues during the last 13 years in power, this government has taken swift and decisive action on the seniors file. For example, within months of being elected this government improved: seniors' well-being through increased federal representation, including significant investments in programing as well as putting in place real tax relief. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755777"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have created a Secretary of State for Seniors. We have established a National Seniors Council to advise the government on issues of importance to older Canadians. We have committed an additional $10 million per year to the new horizons for seniors program to encourage seniors to continue their valuable contributions to their communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755778"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After years of being ignored by the Liberals, seniors, both new to this country and those who have been here their entire lives, can rest assured that Canada's new government is listening to them and delivering results.</div>

    </p><a name="Para755780"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> would reduce from 10 years to three years the residency requirement for entitlement to a partial monthly old age security pension.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is a very simple one, so I do not understand why the Conservative Party is against it. How could they possibly oppose it? The current 10-year requirement is unfair to recent immigrants who are seniors, because they have limited access to old age security benefits. The only amendment this bill calls for is to change all instances of “ten years” in the act to “three years”. The definition of “specially qualified individual”, which indicates the number of years of residency required for an individual to be entitled to benefits, would be amended to read “three years”. When the Conservative Party says that the government has been very generous toward seniors, I have to wonder what it is talking about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear to the Bloc Québécois that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> would give recent immigrants who are seniors easier access to the old age security program. Quality of life for seniors often depends on the care they receive. Quality of life also depends on their income, and recent immigrants are entitled to their dignity too. The Conservative Party does not seem to recognize that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> introduces amendments to the Old Age Security Act that do not encroach on Quebec's jurisdiction. That is why the Bloc Québécois supports the principle underlying this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to remind the members about what the Bloc Québécois has done for seniors over the past years. In May I began travelling around Quebec, and I realized that seniors are vulnerable, poor and getting poorer. Over the past few years, we, the Bloc Québécois, have found that seniors, who are among the poorest members of our society, have always borne the brunt of the federal government's cuts to transfer payments. Quality of life for seniors has been hit hard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why the Bloc Québécois has long been highly critical of the inconsistencies in the federal guaranteed income supplement program, which provides additional revenue for older people on limited incomes. If we wanted to do them justice, we would have to increase the guaranteed income supplement today by $106 a month just to reach the low income threshold. </div>

The Bloc Québécois wanted to see full retroactivity, but that was not included in Bill C-36. It provided only 11 months of retroactivity. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"></A></div>

    </p><a name="Para755788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also a proposal to make common amendments to the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act. These provisions dealt with electronic services, the charging of interest, and information sharing. There was still one controversial issue surrounding accessibility, and the Bloc Québécois opposed the expansion of the limits on new Canadian citizens who had immigrated. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Bloc’s view—and apparently now in the view of the Liberal Party as well—there cannot be different classes of Canadian citizens, regardless of how they arrived. All Canadian citizens should be entitled to the guaranteed income supplement. Some sections of the legislation were problematic because they created different classes of citizens—for example, a person who has a sponsorship agreement still in effect under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These sections excluded new Canadian citizens who were still being sponsored. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois wanted the committee to amend the bill so as not to let the obligations incumbent upon sponsors under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act limit the eligibility of new citizens for old age security.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805">(1805)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para755791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Bloc’s view, when a person becomes a Canadian citizen, his sponsorship agreement should automatically be terminated. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sponsor’s obligations generally take effect as soon as the person being sponsored obtains permanent resident status and conclude at the end of the sponsorship period. This can be very long in some cases—as many as 10 years—and the problem needed fixing. Under the bill, the agreement could not be terminated, even through the obtaining of Canadian citizenship. It could not be terminated by separation, divorce, or moving to another province. It remained in effect even if the sponsor’s financial situation took a turn for the worse. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should point out that the Liberal Party voted against this Bloc proposal last February. Today we are dealing with a matter similar to the debate on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2521443,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2521443&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-36</A>, which received royal assent last May. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> does not deal with new sponsored arrivals but with other categories of new arrivals who are not sponsored. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments are minor. It is impossible to be against them, but we need to go much further.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of globalization and the fact that we live in a global environment, the Bloc Québécois thinks that Canada must be flexible about citizenship and the services offered to newcomers. Given the increase in exchanges between countries, there should be mechanisms in place to allow for greater human mobility, in addition to the measures already in place to help the disadvantaged, including seniors, of course.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois' position is as follows. We are aware that BIll <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073269,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073269&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-362</A> will make it easier for recent immigrants who are seniors to access old age security benefits. As I said earlier, since seniors' quality of life often depends on the care they can receive, this quality of life is dictated by their income. Newcomers also have a right to dignity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, the Bloc Québécois is in favour of the principle of this bill. Nonetheless, I want to point out that there is still a lot of work to do. It is deplorable that in all these years the Liberal and Conservative governments have abandoned, muzzled and ignored seniors, the most vulnerable people in our society. The Liberals were the first to close their eyes to this category of disadvantaged people, choosing instead to allow capital to be sheltered in tax havens, to lower the debt and cut funding from Quebec and the provinces. Then the Conservatives chose to cut taxes instead of providing immediate support to the workers who helped build today's society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the Bloc Québécois is here to ensure that our seniors have a voice in the government. Thanks to our many appearances in the House, in committee and in the media, the Bloc Québécois has managed to keep the attention on a group of people who have been dropped from the government's priorities.

    </p><a name="Para755801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the reasons for us to give this positive consideration are many but I will use the reasons that I see within my own community to talk about this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person becomes a citizen in this country it means something. I go to citizenship swearing-ins on a regular basis and I see the great pride and excitement on the faces of people who are becoming citizens. Whether they are 12 or 60 years old, it means something in their hearts and souls when they become Canadian citizens. They are proud and they want to contribute to their communities for what they see as a privilege and an honour of becoming Canadian citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that it means is that there is an equality of access to the services and supports that are available to all citizens in our country. That is what citizenship means or that is part of what comes with the privileges of being a citizen, but there are responsibilities as well. I want to talk about both of those things today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the privileges that people hope for when they become citizens is that they can live very differently, or maybe in the same way as in their country of birth, but for many people they want to live a life filled with dignity, self-respect and pride. In order for that to happen, there needs to be a way for dignity and self-respect to take place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The granting of OAS to citizens who have been here three years as opposed to the current ten years is a compromise from when this whole debate began but it is something that we should consider strongly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that someone could come to this country and perhaps could become a citizen two years later. They could work in the workforce for a few years, usually not able to contribute to anything, and then become 65, a senior or an elder, and then could be told that they must wait another seven years. It may not matter that they are a citizen, that they were in the workforce or that they paid taxes while in the workforce. It would not matter that their sons and daughters were paying taxes. They would not be able to receive OAS for 10 years. I do not know how that reinforces dignity, respect or pride.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone earlier said that it was about dignity and self-respect when one is an elder. For the elders I talk to, pride is certainly equal if not more important because many of the seniors in their countries of origin had the place of respect and honour in their families. They then come to a country where they have no money, are usually totally dependent on someone else and there's no other way for them to have income so they can ride a bus, get to the park and do those things that seniors might want to do together. The resources may be available for some but for others they may not. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810">(1810)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para755808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The denying of OAS to seniors based on a 10 year residency is unreasonable and goes against all those things that we believe should be accessible to a citizen, which is equality and access to supports.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immigrants in the community in which I live take very seriously the responsibility part of citizenship. In no way do they take citizenship for granted. In point of fact, in my community of Surrey North and in the city of Surrey, immigrants do many things that other people would actually need to be paid to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give some examples to the House that may be illustrative. The seniors I know serve free food at lunchtime to anyone who wishes to come to their temple or their place of worship and receive it. The person does not have to be of that country of origin. They can be anyone who needs food at lunchtime and they serve that food. If they did not do that, people might go without.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the elders in the community are very active in organizing blood donor clinics. We all know that with every holiday there is an urgent appeal on the radio or in the newspaper saying that blood is needed with the a holiday weekend coming up. I do not think many of us in this House would not know someone who has benefited from a blood transfusion. The elders are incredibly active in organizing those blood donor clinics, getting people to them, working in partnership with the Red Cross to ensure they happen, perhaps providing the venue, providing all the external support that might be needed and getting the word out throughout the entire community that this is happening. The turnout is tremendous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood does not only go to immigrants. It goes to everyone. It saves everyone's life. It is not labelled, “Collected by immigrants, to be used by immigrants”. Everyone benefits from that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many elders in my community provide very needed translation services. These are translation services that otherwise would probably need to be paid for, for those people who are just learning their additional language. The phrase, “English as a second language” is a very North American phrase because for most people who come from other countries they already speak two or three languages and this might be their third, fourth or fifth language. The elders provide translation services for hospitals, social services agencies and sometimes for government agencies that otherwise would not be available. They are contributing. They feel that responsibility to contribute, not just the privilege of being a citizen but the responsibility of giving back.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time there is an event in my community, immigrants from all countries participate in very significant ways.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, the sons and daughters or other immigrants who have come to Surrey are perhaps the biggest economic driver in Surrey. There are probably more new businesses started by immigrants in Surrey. It is an enormous economic driver. It produces tax revenue that everyone benefits from. Why should the elders, who have taken out citizenship because they are proud of it and are contributing back, not be able to benefit from that?</div>
    </p><a name="Para755816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard someone earlier say that people contribute to pensions. This is not a pension. If it were a case of people contributing to a pension we would not have so many women, Caucasian women included, living in poverty. They have no pension plan because they did not work outside the home for wages. I am sorry, that is a side issue that I could not resist.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, these people take their privileges of citizenship seriously, but they also take the responsibility seriously. They are citizens and they should have access to the OAS in the three years, as recommended by this bill.</div>

The present requirement is that seniors from certain countries live here for 10 years before they are eligible for even partial payments, which will help to keep them out of poverty. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years is a long time. We require only three years for someone to become a full citizen of the country. Why then do we make some seniors suffer through another seven more years of hardship while they wait to be eligible for old age security? To make matters even worse, this long time does not even apply fairly for all Canadian seniors. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not fit with our fundamental Canadian values and belief in equality for all our citizens. It makes things harder for seniors who come from poorer countries, who do not have social security and who get no protection from poverty here as well. They have come to our country to get better lives and help build a better and stronger Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad that these seniors, the ones who are the most vulnerable to poverty, are the ones who suffer the most from the 10 year wait. This inequality between the seniors in our country is unjust and we must work together to level the playing field and protect not just some of our seniors from poverty, but all seniors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help but feel frustrated when members from the Conservative Party say that only those who have been here 10 years deserve security, that only those who have been here 10 years have done anything worthwhile for our country. This is a gross misunderstanding of the valuable role our parents and grandparents play in today's Canadian society.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78702,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78702&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Surrey North</A> mentioned many reasons for both parents and grandparents to be productive. These seniors are productive members of our great society, and I cannot find a better example than my own parents.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family is not alone in this.

    </p><a name="Para755827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government wants it both ways.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our seniors cannot be productive if they have to worry about how they will eat each day.

    </p><a name="Para755830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had several meetings with seniors in my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78872,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78872&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Newton—North Delta</A>, in Surrey and the Delta area, groups like the Kennedy House Seniors' Centre. They have told me first-hand about how hard it is for our elderly citizens to survive from day to day. This has also come up at monthly meetings and lunches that I have hosted for some of the seniors in my riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My community is telling me that we need to do more to help keep our parents and grandparents out of poverty. It is not right that the Conservative government finishes each year with huge surpluses and does nothing to help those seniors who suffer and need the most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the first time the Conservative government has failed our seniors. It began when the Conservative <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> flip-flopped on income trusts and ruined the retirement savings of thousands of seniors across the country. It got worse when the Conservative government raised taxes for the lowest income bracket in its first budget. Despite a $13 billion surplus, the Conservative <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> decided to pay for the GST cut and military spending by targeting the most vulnerable elderly in our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the minority Conservative government is failing us again by refusing to help the hundreds of thousands of seniors, many of whom have lived in the country for years, to get the old age security benefits they deserve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not acceptable in a progressive society like Canada. I plead with the members opposite to see reason and join with my colleague from Brampton West in taking real steps to protect our seniors from the hardship of poverty. Members should not let their credibility be further ruined by once again choosing partisanship over principles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Liberal Party that established the old age security in 1952, the Canada pension plan in 1966 and the guaranteed income supplement in 1967. We brought the Canada pension plan back on a strong financial footing in 1998 for the next 50 years. In 2005 we pumped $2.7 billion into the guaranteed income supplement to help our low income elderly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put our money where our mouth is and have stood up for Canada's most vulnerable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If three years is enough time to contribute enough to our country to earn citizenship, then three years should be enough to earn the right not to fear living out our golden years in poverty. We cannot continue with a system that has some seniors receiving financial security to stay out of poverty within a year of entering our country and the others having to wait 10 years, based on the country from where they came.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all members of the House of Commons to support the bill. The time has come to put aside our partisanship and work together on this issue so Canadian seniors will not ever live in poverty.</div>

    </p><a name="Para755844"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pointed out and read from an article in the Halifax <i>Daily News</i>, saying that its interpretation of the agreement, based on the information available, was that the province will give up “all claim to all entitlements guaranteed in the Atlantic Accord”. I had planned to read from another article in the <i>Chronicle-Herald</i>, which basically said the opposite, but today there is a newer one that is even more the opposite.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755845"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read these just to point out how confusing it is for those of us in Nova Scotia who are trying to understand this agreement and want to support it. We hope we can support it. We hope it is a good deal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755846"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One newspaper, based on the information available, says that we lose everything in the Atlantic accord, while <i>The Hill Times</i> of October 22 states that “amendments will be introduced to reverse the amendments made to the Atlantic Accord in the 2007 budget”. That is everything we ever asked for. That is exactly what we want. That is exactly what we all have been asking for in Nova Scotia: that the amendments be reversed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755847"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what <i>The Hill Times</i> article says, but the other article says its interpretation is that “the province...gives up all claim to all entitlements guaranteed in the Atlantic Accord”. We could not have two more opposite interpretations of the agreement. One says we lose everything, while another says we get everything back. I called both journalists. They are both well respected and they both said they wrote their articles based on the information they had available. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755848"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that there is no written agreement. I hope that soon we can have a written agreement, because we want to support this deal if it is a good deal. Again, though, one newspaper says we lose everything under the Atlantic accord and the other says we get everything.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755849"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the most recent one in the <i>The Hill Times</i> is right. It says that “amendments will be introduced to reverse the amendments made to the Atlantic Accord in the 2007 budget”. That is all we have ever found fault with. The 2007 budget amended the Atlantic accord and changed the most important aspect of it, which is the way one calculates the payment of the Atlantic accord. The Atlantic accord said it will be based on the equalization formula that exists at the time the payment is calculated and the budget says that from now on the payment will be calculated based on the previous formula. It is a fundamental change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755850"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this newspaper article is right, then I will be really happy and I will go away. I hope it is right, but the other article says we lose everything under the deal.

He may not have seen <i>The Hill Times</i> article, but if he has, is it right? I hope it is. If there is no written agreement, is there a plan to bring one in soon, even before the legislation for the amendments comes in?</div>

Formal letters have been exchanged between the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">federal finance minister</A> and the Nova Scotia finance minister outlining the details regarding our recent agreement on the accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The October 10 announcement builds on measures introduced in budget 2007 which set out a new equalization program that applies equally to all provinces, while respecting existing agreements with Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have consistently said there was room for flexibility in smoothing the transition to the new principles based equalization program. The federal government is providing Nova Scotia a cumulative best of guarantee to ease its transition to the new equalization system by guaranteeing that the province will do at least as well on a cumulative basis as it would have done under the formula in place at the time of the 2005 accord. With this guarantee, Nova Scotia no longer has to be concerned about the risk of opting into the new equalization formula too early and forgoing any potential benefits of the previous formula. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much Nova Scotia may stand to gain from this agreement will clearly depend on a variety of factors, such as economic growth, tax revenues, population, and revenues from natural resources, including oil and gas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can, however, guarantee that under this agreement Nova Scotia will receive all the benefits it expected to receive at the time it signed the 2005 accord, and possibly more under the new equalization formula. In fact, for the 2007-08 year alone, the new formula is giving $95 million more in equalization and offshore offsets to Nova Scotia, which the province can use to invest in its priorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755857"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equalization changes agreed to will require amendments to the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act. We hope to introduce these changes as soon as possible as part of the Budget Implementation Act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para755858"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the agreement with Nova Scotia seeks to resolve long outstanding issues with respect to crown share adjustment payments by launching an independent panel to find an approach that is agreeable to both governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755859"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that our discussions have come to a successful conclusion. This underlines the capacity of our respective governments to work together. To quote Premier Rodney MacDonald:</div>

    </p><a name="Para755862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary mentioned that the new program is to apply equally to all provinces. Another journalist in the <i>Chronicle Herald</i> said that based on what he read, his interpretation was that the government would bring in legislation to change the equalization formula and give Nova Scotia a unique formula different than all the provinces. It says that it is different than all the programs available to all the other provinces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem with not having a written agreement. There are three different newspaper articles by three professional journalists that take different positions than the parliamentary secretary has outlined.</div>
    </p><a name="Para755864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article in <i>The Hill Times</i> says that the intention is clearly to have these amendments included in the next budget implementation act. Budget implementation acts usually come in in March. Is that when we can expect this legislation?</div>
